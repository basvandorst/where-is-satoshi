Hmm, php injection maybe?
Unless gox or the data platform bugged out somehow when all those transactions took place i that short amount of time... I doubt that though since I saw another screenshot recently of bids placed in a similar fashion when gox tanked from 230.
@_date: 2013-05-22 11:31:04
Well, first you have to think, who is going to use 300 of these. Really, I don't know if anyone has the ability to use that many.
My thought would be that it is intended so that whoever purchases them is going to resell them, those people will have to deal with the larger quantity of orders instead of the manufacturer.
I just hope that anyone who plans on reselling them will be listed as an official reseller somewhere so that people know they aren't going to get ripped off when they purchase from someone claiming to be a reseller.

Really while I could have had some benefit from protecting the idea, and am facepalming that I did not, I am just happy to see that it may become a reality and a step forward. As I said in a previous post, it was something that I saw as inevitable.

Speak about "Cold Storage" and "Paper Wallets" how they help secure your money. If yesterday's issue with MtGox's outage is brought up, remind them that NYSE, etc. are all just as vulnerable and that it doesn't mean that the Bitcoin is going to collapse.

Facebook is good and all, but it's old news...
If you really want Bitcoin to go viral, you will reach out to the people who generally make things go viral in the first place... gamers. You are on reddit afterall, and as you can usually see from Reddit's front page, gamers dominate here.
Get Bitcoin involved with streaming (Twitch, UStream, Own3D) and F2P games that use micro transactions such as PlanetSide 2, League of Legends, and Age of Empires Online, DotA 2, SimCity (even though the launch of SimCity was a major failure, it appears they're going to be doing micro transactions in the future) to name a few.
With the growth of major F2P games and micro transactions in these major titles, you really cannot ignore them. Facebook is ok as far as getting the attention of the masses, but it wont really get as many people as you may hope interested in it (IMO anyway). If you can get gamers on board, it will spread like wildfire.

Not at all, just that I should have done something when I thought of it to protect it for use in the future. Just think if you had come up with the idea of the light bulb but didn't do anything about it because you didn't have the tools to create it, years later it's thought up again by someone else, and then created. My situation would be somewhat similar to that, though I cannot say that the idea has actually been put to use yet. Just that someone else thought it up as well and has what appears to be a solid solution for the security problem that my friend brought up when I mentioned the idea to him.
Also I am not saying that my friend gave my idea away at all. The idea isn't really that hard to think up, it was something that seemed fairly inevitable, just at the time I thought it up, there was no practical way to implement it. So I just shrugged it off and forgot about it until I saw this post -.-

I'll say, you had me going for a minute.. up until I read this:


With no way to extract people and send them back to earth, you are looking at people very likely dying on mars. First aid, sure, if you accidentally cut yourself you or someone else can stitch up the wound apply bandages and what not... people can perform cpr... but you are out of your mind if you think it is impossible for someone to get sick in space or get critically injured to the point that they need surgery immediately. You really cannot take that kind of risk. With the way you describe it the best scenario I can think of is a Medic in the military, given some very basic medical training and supplies.. I don't see that as being enough for a long term mission to Mars in the slightest.
As for the weather satellite, I wasn't so much thinking of people trying to see what tomorrow's weather is going to be like like we do here on earth ("Oh, it's going to be nice and warm, sunny tomorrow" or "I better wear a sweater, that's gonna be a cold one!"), I was thinking for better study of the atmosphere as well as a warning tool for any strange weather... dust storms or something that could damage equipment maybe, especially if we plan to attempt terraforming (you have to assume it would change the weather of the planet, obviously).
Comms with our rovers may be established, but I don't see that as being nearly enough for people living on the planet.
And sure, I've thought of robotic excavation, who hasn't, it's a great idea, we absolutely should be doing that to harvest metals &amp; what not that we need here on earth.
FYI, before GPS was used in cars for giving people directions, the military was using it to pinpoint locations, resources, and create strategic maps. Looking at the stars isn't going to help you do this nearly as accurate.
The only thing you've said here that I don't see as a complete troll was that a Space Station orbiting Mars would be vulnerable to radiation... I am only allowing you to get away with this comment because I have no idea what kinds of radiation or other things actually are in the Mars orbit. And if that is ineed the case, that it isn't safe to do that due to radiation, maybe we really shouldn't be thinking about sending people to Mars until we CAN set up a space station with proper radiation shielding.
All in all, there is far too much risk and little to no reward for doing this except to say that we sent people on a suicide mission to mars. (if there is no plan for extraction at all, then it is indeed a suicide mission)
While I may be overthinking many of the details, I believe you personally are way underthinking many of the details, or you're just spouting off nonsense you don't actually believe to troll me.
@_date: 2013-05-18 18:04:27
Well, I wouldn't say that everyone thinks everyone elses code is atrocious... for the most part that is true, but there are some programmers out there who make their code easily readable. If these programmers didn't exist, there wouldn't be so many of us.
I have looked at some absolutely terrible coding (and I know I have written some absolutely terrible coding)... and I've also looked at some extremely cryptic coding. The worst in my opinion is when you have coding that is essentially open source and has no commented code whatsoever along with cryptic coding, that shit drives me nuts.

It would be great if the mods set up a weekly highlight thread with a direct link to the latest thread at the top of the page (other subreddits do this), where businesses can post that they have begun accepting Bitcoin, the mod will compile a list in the initial post of the thread and will need to maintain it throughout the week.
Additionally, an archive of previous weekly highlight threads should be linked somewhere, or posted to a wiki... at least until businesses that accept Bitcoin can no longer be tracked (becomes mainstream).

...Once again "Analysis and commentary on The Grid blog are the views of the author and don't necessarily reflect the views of Bloomberg News."
I don't know why you are reviving a dead topic and attacking Bloomberg when REAL Bloomberg journalists have only had good things to say about Bitcoin. Just because they have a moron contributor doesn't mean you should attack the organization as a whole. That's like attacking Fox news because of the opinions of Glenn Beck, or MSNBC because of the opinions of Rachel Maddow, or CNN for the opinions of Piers Morgan... all of which are obviously far more popular than this Mark Gimein idiot, but I don't pay enough attention to these organizations to know the names of their lesser known contributors/opinion columnists, I am sure you get my point.

I guess we'll leave it at that. I don't think it's realistic to do it within the next 50 years and you do. My opinion on the matter is not going to change, I don't see it as being worth it to do something this major on such a small scale.
While we cannot agree on that, I think it's safe to say we can both agree that we need some more robots out there doing more sample collecting and harvesting resources for our use here on earth ... and eventually on other planets.
I would love to see a robot produce some deep core samples from mars or any other planet in our solar system that give us information on the types of metals and whatnot are on those planets so we can send more specialized (and very likely more expensive) robots to harvest them.

Not to mention the fact that technology (facebook) played a role in overthrowing governments in the middle-east not long ago.
Although, there are ways governments like Iran could at least attempt to shut down Bitcoin, at least in their country. If it were attempted here in the states though, I don't think our government could handle the consequences.

Didn't sound that way during the interview.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:10:01
FYI, the interviewer has to ask tough questions for the people who are not yet educated on the facts. There are still many people out there who are very skeptical of Bitcoin. This interview may well have been engineered to help put Bitcoin in a better light.
Keep in mind now that Fox was probably the first of the big cable news networks to really start talking about Bitcoin and to give an educated look at it. In fact, their first article on the front page of foxnews.com is what got me involved in Bitcoin. It was a fair, educated article that intrigued me, got me to look up more information on it and start mining the coins for myself and trading them.
While Mr. Varney can come off as an ass sometimes, you cannot ignore the fact that his job is to expose the truth and often times promote things. That is what he did in this interview, he exposed the truth for skeptics and promoted Bitcoin just by having the discussion on the air.

Misunderstanding/Misinformation obtained by Varney.
...In otherwords... it is easy to say that Stewart Varney is not a good source for facts. If he screws up on this this badly, who knows what else he has or could screw up on in the future.
One thing is for sure, this guy should never speak another word about Bitcoin, every time I have heard him say anything about it he was dead wrong.
Stossel on the otherhand... he should be the one giving out the information on Bitcoin, though it is concerning that as he's an investor he wasn't aware of what was happening with Mt.Gox. I know he's a busy man, but if you're going to invest your money into something you really should keep a close eye on your investment.

Excuse me? Too young? How old do you think I am? Or rather, how old exactly do you think I would need to be to come up with an idea that revolves around a p2p network for cellphones?
Fact is I thought it up years ago when there was no discussion on it, however at the time if such a thing were to be implemented it would have been an extreme security risk. These guys basically just thought the same idea up in this conversation and actually have a possible solution to the risk.
True I would not have been able to implement it, since I do not have the tools or education in that field to do so, but that doesn't change the fact that I thought of it first.
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:07:34
You probably think its also strange that CNBC had so much negative press of Bitcoin too don't ya? ;)

That is exactly what I am saying.
You don't honestly think I would post and say "oh, I had this great idea that one day all cellphones would be connected together" without having actually put some serious thought into how it would work, do you? If that were the case, I should be banned from the internet forever. Thankfully, that is not the case and I did put a great deal of thought into it, enough to discuss it with a friend and learn of the extreme security risks at the time.

Just as long as the advertising doesn't go too far. I am all for more businesses accepting Bitcoin, but if the whole front page gets lit up with advertisements and discussion of Bitcoin itself gets pushed off, that's no good.
News of more companies accepting Bitcoin is good, but they should stick to normal ways of advertising... put up an announcement on their website saying they now accept Bitcoin, or hell, if they're a big enough company, modify one of their magazine, tv, radio, stream, or youtube ads to show that they accept Bitcoin. That's the way to go for sure.
Posting an advertisement or news of Bitcoin being accepted at a new place only gets the attention of people who are already interested enough in Bitcoin to come read this subreddit. Whereas announcing it to the general public is better for all of us... Bitcoin enthusiasts, businesses, and those who really don't know anything about Bitcoin yet.
I would encourage any business owner to help educate their customers at the very least by pointing them to a resource that shows how the can obtain Bitcoins (since the ATMs aren't out yet) and/or other information such as security precautions. I realize that many businesses are more about straight up buying &amp; selling than getting involved and educating, but it really doesn't take much, just a link to a resource or some arrows that point the customer in the right direction. Trust me if you do this, it will only bring you more and more customers with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:35:20
Well, the first to have it out in public knowledge wins right? Who else has discussed this and had the discussion made public? My ONLY problem is the fact that I didn't do anything to protect my idea.
Now, if you think this idea must have been thought up in the 70s, then surely google cannot do anything about it, since there had to be someone else who came up with it before me and did protect their idea, right?
Oh, and exactly what p2p networks as we think of them and how they work now (bitcoin, bittorrent, etc.) existed back in the 70s that would have given someone this idea?
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:34:06
Honestly, I don't think they've really put enough thought into putting people on mars yet.
Seriously, you have to first have mutiple satellites in orbit around the planet... communication, weather, gps, etc. Only once that is done should an attempt be made to construct a space station in orbit around mars...
And finally... if we were to actually send people to mars, we would need to be sending far more than a few select astronauts. You need engineers, doctors, farmers, etc. etc. etc. etc. I would assume at the very least 1000 people would have to go all at once.... and supplies is another story, they will need not only food for all those people to survive for a certain amount of time, but they will also need tools and resources to begin building a way to get everyone off the planet and back to earth in the event something goes horribly wrong. That doesn't even include surveying and harvesting equipment!
A real mission to mars would cost billions (if not trillions) of dollars initially and require a constant stream of exported goods to be sent to the mars space station &amp; colony... also it would probably take almost the entire world working together to make it a reality. That just isn't going to happen.
While it would be really cool to happen, I just don't see it happening. This isn't the moon we're talking about afterall, you can't just send someone up for a few days or weeks and have them immediately return...
Anyway.. enough of my rant on the whole visiting mars thing and how what SpaceX is doing is just a publicity stunt that will end up failing.
