@_date: 2018-01-17 03:29:38
You know , i dont get why people who are new to Bitcoin asking r/bitcoin users whether they should buy . You do realise these people all basically have a hold in Bitcoins already and are always eager to see prices go up right ? Its like asking an investor from Nike on whether you should be buying Nike shares or not . Of fucking course theyre gonna keep telling everyone to buy cause they want to see the prices go up and take their profits away . Like honestly , if you dont know shit about an investment , do your own research instead of asking people who have already put in thousand of dollars into the investments eagerly waiting for more people to buy and increase the price so they can make a profit
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:21:07
Just hold and buy some more , relax and dont have weak hands
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:09:13
Whos funny now bitch , hahaha you thought i was joking , instead im out here winning while you cry in your basement
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:25:07
And bitcoin is backed by its transaction fees ? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:04:35
You sound like you have weak hands . Dont be like this guy . I bet you sold at 12k cause you got weak hands
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:38:01
You cashed out ? Man i wish we could ban weak hands around here . You'll rue the day when bitcoin reaches $50k ✌️✌️
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:11:28
This guy has weak hands , lose half his savings and he decides to exit ? More for me i guess cause its time to buy the dip boii

Haha thats right shill, no one here is falling for your obvious scam. A legit organization wont have problems figuring out where theyre located. Cant even list where the organization is based with contacts or address details, if it looks like a scam its probably a scam. Glad other people in this sub aint upvoting this obvious scam. 
"I spent the time looking up their registry ",of course you would bud, you're a paid shill who only stated your affiliation once people called you out
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:38:59
Buy more convoluted crypto tokens with your fiat so the government wont know what food you bought, this is definitely not a scam bros and you should definitely trust our org which sells 5c tokens, we're based in Brazil oops i mean Portugal oops i mean Ireland 
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:02:37
No shit you have the time , you're a paid shill who keeps posting in r/menubuzz lmfao, gotta keep the scam going amirite. Such a shady POS, people like you are what setbacks the implementation of bitcoin cause people start to assume bitcoins= scam 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:55:38

@_date: 2018-03-30 11:59:14
Look at his posts , its literally all to r/menubuzz LMFaO
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:48:20
Haha keep crying shill. No one in this sub is upvoting this crap and your posts. You need better PR cause you're failing before anyone even knows what the fuck you guys are about LOL, most people here legit called you guys out as a scam 1 second into reading the description. Cause what we need in crypto is another useless token that just convolutes the market more from people who think theyre gonna make the next bitcoin.
Go spam on facebook or some shit, you'll probably get more people in for your scam 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:23:06
Im pretty sure they would want that lmao , they have one of the highest gdp per capita in the country , im pretty sure they'd be fine with people leaving cause they want to mine bitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:54:51
Wtf , why wouldnt you ? Are you holding cause of that stupid hodl meme ? Holy shit if you're honestly taking investing advice from a fucking meme you should just drop w/e you're doing and evaluate what the fuck you're actually doing in life
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:05:48

@_date: 2018-04-01 16:46:28
 being a prime example. The owner has been going around posting shit about it in this sub asking people to buy their tokens. If you search up the guys linkedin it states that he is currently based in Brazil with his team but his website lists Ireland as his HQ. when you ask him he bullshits his way out saying he was in portugal before moving to Ireland
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:48:42
Keep crying about bitcoin loser. Mods ban this heretic
