I don't delete posts, they get deleted by someone else... because on the bitcoin reddit you can not say what you want...

Did you wait 3 hours for it to confirm, and 5 dollars fees for your bread?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:04:15
Actualy the people who got fairly recent into bitcoin think it just climbs on but everybody who has been here since the last craze and drop knows.... it's over it's almost ridiculous how similar to 2013 this is, everybody going nuts.... The price will plumit and it will decrease for 2 -3 years.... if you are long, you should absolutely liquidate and either short or play with something else for a while
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:21:12
And did you hate yourself because the btc you sepend in that store is worth 100x 3 years later?
Not gonna happen
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:53:47
Iota is a practical coin... it can actualy be used for value transfet unlike btc who is getting slower day after day and costs too much in fees...
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:42:50
Sorry, the price is still falling... hodling is stupid right now
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:55:30
What would make me say the contrary... the situation we are in is ridiculous, I didn't think it would ever happen on that kind of scale of madness again after the china bubble but look where we are now...
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:14:02
Yeah if you sell you lose but you lose less selling now than in a month or 2 years even
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:58:16
Dude do you realy believe even half the comments on social media are actualy humans... most are not even able to make logical replies 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:42:11
Why the hell would someone buy at that price ??? Just look at the charts... the biggest crash in years is looming
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:17:53
Google for a bitcoin atm around you...

Thanks I know HK is autonomus but sometimes things are ambiguous regarding law and regulation between the jurisdictions
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:28:45
Because you have to be on reddit to be involved with btc? Actualy reddit is a bad influence on trading imo... I'm in bitcoin since 2011... back then the btc comunity used other platforms
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:04:45
I have sold my btc already... The morons are the ones who just bought "the dip" XD I don't get how the bubbles get so big... How can so many people buy btc at when a chart shows a spike like like this... How can so many people think it is a good idea
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:25:29
Don't worry soon that will be implementable in smart contracts of some sort ^^ 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:53:15
To the core and further
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:20:08
Well you seem to be one of the reasonable ones... I buy when things have been flat for 6 months...
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:57:11
Hong kong is not china
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:07:08
Well most people get in at the peak when everything is all hyped up and lose a lot of money... that is the principle behind bubbles, that is how us bastards make money ^^
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:23:08
Just send to an exchange sell it and send the fiat to your bank
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:13:10
Yeah sure if they bought at 10$, sold at 1000$ and bought back at 220$... That would have been very wise
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:54:35
You might have bought pretty much at the top actualy :s
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:46:45
I purchase it at a bitvoin atm and send it directly to an exchange where i can buy altcoins... allows me to trade without being linked to a bank account and it allows me to put funds within 1 hour on an exchange when I think there is an opportunity... with a bank transfer it would take days... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:22:33
It will probably fall and stay at 1500 for 2 years then it will go to 9000
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:09:15
Lot of money will be lost this month... Y'all bought at the top... typical mistake
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:14:50
Cryptocurrency trader since mt gox...
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:45:52
Of course it works with coffee too... there is markets for coffee beans and supply and demand make the price fluctuate... the volatilty is of cours ridiculous compared to crypto
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:42:45
Ouch big short closed
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:08:39
But now it's at 4100 and less than 2 weeks it was at 5000
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:07:53
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:52:20
Well... I hope for you guys it won't drop to 1900
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:08:16
I cashed out already
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:36:21
Bill has sold his house to buy btc at 4200 listening to some redditers and the price continued to drop for a month....
Bill is now homeless 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:58:39
Look up on the interweb XD There is plenty of btc ATM's look up if there isnone in your region... if you live in a bigger city there is surely a way to buy btc for cash either at a btc ATM or at a post office/tobaco store... something like that google is stil your friend sometimes

Someone about to lose his life savings trying to reassure the other top of the bubble buyers lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:10:53
Everybody telling you to buy now are the ones who just bought in and realise their mistake... 
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:08:56
The people who cut their losses before the big dump
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:42:45
Ouch big short closed
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:23:18
Lol head and shoulders XD stil people talking about that shit in 2017 lol... you know why those "paterns" used to work before 2000? Because evrybody learned them when they were studying... and it becomes a self realising prophecy of traders with the same shit in their heads... It doesn't work with bitcoin because people trading and investing in bitcoin don't study trading... it's a hoard of people following trends and mass emotions...

@_date: 2017-09-16 02:50:45
And whatbproof do you have that it won't drop a 1000 further... Maybe some people just closed some huge short positions, a few people followed and then it drops to 2500?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:39:25
Thanks I know HK is autonomus but sometimes things are ambiguous regarding law and regulation between the jurisdictions

That's the point
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:40:39
I don't think btc will hit 5000 anytime soon... it will bounce between 1800 and 4800 for a while
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:02:59
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:07:32
This bubble has held way to long and with the recent chinese dickslap there is no point in spamming the hodl propaganda... Shit is going Down 
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:10:24
Did it occur to you that the chinese caused the first big buble when btc hit 1000$ the first time?
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:48:53
Advantage of crypto is you can register your bank account on an exchange to any jurisdiction... even a tax heaven and declare you benefits in that jurisdiction
