SR 2.0 is up and running :)
Dont think you can find an assassin for hire there though

No that was due to the exploit that also affected exchanges.

Where does that leave people who cant buy a Lamborghini? Perhaps someone who has only made a couple hundred in profit and spends it daily (dosent convert it to FIAT)?

SR 2.0 was up a month after they took the first down.
The owner of the first SR had all charges dropped as well.
Im not sure on the future of ALT-coins on SR because ALT-coins bring on a whole extra step to people. Also i believe that there are bitcoin mixing services

Depends fully on how big you want the ad,how many trucks,how long ect. If you want PM me with specifics about your company/what you want to advertise and we can work something out.

Do not think of it as strengthening the NMC network. The power of crypto coins is that they are decentralized, gaining 51% means the coin is much much less decentralized. 
That said for the time being i dont think its a huge deal, doubt Ghash.io (if they where gonna do a 51% attack) would do it to NMC, and then loss the ability to possibly get one off on BTC

Yeah limited instant buys for trusted sellers seem the way to go.

23million (or what ever the actual figure is) is still alot to share amongst everyone on this planet, therefore it will be scarce.

Not refering to 9/11 at all but there is a group of elite bankers that control the minds of the population. No they dont have any mind control devices. They way they do it is by controlling what goes on the news (Note: I dont think there control ever got big enough to do massive damage because of the internets coming about). They can say what goes on and what doesent, by being able to filter, for many americans there ONLY news source, is huge. Of cource this only effects the "sheep" population that relys on 1 news station and dosent question anything
