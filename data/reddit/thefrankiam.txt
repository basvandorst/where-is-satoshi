Yours has a higher fee, so it should work as well

Ah, I was in the same boat when I was young. Had my parents listened to me, we'd be filthy rich by now.
I could buy them for you. You give me the money, I trade it on my exchange, I send you the BTC. But there's 2 things:
1) BTC is a little bit more expensive in my country 17,200 USD right now.
2) I'm just a stranger on the internet and could very well be a scammer.
Perhaps you could tell us where you live, maybe somebody knows a specific method for your country.

Thanks dad

Does everything really need it's own shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:21:22
Fees are determined by the user.
There can only be so many transactions inside a block.
Higher fees get served first.

Why can you get a hold of 100 graphics cards ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:52:51
Should be good now!

Gimme the TXID, I might be able to help
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:33:32
Try a pool accelerator, there's nothing to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:42:24
Relax, freewallet only scams Bitcoin HVTs. You transaction probably just has a low fee.
Seriously, tho, don't use freewallet.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:13:18
Monero the shit out of it, or use it to rent hashing power.

Block times and capacity are unrelated to nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:31:26
You should be good, too, my man

Been waiting on a 20 sat/byte forma 5 days, now

Well, if you aren't planning on paying taxes and are dealing with a considerable amount of BTC, I would suggest staying away from exchanges and instead trading locally.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:27:21
, there's a Mexican exchange called [bitso]( that has supported SegWit from the very beginning, it uses P2SH addresses. You might want to add it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:48:35
I took it a step further! Bringing in new people everytime they ask about it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:38:10
I just had the idea and my SO made it for me, it even has my QR on the back plus the "Bitcoin logo".
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:47:40
Like this?

You don't really own them, you're just trusting some website not to steal you or not get hacked.

My GF is working on modifiying the design ATM, until it's perfect. What do you guys think? Feedback would be appreciated.

Only use it on clean and secure Linux distros, refrain from connecting unnecessary stuff to that computer while you're running, only use hardware that's on it's respective latest security patch. Don't go to the internet, only use that distro for dealing with your BTC. Also don't connect to unsecured wifi, use Ethernet if possible, and run all of that on a spare computer, doesn't matter how cheap.
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:56:25
Also PM me your keys /s

Nah, Mexico City doesn't suffer from that kind of stuff. Waaaaay too populated and police ridden for cartels to prosper.
It's like its own country.
Completely different story almost anywhere else, though.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:35:56
I seriously want to put one in Mexico City, the demand for more in there is real. How do I go about aquiring one?
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:25:04
Done, thanks a lot for the quick response.
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:33:33
The country I live in just turned to socialism, those were my thoughts as well.

So, I requested a withdrawal from nicehash to an address generated for me by Samourai Wallet. I copied and pasted it, checked and double checked the address on my phone's screen before hitting withdraw. I hit withdraw, and the transaction later cinfirmed, but I did not get any of the BTC, my balance stayed at 0.
I've already tried the ypub and xpub on blockonomics, but it shows 0 BTC.
I've also tried recovering the seed on electrum desktop and reinstalling Samourai, but nothing.
NiceHash does batched transactions, so I don't know if it has anything to do with that. 
I'm using the latest version of the app from the playstore, on an unrooted Galaxy S8 with the most up-to-date official OS.
Should I say goodbye to my 15 mBTC? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:15:54
Were you planning on selling today or something?
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:14:27
Thats the principal exchange in Mexico? Can you trade in USD or is it just MXN?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:39:51
I secretly want for it to pop just so I can sell everything then buy even more at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:20:55
Does it count if the money comes from selling out the country ?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:43:11
Have you considered murder?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:25:20
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:55:01
What you could and should do is buy on a cheaper exchange and sell on a more expensive one, like CEX
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:21:55
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:13:40
K, I'll just buy, then. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:05:05
Predict harder, I want it to get lower.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:30:40
My CC got stolen so I couldn't buy at 1650. Just got the new one and it's now sitting at 1900.. you guys think it'll drop soon or should I just buy?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:11:56
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:02:12
I know some of those words
