The interview has finished, and the video can be found here: 
Proof starts around 1:53:00
The block hash referenced can be found here: 
and is verified correctly by Julian.

While I do generally agree that it would have been possible to falsify the video, I am of the opinion that it was genuine, from having watched it. If it was fake, I am impressed with the amount of effort being invested into misleading the public about Julian being alive if he is not.

The bitcoin blockchain is a public cryptographic ledger. That means that anyone, using a computer to "mine" can add pieces of information to it (or "blocks"), provided that they include a "proof of work". Bitcoin uses a hash algorithm called SHA256 to jumble up the data in a block (such as transactions) into a short string of letters and numbers called a hash. It is very difficult to work out what data was used to create a hash, but very easy to determine what the hash of any piece of data is. By randomly guessing new hashes by changing the data slightly, by incrementing a nonce, miners are required to find a hash that is low enough to be under the current difficulty. 
Put simply, the hash of a bitcoin block is a random group of letters and numbers that is almost impossible to predict ahead of time, yet widely distributed after it is determined, and cannot be changed once accepted. This allows Julian Assange to prove that the interview was not pre-recorded.

You are correct. Reading the block hash by itself is not a proof of life, but is technically a proof of non-recorded interview, which when combined with the video livestream of Julian speaking freely and without apparent coercion, becomes strong evidence of life and freedom. This is due to his potential ability to interject with a "Help me" if he was in danger and under duress. It is a possibility that the live stream was edited to show Julian's likeness and generate his voice with an actor, but this is unlikely to be the case. Having watched the entire livestream, I don't believe that this is the case.

I don't think the subreddit should be shut down, it should refocus on the effort to bring him home. That is what Julian was saying, when he said statements to the effect of "Don't take some cryptographic proof as evidence that I am OK, I'm not, I have been held here for 8 years. I haven't been OK the entire time."

He read the block hash of block 447506, the most recent block as he was recording.
