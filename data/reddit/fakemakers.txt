This sub really makes bitcoin look more like cult than a currency.

This seems to be one of Mr. Bloom's more lucid moments. One almost forgets that this is a man who thinks women 'of child-bearing age' shouldn't be employed, congratulated the french on the bombing of Rainbow Warrior, thinks humans aren't the cause of climate change, has referred to 3rd world countries as 'Bongo-Bongo Land', and has said that the unemployed shouldn't have the right to vote.

Not really. Original post means that cash is still important. The respondent completely ignores the message and goes off on a tangent that other things too don't work without electricity. It's meaningless and dishonest.

This post is a strong contender for most stupid thing I've read in 2019.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:55:16
How many people actually use it, though?

Just asserting that it is better does not make it so.

The things that get posted on this sub is sometimes so nonsensical that I almost start to question if bitcoin isn't just a cult.

This aspect of it is basically just a pyramid scheme. Get more people in, drives up prices... Then what? Where is the value coming from?
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:27:05
Yes. Advertise volatility. That's what people want in a currency.

I like the concept, but I think there are issues with it. And I'm baffled by everyone who think bitcoin i the solution to everything.

Bitcoin can do no wrong. If it's complicated to get and use, it's the fault of something else. 
Sounds cult-ish.

Some, probably.
But I thought the point of Bitcoin was to create a currency. You really don't want currencies to fluctuate that massively.

Bitcoin is a really shitty form of long-term saving. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:13:46
I don't believe that Bitcoin will ever really get there. At best it will be the prototype for something somewhat similar.

I get that a lot of the value and trading in bitcoin currently comes from investors speculating, I just don't think that's the way towards a healthy currency.
Creating expectations of significant future gains is anathema to the idea of a healthy currency. You want currency to circulate, not kept as an investment. It's the very reason Central banks work really hard at staving off deflation.

Who's going to use it to buy stuff when you expect it to be worth much more next week/month/year?
Creating expectations of large gains does strangle circulation.

That's such a stupid thing to say.
Either you tell me where you think I was wrong, or you don't say anything.
"I don't think you get it" isn't contributing anything except maybe making you feel like you're right without having to think about it all that hard.
If I'm mistaken then I'd be delighted to be set right.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:46:46
You can, but there's a bit more work involved.
