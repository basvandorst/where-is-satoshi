Haha thanks man, I won't. Just this market isn't for me I guess.

Okay but tell me the correct level of Bitcoin. You can't, right? That's the problem! That's why investing is so stressful and why FUD happens so easily.

Freakin annoying. Any time BTC goes up a bit, shit ton of dump orders worth 0.000001 BTC starts appearing on Binance. Sick, sick market. Shouldn't be like that. As soon as I regain a bit of my losses, I'm saying goodbye to this sh*thole. For the sake of my health.

It looks like an organized dump tho. Just look at the ETC chart because of the rise caused by the Coinbase listing. Just a series of regular big dumps. Looks like a manipulation big time and I'm not fooling ya, it's just the same. 
It also seems that Bitcoin price and ETC Coinbase listing are not accidental. Just when the ETC hype reached its climax, nearly the same second, ETFs were delayed. So ETC in two shakes went down from $20 to $16You can talk what you want but I think somebody has just earned a loooooot of money. Can't wait to be done with this shitty market.

Hmm I think you may be right but how can we tell if the price actually is artificially held low? Maybe it's just because people don't see that much of value in it any longer? 
Fiat is guaranteed by the central banks and governments. Who is the guarantor of Bitcoin?  Only the people using it/hodling/trading. If they lose interest, then the price will go down as well. As everyone here, I'm looking forward to more adoption then.
Although, as Kiyosaki have said, the economic system as we know it today could crash and who knows, maybe Bitcoin could be some type of store of value then.

Thank you. Frankly, this is one of the best investment advices I've ever been given. I think I had got overly emotional because of the lack of experience but you're right. Holding a small amount of Bitcoin for the long term would probably be a good idea. And time is definitely a priceless asset which I've already spent way too much for crypto. Thanks for helping me realise that.
