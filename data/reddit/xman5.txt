 Their problem is... if crypto really gets off, there will be no more IB. So they naturally don't want to support it, because they see their doom in it. Of course they could try to transform themselves... but most of these companies do not like change. The same happened with the traditional mobile phone manufacturers, they could have made smartphones... but they didn't.

 There are countless known and unknown people that contributed greatly to Bitcoin. Now we all should make ourselves useful by not harming Bitcoin more. But if we continue to keep that 1MB limit we would do exactly that. Bitcoin wold not be destroyed by that limit, because it is too resilient but it would be undermined for sometime.

It's not over in principle, but it may be over for "Bitcoin taking over the world"... or with other words... that big Mün thing everybody's expecting. I don't see that big thing happening anymore.
 Also this is not a normal price correction, just look around...

 Yes but the time for increase in blocksize is now (or should I say yesterday) and not in some distant future. That is needed now and actually everybody wants it (besides a few people). 1MB block is not enough and it was "temporarily". Bitcoin wold be undermined greatly if it can't scale with demand. When that 1MB limit was set, transactions were 1000 times less. It was not set to stay forever. There are only 2 ways that debate would be resolved. One way would be to rise the limit to 2MB and that be done soon and with consensus. The other way would be to rise the limit to 2MB after Bitcoin is greatly undermined and with great strain on everybody. There is not a third way, Bitcoin with 1MB limit would not exist for long, because if it can't grow with demand it can't sustain itself.
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:17:16
I do not see in that timeline increase in blocksize with 2 or more MB. 
 So you really want Bitcoin to be greatly undermined?! My talking is not working because I'm no one... oki-doki.... not talking anymore.

It only proves that humans are not rational, nothing more. Satoshi was expecting rational players, but they are not. They need bigger blocks (all of them agree on that) and instead of increasing the block size a few times (even 10 times is possible right now without a problem). They the irrational humans crate entirely new side network to serve something that can be served naturally on the blockchain. If that is not irrational I don't know what is. This is simple logic, nothing about technical details, just pure simple logic.   I think I'm starting to lose my faith in humanity. I hope we never invent AI or it would beat us in 2 seconds, just by creating some stupid debate. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:06:38
 I was thinking the same... but then. The Core team said it is not urgent to increase the block size, and they try to push that abomination Lightning Network. I didn't see anything like that in Satoshi whitepaper. Why not just increase the capacity of the bitcoin network when needed?! We should be able to do that. Satoshi did talk about that. The 1MB limit was temporarily solution, not a permanent one.  You can't just ignore the capacity problem and try to push something that no one wants.
 Also I don't like the censorship as of late. You can't call an increase of bitcoin capacity an alt coin (I don't talk about BitcoinXT, that was another abomination), I talk about increase in max block size from 1MB to 2 or 4. That should happen and most of the community and miners agree to that. Soon there would be supermajority on that. What more do the "Core team" need?!? Bitcoin should be able to take all transactions, small and big. There is not a need for an additional network. There is not a need for artificial high transaction fees.
 
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:01:39
 But it would, just wait moar. 
 What you see now is like conservation of mass, Bitcoin has lots of mass so it can't vaporize in an instant, but it would surely start to lose with time. Now time is not working for Bitcoin, it worked for it before but not anymore, so is the confusion of everyone. But there are indications if you want to see them.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:08:13
 Let me be not skeptical, but we have real problems now.
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:49:30
 I think Satoshi would have wanted bigger blocks because that is the logical thing to do, not side chains or "alternatives". Bitcoin needs bigger blocks. 
Let me give an example: Every time we need more Internet capacity we do not invent a new Internet, we put more/better cables in the ground. Bitcoin is the same, we need more capacity, not "reinventing the wheel". 
 Even the Chinese miners are ready to accept bigger blocks, just not too big. Why not make 4 or 8 MB blocks?! Why wait until bitcoin becomes unusable and stifle adoption with higher fees?!
 Everyone that says "bigger blocks are not needed", should think about it. Why not needed?! If bitcoin is going to become the world's payment network it should definitely be able to do more transactions than now.
 Of course this wold not stop the cryptocoin revolution but would make it very slow. Maybe some people want just this.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:22:19
Miner centralization is inevitable. Also the miners don't look like a malicious entities. We can't have perfect world, we can't have all, so the best way was to make compromise with the miners. We should be grateful that we can even talk to them. A real malicious entity would strike without anyone even knowing and you would not be able to talk with it... like you can't talk with a virus. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:10:28
s_nakamoto would not agree if he was here. He said block limit would be temporarily. It was to prevent spam and not some set in stone rule. 
 I really hope s_nakamoto is still around in some form and would stop that madness. That stupid arguing about the block limit is on the road to harm Bitcoin for a long time. There is NOT a real reason for the limit to stay at 1MB, so it should be lifted. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:53:45
PoW change is not a viable option for Bitcoin. It would no longer be the most secure cryptocoin, it would become just an ordinary no name coin. PoS is a BIG unknown... there is not any significant coin using it. Also I don't think Satoshi vision ever included PoS.

Why run a node... when "blocks are too large" and you even can't make transactions. Let's make them even smaller so no one can make a transaction. What a great idea... I think this should be sticky on r/Bitcoin... "Blocks Are Too Large" ... Lets repeat this one more time "Blocks Are Too Large"

 Energy is not scarce. This is a lie and manipulation from the elites. 
 Today anything can be abundant and much more than we actually need. But some people just can't stop their old ways. They don't want to accept the truth. We have evolved technologically but our minds still think in old terms. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:56:51
 You were asking how much more time it would take. I did answer to that. It is actually pretty cheap to just hash bitcoin instead of searching for matching pairs of already existent addresses. But even if you find one (after many millions of years), the adress could be just empty. It does not take much time to just generate matching pairs of addresses but you have to check if there is something in there. Or you could just make some big database and check from time to time. But the numbers are really big so normal computers would not do the job.  Actually you can look at bitcoin addresses as already existing. Because of that you can generate a bitcoin adress without even having an Internet connection or even generate trillions of addressees. But what you would do with them?!  Without some fast way to check if there is something in there, it's a futile attempt. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:52:19
 No more splits, the miners from SegWit2x would come to BCH if Core don't stick to the NY agreement. Then BCH would become the defacto Bitcoin with much more hash rate. Probably Core would change PoW right about then. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:31:31
There is no point in separate SegWit2x chain.  Also no need for that, everybody who likes SegWit does not like on chain scaling. They want off chain scaling which is not needed. We can do everything on chain without a problem.  If Bitcoin progressed too fast maybe then we would needed off chain scaling. But because some people are stupidly stubborn, they slowed adoption and now we have a technology for at least 20MB on chain scaling.

Antpool - yes, F2Pool - no
Also Antpool is not just 1 miner. 
 Also you should remember US is actually trying to control everything in the world, China is not.  So US is more dangerous to Bitcoin than China. US is trying to impose their "right way" on everyone in the world. They want to change how people live their life on the other end of the world. They finance organizations to try and control other countries governments and so on and so forth. China is not doing anything like this, even to its own people.
 Why Bitcoin actually thrives in China if China is so evil and wrong about everything (think about that). They actually are the only ones with government plans to implement the blockchain in their economy, that way giving Bitcoin a lot of credibility. I know blockchain is not Bitcoin but for most people of the world, Bitcoin is still that "funny Internet money" and they don't take anything connected to Bitcoin serious. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:49:55
 Because they are not against Bitcoin or crypto. This was proven time and again, but people still believe China would actually ban Bitcoin.   People think that in China live some "evil communists" that would ban everything just for fun. No they would not ban Bitcoin, not now not ever.

 They don't want SegWit because Core didn't agree to uphold Hong Kong agreement. 
 Also many people are against SegWit because they don't understand what it is or they think simple hard fork is a better solution.
 Personally I think SegWit is not bad for bitcoin but hard fork and simple block increase is better if miners support it. (most of them do). Either way we should not start war over this or it would be bad for bitcoin. Also I should say I'm clearly against any big changes in bitcoin, or changes at all, without wide support from everyone. We can't afford to brake bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:47:07
 You can issue paper gold if you are an institution, so you can manipulate and inflate gold to almost infinity. That is not possible with bitcoin. You can't say "I have 20 mil bitcoins" without actually having them. Also there is an almost infinite amount of gold in the Universe. There are only 20 mil bitcoins in all of the Universe for all  of the time. Most people still don't grasp it... there are trillions of stars which one day can possibly be colonized and even then there would be only 20 mil bitcoins. Possibly one day in the far future you would be able to buy whole Galaxies with just one bitcoin. The most powerful force in the Universe is working for bitcoin... time.  We are not "early adopters"... we are stone age adopters of a steam engine. So the confusion is understandable and of course most people don't know what that "new thing" actually is. Bitcoin is not the "new gold", Bitcoin is something new entirely.
@_date: 2016-11-26 03:45:08
 That would be really bad for all, so it would not happen. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:51:50
 They don't care about prosperity or equality. They only care about control, they want to control everything even if that means we would be in stone age for eternity. Internet is only temporarily "free" until they can destroy anyone that can oppose them. After  that, Internet would be their next target and they surely can make laws that demands constant surveillance of every action on the Internet. Everything would be recorded analysed and kept indefinitely. So even if you by mistake forget to pay 1 dollar in taxes they could find that and destroy your life. Or if you pay 1 dollar more in taxes then they can sue you for money laundering. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:35:18
 Capacity would not be doubled instantly, more like 1,2x realistically. Most people would not use SegWit right away. 1,2x capacity increase is nothing.

 Only the quantum part would be almost instant, the other parts would still be classical so no... blocktimes would not stay at 1 second. Difficulty would still readjust to 10 minutes after 2016 blocks. Then you would need better quantum computers. But I don't really know if quantum computers would give any advantage as of now. We still don't know what quantum computers are capable of.

 I was on some software forum (can't remember now),  there was a discussion about Folding which I was running at the time. Someone said "Hey do you know about these fake internet money Bitcoin. You can use your CPU and make money." It was more of a joke than an advertisement. Everybody was like "nah this is just a scam, to steal your CPU power". It was not even considered spam yet... and 1 bitcoin was like 0.00001 or something. I can't remember the exact value. But I didn't even consider a test, because some people have telling me it can be a virus. The next time I looked at bitcoin the value was like $1. I still considered it a scam. Next time it was after some big crash on MtGox, then I learned "name of the scammer" Satoshi Nakamoto... I was thinking he actually owns   MtGox and is running with the money. Then November 2013 happened, MtGox failed again, but this time I learned that actual name of the owner of MtGox was Mark Karpeles and not Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was all around the media... The sad thing is, my real consideration about bitcoin started when it was already too late... or maybe not. Maybe we are still early adopters.  
 About "the next big thing", I don't think there is a way to know it. I was always thinking the next big thing would be Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. But that didn't helped me at any point and even folding or my knowledge about computers were useless. I think it can't be predicted by a normal person. You should have be on the level of Satoshi Nakamoto himself to see something like that. Maybe if we know what would be his next project, then we could probably predict "the next big thing". I consider Satoshi Nakamoto one of the greatest minds of our time. When he began his quest to change the world, just e few people even considered bitcoin and not for the money at all but just out of curiosity. Most people then, even experts in cryptography, didn't bother to think about it.

 When we in my country did have problems with our currency we just used US dollars instead of our official currency.

 There is not any centralized power if there was, SegWit would be a reality already.  Why do you think if there were 1000 small miners they would vote for SegWit.

  Unless that ban is some very clever and elaborate plan to deceive us all, that licensing option looks less and less plausible... They wanted the user info on DVDs... who does that?! It's like everything was working nice and dandy until some hardliner on a high position suddenly wakes up.

 Better go back to fiat, than wish any government "help". If we need any "agency" to resolve our disputes, then we don't need bitcoin or any crypto at all... the old system is "working great"... isn't it.
