Is Coinbase Pro only available on a PC?? I can't see where I can use my phone. Android software.

He's sinking. Technology is owning him.

Put  in your url. See what happens. I found it interesting.

It seems like just yesterday that we  were all high-fiving and ass slapping when it hit  $10k. Nothing could stop us. It sets back to $9,600  and the crypto world has collapsed.  HODL the peaks and buy the dips. Or buy in and just do nothing. You can't believe it's going to hit  $100,000 someday and also believe a big drop is the end.

Reading this insightful comment just reminds me that I'm ignorant when it comes to reading trends. I'll just continue to buy regularly and check back in a couple of years.

Am I the only one who isn't trying to daytrade? It seems to be on a consistent pattern this past week. Jumps to nearly 12000 then back to 11000 then back up and down again. Does anyone daytrade?

Can someone decode this "TA" thing?

Question. At the current "mining age" of Bitcoin, what is more important? Accumulating a bigger piece of the 21 million or present price of Bitcoin? I personally hope it scales back to $5k.

Yes, you aren't correct. Buying into this losing opportunity that will make us wealthy someday  is a stupid move that everyone should be making because we're going to go broke when we get rich.

Why is it so difficult to spell the word lose?

Coinbase having issues again?
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:19:08
I've never rooted harder for the grammar police to show up.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:24:07
OK boys. I'll see you in about 5 years when I'm out of prison and we're all rich. I'm about to go beat on my wife for not letting me buy more when it was $3500.
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:38:27
Did you see that guy a few comments up misspell the word lose? I'm telling you. It's an epidemic.
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:44:24
And? Will it?

Update: Now. Now it has been defeated.

Look at that dump.

Serious question. What time is considered "closed"? Do we here in the US loosely adopt a time? Midnight?

Which girlfriend is it?

I have 25% of my NW in Bitcoin. My NW is $152.26. It's not easy but I HODL and DCA. I'll be putting in another $2 at the end of this week....sweet.

There she blows...

Bitcoin is an emotional bitch. It was going up and I was irritated that my future little $100 purchases would buy less pie. It's dropping and I'm irritated the pie I do have is losing value. I'm realizing that Bitcoin simply doesn't make me happy. There is no good balance.

OK. Does Starbucks "truly" accept Bitcoin? Are we fooling ourselves?
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:33:25
While it is absolutely incorrect that you can buy a Starbucks coffee with Bitcoin, I now show my wife these articles so she'll give me less grief about buying crypto.  Oh the power of Starbucks and wives!!
