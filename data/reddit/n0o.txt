Goodluck buying ten grand worth of bitcoin from an ATM
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:41:27
holy shit

Did you research KYC AML laws? How much do you know about the traditional banking industry?

Why would a US money company complying with the IRS subpeona piss you off? You know they can't refuse, right? 
You're mad at the government, not Coinbase.

Why don't you ask Coinbase? Do you think we know?
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:55:30
There's never a good reason to use Paypal for 10 grand. Ever. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:38:18
I'd really love to believe that. Going to court over every 100 dollar chargeback is not realistic. Convincing the court to admit the block chain as evidence, that'd be a first right? 
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:32:17
Those meetups seem pretty dead! 
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:07:54
There's exactly zero credit card companies that will consult the block chain when investigating a chargeback. Chargebacks is Trucoin's biggest enemy. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:05:08
Well I don't like that explanation but I can't stop you from doing what you're going to do. Good on you if you have honest intentions, shame on you if you pass that headache on to others. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:28:59
He kind of has a point though. You could have searched google for "buy bitcoin credit card" and had your answer in 2 seconds. I don't think he means to discourage newbs, this question is just posted daily. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 19:57:44
Google "Moolah Ponzi" and you'll see there is already a lot of whispers. I don't mean to be rude to the people behind Moolah, but we can't trust anyone.

I guess you didn't notice when the price went down to 380 and went back up to 650 in less than a month.
You should study the charts more often before jumping to conclusions.

@_date: 2014-08-27 16:38:33
If you aren't 18 you can't enter into a binding legal agreement without your parents. Coinbase is a business with a service. It's their right to choose who they service. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:59:13
Didn't you post this same rant a few hours ago?
Use another company. They aren't the only bitcoin company. Calm down.
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:49:35
Paypal and Google wallet are good ways to chargeback scam sellers. No one takes that shit. 
How do you have paypal without a bank or credit card? 
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:09:15
Your entire complaint is trivial. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:08:44
So you need to sell off Paypal funds the same day you have an emergency migration? And that's not suspicious?  
@_date: 2014-07-13 22:29:32

@_date: 2014-09-19 23:17:39
You must be new to bitcoin. You think BFL inflated bitcoin? You think they're a reputable mining company? 
@_date: 2014-07-11 22:55:23
There's not much risk of them running off with your funds or being insolvent. But there is always a chance ... You really never know. This is an American company that is certified with the government but always be safe and suspicious. 
But there's also a chance you could lose/destroy your cold storage. There's a chance a hacker could get a copy of your private key if not safetly encrypted. There's also a chance that you send bitcoin to the wrong address. 
My policy is never put all your eggs in one basket. Why not take half your coins and put them in cold storage? 
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:25:25

@_date: 2014-07-19 15:32:13
Hold the money for 2 weeks. They may find a way to contact you once they realize their mistake. You got extremely lucky, but also think how sad you would be if you threw away half a bitcoin. You don't want to be that guy who doesn't give the money back when asked. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:18:45
You need to print out a paper wallet to have your private keys. It's probably better to not manage them if you are not familiar with how public/private keys work. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 22:31:38
The only drawbacks I know of is the network traffic and the disc space. I don't think many people store coins on their nodes so not much security risk on a empty computer.

A front line customer service rep isn't involved in the discussions for expansion. You should ask their CEO the same question and i bet he won't mispell the word 'time'.
Front line customer service at any company is fairly useless if you haven't learned by now.

@_date: 2014-07-22 20:44:09
Smaller amounts will likely fly under the radar. FinCEN is very real and takes money laundering seriously. He did not just guess.

@_date: 2014-07-16 16:10:30
I'm really curious as to how you prevent chargebacks. I always felt like a BTC -&gt; USD company couldn't survive on credit cards alone because of the risk.
Credit cards and paypal seem like chargeback heaven for scammers.

@_date: 2014-07-12 19:54:43
Skipping a step implies you're in a rush. Paypal isn't safe and someone like you should know better. That's 10 grand in Paypal and money transmission headaches, not to mention fees. While I realize you're a big player in altcoins, can you not see why people would be suspicious of the transactions?  
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:41:47
For her to use money locally it has to be USD or zloty in Poland. USD is easy to exchange to zloty. She has to find either someone willing to exchange BTC for fiat currency, or a company willing to do the same. 
The only other option is to only work with merchants accepting BTC. In Southern Poland may be a problem. In the big cities --- maybe. Countryside? nope.  
I probably wouldn't want my wife meeting someone on localbtc in a foreign country, but that's up to you. BTC might not be the best option if she can't find a bitcoin ATM in krakow. It's going to cause more inconvenience than it's worth. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:39:06
It'll take 30 days for them to trust you, but Coinbase is probably your best way.

Coinbase is definitely not illegal, FinCEN wouldn't certify a business as a money transmitter if they were doing anything illegal.

Then why doesn't every junk debt company in the US suddenly sue all the accounts that owe 50-800 dollars? That never happens. 
Because it's not worth their time. It has to be a substantial amount for them to pursuit court proceedings. You don't automatically win by showing up unless the other party doesn't show up. 
Also can you even prosecute for a chargeback? It's not a crime to say "I didn't recognize this charge so I suspect it was unauthorized". How can they prove a crime was commited versus my wife didn't recognize a charge and reversed it. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:06:54
Those companies aren't burgerking and you can't have it your way. Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places regardless of any single company policies. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:08:16
Why did you delete your comments about Coinbase earlier? You forgot the part where you went out of your way to contact them about a gambling website. There's a reason you were mostly downvoted earlier.

Can you exchange giftcards for USD? Yes. There's a few services that exist doing the same in the bitcoin world. 
 
Never used them, but here's a Google result:

Bitcoin is money. How do you earn money in real life?
Selling a good or service, getting a job, or friends give it to you. You can also exchange USD to Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is not really profitable unless you can invest in a farm of miners.

Please share your math, did you factor in difficulty increases?

Laws regarding online gambling vary by country. I suggest Google. If you have to ask these questions and give no context on your location, you probably lack the skills to run a successful business.

On a serious note, I need mass merchant adoption and acceptance. I need the huge chains in my daily real life to accept my favorite currency.

It's not illegal or money laundering, you're a money service business in the eyes of the law and subject to a different set of regulations from a normal business/consumer. A regular person like you can't start a bank or a check cashing service without hundreds of hoops to jump through, why would a money selling business be any different?

Coinbase has reports for sure. Use the average function once they generate a spreadsheet for you.

Why does there have to be division between Bitcoin and Ethereum communities? This angry trolling between users of the two protocols is dumb. We should all work together to create a better crypto ecosystem and not get mad because your investments don't match the investments of other people. Greed is so stupid and narrow-minded.
Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to co-exist whether or not the communities collaborate.
