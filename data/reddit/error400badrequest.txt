Just as I wouldn't give people Euros at a wedding because it was changing the world(one currency that was official tender all over Europe), I wouldn't give people bitcoin at a wedding. It is tacky. 
You don't give wedding guests money,  no matter how special that money is. 
Hell,  most would either throw it away or convert it to USD.

My father does the double-spaces too. I can't believe it... I used to live in the same house as Satoshi! I need to call my Dad!

10k is not stable growth and would be one hell of a bubble. That isn't safe for the long term. For that rate of growth you need wild speculation and instability. If that is what you want,  that is great,  but a stable "weaker"  bitcoin is far better than an unstable "strong" bitcoin. 
The only way I could see this reasonably happening is if the US economy would suddenly and completely collapse as hyperinflation would follow suit. If that were the case,  the value of one bitcoin should be the least of your worries.

Dorian did have a stroke, and that could be the reason for his poor grasp of English. Strokes can do a lot of damage and even with therapy, not everyone gets back to 100%

Meshnets are a great concept, but they'll never see the sort of speeds necessary to replace a proper ISP. 
Especially not without specialized hardware,  and, I just don't see that becoming likely. 
As a proof of concept, it's great,  but for any data transfer it often fails to do its job. 
They are also very hard to scale and regionally restricted. Nobody can run connections between different city nodes,  and it completely neglects rural areas. 
They're fantastic if you wanna take an interest in them and see what you can accomplish(and as an inter-city communication hub it's great) but they will never replace traditional ISPs.

The USA doesn't really give a shit about its debt,  and honestly, it doesn't have to. There is nothing that anybody else can really do about it.

Gold is commodity money. It has many uses in manufacture. 
Bitcoin has no value other than it's "general acceptability."
Not saying you should hold gold over bitcoin, but there is an inherent difference between the two.

You trade the money yourself. You should only use an exchange to convert, and then you should immediately withdraw the funds(BTC or otherwise) to a different account, ideally, your own wallet.

I never said I was balding, LOL. I just wouldn't consider being bald awesome for everybody. 
I shaved my head once, it really didn't work for me.

Why doesn't somebody just make a jailbreak app(circumventing Apple's restrictions) and released a full fledged wallet-app for the device. It seems like it would be simple to do. I'd be surprised if one didn't already exist.

Well, I didn't win, but that's OK. I made a blockchain wallet and I like the site, so I'll probably be taking advantage of your service in the near future.

As much as I respect you for embracing your baldness, I most certainly am not willingly going to abandon my mane in favor of a shaved head. Sadly, what works for you doesn't always work well for others.
