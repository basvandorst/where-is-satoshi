Not everything but 75% bitcoin, 15% stocks, 10% gold.

Surpasses fiat for sure

Buy now ask later
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:22:25
Literally the only reason I decided not to become famous.
@_date: 2019-11-05 23:53:11
I wasn’t actively involved in my brokerage account, so I agree, my financial advisor had to have been doing something egregiously wrong
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:50:06
Stock up brother
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:19:26
Your hard earned money is created out of thin air by the federal reserve. Not much difference.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:17:18
Is that really what a wrench attack is ? Lmao I thought it was some serious crypto talk that went over my head.
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:14:15
I can’t find anything about this, do you have a link? Interested to see the allegations.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:36:18
No body is hoping they will get money for bitcoin. People are getting money for bitcoin everyday. It’s like gold because it takes investment to mine. Obviously there is no practical use for bitcoin, just like there is none for fiat currency. But just like the US dollar, enough people have agreed that it is worth a specific value.
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:41:33
Basically. From what I understand it’s more like you are simply betting on the price of crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:15:33
I made a withdraw on the “bitcoin” I purchased through robinhood with no issues about 2 weeks ago. Obviously it was not a significant amount compared to this guy so I guess we’ll see what happens.
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:23:35
You sound like a financial advisor lol 
But seriously I made more money in 4 weeks with bitcoin than the last 4 years off mutual funds.
@_date: 2019-11-04 15:06:16
Is the purpose to verify transactions ?
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:39:04
Tulips were a commodity. Bitcoin requires capital to mine and there are a finite number of coins. It’s more like gold, which has only increased in value.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:15:59
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:11:45
You didn’t answer the question.
@_date: 2019-11-04 12:40:30
Same brother, emptied my savings and brokerage account and put in bitcoin. Why not ?
@_date: 2019-11-12 16:20:44
Not telling you what to do at all. I used to use it until I realized you don’t actually own any bitcoin when you buy from them.
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:37:30
You’re right, just searched. My bad
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:40:17
Love this
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:40:10
Prob shouldn’t use robinhood
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:52:23
Amen. This is a long game.
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:03:51
The fed isn’t dumping in more bitcoin every year.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:54:48
Those are rookie numbers, gotta bump those numbers up
@_date: 2019-11-21 03:21:11
Dude you read my mind. Fuck the fed and their contrived hidden tax of inflation. Let’s go all in and buy lambos.
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:15:36
When I dip you dip we dip 
Buying big on the next dip for sure brotha
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:33:46
CIA prolly pocketed it
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:26:37

Nothing better than advice from a 17 year old
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:39:59
Sending usd and withdrawing cash. I never actually had bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-17 08:49:30
Been 10 years since the last recession. The housing market has been insane for years. Fiat is about to get killed.
@_date: 2019-11-30 01:07:15
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:39:15
Ahh okay, then if that’s the case I prob won’t do it. Thanks for the info brother.

Hahah I love it
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:31:27
Bitcoin proves your argument wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:25:08
Correct you cannot move your “bitcoin” to another wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:08:24
If you are thinking only short term then yes, you should continue to get paid in fiat currency as it is less volatile.
@_date: 2019-11-04 12:43:36
Would like to run a full node to do my part in supporting the community. Any suggestions on a laptop or desktop that is inexpensive/ reliable for such a task?
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:00:05
True, but if it explodes to 100k and you try to cash out, robinhood might not be able to pay.
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:40:07
Thanks bro
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:10:55
So you’re saying if you bought at 9k then you’re a dumbass
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:40:13
Agreed. They are still having to put the same amount of time and investment to mine half of the bitcoin they have been getting. They will hold out for higher prices when selling. Seems pretty obvious.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:01:50
Woah let’s move this to r/conspiracy and go deep homeboy.

Love it
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:02:35
Hahah agreed
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:03:53
What would be a situation where it could be undone ? I would really like to use a different platform but don’t want to cash in on my bet :(
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:29:52
Thanks man, just downloaded Coinbase app so I can purchase the next dip.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:04:34
Thanks for the info my bro.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:25:07
Could the work and investment put in to mining bitcoin be another argument for its intrinsic value ?
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:14:04
Just told you the future bruv ��

Sure bro, or miss out. Your choice
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:23:01
Spoken like a true cuck
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:35:13
You can tell he’s worried about governments shutting down and censoring the internet to keep corrupt fiat currency in power.

Same bro
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:35:32
Yes “The Creature from Jekyll Island” is a must read.
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:35:03
I never would invest in anything on a belief. Bitcoin is a viable alternative to fiat currency because it is not controlled by the corrupt cia/US government.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:12:31
Only reason I still check daily is to buy the dips
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:30:07
True but at least it can’t be inflated on whims of the federal reserve
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:25:43
You can read the pdf online for free

Coinbase is good but the transaction fees are high
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:12:32
That’s my team because of bitcoin

Have not yet spoken to another woke hodler in Jacksonville
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:41:40
Same bro. I didn’t even realize what was happening to our tax dollars until I read this.
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:42:23
Nice because Wikipedia is right about everything.
@_date: 2019-12-09 14:27:54
Just need amazon to accept bitcoin payments then wham boom to the moon
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:06:25
BRD fees are a nightmare too
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:10:08
Seems legit
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:33:06
Bitcoin is finite. Fiat currency is constantly inflated by the federal reserve.
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:35:42
Basically everyone in my life who’s is intelligent and earns a decent living knows nothing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:45:57
Only really care about the fiat money that I am forced to use.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:54:47
Wonder what USA was
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:09:35
I have much to learn
@_date: 2019-12-09 17:21:23
Same. Took them forever to verify my ID
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:41:28
Real world utility is abundant. Fiat currency is insured by tax payers. You’re a pussy.
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:31:34
Love explaining it to people and them shaking their head and trying to make an argument for fiat currency lmao
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:41:58
What is this book about?
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:32:00
You’re right bro. But most don’t listen long enough to understand.
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:06:00
Which service is he using ? Coinbase fees are insane
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:34:29
I only take financial advise from people serving life sentences
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:40:33
So true. The research in this book is unparalleled.
