The only way I can see to address this kind of utter nonsense is to take to the comments sections of articles like this and tactfully explain the truth using logic and fact.  These people have "big name" companies, brand recognition, and not to mention political capital backing up their idle conjecture and the sad reality is that is more than enough to influence the hearts and minds of 3/4 of the people reading their articles.  We, the minority, the ones who actually use our minds to think, question, and discover our own truth aren't the target of this sort of psychological attack.  But, I think it important that we do all that we can to defend against such utter BS as well as educating those who can't or don't want to take the time to understand the world we live in.  Post here for the good of the community.  Post in the comments of the outlets that would otherwise mislead everyone else!

Cite your source(s) please.  
Here is mine: 
According to 12 USCS § 25a , “lottery" includes any arrangement whereby three or more persons (the "participants") **advance money** or credit to another in exchange for the possibility or expectation that one or more but not all of the participants (the "winners") will receive by reason of their advances more than the amounts they have advanced, the identity of the winners being determined by any means which includes--
(A) a random selection;
(B) a game, race, or contest; or
(C) any record or tabulation of the result of one or more events in which any participant has no interest except for its bearing upon the possibility that he may become a winner.
No money was paid for a chance to win here, so according to federal law, this was not a lottery.

Don't disagree, but what (which) laws exactly?

Pinnochio’s makes the best pizza.
If we replace the word *best* with the word *good*, we get:
Pinnochio’s makes [**the**] good pizza.

Point taken on Bitcoin vice Coinbase...the latter being more like a bank than the "dollar".  
Even though I'm not the OP, I have to ask - when have you ever seen a bank give a reward to a patron for pointing out a security flaw?  Any example will do!  :)

Here is another source from Kentucky:
(5) "Lottery and gift enterprise " means:
(a) A gambling scheme in which:
1. The players **pay or agree to pay something of value** for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other media, one (1) or more of which are to be designated the winning ones; **and**
2. The ultimate winner is to be determined by a drawing or by some other method based upon the element of chance; and
3. The holders of the winning chances are to receive something of value.
(b) A gift enterprise or referral sales plan which meets the elements of a lottery listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection is to be considered a lottery under this chapter.

^ This.  Thus our ability to document the password, i.e. in numbers, letters, symbols...vice sight, smell, taste, feeling, quantum spin, and a whole host of other known/unknown means of conveying information limits entropy.  At some point though, the principle of "good enough" kicks in.

drop the "n" - it is more like oppa, and it means older brother (if speaker is female) - 오빠.  If you're a guy, you'd never call someone this in Korea, well, unless you're gay, and that's O.K.!

I'm late to the party, but: How did you make $100M on bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:28:03
- I use my Coinbase account to buy, sell, and sometimes store my legally purchased bitcoins.
- I legally purchased and/or received bitcoins through the conduct of legal transactions for all bitcoins deposited into my Coinbase account
- I used funds acquired through legal means to purchase bitcoins
- My outgoing transfers are related to transactions for legal goods and services
Send those as responses and see what happens.  I'd be curious to see if they just need to "check a box" for compliance or if they dig further.

Another great idea!  For sure, a company/franchise this large is not going to move on a few forum posts.  However, the fact that so many inputs are coming back this quickly on both Reddit and the Blizz forums is promising.  Keep the comments coming!  The more suggestions we get the better!  WoW represents a HUGE opportunity to introduce Bitcoins to both consumers and industry!  
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:55:21
Soooo much help needed in the General forum - a little bit of your time spent explaining BTC to the WoW populace is time well spent!  :)

Gobslam has a point - I'm paraphrasing, but I think it is up to us (the community) to evangelize Bitcoin; Blizz/WoW just seems like a logical place to put some effort.  I'm just getting this started, and I'll keep contributing to the extent of my knowledge but I'm hoping this gets some traction here and that this community actively engages via the forums on battle.net.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:25:23
Well, China does sort of "own" the Wow gold market and BTC holdings!  :P  Seriously though, if you can describe a model that is both attractive to users and profitable to Blizz that would allow that, then do tell!

Covering the bases in General.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:20:29
Expected?  Yep!  Not unlike trade chat.  But I'm hoping that can assist in providing useful, compelling, and engaging information to the "WoW masses" so that we might get Blizz's attention.
