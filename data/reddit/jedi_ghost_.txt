Thank you for taking the time to write all of this down.
I agree with you 100% and if I owned a hat I'd be tipping it to you right now.

Stop thinking in 2D, if you look at the chart with 3D glasses (popcorn optional) and squint..and go la-la-la-la - all 180 lines are accounted for.

I am suspicious of you Doc, anybody with the word "reality" in their name , posting on Reddit AND about bitcoin??
Hah...what an oxymoron.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:36:50
In the real world I would have been considerate and told you everything is going to be fine, BTC will hit 200k by December and your flaming orange (or shiny gold wrapped) lambo will be delivered to the moon to a parking spot with your name on it. You of course will already be there , riding your stash of bitcoins , waving your cowboy hat screaming Yeeeeeha!
But...this is Reddit, nothing to do with the truth or reality or competence of any level. You'd get more useful information by walking into an opium bar in Shanghai and asking any of the drooling comatose patrons about the future of BTC.

Quick question, for people who are buying on the dip and "quickly" selling on the rise ...I assume you sell for USD and then wait for the next dip. But where? What exchange allows you to do this buy / sell for USD?
Coinbase? Please enlighten me.
Thank you.

If by meaningful you mean something that is constant and that can be counted upon..then NO.

Well said, most of the FUD articles are paid for by people who are scared shitless by the wealth being amassed by average joes and are terrified of no longer being in control of the average Joe's life.

If I have learned anything since I have been visiting this forum and reading posts by people I have never met is this : Red and green dildos are a constant as well as imaginary trends that are only referred to by using the names of quadruped mammals.
This place ...is full of wonders and more oracles and fortune tellers than a gypsy circus.

Your well rehearsed comment reminds me of that bar scene in Good Will Hunting, about the douchebag who just regurgitates shit he has read or heard somewhere but has no real understanding of it nor any ideas of his own.

I am sure some expert here has irrefutable evidence that without a doubt BTC will be 435637 on April 8th 2024 at 4am.

You obviously don't know the definition of racist.
Chinese eat anything that moves and if it doesn't move...they'll ground it and make spice out of it. This isn't racist...but a fact.
If you are Chinese and the truth offends you...take it up with your parents.

My definition of "crash" may not be the same as yours. To me crash means sub 2000.
This whole swinging back and forth between 7k - 11k is clearly the result of purposefull manipulation by those who have enough Fiat or BTC to affect the price. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:18:06
Chinese will need cash to buy dogs and cats for the celebration dinner. They'll need Fiat for the quadruped critters...UP we'll go!!

The exact dick response I expected - deflecting the original point and trying to turn this into a discussion about the real vs perceived or pseudo value of bitcoin.
It is about average people being able to make considerable sums of money by playing a game that was only reserved for the "haves".  
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:05:38
You should start with a visual representation of the price crash.. of how fast it fell.
I am thinking of mounting a go-pro cam on your helmet and throwing you off of the roof of a skyscraper.
I will also provide a spatula (paid for with bitcoin) to your nearest relative of choice and promise to upload the content of the go-pro as soon as said relative is done scraping you off the pavement.

1. I think if you day trade BTC, one of the requirements is that you go through a personal dildo fitting session .. there must be a Bespoke Dildos Inc...registered ... somewhere.
2. About all the guys holding the cardboard signs screaming about The End is Near / Here...there should a requirement of verified ownership of 25+ Bitcoins before those cardboards are given out. If you want the string to hang it around your neck to allow for handsignals ...that should be +5 BTC extra.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:36:54
That is the best advice on this forum by far!

This isn't rhetoric about a revolution.
Crypto currency that is mineable or can be had for cheap and has the chance of massive appreciation without any positive or.negative interference from the powers that be - gives an enrichment option to the average person. This is a simple fact. Also a simple fact is that those with considerable financial means do not like when the gap between their $$$/ power and the average guy gets smaller and threatens their position of.power.  This is also a fact and if this is rhetoric to you then you are a naive moron

Not sure, I have converted quite a bit of my BTC to lesser known alt coins that I am hoping fall under the sleeping giant category.
Until we have people moving thousands or even several hundreds bitcoins just to manipulate the price , make a quick profit , let things stabilize and then do it again...well.. until then...in so many words...we are fucked. And by "we" - I include people with 2 digit stashes.

You sold for Fiat?
I am curious..when you decide to sell and want Fiat..which exchange or site do you do that on?
I hope it's not Coinbase...I hate coinbase and their loanshark fees

Here's a noob question.
With the prices now sub $8000, I am ready to buy 10 bitcoins for USD.
Is there a way to get it safely, securely and without having to wait weeks for verifications and then be limited to 1 count day or any other nonsense restrictions?
I'd appreciate some meaningful and usable advice instead of sarcasm or ridicule, I am a noob at this.
Thank you.

These past 48 hours have been the most fun I've had spending on a forum reading posts and reactions from faceless people only identifiable by quirky nicknames. I have learned about dead cats , bears, bulls and other animals in various stages of activity such as setting traps, using red or green candles to pleasure themselves or others and much more. I've laughed, cried , got boners and suffered from flaccidity. Thank you all ! Now, for the question : at what point do I buy?
