It's partisan humor. Pro bitcoiners will be butthurt and non Bitcoiners will find it humorous.  It's not genius, but it's humorous.

Hodl is literally the worst slogan for a currency trying to grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:55:25
As opposed to Bitcoin wallet fees for every purchase?  
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:35:28
I think you can, you'll just probably over pay. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:30:02
The Chart isn't a consistent scale and the numbers at the top are closer together than the bottom, so the 35% drop from 19000 looks minimal.  13,000-20,000 is the same distance as 600-800.   When you use shady data to draw your conclusion, it should be very alarming.

The caption should have been:. How do you see into the past and the future at the same time?

Thanks for the reply, 
1. There's no proof that stability will occur, 12 million out of the 21 million coins are already available.  Even with double the coins, there wouldn't be enough to make it mainstream. 
2. We agree that it's not currently a useful currency, which is it's intended purpose, you can try to justify its existence by attempting to change the purpose of the coin, but it's not a functionable currency in it's current stat.  It's a fixed product, it's not changing, so I can't see how it will evolve into functionality.
3. That's good to know, although how much money are you losing every transaction? When the price stabilizes will it be worthwhile? It seems like many Bitcoin people are ok with the fees because they made so much money off of the coins, it's like playing with free money.
4. I guess it can change the terminology if it becomes popular. 
5. Security is a weakness, it's good for people that want to hide money, but the lack of insurance or it's hackability doesn't seem worth the risk or headache for a casual person wanting to use the currency.
Additionally I don't see a solution to the fees, these miners are working hard and they are not doing that many transactions compared to if the currency was used for every day purchases, I feel like that stress would cause fees to go up or miners to lose interest.

That's true... It's not like crytocurrency can just create another currency.... I mean there's only one crytocurrency.
The price of orange juice is generally the same price daily.  Without stability a currency can't function as a currency, so what do you have? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:35:49
Look at the 1,000 different crypto currencys popping up.  Obviously there is a feeling you can just create digital gold.  
Bitcoin today, garlic coin tomorrow... It's amazing you think your digital coin is truly worth $15000. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:06:35
I don't believe in any of them.   
I get that crypto currency will exist is some format.  I just think it will be run by a trust worthy governing body.  (Our government is just people we elected to run the government, that's far more liberating than a get rich quick currency created by a mythical people, who's prices are controlled by huge whales that we have no idea who they are and have no say in what they do).  
Bitcoin didn't create enough supply for it to be used as a currency.  Currency is about stability and ability to purchases goods and services and assign value to those goods, not about making money from owning it.  The bitcoin product doesn't function as a currency, it functions as a stock.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:11:20
I feel like your redefining it's purpose because it's terrible at it's intended purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:39:07
Bitcoin has lost 35% of it's value since a week ago, so that's noteworthy. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:01:16
I as a non-coiner. My issues are:
-no stability, it can go up or down 10-30% in any given day
-it's marketed as a currency, but it's not treated like one, it's treated like a stock, people don't buy lunch with stocks. Hyper deflation is bad for a currency, good for a stock. 
-it isn't accepted anywhere (almost)
-there's not enough Bitcoins around to be used as a functional currency.  I'll get a meal for $6 or .0.0001256 Bitcoins. 
-it was supposed to get around Bank fees and currency exchange fees but it's fees are huge. And the fees make small transactions undoable. 
-there's no security, if someone hacks my wallet it's gone, and there's no one that can get it back for me.
- it seems like a good idea, but a prototype thats not large enough to handle mainstream adaptation. It feels like a trusted govt will replicate it and make it a usable currency. (I.e. The euro can be replaced with a euro coin
Thats all i can think of.  
And worst of all, as a gamer it has driven up the price of gpu’s, so its basically evil
So convince me...

Tbh. I invested$40g into the stock market in January and I lost $3,000.  It feels painful.   Money lost feels painful anyway you slice it
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:05:51
But I thought one of bitcoins foundational elements is a public ledger
@_date: 2018-10-03 06:35:05
Non Bitcoiner.   How is a bug patched on Bitcoin? It's a decentralized network, who is the authoritative body deeming what's a patch and how can that not be used to create an exploit into the software?
@_date: 2019-02-04 06:10:32
This is the only way it will grow.  If companies get business from Bitcoin, then more businesses will adopt it and it will be more successful.  Hoarding it is the worse thing you can do if you want it to survive.

Imagine being sentenced to death for wanting to be free.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:32:46
So is the correct price of a bitcoin $8000?  
Stability is everything.  It's lost 60% value in 6 weeks.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:58:41
I lost 20% in the stock market this year and it feels horrible, I can only imagine what you guys are going through, stay strong!
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:53:26
high is a relative term.  This coin started at $1 or less, and now it's $10,000.  Everything seems relatively high
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:31:01
Shouldn’t be allowed to call them atms unless you can get cash for selling bitcoins
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:27:52
The best way to make it grow is to spend it, more retailers would be willing to accept it if it was a currency that was deemed necessary to accept, if 0.01% of transactions in retail were bitcoin, why would they invest/waste money to accept it?  Adoption is the biggest hurdle after stability
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:09:51
This website seems like a very unbiased reliable website
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:20:56
Who would accept Bolivar for Bitcoin? It sounds like a risky investment 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:46:55
People would like a digital currency, but a stable one.  I don't want to move my money into a crytocurrency if it might go down by 65% or up 500%.  
It's not about price it's about utility.  
Hodl is literally the worst idealogy for a young growing currency.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:29:47
Well credit cards are technically loans, so I could see why they would restrict that.  
And the anonymous non-refundable nature of crypto currency would make it impossible to ever recover a fraudulent charge. Fraudulent charges you are not responsible for and the bank must project you from. I still think we should make purchases with our own money. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:26:57
That would make it technically a bigger circulating supply than the usd
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:10:52
So if I was a whale, I could sell to myself at an inflated rate and create an increase in value. Since all these transactions are anonymous, I could create a huge profit for myself by pumping and dumping over and over.

So at 6:55am everyone was like, I need Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:20:04
Looks like an increase in hodl comments when there is instability.  And pointing this out is going to ruin any statistical correlation from today forward
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:00:56
Other than exposure, what's the purpose of this? ATMs typically give us cash so we can buy stuff in person.  
This machine takes our cash and puts in their Bitcoin wallet, and now we can do nothing with it at that time... It's the opposite of what a physical ATM is supposed to do.  
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:48:44
I look at the price increase from 6:55 to 7:35 am.  $6900 to $8000.   What could possibly justify a 16% increase in value of a currency in 35 minutes?
It does seem like this price is very manipulatable. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:23:49
Debit card purchases are protected by is theft laws.   So there is a liability for the bank
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:30:08
Because I don't want to work hard and agree to be paid  for a $100,000 a year in BTC, then 3 months later I'm getting paid $33000 a year. .
 This is supposed to be a currency right? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:01:54
Spending your Bitcoin and using as a viable currency is the smartest thing you can do to ensure that adoption and survival of the currency
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:19:32
At times? It increased in value 1500% in 1 year. Bitcoin is a joke, and will only mean something to a small niche of people.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:44:38
Currency that's not back up by any government, is not used by anyone to buy actual goods, is not universally accepted, has no way to gauge an accurate price other than supply and demand.
Bitcoins have more in common with beanie babies than us currency.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:31:49
No. But you don't make money by having money, you own money by having money.  If you are trying to make money by buying money, than you're not really buying money. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:17:27
Well what would you say is an accurate valuation is Bitcoin? $2,$2000 or $2 million per Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:14:20
So is Bitcoin supposed to be a currency or a stock that goes up on extreme value?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:02:10
Can u explain why Bitcoin doubled in value in the last month or why it went down 80% in a year? Or why it randomly goes up 1000 dollars in value? Seems like Bitcoin is the one being manipulated.
