Not sure what you mean? They give you bitcoins and then run away before you have a chance to give them  $? 
In any case, localbitcoin uses escrow so the btc don t get released until both party agree. If you pay with $ and don’t get the btc, the other party can run away if they want, but not with their btc which will remain in escrow until the dispute is resolved.
The main problem that I find with Localbicoin is that traders take a significant margin when selling btc (and also to buy but less so).

It’s also very different from Coinbase inasmuch as trading partners are independant and have different preferences so you could potentially find a better deal that fits your needs. Cash deposit is only one way to get bitcoin, there are dozens of other offers such as gift card value, bank transfers or other currencies.  Even if the end result didn t differ much from coinbase (you may get cheaper btc, or you may not), the transaction is completely different in nature. 
Another big difference is you don t have to give so much information about yourself to localbitcoin compared to coinbase. Although I’m not too sure what are the exact requirements at coinbase, as I haven t used them in a while.

I ve used Xapo since March 2014, never had to call customer support. My experience with it has been great. It s the wallet I use the most for spending or transacting. Their iOS app is great and 2FA less annoying than with most other wallets (Coinbase 2FA being a real pain). A good thing about Xapo is that they embed your transactions with other transactions providing you with a much better level of anonymity, which is always good.

This cover and the article isn t changing my opinion on Bitcoin so much as my opinion of The Economist! I might start reading The Economist again.
