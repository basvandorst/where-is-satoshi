Hey now, gold is finite so maybe don't be giving out those gold stars all willy nilly...

I personally see this as the most likely scenario. Bitcoin was the first, but that doesn't make it the best. The technology world is littered with the corpses of previously implemented by inferior technologies.

Cryptocurrency markets will be benchmarked along fiat until such time as cryptocurrency becomes the primary means of paying debts, at which time different coins will be benchmarked against each other. In the current market, all of these coins are only worth what their equivalent dollar value is because any companies that accept crypto are going to benchmark the crypto prices against a fiat currency (like the USD). 
If BTC/ETH/LTC/whatever goes down your purchasing power goes down. This is reality.

So FWIW, I just did a test send of $5 worth of btc (about 0.0006 at the time of this post) and the miner fee was $0.13, or about 2.6%. So basically the same amount of middle-man fees would be charged on a btc network as are charged on a credit card network.

As opposed to the noble bitcoin miners who charge a similar fee to Visa and Mastercard for allowing a transaction? 
Don't get me wrong, I'm generally pro-blockchain, but I don't see how this is going to change anything. I just got charged a 2.6% miners fee to send coin, so I don't see how this is any different than if I paid that fee to Visa or Mastercard, both of which are also just payment facilitators/protocols.

A subscription to a seedbox, about 5 months ago. As the price skyrocketed the transaction costs got too high to justify using BTC anymore.

If you haven't cashed out then you don't have any gains. Gains and losses are real until you realize them. Until then it's just numbers on a website or spreadsheet.

Don't confuse bitcoin with the underlying technology of the blockchain. There's absolutely no reason that BTC has to be the future over ETH or LTC or EOS or NEO or Monero or Cardano or ......
It's the biggest currency now, sure. But AOL used to be the  ISP/email/search engine. What's their market share like these days? 
Blockchain technology will be a huge part of the future. BTC may or may not be.

The real question is why anyone would want BTC if there was knowledge that the wealth of it was concentrated in the hands of a few whales who are fully capable of crashing the market any time they see fit (see Mt. Gox). In a free market why wouldn't they choice a different coin that was already more evenly distributed, thereby decreasing demand and price? 
Very few sellers only means price increase if people actually want to buy it. In my eyes BTC is very very vulnerable to market manipulations. If Jeff Bezos decided to start crashing Amazon stock by dumping huge amounts of it what makes you think that it would ever rebound?

I just paid a 2.6% miner fee for a transaction so as it stands the bitcoin network is not really eliminating the middle-man as much as just changing who the middle-man is.
