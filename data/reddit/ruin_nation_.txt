blame me guys before i got into it was strong lol. I bought into it and mined a bit got in a 3k but i recently bought a big share then it started sinking :(
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:58:34
yeah i hate this fuck. such a click bait video guy. took a loan out to rent a lambo then lied to people in his video.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:05:48
never knew ms did accept them. not sure why both parties dont accept them any more. seams like a consorted effort to stop btc from gaining ground.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:42:57
yeah im glad i didnt sell and bought a few bucks and mined here and there when it was between 11k-14k

@_date: 2017-12-28 20:43:24
baby its cold outside. 17 outside today 60 in my room just from mining :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:04:17
yeah not sure how much longer its going to dip below 14 or 13 k. but im seeing a trend it doesnt dip lower then that. so im hitting the valleys when I buy and I mine when i can.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:53:00
It had a little trouble breaking that 17k after it went to 19 20k the other day. then went back down nice to see it staying at 18k slow clime or fast climb ill take it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:03:13
I know i got in at around 3500/4000 so im up not as much as other people but with mining and buying here and there when I  can.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:28:37
bought some when it was around 12k today i just hope it shoots up haha
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:27:44
what im doing right now Im buying btc anytime it drops to under 13.5k 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:56
17k gdax woot woot 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:46:22
I heard it jumped to 19k i didnt see this. The price chart i saw said only got above 17k for a high?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:58:37
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:59:32
I dunno what the cost to heat the one room is vs the oil heat heating the whole house. But ive been mining btc for a while and the electric bill hasnt gone up to much. Im also in a state where the electric bill rate is pretty high.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:47
I got in between 3-4k
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:11:06
Man I dunno this seams like the ship is sinking all together. All these heads of the coins just selling in mass really is hurting the market. every time it scraps up a few hundred it gets pushed down 1000. Im gonna hodl for now i havent really lost much. I have my point where ill cut my losses tho. I dont want to show nothing at the end of the day. Hope some one comes in and buys like 500 btc lol.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:40:55
no sure what you mean sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:18
yeah i see that point. i was ready for a dip but darn this is like a sink hole heh
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:43:57
lol ok then 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:35:19
so crazy :) 20k incoming hold on to your shorts
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:40:42
it hit 11k a few times so far but doesnt want to live at that range just yet. i think it got as high as 11700 yesterday 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:25
yeah you would think one coin down the others go up. or at least one goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:54:43
I slept a good time 10 hours pretty sick. I was thinking maybe she will be at 15k. me and a friend were joking maybe 20k by Christmas?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:34:31
bitcoin tramp stamp?
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:34:51
i highly doubt some one of both the ages of these 2 will forget what a dollar is.
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:47:50
like i said before with the last few months of btc up and down. id rather see a small steady climb over a big push up. Big push up recently has seen a bigger push down.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:16:03
Its a nice way to look at it. but atm it isnt to stable. Dont know if its a effort to decredit bitcoin to buy and dump from people in the fiat only market.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:17
hmm i hope it isnt a massive hack
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:18:33
Just Do It
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:38
and up it goes again like the Phoenix 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:04
The GDAX chart was going crazy as heck it was like christmas lights during that big sell off. buyers were going hard in too but the sellers won for a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:24:18
I buy when i can and mine all day mostly with my water cooled 1080 i have made up to the 4.70 a day
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:20:53
Id guess 10k around 11pm eastern.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:43:04
ok thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:35
massive sell offs likely just like the stock market.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:55
kinda mixed by that. it could be good as more people take it seriously. But could be bad with speculation connected to the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:03
damn btc is at 10734 may hit 11k tonight 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:39
I knew those bastards would try this.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:20:00
Thanks this was the reason in 2012ish i never took bitcoin seriously. I heard about some of the bs arrests and was like yeah i knew it they will make it illegal. then tail of last year i saw it was still around looked into a bit. 
me and my friend started mining since both have good gpu now. see how it went now we buy when we can and mine. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:41:01
I would never want to see a man eat his own nut. with that said get rdy do you want hot sauce with that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:09:51
my coinbase has been stuck on 9989 for like the last 40 minutes 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:55
9482 might get to 10k this week
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:42
All sites are down atm for tracking btc. Hope its a glitch not something worse
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:22:42
lol thats what im saying 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:33
big dip atm damn it went from 11600 down to 10500 time too buy
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:32
yeah done that
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:15:28
could very well be 7k by the time we all wake up tomorrow. heck at this rate may be 7200 7300
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:19

welp i was off lol. looks like some balls will be eaten :)
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:23:33
just wait if it hits 6-8k again people will start buying gpu's like crazy making the market go up again.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:07:12
uh huh

dilly dilly
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:09:39
How would they even know if you are mining lol gtfo. i wouldn't be surprised if they rushed into your home to see if you mine or not.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:40:28
Yep just goes to show you that government is to big. To many hands in the cookie jar one or 2 hands pocketing money for them selves.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:10
I made a little sold it gained more then I thought. Looking to buy again but also know it may crash to the point people jump ship. Its sad I hope it can recover. but things like this no one can tell the future.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:32:56
The point of this is why is it falling so hard? Is every one just cashing out after the big gains? doubt it is every one cashing out to pay for the tax on coins doubt it. something fishy going on here i feel.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:34:32
I dunno where its going from here. but i Honestly didnt see it crashing all the way down to high 5k and staying at lower 6k. it may go back up to 8k been going up to 7k today. but then the other side i never thought it would hit 20k. so wait i see i guess if btc dies other coins we have.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:28:07
Excitement New influx of users it was being talked about all over the news. Getting backing from big companies thats not a lot of no reasons. I am just saying I know things go up and down.
 But I wouldnt be surprised if some group of big people who want the coin market to fail. Bought as crap ton of coins then to sell them off to make the market crash. I mean thats not out of the realm of possibility is it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:17:49
Would you guys say since the coin market came from the stock market crash. that in return the stock market effects the coin market? Or other economical news? 
 Stocks go up coins go down or stay put. stocks fall coins go up due to uncertainty? Ive notice with the latest job reports Trump tax cuts unemployment numbers hit the coin market goes down? could this be a underlining factor? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:18:19
still kind of scary how far it has dropped. tho. everything rises and falls i guess.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:56:10
I still wouldnt put something fishy going on any time money is around something. I disagree tho but to each his her own
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:22:37
Sigh here we go again another insider crash to try to kill crypto
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:26:09
this was my point the other day before the bigger crash. what if some shady people or a big group wanted to kill bitcoin off. they bought a shit ton. made money then dumped it like crazy. would that be to hard to think some one would do it?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:50:28
ok so coast of mining and getting the reward will be higher. but the percentage between both of them will be generally the same?
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:48:37
this is kind of ass backwards. they accept it before it was big semi mainstream. then back out of it when it becomes a giant???/
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:49:14
ok my bad still a noob at this 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:19:24
Thats what we call the Walrus clap
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:42:15
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:49:25
oh nice for the info
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:31:32
For those who cant invest must in bitcoin mining is the way to go. they still support bitcoin correct so they are still brothers and sisters.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:13:16
feels like another pump an dump by manipulators 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:06:53
The Great Sell Off something is damn fishy here.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:23:21
It isnt even about money tho. Look at gaming pc master race vs Xbox vs Playstation. I have spent. 2k on my pc have a xbox one love both. But the console wars are so damn cringe. Everyone has a dog in the show. they will support even if it dies. Bitcoin alt coin etc no difference.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:00:57
They need to work on letting people with coin sell them when they want. got rid of paypal. my bank isnt listed manually put bank account in. never got the 2 small transactions in my bank to confirm it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:17:58
Any yearly fees?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:21:41
me thinks they are just pissed off. cause they cant regulate it or tax it or should i say yet. im sure one of 2 things will happen. they will try to tax it or ban it.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:11:40
I dont keep any bitcoin on my phone so this wont effect me i guess. no apps no wallet etc.
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:27:17
I wouldnt doubt if a large amount or a few millionaire keep buying bit coin. Sell when hit hits 7-8k then all dump at one time and keep doing it over and over to keep it in check.
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:29:56
Im saying they bought them before that and they sell off here and there. I mean its not hard to fathom they would do it
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:02:33
Slow steady climb is good right now keep chugging along bitcoin
