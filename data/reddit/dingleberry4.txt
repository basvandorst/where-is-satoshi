Who needs bitcoin when the nearest 8ball is down the street?

Top of your statement.

Just the opposite. There's nothing stopping you from buying BTC. You said it was hard because you were under 18. Naturally, I assumed this is due to not having utilities in your name for Mt.gox verification, as 16 year olds can open bank accounts here. I don't know what you're complaining about here. It's just as easy for you get bitcoin as it is for everyone else in the UK.
Meaning it's often slow and costly.

Anyone who makes the wise choice to actually 'invest' should just sell their computer and

Should've brought Bitpay up.

If you don't want to get charged above market price, then you should be looking at using an exchange like bitstamp. It'll involve a one-off fee of about £20 (based on your bank). 
Otherwise, localbitcoins.
Also, keep your bitcoins in an offline wallet, never on an exchange. Unless you plan on day trading.

You mean refute your guess with one of my own?
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:33:30
You're getting advice from someone who, despite claiming to know about markets, is just as clueless as the rest of us when it comes to bitcoin. Don't you see this?

If bitcoin doesn't become as huge as people like you expect/want it to, then 'some average' such as 150, 200 or 250, makes complete sense if it ends up only being used by a small demographic online.

No meme? No encouraging to hold/sell? I'll take it.
Anyone remember the early stages of the last crash (if this even ends up being a similar event)?

he's gonna wake a smoothie
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:50:19
It's not. Sign up on bitstamp, fund your account and then buy. If you want to get verified, they'll accept bank statements if you don't have utilities in your name.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:21:47
We needed to know how many BTC you own.

What a fucking retarded post.  Another person who thinks this recent growth is somehow steady. Oh, and we seem 'better placed' to handle growth, do we?
I want bitcoin to succeed, but I'm not deluded to the extent that I consider a $50 rise in value in three days 'steady growth'. This recent rise in price looks pretty much the same as the one in March - not a good thing.
Also, stop trying to get people on here to console you about your investment. It's desperate. Everyone here is clueless anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:03:56
So desperate.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:55:49
Not again.

Click the link broseph. It's not an exchange.

I masturbate furiously everytime the price drops. Feels good.

Yeah, get all nitpicky about my choice of words and ignore the point I'm making. Nice brah.
Bubble and crash are interchangable in this context and obviously there can be more than one crash.
