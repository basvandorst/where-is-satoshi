So far I just see "Your withdrawal request to thatcooladdress is Completed." Hopefully I didn't mess it up.
*edit, where "thatcooladdress" is a valid address. Nothing on blockchain.info yet though.
**edit edit if this goes through I owe you reddit gold or something. At least.

It worked. And the timing of this could not have been better.
Please let me do something for you. A steam game? Something similar?

Ok... At the very least, once I get stuff moved around I intend to let you know what a difference you just made. 
Once I do, I'll leave it to you to decide if you'd like to take me up on that steam game :)

The one advantage that stands out to me is bitcoin is a push payment, not a pull payment, and as such the vendor doesn't ever need access to private information like CC numbers. Which means the vendor can't steal them, abuse them, or have them stolen from them.

This is very cool, nicely done.

Free at the point of sale.
Not free at the point of transition from USD to BTC, or back from BTC to USD (although in this case I believe the first million is free with coinbase.)
If there's a 1% fee on each side, in the short term at least the impact is the consumer is absorbing half the cost of would-be-credit cards. I think these exchange fees need to be lowered in the future to be truly competitive, especially for large retailers who may have negotiated lower cc fees.

This should not prevent apps that allow the buying and selling of bitcoin. This is not in line with the app policy.
From the developers guide: "• You must deliver your digital good or service within your app. Do not use In-App Purchase to sell real-world goods and services."
So this should not cover bitcoin for the same reasons it would not cover online banking or ordering product from amazon.
Apps that allow the use of bitcoin for inapp purchases would be a different issue, of course.

I have an event coming up, and would love to integrate bitcoin into our ticketing system, but no one on our team has the time for it.
Matter of fact, every pre-built ticketing site has limitations that make it difficult for us to use, aside from not accepting bitcoin. There is an opportunity for someone to make a really nice multi-currency ticketing system with the features organizers need...

The "legal tender" argument doesn't really matter. Some airlines, for example, only accept credit/debit on board for drinks and such.
It must be accepted for debts, but it's not a debt until the transaction is finalized and you owe it (or something along those lines).
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:56:35
Simply put, you feel better about where you put your money if you enjoy it.
It's a lot easier to feel like your $500 tablet wasn't a waste if you use it, play games on it, message on it, whatever.  Even if realistically you could have derived the same enjoyment from that money spent elsewhere, once you associate the enjoyment with that object, it doesn't matter anymore. Same applies to a car you enjoy driving... and sometimes even one you don't, as you'll seek to find reasons to enjoy it anyway. It helps justify the purchase in your mind by extension sets your mind at ease.
If the technology and the community make people feel good about themselves, it's going to be psychologically difficult to make folks feel like it's not money well spent.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:36:23
Wow, anger issues. Amateur radio cannot be used for commercial purposes in many jurisdictions, not just the US.  This is a major component of the frequency allocations handed over to it, and is not just about the law. The community would by and large be against this as well.
But fuck them, right?
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:51:45
No,  it isn't. 
For most in app purchases the developer is selling you something they do not have a direct cost for. They are selling you for cupcake baking faster, or a new virtual hat for your virtual wombat. 
Do banking apps on apple platforms require you to give apple 30‰ if you transfer money between accounts? What about stock trading apps?  (hint: they don't) 
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:53:55
As far as "never connected to the internet" it's reasonable that a used machine, with a clean installed OS, from a known good source is good enough.  If you like, you can even dig for some os install media from before bitcoin was popular.

After a few moments more thought, a suitably large pool could sell tickets which pay for mining gear/power/etc, have daily scheduled announcements where the winner is announced, and just say "no winner" when there haven't been any blocks found.

The HAM operators that need to relay the transactions, perhaps.
It's ultimately their network, and it's operated this way for a very long time.  You could build your own relay network on licensed spectrum, though.

Maybe at least get the shipping and handling bundled together...

There is nothing on 1-800-Flowers for $5. Even if there is, after the $12 shipping and handling and other fees it won't be.
That said, 1-800-Flowers is very much mainstream.

I don't believe the parent said that. Or implied it, either.
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:35:19
One of the problems is it's difficult to vet most of these exchanges. When I was getting started with bitcoin everything seemed shady, and folks actually advised me to use gox to get in.
I'm glad the alarm bells went off but it's still difficult to tell who's legit in the market as it stands.
This is not confined to bitcoin, though. Look at paypal... tons of folks have issues with it, I for one had several thousand dollars tied up with them for months because of a chargeback that was later reversed, and their resolution system is garbage.... Yet everyone still uses them anyway.  Some folks lose my business simply because paypal is the only option (not as common as it used to be though).

Why does this apply to bitcoin, but not to online banking apps which allow the transfer of funds between accounts?
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:58:58
From the developers guide: 
"• You must deliver your digital good or service within your app. Do not use In-App 
Purchase to sell real-world goods and services."
So this should not cover bitcoin for the same reasons it would not cover online banking or ordering product from amazon.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:55:01
Using this for bitcoin would be illegal.

Powerball is visual. Maybe if mining could be displayed in a more visual fashion it would attract some of these masses.
Powerball also has commercials (which mostly lie) about putting money towards the elderly or schools. Perhaps mining needs an equally happy-sounding supportive ad.

Printing new dollars increases inflation.
Increasing inflation decreases the value of new dollars.
Buying out bitcoins would likely increase their price, and printing dollars to do so would further increase the USD to BTC costs.

I work with a non-profit organization called basekamp in Philadelphia. 
We only do a handful of events each year with ticketing, and most of them are not paid events.  Our largest gig is fosscon,  Phillies largest open source software conference. 
Reading up further on shopify tickets it seems like it might work for our paid stuff but I'd have a hard time justifying paying for an account year round...  I still think I'll look into it though. 
If selling tickets can we pull a list of registered attendees? 
Only somewhat related but a few weeks ago I did a presentation on shopifies dashing dashboard at our local lug.
