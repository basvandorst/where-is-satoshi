The widget is broken with Lastpass and Chrome autofill.

Correct. I'm not wishing for less fees. I'm wishing for an online purchase insurance program similar to what Paypal provides with fees similar to what Paypal charges. I don't even care if it's *more* than the 3.5% Paypal charges, at first, at least. 5% would be fine.

Yeah, I don't really expect spectacularly good anything from Microsoft, aside from marketing.

I can't figure out if this is authorizing a mass surveillance scheme or just saying that a court can issue a warrant for a clearly identified computer, given probable cause to believe it contains evidence of a crime without first determining its location when specific conditions are met.
If it's the latter, I think that's reasonable. That doesn't lower the evidentiary bar for getting a warrant. There still needs to be probable cause the evidence of a crime is on that specific computer.

Sure, just as soon as I get done writing up my unrelated negative experience with Coinbase.

When banks as we know them were new, a major bank robbery would have caused a lot of people to withdraw their money and put it under the mattress.
Now banks are old and bank deposits are insured. People don't worry about their money when a bank gets robbed.

I actually tried using it entering the card number manually, but Coinbase [still hates me](
Edit: I tried using a different email address and it didn't like the fact that I'm currently in Germany, even though I'm a US citizen and was going to use a US-based debit card. I'd try proxy sites or TOR if I was really determined, but I'm not.

Screenshot sent. There's not much to see: Lastpass appears to do nothing. Chrome autofill turns the fields yellow, but doesn't fill them in.

I just got a response saying that all new accounts are manually reviewed. While the fact that the website doesn't make this abundantly clear up front is problematic, the response time to my support query, explanation given and anticipated corrective action are all reasonable.

There's probably a market opportunity for a company to offer Paypal-style buyer protection and dispute resolution for Bitcoin transactions.

I've been able to get a response, it just wasn't *helpful*. Here's what I find unacceptable:
* The site doesn't tell me there's a security hold on my account. It simply appears to be *broken* with no information on what I can do about it.
* The conclusion that I'm not eligible to use the service seems to be incorrect according to the policies I can find, but there's no information on why it was taken and no opportunity to appeal the decision. I'd be OK with something like "you got flagged for possible identity theft; we can't tell you why for security reasons, but you can jump through these extra verification hoops".
* Customer service agents don't appear to have access to accurate information about account status.
* Response time from customer service is unacceptable for a company that acts like a bank.
I've had my Paypal account get flagged for review before too:
* I was told by email and when logging in to the site exactly what was going on and how to resolve it.
* I could get a response from customer service within minutes or in real time during extended business hours.
* The resolution steps, involving uploading a government-issued photo ID and, I think, a bank statement actually worked.

That's one way to do it, but it doesn't help much for peer to peer transactions. Here on reddit, for example we have a lot of hobbyist communities where people trade stuff. For example, I occasionally modify flashlights with LEDs you can't find in factory lights and sell them.
If someone uses Paypal, they don't really have to trust me. It would be nice if similar protection was available using Bitcoin for a reasonable fee.

If that's accurate, it means the warrant covers all computers connected to the internet if the target computer is. More research is required.

I had a look around BitPay's site and didn't see any documentation for this feature. I'll take your word for it that they do it, but purchase protection is easy to find on the front page of Paypal's site. It's a core feature: the message is "it's safe to buy from strangers and small companies on the Internet with Paypal because we have your back".
I just bought a moderately expensive (over $100) knife from a random stranger in a Facebook group. I paid him with Paypal, and I have no worries at all about whether I'll get ripped off. Bitpay's site talks about support for refunds, but as far as I can cell, leaves it up to the merchant's refund policy.

Great! First, I have to buy some.
I set up an account with Circle, which *did* allow me to buy, but then prevented me from *sending* the BTC I just bought to a local wallet, which is *worse*. I'm waiting for a response from support.
I know there are more options, some of them less bank-like, but I wouldn't mind using bank-like options if they behaved like my credit union: if there's a problem with my account at my credit union, I can get a response from customer service *immediately*. It's as if they take problems involving my access to my money seriously.

I just had my Coinbase account completely restricted from buying. After a couple weeks of back and forth with customer support, they said they had done a "manual review", the decision is final and they can't tell me why. The site doesn't even tell me this is the problem - it shows a daily buy limit of $10k.
If there had been any adverse events associated with my account, I'd be somewhat understanding, but the combination of the site behaving as if it's broken rather than saying something like "there's a security hold on your account" and the complete lack of explanation makes me think this is not a company I should trust with money.
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:26:32
I had a similar [negative experience with Coinbase]( I never did find out why they restricted my account from buying. They refused to answer any questions or escalate the issue further.
My experience with Circle was much better. I'm very disappointed that they're no longer selling Bitcoin.

The TSA has very limited power to detain people. If they think they found evidence of a crime, they summon the local police who are stationed near the checkpoint.
I don't think the TSA has the authority to do anything other than physically examine your phone and laptop to ensure they're not being used to conceal weapons or explosives. They may ask you to demonstrate that it functions to expedite the process.

The TSA usually fails to detect dangerous objects (firearms and simulated explosives) their own penetration testers attempt to smuggle through. That suggests to me that they're ineffective when it counts.
Catching people who forgot their concealed handgun was still on their belt or didn't bother to think about how the TSA might view a fake grenade doesn't actually make anybody safer. The fact that a large number of such items were found just means a lot of people were careless, not that there was any real danger.
