My Conclusion on Cryptogeddon
There is a lot of risk here, and there is a better than average chance that your investment might be lost in its entirety. If you approach it with the view that this is a complete gamble, and that you could lose the money at any stage, you won’t be as likely to invest more than you can afford to lose.
But, even more importantly, you won’t be as tempted to dump everything when the market does drop again. That means that you’ll have a better chance of riding out the vagaries of the market over the long term.
By doing your homework carefully, though, and by maintaining the right attitude, you increase the odds of being a winner with this type of investment. It is bound to be a bumpy ride, but the crypto industry is a long way from being over and done with

Why will you use a fork? Try connecting a screw driver to electricity and then make sure it touches your retina.
