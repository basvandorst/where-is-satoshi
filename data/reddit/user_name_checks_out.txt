you jest, but this is a good point to make every time somebody says bitcoin will hit zero - it would mean that bitcoin is worth nothing to anyone anywhere, which will never be the case.  then again it could also hit zero if the governments of the world band together to make it illegal, which in my opinion is very unlikely but not impossible.

The fact that bittorrent still exists does not invalidate my argument.  The founders of Pirate Bay went to jail, would you want that to happen to you?

Please forgive me for being a pedantic ass, but...
Previously you were saying that the green and red shaded areas represented the spread.
Now you are contradicting yourself, and you are saying that the red and green shaded areas represent the highs and lows - which is exactly what I think.  You are right that the samples appear to have been taken every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours.
The daily (or 12-hourly) high/low is not the same thing as the bid-offer spread.
Sorry if I seem ungrateful, in fact I am very grateful to you for helping me to understand the chart.  I agree completely with your most recent take on it.  If this is the correct interpretation, then the web site's own documentation is incorrect, which is what confused me in the first place.

@_date: 2019-07-04 16:12:38
There are two ways to calculate the price on bisq.  You can either set a fixed price, or you can set the price as an offset (zero or more basis points) of the current market price (which bisq tracks in real time, it uses BitcoinAverage).
If you wanted to sell 0.1 BTC for USD, you would first have a look on bisq to see who was offering to buy 0.1 BTC for USD.  If you see an offer that you like, you accept it.  If not, you can either wait until something comes up, or you can create your own sell offer.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:48:50

Thank you for acknowledging my point.  It's not unlikely at all.  To someone not familiar with the details of how Bisq works, all of the little payments involved in a transaction - security deposit, mining fee, trading fee - can be difficult to track.  You are most interested in the amount of bitcoin that you purchased, and once you notice that that has been received, you could very easily fail to notice that Bisq lost one of the other amounts.

Absolutely you are in danger of losing your coins.  If I had not by chance loaded the seed phrase of my Bisq wallet into Electrum, I would never have discovered the missing UTXO.  The only reason I used Electrum is because I wanted to transfer some funds to a segwit address, which Bisq does not support.
This is a catastrophic bug in Bisq and you are not helping by brushing it off.  It should be fixed urgently, and in the meantime all Bisq users should be told about it.  I should not have had to discover it for myself by accident.

@_date: 2019-07-10 16:07:21
Many thanks for getting back to me.  I am very interested in the points that you are making in this thread.  However I don't think I phrased my question well, let me try again.
Suppose that you are hodling long term.  Ideally you will hodl until such time as 1) your bitcoin are worth a lot and 2) bitcoin is widely accepted.  e.g. so you can buy a lambo direct with bitcoin.  But suppose that you want to allow for the possibility of 1) without 2), the possibility that at some point in the future you might want to convert your bitcoin back into fiat before purchasing your lambo.
So now you're worried about the possibility that, on the day you try to convert back into fiat, the exchange might refuse to accept your bitcoin because, unbeknownst to you, your coins are tainted.  Wherever you acquired your bitcoin - an exchange, localbitcoins, Bisq, wherever - the coins passed through the hands of an illicit owner prior to that, and they are tainted.
What steps might a hodler take now to avoid the risk of having problems selling their coins later if the coins turn out to be tainted?
Or maybe you did answer my question, but your answer was too nuanced for me to understand it.  You say that you continue to hold privacy coins, is that your answer?  Holding privacy coins, how does that mitigate any problems that you might have with tainted bitcoins?

Not at all.  Look at the guy who paid I-don't-remember-how-many bitcoin for 2 pizzas and those coins are worth a fortune now.  With the possibility of the price of a bitcoin hitting a million USD in our lifetimes, why would anyone ever sell for less?  The ideal is to wait until the value of your stack reaches a life changing amount, and until you can purchase what you want direct with bitcoin, without ever converting back to fiat.
I have a few satoshis on my phone and I make trivial purchases with that, just to encourage businesses to accept bitcoin.  My cold storage, though, I'm never touching that.  If it goes to zero, so be it.
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:55:59

@_date: 2019-07-01 12:45:22

If my calculations are correct, then at a price of $12,300 per bitcoin, your $2 bought you 2/12,300=0.00016260 bitcoin, or perhaps a little less depending on how you handled transaction fees.
I believe that the price of one bitcoin will hit one million dollars in our lifetimes.  If you hodl until then, your 0.00016260 bitcoin will be worth 0.00016260*1,000,000 = one hundred and sixty two dollars.
Don't settle for a penny less.  Hodl my friend.

By "arresting everyone involved", I meant, first passing a law prohibiting crypto, then enforcing it.  The government is more powerful than the people, and it represents the interests of corporations, not of the electorate.
Of course they could make it illegal to run a node, if the political will is there then it's just a question of passing the law.  They don't go after scammers and spammers because those people threaten you, not the state - unlike crypto which is a challenge to the system.
The Occupy protesters, where are they now?  Still hanging out in Zuccotti Park, pushing their agenda?  No?  Did they go home victorious, having wrested control of the government out of the hands of private corporations, and restored it into the hands of the electorate?  No.  The protestors got the shit beat out of them.  Some of them suffered broken bones, some of them suffered permanent nerve damage from zip tie handcuffs.  There was no need to run anybody over with a tank, the state won, but you want me to celebrate just because you are able to point to some other place on Earth that's even worse than the States?

@_date: 2019-07-04 13:39:50
I've used it maybe half a dozen times now.  What do you want to know?
Before you can use bisq, you need to already own a little bit of bitcoin for a deposit.  For me this meant retrieving a few satoshis out of very cold storage, which was kind of a hassle, but still preferable to any alternative, e.g. subjecting myself to KYC from an exchange.
Bisq transaction sizes are limited, depending on how long it has been since you entered your bank account number into bisq:
* &lt; 1 month: 0.0625 BTC
* &lt; 2 months: 0.125 BTC
* \&gt;= 2 months: 0.25 BTC
I used bisq a few times a year or two back, then switched computers in the meantime.  When I restored my backups, for some reason it forgot the age of my accounts, and I had to start again with an account age of zero.
Just now I earned some money in a foreign country and currency.  Rather than send it home via Transferwise, I decided to convert it into bitcoin just for fun.  I put a buy order on bisq a few days ago.  I offered to pay market rate, which was better than the other offers online at the time, where the buyers wanted to pay a few basis points below market rate.  My offer still sat there for a couple days before it was accepted.  The price rose in the meantime but it's no big deal - I believe it will rise much higher.
I really like bisq!
- Bisq doesn't support segwit.  But I believe that you can enter your bisq seed phrase into Electrum and send the coins from there to a segwit address.  I will be attempting that shortly.
- Bisq doesn't support watch-only wallets.  So if somebody hacks your computer, they can steal any coins that you have in bisq.  I don't like that!
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:15:11

After we first hit 10K in 2017 we then went in to a vertical climb straight to 19K in 17 days with very few tracebacks.  So what we are seeing these days does not yet compare to December 2017 as far as bull runs go.

@_date: 2019-07-01 11:03:17
Not really.  On 13/11/17 it opened at 5870 and closed at 6525.  From there it was more or less a straight shot up above 19K on 17/12/2017.  There were a handful of red candles along the way but most of them were tiny, the biggest was on 09/12/2017, an open at 15,800 and a close at 14,607.
The bull run of December 2017 was pretty insane and we have not seen anything like it since.  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, I think a gain at that speed is guaranteed to be followed by a big crash.

Consider this image:
The top is from bitcoinwisdom.io, the bottom is from bitcoinity.org.  Both are showing Bitstamp, USD/BTC, daily.
You can see that the bitcoinwisdom chart shows a peak price of $13,764.  The dates aren't visible but that was 26/06/19.  If you look at the same day from bitcoinity, the yellow line never goes above 13K.  The green shaded area - which you are calling the offer portion of the bid-offer spread - does get close to 14K.
The bitcoinity chart would make sense to me if you told me that the yellow line is the opening/closing price, the red shaded area is the intraday low, and the green shaded area is the intraday high.  With this definition, bitcoinity would also match bitcoinwisdom perfectly.

This is the cause of your confusion. There is no such thing as "$100 in bitcoin".
As I write this, one bitcoin is worth $10,680. So if you were to convert $100 into bitcoin at that price, you would then hold 0.0094 bitcoin.
If at a later date you chose to convert the bitcoin back into fiat, the amount of fiat you would receive would depend on the market rate at that moment.
But why ever convert back? Why not just spend the bitcoin to get whatever you want?
You are still thinking in the language of fiat. But nowadays it's better to think in the language of bitcoin.

In my lifetime civil liberties have already been curtailed long past the point where I would have expected open rebellion in the streets.  The Occupy movement was the real opportunity for the people to fight back, and that movement was absolutely crushed by the government in a brutal and violent fashion.  Shutting down bitcoin would be nothing in comparison to the limitations on our freedoms that have already been put in place.

The government could shut down bitcoin if they wanted to, and it's naïve to think otherwise.  Look what happened to wikileaks, pirate bay, silk road, swiss banking...
People say, "The government can't stop us from transmitting ones and zeroes around."  They can.  All they have to do is imprison anyone who engages in any bitcoin related activity - running a node, running or using an exchange, contributing to a git repo, etc...
More likely the government will stop short of killing bitcoin, but they will regulate it into something that they don't see as a threat, e.g. by eliminating anonymity, implementing KYC and taxes everywhere, etc....
I'm a bitcoin maximalist.  I hope that the government does not shut down bitcoin.  The longer we go without it happening, the less likely that it will happen.  But it's not impossible.

You are mixing multiple questions.  Could the government try to shut down bitcoin?  Would they succeed?  What would be the result if they did?  Those questions are not unrelated, but let me treat them separately.
In order to make cryptocurrency illegal, all the government has to do is pass a law to that effect.  It wouldn't matter if it contradicted existing contract law.  And the courts wouldn't strike it down, the system of checks and balances has not been working for a long time as all three branches of government have been increasingly taken over by corporate interests.  To grab just one random example off yesterday's front page: [Protesters as terrorists: growing number of states turn anti-pipeline activism into a crime](  There you go, private citizens exercising their right to peaceful protest, and now they are treated as terrorists.  It's un-Constitutional, but now it's law, the courts will never strike it down, and there's nothing you can do about it.  This kind of steady erosion of our civil liberties is happening all the time.
As to whether enforcement of a ban could succeed, maybe not 100%.  They could pretty easily shut down all the exchanges in their jurisdiction.  They could make it illegal to work on bitcoin-related software, or to run a node.  Bitcoin in some form might still persist in third world jurisdictions, or in the dark corners of the internet, but it would not be recognizable.
What would be the result?  If it became nearly impossible to convert between fiat and crypto, I do not think that this would cause the price of bitcoin to skyrocket, rather the reverse.
I love bitcoin, I have all my savings invested in it, I am betting on its future.  I hope the government doesn't totally ban bitcoin.  And I think a total ban is unlikely.  It seemed more of a risk a couple of years back - the more time passes without a ban, the less likely one is.  The more that establishment figures get involved in bitcoin, the less likely the government is to ban it.  I do think they will regulate it into the ground, which is a shame, but they won't kill it entirely.  And I do believe that bitcoin will grow to threaten fiat, and that it's quite likely that a major fiat currency will fail in our lifetimes, which would be great news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:39:59
Sure, Pirate Bay was a system on top of bittorrent.  Look at all the systems on top of bitcoin - exchanges, wallets, payment systems.  If it wanted to, the government could shut all those down in a heartbeat, just by arresting everyone involved.  They could make it illegal to run a node.
I agree completely that a government only has as much power over the people as the people give it.  So far, with regard to the question "How much shit are the people willing to tolerate," The answer is that there is no limit.  The government has been steadily eroding our civil liberties and we do nothing about it.  The last time that the people rose up significantly was the Ocuupy Wall Street protests and that was shut down by the government in violent and brutal fashion.

I wanted to move some money from Bisq to a segwit address, which Bisq doesn't support.  So I entered the seed phrase of my Bisq wallet into Electrum, that's when I found the missing UTXO.  They really should spread the word far and wide until this is fixed.

I agree with this.  People like to say that the risk of bitcoin being shut down by the government is zero.  I find that viewpoint naïve.  A government entity such as G20 could very easily shut down the bitcoin network, simply by imprisoning anyone who engages in any bitcoin-related activity.  Thankfully bitcoin seems to be attracting enough interest from members of the establishment that hopefully this will make it politically infeasible for the government to shut it down.

Crises are deemed to be negative changes in the security, economic, political, societal, or environmental affairs, especially when they occur abruptly, with little or no warning.

There is no way of identifying the highs and lows.
In hindsight it's easy.  You look back at the chart and say, oh, I could have bought there, I could have sold there.  But nobody can predict the future.
As I write this, the current price is $11,731.  Is that a high, or a low?  What if I buy now, and then the price tanks down to 9K?  What if I sell, and then the price surges up to 20K?  You can't predict.
If you believe in bitcoin's long term prospects, then DCA in and hodl.

During the bull run at the end of 2017 I was watching the price almost in real time.  I was earning more per hour off my bitcoin wallet than from my consulting job, and I kept recalculating my net worth and choosing my moon.  Since then, during the periods when it seemed like another bull run might be kicking off, I watched the price somewhat obsessively.  At my desk I have the price displayed on one of the tabs of my browser.  Out and about I check it on my phone when I have a free moment - waiting in line at the grocery store etc. During quieter periods I check it less often.  Recently, after it came off that peak of 13K and fell back down, I lost interest, I check less than once a day.

"A rough guesstimate for what price would be around July."  
Again looking at bitcoinwisdom for bitstamp, for July we have an opening price of $10,749, a closing price of $10,085, a high of $13,880, and a low of $9,049.  If you think "~9,200" was an accurate prediction for July, then you would have said the same for any prediction between "~9,000" and "~13,900".  If he only has to be accurate within the nearest thousand or two, then why does he even bother to specify the hundreds?
This is how people end up believing in astrology, in nostradamus.  Vague predictions coupled with lax interpretations of their accuracy.
This screenshot seems to predict the future, if you don't squint at it too hard.  There must be a thousand other screenshots on 4chan with other predictions that turned out to be obviously wrong.
Even if this screenshot were specific, and correct - what would that mean?  Do you believe that it is possible to predict the future?  Then why is that guy posting on 4chan when he could be sailing around on his yacht?  It was just a vague guess that has been lucky so far, nothing more.

Is there anything in the original prediction to indicate that the predicted prices were monthly lows?  Anyway bitcoinwisdom shows for bitstamp a low of $9,049 on 17 July.  Again, if you are lax enough in your interpretation, any "prophecy" comes true.
1) I doubt that there is a large segment of the market paying attention to this prediction.
2) It does sometimes seem that whales can manipulate the market at will.  But whales don't all operate in unison.  If one whale decided to spend a lot of money to push bitcoin to a certain price, others could make a lot of money by betting against that.

acquire an extra PC.  install the electrum wallet onto it, then disable internet access for that machine and never take it online again.  create a new wallet on the offline machine.  write the seed down and keep it safe.  copy the receiving address(es) to an online machine.  delete the wallet from the offline machine.  transfer your bitcoin to the receiving address(es).
later when you want to spend the bitcoin you can use the seed to reconstitute the wallet on the offline machine.  electrum lets you sign a transaction on the offline machine and then transfer the transaction to an online machine from which you transmit the payment.

Was it?  The prediction for July was ~$9,200.  According to bitcoinwisdom, bitstamp's closing price on 31 July was $10,085.  That's pretty far off.
"July 2019 - BTC ~ $9,200" - what does that mean exactly?  Closing price?  Monthly average?
This is why people believe in horoscopes.  Vague predictions combined with lax intrepretations of outcomes.
Anyway how could somebody in January predict what bitcoin will do in July?  Nobody can predict the future.  And this prophet wrote "charts never lie" - charts are completely backward looking, they are based on the idea that the future will repeat the past, and they take no account of unknown future events.
I hope bitcoin breaks $87K next year and I believe that there is a very real possibility that it could.  But it won't be because someone on 4chan predicted that it would.

I might use a safe deposit box for, say, offsite backup of an encrypted hard drive.  I'd never store my seed phrase there.

if i am understanding you correctly, the only relevant information is what i have bolded above.  you tried to transfer bitcoin from coinify to coinbase, but it has't confirmed.  what happened before that, or what would happen after the transaction goes through, isn't really relevant and just confuses things.
what fee did you set for the transaction?  if it never confirms then it would fail altogether and you would not lose the coins.  do you still see the coins in the sending wallet?

this point is almost universally misunderstood. if you write down the seed phrase of an HD wallet, that's not the same thing as a paper wallet. similarly a paper wallet engraved on steel is still a paper wallet. the defining characteristic of a paper wallet is not the piece of paper, it's the fact of having a non deterministic seed that exists outside of any software package.
likewise, memorizing the seed phrase of an HD wallet is not the same thing as inventing a seed yourself. unfortunately bitcoin wiki describes both of these techniques under the same heading - brainwallet - they are very different.

My main point was that banks may block transactions or freeze accounts because of bitcoin related activity.  You yourself confirmed that banks are within their rights to do so.
I said that, more generally, banks might block an account for any number of unjustified reasons.  I linked one example, you said "I guarantee you there was other shady stuff going on", so I mentioned another example, which I am too lazy to Google up, were a guy got blacklisted because of what turned out to be an error on the part of his bank.

you mean "bitcoin", the currency, not "Bitcoin", the protocol.  i haven't given any indication of my expectations about the price of bitcoin.
the problem is that your predictions are too vague on which to base any decisions.  "a downwards channel exits its trendlines upwards".  how low does it go?  when does it change direction?  how high does it go?
you look backward with 20/20 vision and superimpose your perceptions on historical data.  this squiggle here is a downward channel, that one there is a bart.  but had it gone another way you'd have called it something else.  the future price of bitcoin is based not on past historical patterns but on future events, which are unknowable.

Are you using the words password and passphrase interchangeably?  They are not the same thing, you should be more precise in your terminology.
If someone were to find your seed phrase, with three words missing and the remaining words scrambled, and if they were to recognize it for what it was, I do not think it would take them very long to crack it.  But you might lose the algorithm and lock yourself out of your wallet.  You are essentially inventing your own flavor of cryptography which is not recommended.  I think it would be preferable to keep the seed phrase intact and to ensure that it is stored securely.
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:37:05

suppose i run electrum on an airgapped computer.  now i decide to record backup information for A and B.
**2-of-2**: write down (or stamp in steel) the seed phrase of wallet 1 for A and wallet 2 for B.
**2-of-3**: seed phrases alone are not enough for A and B to reconstitute the wallet.  now i need to record the MPK of wallet 3.  i'm not going to write that down by hand.  in order to print it, i need to connect my airgapped computer to a printer.  i suppose i could deploy a watching only wallet to an online computer and print from there. in any case, hassle, and potential loss of privacy, if the printer and/or the online computer is hacked.  also, it would be inconvenient for A and B to restore the wallet from a printout - they would have to type the MPK in manually.  i could print a QR codef, but that assumes that the target device has a camera.  if i store the MPK in digital form, that would mean that A and B could copy and paste it in to the target computer, which is easier.  so i could send it to them via email - but there is the risk that the email could be lost or intercepted.  and now they'd have the MPK in an email and the seed on paper, two separate artifacts.

i am no expert on this variation.  the article says:


it's saying that the purchase amounts are calculated automatically.  i imagine that that is specifically intended to exclude emotions from the equation.
also there is no mention ever of timing purchases subjectively.  the timing of the purchases is always automatic.  there is no attempt to time the market, no attempt to "buy the dip".

but that is attempting to time the market.  "sell at the peak" seems simple with hindsight, but there is no way to identify the peak when it happens, because nobody can predict the future.
suppose that tomorrow the price rises to $30,000.  is that the peak?  nobody knows.  the next day it might rise to $40,000, it might drop to $3,000.

After a long struggle it emerged that his own bank had mistakenly deposited some dodgy checks into his account.

@_date: 2019-06-03 20:12:23
well, you have already received good advice.  if you receive multiple payments to a single address, then they can all be tied to you (or, at least, to each other).  when the time comes to spend from that address, you should spend all the funds, receiving any change into a different address.
@_date: 2019-06-09 16:56:14

if part of a seed phrase is discovered, there is a risk that it could be brute forced.
with these three partial lists, do you indicate the place number of each word in the combined list?  if not, you risk confusing yourself when it comes time to combine the lists.  if so, you make a brute force attack easier.
a multisig wallet is an alternative to splitting a seed phrase into parts.  in your case, a 2-of-3 multisig wallet would achieve the same result that you are shooting for, with greater security.

no, that is not DCA.  DCA means buying at set time intervals and it's specifically intended to ignore market conditions.  it is very easy to say that you will *buy the dip*, but in practice it's pointless to try to time the market, because without a crystal ball you have no way of knowing when you are at the bottom of the dip.

@_date: 2019-06-04 09:47:07
absolutely it can.  receiving multiple inputs to a single address compromises your privacy, and sending all of those inputs together to a new address does not restore your privacy.
the reason that you send all those inputs together is because not doing so would also compromise your security.  spending from an address reveals the public key of that address, which makes the address vulnerable to a quantum computing attack.  never spend part of the funds at any address.  spend all of the funds, and receive any change into a new address.

if i were to go down to my bank and try to deposit €10,000 onto my account, they would ask me where the money came from.  if i were to try to withdraw €10,000, they would ask me what the money was for.  in either case, if they did not like my response, they might refuse the transaction, or lock my account.  so fuck those cunts, i keep my savings in bitcoin now.

neat article, but it is very old - published in september 2017.

look at the next to last table, the one just above the text "You need 15 Bitcoins to be in the Top 1%.".  suppose you want to know what percentile would result from a balance of 5 BTC.  start at the bottom of the second column and scan up until you hit 5BTC.  there's no exact match, so go up to 5.4 BTC.  look at the number to the left - a balance of 5.4 BTC would put someone in the top 4%.
well, i didn't really answer your question.  if you want to know how he calculated the 4% - he lays out his methodology in the article, it's a multi step process, with lots of assumptions and estimations.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:08:53
you are confusing multiple concepts.
- at the link you gave, somebody provided a link to a demo, written in javascript, showing how to hijack the clipboard.  the fact that that demo was written in javascript does not mean that javascript would be the preferred or only way to effect a clipboard hijack.
- javascript runs in the browser.  uninstalling java from your computer would have no effect on whether javascript runs in your browser.  you could change the settings in your browser to prevent it from running javascript.

@_date: 2019-04-12 07:29:33
this came up recently.  apparently they don't, but some of their dealerships do.
anyway i should have chosen another phrase.  i was trying to differentiate two categories of hodlers:
1) purists who have no intention of ever converting back into fiat.  
2) not purists who might convert back into fiat some day.
so when we hit the moon and people want to realize their gains, presumably the first group would hodl as long as necessary in order to convert crypto directly into whatever asset interests them, whereas the second group might convert back to fiat first.
i characterized the second group as "waiting until they can afford a lambo" but that was a poor choice of words.
the point is that, depending on which category you're in, you might make different choices while waiting until we hit the moon.  i spoke about exchanges placing onerous requirements on you to prove the provenance of your bitcoin.  i neglected to point out that even if you hodl in the hopes that bitcoin might be more widely accepted, you might still have to prove where you got it.

no need to gatekeep me.  whether or not i want to reserve the possibility of one day converting back to fiat has nothing to do with how long i've been hodling.
anyway i already addressed this point upthread:


@_date: 2019-04-11 21:26:56

@_date: 2019-06-24 07:41:28
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:17:58
i feel the same.  the more hodlers, the merrier, and i always feel sorry for weak hands.  i can't yet envision any scenario in which i'd ever part with a satoshi, the chance that i (or my heir - my goldfish, Oscar) would regret it later is just too much.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:29:23
this all sounds perfectly sensible to me.  hopefully backup measures will never be needed anyway.  everybody is different and everybody needs to make his own threat assessment.  i, for example, have a long and well established history of securing things so securely that i lock myself out of them, so i worry more about that than about getting hacked.
i think that it is a very good idea to memorize the seed phrase.  who knows, one day you might need to flee home with nothing but the shirt on your back.  but i would never rely on my memory as the only copy of my seed phrase.

at the moment bisq seems to be one of the last platforms that allows you to convert to/from crypto/fiat without undergoing KYC.  the biggest drawback of bisq is that it limits transaction sizes.
agreed, if you own the private key then by definition you own the bitcoin.  but they want to know where you got them, how you paid for them, whether you have made all the proper tax declarations and payments since then, etc.

you asked about buying crypto, in which case you would receive fiat.
if you want to sell crypto - in the case of bisq you would receive fiat via bank transfer.  in the case of a face to face contact e.g. via bitcoin meetup, that would be for you and them to negotiate.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:54:53
nobody can predict the price and trying to time the market is a fool's game.  if you believe in bitcoin's long term prospects then DCA your way in.
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:34:20
exchanges ask endless questions about the origin of your bitcoin before they will allow you to convert them, and in the worst case they might confiscate them.
you might be asked to prove the complete history of your bitcoin from the moment you bought them.  even then you could have problems, if the address from which you purchased the bitcoin is linked to illicit activity for example.
so suppose you acquire bitcoin legally, then anonymize them by passing them through a mixing service.  now you can no longer prove that you own them, and you might never be able to convert them back to fiat.

- why do hodlers always talk about buying a lamborghini when we hit the moon, as opposed to some other make of car?
- judging from photos it appears to me that the lamborghini sits very low to the ground.  wouldn't this be impractical for driving around town?  i'd be worried about bottoming out at every bump or dip in the road.

i'm in two minds about privacy.  on the one hand i can see the desire to anonymize your bitcoin and hold them in complete anonymity.  on the other hand, if you want to convert them back into fiat some day, you might be forced to prove ownership.  depending on what steps you took to achieve anonymity, you might find it impossible to prove ownership, or you might get into trouble for having failed to declare ownership sooner.
this is a moot question for the purists who never intend to convert back to fiat.  but it's a problem for the people who are just waiting until they can afford a lambo.

A what now? Look at mister big brain with all the big words.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:48:09
I believe that the main argument for running your own node is not to protect you from faulty transactions but rather to protect your privacy.
There is no such thing as a faulty transaction.  Once a transaction is mined, that's it, it's on the blockchain.  I suppose that a bad actor could try to spoof a transaction but I would say that the risk of a reputable exchange attempting that is zero, unless they were taken over.
The reason that people advise you to run your own node is to protect your privacy.  If you run your own node, it pulls down the entire blockchain.  Your wallet then connects locally to the node and examines the UTXOs that it's interested in, free from observation (hopefully).  If you don't run your own node, then your wallet must go out to the network to request the data that it needs, and then a spy could observe your activity, for example it could establish that all of your addresses belong to the same wallet.
To answer your question, the worst case scenario is...
- Your exchange is taken over or somehow impersonated
- You run your own node, but the attacker partitions your node such that it only links to bad nodes
- The attacker generates a false transaction which is visible to you and to the bad nodes but not written to the blockchain
- Your transfer from the exchange to the wallet is stolen
The problem with this scenario is that it would probably cost the attacker more than the value of your coins.  So the likelihood of this is so low that you would be better to worry about other things, like aliens zapping Earth.  I think it's a good idea for you to run your own node in order to protect your privacy, but I don't think it's necessary for you to run your own node in order to protect yourself from a faulty transaction from an exchange.

My pleasure.




Sure.  Normally the addresses in your wallet can't be linked to each other, except by you - to anyone else they appear unrelated.  If you are not running a node, then your wallet goes out to the network to retrieve the info that it needs - i.e. any UTXOs spendable by you.  Anyone sniffing your network traffic can see for example that your wallet is inspecting exactly addresses X, Y and Z, and none others - so such a spy can conclude that these addresses belong to the same wallet.  In contrast, if you run your own full node, then when your wallet inspects that node, this traffic is invisible to the outside world.  So anyone observing your network activity would see your node downloading the entire blockchain, and would not know the particular addresses that your wallet is interested in.


Thank you!

I made my first ever bitcoin purchase on localbitcoins back in 2014, then switched to bitstamp and never used localbitcoins again.  They just emailed me to say that I still have some bitcoin on the platform.  The email looks legit and it would be totally like me to leave, say, ten dollars' worth behind.  Which today would be worth $250.  Not a life changing amount for me, but I'm very curious to see just how much is on there.  I still have my localbitcoins password, but the two factor authentication failed, so I have to wait two weeks for them to reset my account.
P.S. Looking through my old emails from other localbitcoins users, came across this gem.

if bitcoin hits $1,000,000, the only bitcoin billionaires will be the people who own 1,000 BTC, that's a rare breed.
there are 1,677 wallets containing 1,000 BTC or more.  that probably includes all of Satoshi's lost bitcoin.  and there will be some individuals who own multiple wallets from that group.  so there are probably far fewer than 1,000 people who own more than 1,000 bitcoin.

according to wikipedia, Luka Magnotta was arrested on 4 june 2012 and convicted in december 2014.  reddit says that the "timetraveller" post was "submitted 5 years ago" at which moment the guy was presumably in pretrial custody of some kind.  so it would seem that he had internet access at that point.

i have the impression that the traffic here has ramped up steadily since the price of BTC broke $4,500 at the start of last month.  i was not active here at the start of the previous bull run so i don't know if it was the same that time but i would guess it was.
i notice also that the trolls have become more active, and more varied.  during the bear market, there was some low level negativity, but it wasn't targeted and might even have been honest opinions of random individuals, rather than some concerted attack.  nowadays we get targeted messages, e.g. to the effect that bitcoin is inferior to the traditional banking system.  people must remember to read with a critical eye.

strictly speaking, it was neither.  OP wrote:


but more generally i think the question is, who gets your bitcoin when you die.  you could transfer the bitcoin to your heirs in various ways - wallet, seed, whatever.  your proposed solution...


... doesn't really address the question at all.
also, if your data is well encrypted, it's actually better to give it a meaningful name, it reduces the risk that you (or your heirs) will mistake what it is.

just tried to recover an old samourai wallet that i had tinkered with a while back.  it wouldn't come up.  then i noticed that one of my seed words, "garbage", appeared twice in the list.  i tried it with "garage" in place of the second occurrence and it worked.  woohoo beers on me.
edit: btw i first recovered the samourai seed into electrum using the instructions at this link:
 
















once i corrected the seed, it worked.
then i recovered it on the phone using samourai.  easy to make that typo with predictive text and my fat thumbs.  i'm surprised that two such similar words both appear on the list of standard seed words.

@_date: 2019-05-13 13:47:47
yes... i was approached by 2 friends last week, one wants to buy 1 BTC and the other 2 BTC.  it's a little bit frustrating.  i have been evangelizing bitcoin for many years now and have been in low level chats for more than a year with these two friends regarding the possibility of them investing in bitcoin.  all last year they could have gotten in during the bear market, but now the price is climbing as we speak.
by the way, how should i advise them?  i am inclined to help them open accounts on exchanges in their own names.  as opposed, say, to me acquiring bitcoin on their behalf.  the idea being that, if they want to convert back into fiat later, they can establish an audit trail to prove their ownership.  if i help them to acquire bitcoin anonymously then they would benefit from the privacy but they might get into trouble later if they want to sell.  how would you handle it?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:38:21
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:44:40


that prediction is so vague that it's guaranteed to come true.  of course the price will not rise at this pace forever.
when do you think it will peak?  at what price?  how long will it fall?  how far?  when will it rise again?  how high?
if you want your prediction to be meaningful then you need to make it more specific.

did you use a new receiving address for this transaction?  or did you send the bitcoin to an address that has already received bitcoin in the past?
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:56:12


it's because the title of the article is deceptive and starbucks doesn't really accept bitcoin.  they support some payment platform which is thoroughly KYCed, and in which BTC is exchanged under the hood and completely removed from the point of sale.  you can't pay from your own wallet, and this is a GIANT leap backward, not forward.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:05:31
i think it's a stupid idea.
i agree that anyone who holds his BTC on an exchange, or in the control of any other custodian, should move them into a private wallet. this is always true and we don't need an annual event.
but if your bitcoin are already safe, why should you move them? suppose you went to a lot of effort to anonymize them. why risk being identified?
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:20:09
yeah, this is the problem.  maybe it's technically possible to "pay with bitcoin" using some custodial payment platform that is KYCed out the asshole, and in which BTC is exchanged under the hood and completely removed from the point of sale.  fuck that.
i have a few satoshis in a samourai wallet on my cell phone.  i will walk an extra mile to spend them at any shop that will accept them.

you (and people who are responding to you) are conflating certain terms:

that prediction is almost guaranteed to come true, especially given that it specifies no timescale whatsoever. the only way for it to not come true is for the price to rise above 6K and then never ever drop so much as a cent below. the prediction is so vague as to be meaningless.

i just made my first ever bitcoin purchase.  a while back i had this idea to acquire some extra satoshis and to try to use them as much as possible in day to day life.  so i fired up bisq, made a couple of purchases, and transferred some coin to a samourai wallet on my phone.  but i never got around to spending them and then i had to replace both my laptop and my phone so i wrote down the seeds and forgot about it.
then yesterday i managed to get bisq up and running again on my new laptop, and, [after a few heart-stopping moments]( got samourai back up on my new phone.
then i went to a web site that supposedly lists local businesses accepting bitcoin.  the nearest place that they mentioned is no longer in business, but i went to the second nearest place, a noodle bar, and paid bitcoin for a chicken soup.  yippeeee....

i would say that burning bitcoin is not the same thing as losing them.  burning bitcoins is when you deliberately send them to an address from which you know that they can never be spent.  same end result.

good, so hopefully that tainted address can't be connected to the other receiving addresses in your wallet.
if the transaction has not yet received any confirmations then you might be able to replace it with a new transaction by doing a double spend with a higher fee.  i'm not sure whether samourai would allow you to attempt that, if not you might try importing the seed into electrum and attempting to initiate a replacement transaction from there.
even if the original transaction goes through, i wouldn't burn the coins.  you could just be careful never to send them to an exchange (nor to anyone else who would care about their origin).  and you could anonymize them e.g. with a coinjoin.  if anybody ever asks why you did that you could just say that it was for the sake of your own privacy/security.
bon courage, i think you will be OK.  it's unlikely that the coins are tainted in the first place.

just gazing at the live action on bitcoinwisdom.io for bitfinex BTC/USD.  there is a buy order for 30 BTC sitting there at 8750, just below the current market price of 8760.
the amount and price of the buy order keep fluctuating slighly, every tick.  the price goes to 8750.9, then back to 8750.0.  the amount goes to 30.007, 30.000, etc.
does that mean that the buyer is making tiny tweaks to his order in real time?  what would be the motivation for doing that?
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:59:38

think carefully about all of the scenarios that you want to plan for.  for example, what will happen if you are incapacitated, or killed?  if you want for your bitcoins to be accessible to someone else in that case, then you need to make a plan that gives them access to your wallet - but be careful to organize this in such a way as to not make them potential targets in the meantime.  and make sure that your plan will still be valid in the event that the price of bitcoin rises considerably.  there are lots of angles to consider and the optimal plan for each person is probably unique.

i hear you.  i don't have time to respond in detail.  yes a corporate retailer needs a platform of some kind, they are not going to manually maintain a single wallet.  but they could still provide at the point of sale a QR code that i could scan from any wallet.  there is absolutely no necessity for them to lock me in to some kind of custodial payment platform.  and it's no accident that they are trying to force us in that direction.

TA predictions are no more precise than horoscopes.  a typical TA prediction runs something like "if we break current resistance levels then that could lead to a strong upward trend otherwise there will be a pullback."  no dates, no numbers, and if you distill the prediction down to its essence you get "the price might rise, or it might fall."  the prediction is so vague that its author can always point back to it later and claim that he was right.  but for you today needing to make decisions about the future, TA is worthless.

i'd love to see a new ATH.  i couldn't imagine it breaking into six figures this time around though.  of course, the more wrong i am about that, the better, but it doesn't seem feasible.
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:49:48
beautifully said.  i am looking forward to that insane epic move.  i guess i was despairing slightly because at first the current bull run seemed like a repeat of that in 2017 but it's faltering slightly.  of course the only thing we can do is wait and see.


i don't pay much attention to the news.  and i have always believed that bitcoin would rise again.  so i was not aware that investors had written it off, is that really a well established sentiment?

absolutely it is not.  a step in the right direction would be so much easier than this mess.  all the vendor needs to do is provide a receiving address.  but they're not doing that because it would mean you retaining control of your bitcoin and retaining your privacy.

i hope so.  lately this bull run seems to have less steam than the one in 2017.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:00:51
at the end of 2017 the price of bitcoin went from below $6,000 to above $19,000 in less than two months.  if we get another bull run like that then we could see an ATH long before the end of the year.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:52:44


or if he sent them to any other recipient who cared about their origin.  or if any such party managed to link the tainted address to any of his other addresses.


sure.  bisq has a pretty low limit on transaction sizes, so depending upon the amounts in question, it might not be a suitable alternative.  not to mention the fact that he could lose any amount that got frozen by an exchange.
it's naïve to say that the OP has no cause for concern, we don't have enough information.

i think he knows what year it is.  the headline is "Bitcoin's First $1,000 Weekend Since 2017."  i think he's contradicting that by saying that we had a $1,000 weekend in April 2018.  that said, i can't find it.  i see a big green candle on thursday 12/04/18.  and a couple of weekends in the green, but i don't see a $1,000 weekend.

they wanted to rewind the blockchain to make it as if the theft had never happened.  this kind of thing has been done before on centrally controlled alts.  it's not possible with bitcoin, at least not without completely compromising the protocol.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:44:54
what happens if you use bisq on a compromised machine?
with electrum you can keep your keys on an airgapped machine.  you have the watching wallet on the online machine.  you sign transactions offline, and it would be difficult for a hacker to steal your coins.
with bisq your wallet's seed phrase is there to see in the application on the online machine.  if your machine is compromised then the hacker could easily steal your coins.
any way around that?
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:33:54
this sub is infested with anti-bitcoin shills who spread FUD and engage in concern trolling.  so people are suspicious.  but i think if someone were to raise a valid criticism of bitcoin supported by coherent arguments then people would respond positively.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:40:11




the two of you are confused by the distinction between a paper wallet and cold storage.
a [paper wallet]( comprises a single key that is written (or printed) on paper.
[cold storage]( refers to the case where a wallet is stored on medium that is not accessible online.  one example of cold storage would be a wallet seed stored offline and this *would not* suffer from the lack of randomness incorrectly mentioned above by u/AlistairMann.

well done for informing yourself.  one common point of confusion, people mistake paper wallets for cold storage.
a paper wallet comprises a raw key managed by you outside of software.  these are dangerous and should never be used.
cold storage means storing your keys offline which is definitely appropriate in your case.  one example of cold storage would be generating a wallet using an application such as electrum, then writing the seed on paper, then uninstalling electrum.  this is not the same thing as a paper wallet and this is a point where many people get confused.  the seed can be re-entered later into electrum (or other wallet software) to recreate a software wallet.  the defining characteristic of cold storage is not the piece of paper, it's the fact that the keys are stored offline.  that said, in the example above, it would be better to engrave the seed onto stainless steel rather than write it on a piece of paper.  also, please research the distinction between seeds and keys, if that is not already clear to you.
sorry for the ramble.  on to your specific points.  based on what you say, to me it seems absolutely sensible for you to get a hardware wallet (a ledger or trezor) and to transfer your bitcoin to that device, for long term cold storage.  the hardware wallet will generate for you a seed which you must store separately and safely.  if you lose the hardware wallet, then you can recover your bitcoin by creating an identical replacement wallet (hardware or software) from the seed.
i have never owned a hardware wallet, so i leave it to others to explain the specifics of that.  but don't be daunted, their use is absolutely straightforward and you can definitely work it out.  in brief, you acquire the hardware wallet, take a backup of the seed, then use the hardware wallet to generate a public key to which you transfer the bitcoin from the exchange.  use a new address for each input.  make sure you purchase the hardware wallet direct from the vendor, to reduce the risk of it being tampered with in transit.


any wallet, hardware or software, will generate a seed, which can then be used to generate a deterministic series of public/private key pairs.


your hardware wallet generates a series of public addresses.  for each transfer, you go on to the exchange and send the bitcoin to an address on your hardware wallet.


those two terms are not strictly synonymous, and the term "wallet" is itself somewhat vague.
for your purposes, you could think of the hardware wallet as your wallet, and of course the device itself serves as storage, with the seed as a backup in case the device is lost.

and i was responding to that.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:22:10
i think the same.  the day it hits 100K, everyone will freak out at the fact that it could possibly get that high, and it will drop.  then some time later it will consolidate solidly above 100K.  don't want to predict when that all might happen though.
if it ever settles comfortably above 100K, i'll sell some.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:06:06
