The same people hedging in the futures market have been playing the spot market for a very long time. The Cboe Jan contract was perfectly timed to close below $12500. Initially, they set up sell walls to defend it and then nuked the order books to punch the price below $10k hours before contract closure.

The USDT discount on Kraken can theoretically be used to add/remove a premium on non-US BTC price. But I doubt there's a global shortage of Dollars to fill that order book. instead, it looks like a precursor to a USDT premium to keep BTC prices low.

No, the size of the transaction depends on the number of input and output addresses. In practical terms, an exchange paying out to multiple addresses in a single transaction would be saddled with a larger tx size. You can send as much BTC as you want without any worry.

The [grey band]( is where your tx is sitting at. If it does not clear within 14 days it will automatically be sent back to your wallet with no charge. 
I know its frustrating but the only solution is to educate yourself and understand the merits of the system. At this point, instant tx are not the reason why people advocate for Bitcoin. And if you still leave, know that the community will be weaker for it.

In the event that it isn't confirmed, it will return to your wallet in 2 weeks. A peek at the [grey band]( shows you that you're not alone. All of these are 100sats/B+ unconfirmed tx and very near the top of the pile for miners to pick up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:59:01
If you don't run your own node, check public node stats like [satoshi.info]( for the minimum mempool transaction fee (currently at 40sat/B). i.e. the tx will be booted only if it has less than 40sat/B as fee.
Even if your fee was lower (I have been trying to push a 5sat/B tx for a while now :P), you'll still have it rebroadcast every couple days from nodes that had a lower mempool tx fee. Remember, each node has a different RAM capacity to store unconfirmed transactions!

I am hoping we will transition peacefully into a market for security solutions that's
1. Not a geographical monopoly
2. Allows for the changing reality of internal and external security to be priced and packaged as a product. 
3. Allows traditional nation-state "protection" responsibilities to be divorced from electoral politics. 
Legally allowing private actors in law enforcement would diversify choice for the consumer and more efficiently provide the day to day protection from crime while would also contribute to the security between larger nation-states with the same model (either directly or priced into a global market)
I can't really find too many reasons why the model can't work as well as civil dispute resolution bodies which have a diversified product range distributed through a colourfull range of legally endorsed private institutions.

The [network protocol]( is well defined and there is a very literal consensus on how value is transmitted across the network. What you want to know is how other payment networks &amp; stores of value compare to bitcoin. Ironically those networks are not as well defined, prone to intervention and purposely obfuscated which make it hard to measure their relative worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:20


You don't really need to vote every 4 years on whether rape, murder arson and kidnapping is legally defensible. 
A private law enforcement market based on these fundamental protections gives a private citizen regardless of race, gender, political affiliation or religion access the same security services and outcomes that the wealthy minority enjoy. In this scenario, even if your private security service fails you, the market will have competitors willing to close the gap. In every way possible, having a competitive market gives back power to the consumer. 
I think somewhere down the line, we forget that we are geographically locked into our security provider. A Japanese citizen has limited access to the American security complex, even wealthy Japanese. This creates an imbalance in outcomes and encourages whoever runs the current administration in your country, to deny or provide security and determine the level of threat on your behalf. All this should be priced into a fluid market.


To prepare for a civil dispute, I can have my firm insured, access Judicial remedy, approach appellate bodies for arbitration, trade councils for private arbitrage, media, and public relations firms to market my position on the dispute and a number of lobby groups to leverage my financial status to legally enforce my position.
If I think there's a threat to my life, I have much fewer options - mainly government authorities and private security. One of these can't even arrest my attacker. And both are overpriced.

This is just an inefficient protection racket. 
The crux of the signal to noise argument follows that we the non-economists would like to enjoy the token of trust which comes from a trustless predictable monetary system and are comfortable knowing the world it creates may be chaotic and constantly fluctuating. 
This may not necessarily be Bitcoin as you have pointed out. But even the protection racket should benefit by coopting the principles of Bitcoin.

The RBI issued a [fresh circular]( on 6th June which is a carbon copy of the one released in April. In each of these circulars, the RBI gives banks 3 months to cut ties with crypto exchanges. However since this is matter is being fought in court, the 3 month extension circular might just be given out in perpetuity.

BCH is in a downward spiral of hash power. Without tx to back it up, the 8MB experiment is slowly losing steam and investors are going back to the original flavour.

Large scale miner's will dump just to put inefficient miners out of business. Those who will take on debt to stay afloat do not contribute to the spot price. If a miner @ 6k uses debt as a discount on the spot price, the leveraged futures also is a method to distort current prices. So OP is right when he says cost of mining is not a floor.

Works perfectly but cost of mining is tied tightly to difficulty and eventually, you will run into a supply problem on the spot market. So you would need a derivative product for hashpower that you can independently trade.

You would need a large pool as a counterparty. Maybe right now they could simply stripmine BCH when you short hashpower. The objective is to keep all pool mining equipment online and price in for any time BTCUSD is shorted. ie You buy hashpower directly without letting it affect BTC price. The haspower can be stored in USD or BTC wthout affecting the price of BTC/USD and you can keep shorting the original instrument much longer.

It's tough to move USD outside the country in the kind of volumes that would make it cheap and efficient as a crypto. Even on Bfx the shopfront has USD pairings but we know they provide liquidity through Tether. IMO you will be exchanging your Dollars for tether right up front at the deposit, even if they don't mention it. Tether will just become an accounting system for internal $ movement.

Please note that theoretically USD prices for BTC should exponentially increase, especially in an era of Global QE.
So the decimal has to constantly keep moving as the years progress. In practical terms, unlike the current inflationary system, as time passes things get cheaper instead of dearer. Scale and efficiency work out the middle man and improving quality of life gradually becomes easier.

Bitcoin supply is predictable and mathematically derived. This creates volatility in the price. Traditional fiat currencies would inflate or deflate supply/interest rates to keep the price stable.
