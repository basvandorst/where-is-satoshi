Not indefinitely. Dropbox keeps a copy of deleted files in a special folder inside your dropbox folder. You can even delete it yourself if you want.

OP you're totally doing it wrong.
The question "are brain wallets safe?" isn't about given an address finding the passphrase. Obviously it's very easy to make this problem arbitrarily difficult.
The issue is: "given all the passphrases I have in my database, does the corresponding address belong to some poor idiot who put his money there?" If so, I just "cracked" something.
These are two fundamentally different questions, probabilistically speaking. The Afrikaans guy didn't get hacked because some guy decided to hack his address! No, he had a humongous database of addresses and their respective passphrase which he build by indexing mankind's literature apparently, and the Afrikaans guy was unlucky enough to put his money there.

Exactly. And that distrust is fighting the fact that fractional reserve is more efficient at allocating resources (I mean, it's easy to see that having money sitting in the bank can't be very efficient.) And guess who's winning.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:11:19
I think you missed his point.
Whether the trading is done on-chain or off-chain is a mere irrelevant technicality. Like you said, 'duh'.
The important point he was making, I think, was that of Who legally owns the assets after the deposit and before the withdrawl? Because I always thought the person doing the deposit owned those assets, whereas he's saying that No, the bank/exchange owns them. I find that very worrying.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:01:44
How do you reliably estimate when you "should have to" go for the cold wallet? If your users ask you for the money, you have to.

The other day I tried creating a serious thread discussing: "does the argument that btc is deflationary have merit?" People tried to argue that wasn't a problem. I think it is, and apparently so do you. I think if it's strongly deflationary, people don't want to spend them. Obviously.

That's one thing that I find mindblowing in this community, that something so basic is still so mysterious. Isn't this something everyone using bitcoins should know about?
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:00:38
That's not an actual argument for bitcoin. People in the past also had lots of delusions that didn't work out and that's not an argument against bitcoin either.
Things should be evaluated based on their own merit, not on stuff like "people in the past also said X wouldn't work out and it did".
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:57:40
I don't think it's all or nothing. I think that bitcoins do have an intrinsic value as a mechanism to send wealth easily. The possibilities that they open that weren't there before are what gives it its value. But of course, nowadays that's not the reason most people are buying, they're buying because the price is going up.

Fuck! Thanks for the heads up. _This_ is precisely the kind of things I was talking about. I've played around with bitcoind, but I've never seen those pregenerated change addresses. I mean, doing
    bitcoind listaccounts
I can list all accounts (lets say I just have the default one) and then doing
    bitcoind getaddressesbyaccount ''
to list all the addresses in the default account, I should see those addresses there, right?

I don't question that bitcoin spending is increasing. I didn't say it wasn't.
What I said is that people only spend when they believe that bitcoin value will increase slowly, or decrease. Never when they believe that bitcoin value will increase very strongly.

So? If you _hadn't_ spent it, you would have 100 coins, and then you could spend 1 btc and get _two_ laptops.
We come back to my point, which is if the thing you're paying with is increasing in value it's better to avoid buying for as long as you can.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:39:31

FTFY. It's a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:54:00
number of bitcoin * number of those bitcoins hadn't moved.
That multiplication increases with
a) number of bitcoins
b) number of days those bitcoins _hadn't_ moved.
_You_ don't seem to understand it.

Btw what would be the safe way to store keys in this scenario?
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:50:20
One of us isn't understanding that article. What they measured is _transactions_ after the creation. Not _expenditure_. So in transactions they're also counting coins that I send between 2 addresses I own. Is that not right?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:35:00
Ah! But bitcoin day _isn't_ (BTC value * BTC age)/time, it's (BTC value * BTC age). There's no /time there. And so one of the factors (BTC age) is counting _not moving_.

Wait I still don't understand. Why would bitstamp's bank refuse to do business with someone on the basis they were involved with bitcoins, if bitstamp itself is involved with bitcoins as well?
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:01:50
All good questions.
Yes, it uses a separate blockchain. I'm not sure who mines it, but bitcoins are easy to come by. Faucets there give you 3btcs and they're worth nothing. I have the feeling that because they're worth nothing, not many people bothers mining, so the number should be increasing very slowly (actually, the faucet it got my 3btcs from was asking for them to be returned once I was 'done with them'). The testnet blockchain is 500mb atm.
EDIT: It's also a fact that sometimes things go wrong and the testnet blockchain is reset (for example, I read that in the past people started hoarding btcs in the testnet and selling them, creating an incentive for more people to mine and hoard, and so they became hard/expensive to obtain, defeating their purpose). This testnet is the third instance.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:39:40
Probably good ones.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:07:03

Ah, I thought you could know more. Thanks!
So, related question. I said that I didn't want an online wallet because I was assuming that the guys who hold my wallet could access my keys. But I seem to be finding that the blockchain can't access my keys. Is that true? How does that work?
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:46:02

@_date: 2014-02-23 02:16:36
Precisely. The value of a currency is in a massive number of people using it. If theres tens of thousands, no single one will have lots of people using it, so they will be all useless. So it _is_ a bad thing.

@_date: 2014-03-09 17:50:27


Obviously, "needing" isn't yes or no, it's how much you need it. If the btc price is going up every day you'll btcs more than you need computers. You'll save btcs and use dollars.
It's amazing how overly simplistic people always are. "the computer economy is deflationary"... yes, but a) computers are a lot more important then buying cofee from that one website that accepts bitcoins and b) the price of stuff measured in bitcoins is going down A LOT FASTER than the price of computers. Again, it's not a yes or no question, so don't give me a yes or no answer.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:25:47

Insider trading is immoral to say the least.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:08:39
Ouch. I think this is actually bad news.
That the bitcoin ~~network~~ community decides to count as important coins _not_ moving I think is a sign of sickness. Real economic activity happens precisely when there's money moving. Sure, if you count _all_ movement you'll be picking up things that are basically people transferring money to themselves, but in a healthy system those should be negligible compared to the transfers which are expenditures.
Maybe it's not a sign of sickness of bitcoin, how just of how immature the community is at the moment. My main point is if bitcoin ever becomes ubiquitous as far as actually buying stuff, no one will be talking about "bitcoin days destroyed".
Anyone care to point out whether this analysis is wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:52:46

@_date: 2014-03-10 02:43:29
Holy shit why is everyone insisting in the use of the word 'destroyed'? I KNOW no coins were destroyed, but that's how it's called. Fuck. 
What I meant was a _bad_ thing was the fact that people are using as a measure of economic activity something that weights coins that don't move often more heavily. But to me that's the opposite of economic activity.

You know what's also associated with buying illegal stuff? Dollars, Euros and Yens. I don't understand why people keep mentioning it, that you can buy illegal stuff with Bitcoins just means they're working correctly: you can buy stuff with them, just like you can with the rest of the currencies.

That is largely irrelevant. The people who bought because it was going up will all going to sell like crazy to the first bump of the road. It happened to be MtGox's lag, but it could've been _anything_ else.

Ouch. I know that's not for me.

You have shitty parents. Dump them.

What happened? Who beat you to the punch? Are you talking about predictious, or...?
What are you working on now, if it's not a secret? :D

I'm the intersection.

Scumbag Bitcoin Community: want's more regulations for traditional financial system, less regulations for bitcoin.

Fork off.

"The" trading platform? MtGox is one of many exchanges.

You sound like a techie of mediocre intelligence.

You still haven't told me how to do the calculation given the data. You just keep writing large amounts of text which as far as I can tell mean just "it's difficult", but you still haven't said anything at all about the calculation itself. If you don't know how just say so, and I'll try asking someone else.

What's a "brain-wallet"?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:51:18
I downvoted because you're not contributing to the discussion.

It's not giving BTC a bad rep, it's giving bad people bad rep.

Regulation = privileges. TIL.

So, imagine that I have a certain currency, and the total amount of stuff that I can buy with that currency is X. Is that your E?
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:54:55
Well? Did you?
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:00:38
We "need"? By definition an exchange is a centralization mechanism of some sort. You're centralizing trading. Maybe you'd like decentralized trading, but that would a) be less efficient and b) not be called an exchange.

I have bad news for you. You're not tech-savvy. Sorry to burst your bubble.

The CFTC can't regulate them, but they can regulate trading for US citizens and/or in the US.

You forgot "spend". I have no moral obligation to _spend_ bitcoins just because someone tells me to.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:19:43
Thanks for the effort, but you must've misundertood my question. I asked how to calculate the value of a currency, not gdp.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:50:01
How's it coming along?
