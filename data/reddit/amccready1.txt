For some further clarification on my intent with this question, compare the real estate market to a pump and dump scheme (as extremes, not comparing BTC to either). House prices tend to be sticky, more so when turnover is high, since almost nobody is willing to sell at a loss, so the price goes up, and sometimes stays flat for years rather than going down. In pump and dump scheme, usually there isn't much real value and the cost base is super low for insiders, so you can end up with a bunch of people who paid almost nothing, rushing for the exits at any given price. If half the current price is still a big percentage return for the biggest holders, that's a big risk factor. If the early holders all sold long ago, there isn't necessarily any additional risk.

IMHO, flat prices are very positive. Every day that goes by where bitcoin maintains its market share and price, is further justifying its place in the world. Keep in mind that the detractors aren't on the sidelines saying that bitcoin should be valued 20% lower. They are saying that bitcoin should be valued at zero. This is an argument between zero and "to the moon", and staying the same continues to prove the case that bitcoin is a store of value.

I got a collection of hyperinflation bills as a reminder of the potentially fleeting value of fiat money. The biggest denomination is the Hungarian Pengo. It’s 10^20, which I think is 100 Quintillion Pengo. It definitely gets a little absurd when they can’t practically print the zeros anymore. It just says 100 million billion.

It's a typo in one of 3 ways. It's not properly punctuated as it's written ($87,00), so it technically must be a typo. It's either supposed to be $87.00, $87,000, or the typo was 1.5 Billion. Obviously, I realize it's meant to be $87,000. I just brought up the typo as a joke.

The coolest thing about this is that it effectively gives access to all Americans as well. The Toronto Stock Exchange is a major one, so it would be accessible from any major brokerage anywhere. 
I’m Canadian and I buy US stocks all the time. The same works in reverse.

The big question is, will we all panic sell in Nov 2020 because we aren't 100% sure if $87,00 was a typo of $87.00 or $87,000? lol

Long term and short term are relative. Gold has been a store of value for 5000 years, and bitcoin is sitting at 10. You could consider 10 years long term, but it's pretty obviously not very long compared to gold.
