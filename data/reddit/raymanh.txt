Great advice. What do you mean by "Bitcoin will soon be able to be shorted"- I understand what shorting is, but what's with the wording 'able to be shorted', is something happening in the future that I'm missing?

Well its already up to 17.5!

A sell wall is when there's a certain price where there are lots of sell orders. So say someone is selling 1000 BTC at $16000, that's a huge sell wall and will take a long time for buyers to 'eat up', and may push the price down or limit it at $16000. It's just buyers vs sellers (demand and supply)

If you select the GDAX exchange on cryptowatch, it should be the same as in GDAX.com

Why would be shorting on the 18th December then (unless you mean you'll be shorting on CME- that's the one on the 18th right?).

Sorry I don't quite what you are going to do. Your going join the CME market and short on there (the obviously buy back) and then sell on other exchanges (GDAX, Bitstamp etc.) as their prices will still be high? I like the idea, profits two ways.

So institutional traders will be buying and shorting on those large exchanges, but all the current exchanges, GDAX, Bitstamp etc should remain free of that right?

Right, so I'm better off changing it to LTC or EHT and sending it that way

Could just be that prices are so volatile now and that reflects in the price difference between exchanges.
I'm guessing there's a correlation between % change in the price of bitcoin and the difference between exchanges

I just opened them up on separate tabs. They are exactly the same, maybe 1 - 2 second lag. Looking at 1 min on each chart.

The price on each exchange reflects the trading price of THAT exchange. There is no 'accurate price', only an average of all BTC exchange prices (which will be lower than GDAX since GDAX is 1K above the others)
