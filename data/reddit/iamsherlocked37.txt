How do you become convinced I am trustworthy? And, since I met you on reddit, how do I know that you are?
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:12:58
I just wanted to buy a little bitcoin as a one or two time thing. I'm not looking to get into the whole market.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:11:47
Upon further investigation, the next time I need BTC immediately, I'm using this for sure. It fits really well with my needs. Since I already went with ebay, I'll just use this next time. Thanks so much!

I don't understand. Are you saying I didn't do any research? Because I was literally up all night doing nothing but. (Well, that, and taking fucking pictures of myself holding my passport).
Also, if you're saying that it's common for people to come here with trouble in just obtaining bitcoin then you are just proving my point. How do you expect this to take off if people can't even buy it? How will it become more valuable? I get that maybe it's fun to mock me or whatever, but you are literally promoting a product that has a value based on other people buying it, and one of the main things people complain about is that they can't buy it. Nicely done.

Ha! Me too. I've got my ebay ones now, and next time I'll just do that. I'm so surprised by some of the responses on here. Mocking me for not being able to get them. Don't they understand that making it easy to get bitcoin is, like, good for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:21:05
Thanks for the reply!! And the tip. I'm, uh, not sure what to do with it, but now I have a reddit changetip account :-). That's awesome of you.
I was only wanting around $100. I did try Celery... I don't remember why that didn't work out. I didn't try Circle. You're right about Bitquick... it looks like a trip to a bank, with cash, would work out. 
 
I guess I just thought I could, at the least, link my bank account any maybe, at a stretch, upload an id (even that thought had not crossed my mind).

I'm just looking to get a couple hundred bucks in bitcoin, not change my entire lifestyle. But thanks.

What is FUD?

Well, the post wasn't really that long. In fact, not much longer than yours. And, in human nature, it's pretty common when people are tired and fed up to want to vent and look for help from other people who might have resources that they don't. 
I did finally get some bitcoin in my wallet. It did take me two days. I understand much more about why the security measures are in place now. I STILL think the cost of admission to this is way too high for the average person. I'm not a genius in any way. My computer skills are well above average, but I can't code or anything. But I'm pretty smart and I can learn pretty easily, and this was one of the more difficult things I've done in a while. And, last year I learned how to perform microsurgery on a rat.
I'm not saying bitcoin is useless or anything. I'm saying that there's one huge flaw that I see. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:09:10
I'm definitely open to suggestions
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:23:20
What's a FUD?
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:57:54
I'm just waiting on Circle to verify me. Photo id and proof of address were required.

My "you guys" comment is directed towards the jointly held philosophy. Here you have an educated and fairly intelligent person, who had no problem educating herself on topics. She walks into the bitcoin world, and for hours upon hours she simply cannot navigate it. From what I've heard in this forum, the ideal would be for bitcoin to be the main currency instead of fiat currency. How does anyone expect that to happen when a college educated person cannot even buy some bitcoins? (Though I did eventually manage to buy some, but not through any of the services that were recommended).
As far as making things better - well, in life you pick your battles.  I wrote this to let this forum of people know, from an outsiders perspective, that bitcoin has a high cost of admission - it's moderately difficult to understand (though that can't be helped and people need to just be educated) and it's close to impossible to navigate. People who want bitcoin to be the main currency or to be more popular should take that into consideration. I guess that IS my way of trying to do something about it.

I'd probably give them advice about the way I had found to make the process easier.
As an example: it used to be, back when journal articles were still mostly on paper, and bit PITA to write a research paper. I worked at the library help desk. I got students complaining a lot about how archaic and unfriendly the system was. Luckily, because I knew the library and had written quite a few research papers myself, I was able to show them shortcuts and tricks to getting things done more quickly.
I also was able to pass their feedback on to the people that mattered. I don't know if anyone here is in the position to do that. But you all own BTC, and I thought you should know what it is like for an outsider coming in.

Ohhh. I've been looking for someone like you for AGES. How do I get into shilling. I mean, obviously I'm no good at figuring that out on my own. I think I'd be great at it though. I'm willing to start at the bottom and work my way up. I already frequent SRD, that's gotta look good, right?
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:37:16
You live in the Netherlands. Don't even talk to me unless you are willing to marry me so I can live there too. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:56:29
Why not?
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:48:30
I'm almost entirely serious. I've been there a dozen times. (My ex was british, so we would go to visit his family, and I would always take a side trip to the Netherlands.) It is so beautiful, and the culture is so amazing. I hate that they won't let us filthy Americans come live there. But, if you wanted to work something out... ;-)
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:39:34
Oh. So, was I not supposed to do that? Or was the call for a mod ironic?
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:45:50
Ah I see. I wonder why they haven't cracked down on it. I remember ages ago, back when Bare Minerals first came out, people were selling "samples" of them. Then that became against the rules, and you don't see it at all anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:04:11
The problem here is that I don't want to leave my house to buy something online. When I buy a vacuum cleaner on Amazon, I don't go put cash in my bank account. I use the money that's already there. Why can't I do that? That baffles the everloving shit out of me. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:05:10
Already have a wallet. That was one of the first things I did.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:48:58
Thanks for that!
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:22:10
Of course. Then let's say I want to buy a rare coin, or gold. I can get those online with my credit card or bank account. I don't have to go somewhere and use cash. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:50:14
Am female, will try. If I have to put in like 10 types of identity verification, or wait 20 minutes for a text message, I don't even know what I was gonna say I was gonna do... I'm so freakin tired and beat down. Bitcoin has won.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:14:42
That is entirely possible. Now that I am seeing other methods (like just dropping cash off at a place and then having BTC in my wallet), I can see where the problems are. I think my biggest frustration was not being able to get a validation email from localbitcoin. I just couldn't understand it. When I put in a ticket, it went to my gmail just fine. /shrug
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:07:30
It looks like LibertyX is like a place where you give cash and get a receipe and then get bitcoin in your wallet? Maybe that's a decent path to take. I just wish there was a way to just do it all online. I'm curious why there isn't.
