LOL, you are a joke dude.  Arguing that food prices aren't increasing is just silly.  Just looking at 3 specific commodities over a very short time horizon proves nothing.  No one is really arguing that food prices are not increasing.  You are just wrong really.

Haha nice, I see you gave up your historical food prices argument.  Switched to "in the future, things will change--you'll see!"  Good call as at least then you can't be disproven right now.  Considering most food commodities are in contango right now, I doubt you are right, but who knows.
Also again commodity prices =/= retail food prices. Retail food prices have many more inputs than just commodity prices.

open and verifiable =/= not rigged.  It definitely is gamed for sure.  And your article is hardly a debunking.  I encourage everyone to look up food prices and think for themselves.
