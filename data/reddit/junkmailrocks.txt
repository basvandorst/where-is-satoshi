Agree with everything except the millionaires of average Joe part.

Was your wallet encrypted with a password? Because if it was, then it was not from the vulnerability.

He should have put a wallet address on his sign.

Yep, me too. Tried it 3 times. Error every time.

Payment failed to send. This can happen due to temporary network connectivity issues or an unexpected server error.

I see your point.

I do not agree that there is no bitcoin brand.

Here is a quote from Roger Ver, the owner of bitcoin.com:
"Bitcoin Cash is not an offshoot of Bitcoin, It's the original Bitcoin with the original functionality restored."

What seems to be happening though is that Roger Ver is taking control of the bitcoin brand.

I see your point.

That’s true. Now that I think about it you usually need to invest a minimum amount to even get shares of a mutual or index fund. That is the benefit of ETFs. There is no minimum requirement for ETFs. In the past, they used to have stock splits. But, that seems to happen less these days. See Amazon for example.

No. But, you can buy mutual/index funds that may include fractions of Apple stock.

Has anyone tried to bring the suit? What about the owner of bitcoin.org?

See 
"Trademarks and FOSS are not incompatible; instead, trademarks are legal tools strongly aligned with FOSS principles. A trademark is an assurance that the recipient of the goods or services is receiving a product of known source and qualities. Controlling how a FOSS project trademark is used protects the community and its software, by preventing use of the trademark in ways that are harmful to the reputation of the community or the software. This isn't a theoretical problem, it happens fairly often.
It may be the case that confusion between two products with similar/identical trademarks isn't intentional wrongdoing, but rather a matter of differing views on a project's direction, sometimes resulting in a fork. But if both forks use the same trademark, users won't be able to distinguish them."

My morning was bad before I clicked that link. Now, I'm completely sick to my stomach.

This guy is a disgusting slime ball. I hope and pray he is alive to see the bitcoin revolution crush his precious bank.

Yeah, I do not understand why experts get so flustered in response to his cypto-hostility. There are numerous counter points to his questions. Maybe the problem is that he simply cuts them off when they start to speak.
