Yeah but most people that think bitcoin is dumb as shit doesn't think the same about cryptocurrency in general.  This is the sentiment I hear from most people that are anti-bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:45:58
Nope just a giant sweaty bag of mayonnaise. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:55:56
So full of shit. I haven't seen them rejected by a single merchant. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:49:19
Pretty common knowledge that they are nothing more than petty criminals looking to con their way into much coin as possible.  This community will continue sucking them off until they have been bleed to death. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:28:23
And by made he means realized. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:41:41
Any dissenting opinions in this sub is met with down votes  A good portion of this sub is beyond fanatical.   It can seriously get pretty scary in here. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:08:06
Thanks for the coin bud. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:37:45
So you don't get labeled a ridiculous hypocrite. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:05:06
I'll take your word for it. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:18:50
Yeah you must have forgot to flip the graph upside down, display in it log format,  and do a sacrificial dance to Andre popopolopolopolos. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:14:50
Say hello to your average human.  These are the people that have to be convinced.  Hope you guys are ready for a long bumpy road. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:12:05
Those people are making money. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:25:52
The fact that you have to ask should tell you how often it happens.   Rarely ever. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:28:12
I'm the guy that supposedly doesn't give a shit yet responds anyway. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:46:28
When people see you coming they cross the street so they don't have to hear you evangelize. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 10:23:56
Have you ever visited earth before? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:13:36
Yeah this sub neeeeeeever sends out vote brigades to influence polls. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:38:04
Nope just have to worry about losing or forgetting the private key.  Having a hard drive shit out on you or various other reasons but sure we can keep pretending bitcoin is perfect. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:26:57
I knew it would draw you manchildren out. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:24:37
At least the trolls acknowledge you. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:26:12
Ask silk road if their funds were seized by the goverment
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:53:42
No Intel is in the business of making money. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:47:47
I find that before  crossing a road I look left and then right. Sometimes I look right first and then left.  What other strategies do you guys have for crossing the road? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:32:14
Sorry I'm not a search engine. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:21:42
Now even with free electricity every miner out there is losing money.  Not sure why that elicits so much excitement. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:09:51
It's always a pain dealing with people stuck in the 1930's.
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:42:17
Sure.  Originality was never a strong suit for you guys. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:00:31
The ones that got in after November and killed themselves. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:58:13
Haha no problem and thanks. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:48:04
I don't see any gorillas in that picture at all.   Misleading title. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:23:56
What effort does mining take outside of setting up a machine and turning it on? 
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:14:01
OK a vast majority isn't 100% and my point still stands. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:50:09
Ahahahahahahahahaha... 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:16:43
Yeah but it's way easier to pretend every got into btc from day 1
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:40:29
So if I were to call the business he bought the coffee from they would tell me that it was purchased with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:16:37
You guys really have a hard on for throwing change at people. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:46:46
Til: Bitcoin can cause a massive break down in musical taste. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:36:06
Check @_date: 2014-05-24 22:48:18
So judging by the topic title you are for bitcoin malware? 
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:16:18
Fuck that kid and fuck his mom's stupid liver. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:05:00
That's a lot of work for 10 dollars. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:01:55
They did years ago when the general public was still ignorant and had no idea that x had stupid pictures on them. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 12:05:38
Hell at least they are entertaining. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:53:15
Coming to this sub for anything other than participating in the circlejerk is a massive waste of time. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:40:51
Yeah you can pay with things using blow jobs as well I don't see any massive queues forming for that. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:18:13
When mentioning the mining aspect try to emphasize that you aren't going to become super rich by using your 1995 Hewlett Packard to mine.  Mention the high entry costs. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:48:20
Has nothing to do with bitcoin, sorry. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:56:25
Hi our local dildo store in Fairbanks Alaska is now accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:14:03
No I know as little as the next person but the way they word it makes it seem more like in-app currencies than crypto. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:16:59
If you aren't selling everything you own and putting it into bitcoin no one wants to hear what you have to say. Put up or shut up. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:48:16
Could you edit some line breaks into that for us?  It sucks trying to read big ol walls of text. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:16:08
As they say you can lead a horse to water... 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:30:34
Unbelievable how far technology has come. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:55:55
I'm no farmer but wouldn't shipping on that be ridiculous? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:19:08
Can you explain why it doesn't matter? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:36:00
I love how the response to getting fucked over is to point fingers elsewhere and cry and not even try to address the issue. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:29:53
Get a job you bum. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:48:42
Ka-ching!  Ka-ching! 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:20:18
Nobody wants to do little shit jobs for insulting amounts of btc. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:39:51
To the surprise of no one but the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:30:30
I would bet North Korea doesn't look on it very fondly. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:45:11
I see a long troubled road ahead for you my friend.   If you would prefer just send me the 100 bucks, I'll kick you in the nuts and then you will have the entire bitcoin experience. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:50:25
They don't know and even if they did they wouldn't care.  Yeah, its the divisibility problems and not the continual geyser of shit news out of the bitcoin world that keep people from buying in. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:29:55
They posted a standard blow off a few times. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:21:11
Relate to the stereotype you mean. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:41:03
Yeah its almost like this entire bitcoin thing is stupid and nothing more than a get rich quick vehicle for a bunch of manchildren
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:39:58
Well TIL
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:05:20
Yeah if my entire family was a gallery of cancer I wouldn't consider myself above sucking a dick to save their life. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:17:14
He and Andreas also agree that food has no intrinsic value.   I think we know where bitcoin Jesus really took his vacation. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:24:49
Says the guy using electronics manufactured with gold. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:33:30
Care to provide any examples and refute them with regards to tulips or do you just plan on just making baseless claims and shitty analogies. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:56:54
Now the lizard men are after you. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:53:24
This is literally the only sub I see where basic Internet usage and security has to be posted multiple times a day. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:13:03
I would pay good money to see a show about this we could call it hell on earth. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:58:38
Shhhh you don't want to scare it off. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:54:46
Because they aren't a failing company that needs a media boost to stay afloat. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:47:58
Ugh he would have had to wake up,  get dressed,  look for the banks phone number,  pick up his phone,  wake it from sleep,  dial each number individually, listen to a robot give him options,  choose an option.  Wait some more,  go to the fridge while waiting because he is thirsty.  Then he will have to talk to someone.   That sounds like a lot of work and with bitcoin all he would have had to do is wave his hands like magic and all his problems would have been gone. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:59:05
You might want to lay off the heroin for awhile. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:25:57
And soon to be first to close. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:53:45
No I'm pretty sure they just like gathering around and watching the autistic spergs living n a delusional fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:27:57
Hopefully we will see a nice run of heat induced brain damage.  If that's the case some more coins should fall off the face of the planet and your coins will go up in price.   Think we can all hope for this outcome.   You so you can get a few bucks me so I can get a few laughs. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:12:56
Yeah so is every virus ever doesn't mean people want it. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:08:18
I don't think any real trolls give a shit tbh. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:03:55
Wow that's so deep. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 02:19:11
Are you just stringing random words together? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:43:19
Even the mods have gone full blown retard in here. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:19:07
And yet you somehow found the need to let everyone know you were the cryptoguuuurl. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:48:14
So when are people going to work on actual problems with bitcoin and not this unimportant bullshit? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:48:07
Let's see.  You have a niche community that has maybe 1/6 the users that World of Warcraft does.   Is he famous..... Hmm I wonder. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:13:30
As long as you ignore everything post Gox price manipulation right? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:24:33
Why do you think they can afford to hold their coins?  Both companies are struggling just to keep their heads above water. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:55:40
I hate the  break it to you but idiots have been on the Internet since the early 90's.  No idea where you got  this idea that the Internet was some glorious techie refuge. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:50:59
Uh, what good news? 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:36:33
So basically deal with bitcoin as you normally would. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:20:16
Well yeah but there is a demand for scat porn as well but I don't see it breaking into the mainstream any time soon. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:10:12
Been in this sub quite awhile already but thanks for the welcome. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:28:29
I don't discuss donations or charity that's pretty tacky bro. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 05:10:14
Did you read it?  IPhone was only recently introduced in China and almost every single one of those switches was from there. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:14:59
Lemonparty.org has a couple of DDoS programs. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:19:44
I don't think any of us expect the media to do actual work, research, or even to go as far as basic fact checking. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:16:13
You won't get many responses most of those people are either dead or took up a new residence in satoshi swamp. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:48:18
Outside of the lamestream media yeah that's exactly what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:51:05
Which still does nothing for it being illegal to ship across state lines. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:35:05
No because gambling generally requires the player to at least have a chance to win. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:13:18
Nah I'm pretty sure Danny is just a human pile of garbage. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:00:58
That's generally what happens when you buy from a struggling company that has years upon years of customer  service complaints. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:41:51
Every retailer in the world isn't going to help if no one is spending or using it though. If every company in the US announced they accepted the euro do you think everyone would just suddenly start switching to that just because it was being accepted? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:39:53
So how much does it cost outside of the US to convert the bitcoin to a usable local currency? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:50:49
Human error in essentially every situation.   Losing the keys,  having them stolen etc. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:23:40
It's already been removed from the sub my job is done 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:12:03
Now go and ask your average person if they give a shit and get back with me. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:58:41
Talk about being tacky as shit. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:14:01
I'm the idiot that thinks you can get high off seeds. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:37:05
I love when two retard delusional communities get in a slap fight. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:00:09
If this is the best leader we have we are in deep deep shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:22:04
I find it suspect how he claimed everything was fine at Gox all the way until the end as well.   He seems to have his finger in a lot of suspect pies or he is just completely incompetent. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:49:51
It's only seeds. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:58:30
So basically one of those eBay brick and mortars... but with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:29:13
Of course it would be good for bitcoin.  Would it be good for Newegg?  Doubt it. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:34:47
Food u dislike 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:12:53
Google actually makes shit and offers services. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:03:12
TL:DR  Go sign your petition I don't really give a shit.  Whatever makes you feel better. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:17:18
Wasn't Aurora considered dead in the first few hours of release? 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:24:49
It's a box of ammunition isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:15:00
Oh its in the wiki and someone will totally solve that problem in the future so around here we just go ahead and check that box and count it as solved. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:59:24
That's some great examples of companies that used bitcoin to get some media exposure and keep their heads above water. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 02:19:39
If it's called The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin then it should accept only bitcoin and show us how much it has risen. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:01:41
We will see who is laughing when everyone but you is riding around in diamond encrusted clothing atop gold plated unicorns. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:10:41
Yeah it sure is... 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:47:13
Oh we are pretending that we are retarded.  OK should have let me know at the start I would have played along. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:33:24
And yet again this gets reposted and no one reads the article. It gets funnier every time. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:03:23
Well that's obviously a lie it's to get more attention for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:06:20
I just like seeing you type up paragraphs in a frothing rage for virtually no effort invested. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:24:44
Most likely a one time pity deal. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:34:40
What I want doesn't matter but for bitcoin to have any hope at all of becoming something more than a tiny niche market it will require regulation.  That and getting as far away as possible from the libertarians. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:30:56
Well that was painful. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:35:39
That's almost as much as the red cross did in 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:24:51
Funny enough it would help the 1st world white male even more.   We can read between the lines. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:09:42
They could already gone  straight digital if they were stupid and hate money.   So what exactly is bitcoin supposed to be doing to ensure this amazing transition to a digital only? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:49:01
Lol no
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:22:31
Nope outside of doing sha256 hashes all that equipment Is useless garbage destined for the junk heap months after they are released. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:57:46
Not really, anything even slightly negative about bitcoin true or not is met with down votes and fanaticism. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 11:29:17
You act like creating a bot takes any effort. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 07:30:41
Satoshi swamp living up to it's name... 
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:46:35
This will be ultimately be useless as everything is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:07:39
Now this sub is even labeling itself a troll community.  It just gets better and better. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:49:42
With stupid fucking topics like this I don't know what else you could possibly expect. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:29:49
They don't care they watch for the game not for the ads. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:20:53
Don't worry there are other way more dedicated groups that can get more accomplished than starting a wiki.   Think bitcoiners can sit this one out as always. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:49:13
What does that have to do with anything?  
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:42:44
Would Charlie Shrem be considered losing? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:29:28
Why when i can just steal it with virtually no effort. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:43:23
Shhh don't ruin the circlejerk with things like reality and fact. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:20:43
Its not that people are anti-bitcoin its that the general population hates douchebag cultists.
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:39:02
Nah I never claimed to be anything special I just know a bunch of shit bags when I see them. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:27:24
Publix also has this in a few of their stores. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:18:17
So what makes this criminal worse than any of the others already on the board? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:08:36
They bought buttcoin.org just to change the reviews making fun of their shitty hardware so this really doesn't come as a surprise. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:42:33
Fuck if I know it's been nearly 2 decades. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:33:18
You are belittling them by suggesting the only thing holding people back from bitcoin is in how it is denominated and not the other stupid shit associated with it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:14:54
Please tell me more about Satoshi.  I would like to know more about him besides the fact that he came up with the bitcoin protocol. I tend to want to know more about a person than a one sentence blurb before I start claiming more people should be like them. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:39:36
Yes please attempt this I could use the laughs. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:35:47
To the surprise of no one but I'm gonna have to make this a macro at this rate
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:08:49
Well there wasn't much said about the charity so I guess I was confused. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:22:31
Here comes the he revisionist history of e-mail again. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:47:23
Well it's almost guaranteed you would bring in more money just by bringing the charity to other people's attention.   Not sure how getting them to accept bitcoin and then receiving a couple of donations for the time it stays on the front page is helpful at all. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:23:38
Yeah your one of the lucky few that lives within 100 miles of a business that accepts bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:00:08
I don't think you know what half of those words even mean. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:46:45
But see those ten percenters that have such shitty credit they couldn't get a library card now have a new option in bitcoin to be irresponsible with their finances 
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:28:03
Question in the headline? Oh that one is easy.  No. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:58:58
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:03:33
Good thing one of the big selling points of  bitcoin is the public ledger. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:08:08
Someone contact CPS please. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:11:18
Just use coinbase or whatever.  It's already their main business. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:37:14
With all the urgency they are putting forth to fix this issue it's obvious that their bitcoin side of business is booming
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:51:25
Thanks for the money bud.

Yeah I'm an obese neckbeard that likes my little pony and animes.  I've also never been laid.  I'm unemployed and live in my mom's basement.   Does that cover it all?  Man you guys pegged me from a mile away.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:23:12
There needs to be a reason for average people to use it.  Being able to send money to Zimbabwe isn't a real motivator for average people.  Neither is the whole fuck banks let's go decentralized.  People just want something easy the  spend.   All the other bs is exactly that,  bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:54:52
Jesus Christ are you still here?  Pretty funny coming from the guy lecturing me about argueing with teenagers on Hypocrite much? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:18:41
So basically a massive waste of time unless you  find another sucker to  buy out your contract.  Got it.

Mining requires a major investment to even come close to the realm of feasibility.  What do the people who can't afford that investment do? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:54:30
Could have fooled me.  New was pretty much nothing but people crying about how others should be buying more coins to raise the price back up. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:00:25
No this community is just that shitty. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:15:20
They like to pretend it is even though  it's becoming more and more centralized every day. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 20:57:34
I happen to like the name. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:41:17

Fuck you got mine is the go-to bitcoin policy.

Guns and gold is generally considered to be a punchline to a joke not a mainstream lifestyle.

How man tightens did you realize along with those loosens? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:21:26
What makes you say that?  It's been nothing but a revolving door of criminals from day one.  Nothing has changed. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:37:45
Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about your lack of reading comprehension.   My mistake,  seems that instead of a woman that tries to fish for updates with her gender you are just an assuming foul mouthed twat.

What a waste of perfectly good electronics. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:37:26
Pretty sure that will happen with the extinction of mankind and not Internet tokens. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:11:47
This sub is like 99% idea guys how is this any different from the previous 50000 idea threads. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 04:25:48
Thanks for the coin, bud. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:44:21
Yep if you want to get down to the nitty gritty you could technically run the entire network off of a Nintendo. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:24:22
Why not it's the bitcoin way. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:52:32
Yeah its called the superbowl

I'd like to know as well but he chose to not give examples of how he was wrong.

Physically yes. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:34:44
Bitcoin is used as a get rich quick scheme by 99% of it's user base.  How are they gonna be the new 1% if they are spending as opposed to hoarding.? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:21:14
Well I hope he also brings employees and a business with him. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:17:47
Lol no you fucking idiot it takes less work to steal bitcoin than it does usd.  Hell bitcoiners are practically begging you to steal from them just go take a look at all the ponzis running on bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:05:44
Even if they understood then you have the problem of trying to get them to give a shit. Which is where the real problem lies. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:56:17
I couldn't give two shits what they call it. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:54:37
I've literally never heard any person ever say anything remotely like that. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:23:56
He wants Gorbachev to tip everyone a few pennies worth of bitcoin or something and then everybody will want to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:17:36
A fool and his bitcoin are soon parted.

The self-assurance is strong with this one.

If Thermos can be a mod I would say you have a pretty good chance
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:20:31
No that's only if you are stupid. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:53:31
How much more efficient are these chips supposed to be? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:23:51
Yeah trying to leech off others work and success is the bitcoin way but this community couldn't fund a gumball machine. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:15:30
An all time high for laughs, yes. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:16:00

It never was.

Lol but they already do that. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:17:44
Because a Libertarian has never stolen anything right? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:00:05
They believe in profits they don't give a shit what the delivery method is.

If there was ever a group that had in depth knowledge of what attorneys you should use it would be those guys. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:29:35
I just need it funny that you think its based on jealousy or being butthurt.   It's really like it's too much for you people to realize that everyone just want to gather around and watch the idiots.  This forum is unintentionally hilarious and it's participants are clueless and delusional. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:00:07
Since when is a wiki considered a valid source for anything? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:34:40
You people seem to never understand that it's more about how God awful this community is.  This community is like a magnet for the scummiest ,  shittiest bunch  of people you could ever hope to not meet in person. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:14:34
Building them is the easy part.  Maintaining them is a different beast. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:45:15
Hmm.  Nope still in Seems like the standard type of post. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:48:03
It dropped off the front page quite awhile ago.  Without constant exposure donations tend to dry up pretty quick around here. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:32:01
That is one creepy motherfucker. I wouldn't sleep in the same room as him tbqh.  Seriously that look just screams 'I'm about to diddle your butthole' 
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:16:58
I think now I'm just going to come harder.  I'll dedicate all future trolls just for you. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:39:56
Maybe you guys should be more concerned with actual problems bitcoin has as opposed to getting in autistic sperg fights over nomenclature. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:56:54
If they had coin in Gox then yes I am smarter than them.  There is no arguing this sorry.   Now how else do you plan on steering the conversation away from where it began?  I can also say with confidence I was never convicted of a felony like your Lord and Savior Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:57:11
Have you tried Craigslist?  There are plenty of people on there that will pay for oral services.  It shouldn't be too difficult for you and if you aren't above begging I don't see why  you would be above sucking a dick if you need the money that bad. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:12:18
You might want to look up that word because I'm pretty sure you have no idea what it means. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:13:56
I don't know if you have been paying attention at all but they are going to need a lot more than just an owner. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:38:56
You would probably get a better response by telling these guys that it will make their bitcoin rise in price.  Coming in here talking about charity will get you at best a little more than nothing. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:07:03
I'm pretty sure it's referring to shit like Farmville tokens and other stupid in game currencies and not cryptocurrencies or Apple coins. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:04:46
Convenient excuse for people who have no intentions of donating anything. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:15:50
Oh whatever you do please don't ban the criminal consortium known as the bitcoin foundation. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:35:53
Sorry I wasted your time I'll let you get back to your mega fortune. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:19:11
I don't have to. The overwhelming majority of the public already does that. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:02:34
Did you come up with that one on your own or did you need help? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:35:53
Nope I remember those being for lame asses and everyone else using alta Vista. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:25:49
Are you kidding me? You can barely hear anything outside of everyone chanting moon in here. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:25:41
Are other foundations also rife with criminals? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:27:53
That's not a fact that's paranoid schizophrenia. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:25:06
Another ideas guy.   Not even an original one at that. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 12:38:11
So you have no real retort? It literally exists right now for stupid bullshit posts. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:41:12
I do ignore them.  Or are you telling me I shouldn't answer the ops question. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:24:33
I don't think it's too far of a stretch to assume that the bitcoin foundation knew what was going on and and most likely profited themselves. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:28:40
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:20:11
Not a single fucking person outside of the media said that and i'm guessing you're at best 15 years old.  Because no one that was around would say anything remotely close to that.  This sub has a pretty retarded revisionist view on history between this and saying that e-mail was some super complicated thing that no one understood. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:51:59
Unfortunately a fast Internet connection doesn't waste enough electricity. Sorry. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:43:14
That's big bucks here in @_date: 2014-04-06 12:32:37
Yeah I guess they could pull in whoever off the street it worked out pretty well he first time right? 
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:22:27
No I mean your going to die in a few years... Like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:57:32
So what is it like repeatedly sticking your dick in the blender? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:23:33
I feel so bad for those customer service reps there's nothing worse than pretending you give a shit what a customer has to say. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:50:58
Jesus is imaginary.  His return isn't happening and bitcoin isn't surpassing PayPal this year either. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:29:18
I don't understand why this sub can't be used as Craigslist. Come on people just buy those shitty miners that will never see a ROI. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:31:26
No and thanks for the coin bud. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:40:27
Nah pretty sure they just like picking on the stupid kids. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:28:00

What reddit fees are you speaking of? 
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:56:45
They could try destroying their PC or Mac as well.  Entertainment is entertainment. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:22:52
There sure is a lot of desperate pleas for everyone else to buy more bitcoin today.  This sub is currently staying afloat on a sea of tears. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:04:47
Perfect for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:55:12
Nope but advocating slavery and child prostitution is.  The word games you psychopaths try to play is always hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:45:13
There are already grocery stores that do this.   You  scan the food as you shop. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:37:55
An old used dildo could be a valid replacement for the foundation. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:01:10
Lawyer fees are a great place to spend the tenths of a percent, if any, in transaction fees they save using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:55:24
Better chance of hell freezing over.

@_date: 2014-03-30 23:30:49
Yeah you can view a cached copy of the original article still.

Didn't realize stealing electricity and CPU processing time for personal gain was what university computers were for. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:54:25
Obviously no because you aren't losing money. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:17:33
All of that still exists... 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:06:28
Well he better hurry because the media is starting to care less and less and accepting bitcoin  isn't getting many people free advertising any more. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:11:42
Well that's just one of the many,  many reasons why the Xbone is a joke. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 08:43:59
Pretty much everyone outside of this sub that is observing.

@_date: 2014-04-07 00:37:41
They could beat it out of you as well. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:59:55
Yeah you all should have invested in Neo &amp; Bee.  Poptarts knows what he is talking about. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:37:12
I love you. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:45:37
Oh boy another ideas guy.  We definitely don't have enough of those around here. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:36:35

If it worked for the Patriot act and two wars why not for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:36:50
Nope it always has something to do with criminal activity. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:32:53
Free publicity.  The only reason anything is attempted with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:42:32
Sure we can dress him up and prance him around like a pony and everything. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:52:59

@_date: 2014-06-03 08:41:08

Bitcoin never took off as a currency so it's impossible for it to end. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:30:29
The problem is that 99% of the questions people ask could easily be found by entering their question into Google search. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:37:23
Yeah I'm willing to bet they are editing the ever loving fuck out of it to try and give it a positive spin. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:10:23
Few hundred more of these and you can get a few items off the McDonald's value menu.

What sub do you think you are in?  That's all 99% of the people here give a shit about. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:12:35
The difference is that super computers can do quite a bit more than hash. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:57:34
I feel the same way about people that don't know the difference between two, to and too. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:27:23
Yeah I'm sure Apple has dire concerns about a sinking company in a dying industry. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:12:56
Yeah... No idea. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:32:18
It would be funny to see anyone do it. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:11:59
Except it will be pretty obvious when they see where all the traffic is coming from. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:44:16
I was gonna have some fun in here but you got me to literally lol. Good luck with your project.  I'm out. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:09:10
Making popcorn. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:34:47
The fact that no business of note holds bitcoin instead of instantly converting to USD. Mainly because they want to make money. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:51:39
Nope I'm 100% it's on you. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:35:30
Doesn't hurt BFL's profit margins
@_date: 2014-04-13 10:55:17
Thanks for the coin bud. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 01:48:21
You can still do that.  There's never a shortage of bitcoiners ready to willingly give you their coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:44:37
You generally have to be innocent to take that route. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:51:35
I'm not sure if there is a site that rates brick and mortar btc shops as well but those could be rolled into your idea as well.  Also I love a good customer service horror story I would love to hear yours. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:30:55
I would tell you that you are pretty fucking retarded if you really believe that. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:21:17
I'm a member of all subs. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:10:55
Maybe if you weren't such a lazy ass you would have read the forum rules and noted that begging isn't allowed here.

@_date: 2014-06-08 12:44:54
Another business taking bitcoin and exchanging for fiat immediately you mean. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:56:50
I tend to take anything that comes out of Rogers mouth with a grain of salt especially after those awful Gox videos with him reading off a teleprompter. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:19:48
Everything is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:28:10
My favorite part is how he was pro-bitcoin this whole time and this shitty community turned him off of it finally.  You guys do a better job of fucking yourselves over than any troll could ever hope. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:21:25
Yes I'm sure the units of measurement used is the deciding factor as to why people don't use bitcoin as opposed to the other multitudes of issues. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:10:51
Boy oh boy is your landlord going to have an amazing surprise for you. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:32:26
Nah it will just go by unnoticed and no one will give a shit. Just like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:31:54
Boredom at work motivates me.   We're you expecting some nsa/banker conspiracy to bring about the downfall of bitcoin from within @_date: 2014-04-12 21:11:22
This exact post has been submitted literally every day the last 5 months. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:23:25
Because they will see the voting was obviously tampered with and they will either adjust the results accordingly or just remove it entirely.  Just ask Fox News about that technique they use it pretty often. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:52:01
It probably hasn't even be rolled out yet the important part of what he was saying was the  part about having legit backing as opposed to the consortium of criminals that overwhelmingly plague the crypto scene.   Most people don't care what they are spending they just want to be able to use and spend with  confidence
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:10:01
Nope we already know this is all the doing of Manbearpig. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:10:59
Pretty sure dust doesn't retain any memories. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:33:16
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:14:39
So basically throw money at the problem or sit on your thumb.  OK. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:31:25
This is a time to buy is the new I'm not fat I'm big boned. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:40:09
Whatever makes you feel better about being wrong.  
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:17:56
Stupid people are going to get infected regardless. What OS you use really doesn't make a difference. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:21:20
People actually buy the stupid shit in those magazines? 
@_date: 2014-05-25 01:16:05
Some people just like paying a premium for the opportunity to be robbed, murdered and raped. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:05:10
You don't have to eat a turd sandwich to  know that it tastes like shit.   Why does it matter if they have used it or not? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:52:54
Scams involving bitcoin?  Why I never! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:32:37
That's the thing.  It isn't their customers spamming them and asking for it, it's you trying to encourage this circlejerk sub to lie and over represent just to pump your investment. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:12:24
Yeah they don't even have light bulbs but it's definitely mining equipment they need. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:19:41
Um... They are.  What do you think they use to manufacture electronics. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:12:27
Dunning-krugerrands was already coined and is a perfect fit. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:34:24
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:47:07
Email these businesses and ask them why they are accepting it I imagine you won't hear any answer even similar to that. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:04:15
No that's just one of the common lies told to people to try and get them to buy in. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:10:03
You  didn't coin anything. That's just standard caveman philosophy. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:03:27
What's funny is easily you can swap out dogecoin with bitcoin and nothing changes. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:21:46
Hey guys here is a picture of an Asian. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:27:22
I'm president Obama. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:00:39
It wasn't a fluke it was a planned pump and dump. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:48:37
Did you guys sell out of fleshlights pretty early? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:36:49
Talk to pirateat40
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:41:49
So it can't be confirmed or denied that he punches puppies and eats babies in his free time? 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:39:40
It's going to be amazing when this whole thing comes crashing down. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:55:44
In 20never.
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:11:48
An overstatement. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:32:35
Zero importance. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:20:11
My grandma is going to love it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:27:50
So like ticket scalping? 
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:17:33
It's a good thing the mods implemented that useless system to "stop spam". 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:40:48
Remember the  bitcoin pricing rule.  Linear graphs for rising prices and log graphs when it's dropping. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:03:44
Christ dude like 7 times more people play World of Warcraft than use bitcoin and you think it could even compare to Linux? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:16:20
It would end up being like the ol' cocaine on the US bills except in this case every bitcoin would eventually be marked as stolen. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:17:26
I think beggars should be rounded up and put to work in the salt mines. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:51:55
Then stop bugging people about accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:23:15
There was  guy that posted here a few months ago who did exactly that and it lasted only a couple of weeks because he couldn't even make enough to pay for his hosting. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:39:44
Even if he was broke the fractions of a penny people toss around here wouldn't have changed anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:22:23
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:42:27
You would think that but BFL didn't. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:59:09
We all know that it was being explained that it could be scaled down to run with such little computational power.  That it technically can be done. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:51:44
Yeah its pretty hilarious.  The best part is they get pissed that you don't accept the fractions of a penny they throw at you.  The concept of time is money doesn't exist here.  I can see them going down the street throwing shredded pennies at people and getting angry when no one bends over to pick them up. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:14:49
And why exactly couldn't it be replicated? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:27:29
Isn't it just Charlie Sherms sob story.   The fall and fall of Shrem. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:10:11
Your own posts admitted you were getting no business with bitcoin so how are you going to tell us it has advantages when you have been in here begging for traffic from the start. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:13:30
Why would some imaginary man influence me in any way? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:46:28
As a heavy drug user myself claiming that even more than a tiny of a fraction of a percent was people using it for euthanasia drugs is about the  lamest excuse I have ever seen. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:38:00
Yeah we all know the media is full of idiots.   The difference is when you explain the Internet or bitcoin to normal every day people. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:19:27
Thanks for your hard work Sherlock.  is safe from the evil doers again. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:33:10
Coin map is useless anyway.  If you do end up using it you might want to call and verify ahead of time that the business actually takes bitcoin.  Most of it is either spam, online businesses that don't accept it at their brick and mortar or they just don't take btc anymore. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 07:48:58
Might as well mention that mining on your 1998 gateway won't make you rich. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:42:05
Apart,  not in place. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:35:07
Just steal a slogan like most of this community does.   I'll suggest "Bitcoin,  what was in your wallet?" 
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:24:46
Just because the bitcoin foundation and their pals have access to this information doesn't mean we all do. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:26:19
Yeah facts u dislike is my thing. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:44:28
Ah the old special.  Nothing like drawing random lines on a graph and pretending you know what the fuck you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:02:11
I will give you 100 Schrute bucks
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:56:50
Yeah that guy is clueless as to what the blockchain is.  How is that different from 99% of the rest of this sub? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:58:44
Didn't you know that bitcoin ends human greed and suffering,  ends global warming,  and cures aids? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:05:25
By the time 1 gets taken down 10 more would take its place. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:26:23
According to Betteridge's law of headlines,  no. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:29:07
That's just the newest criminal they welcomed into the fold.  There are plenty of others already on board. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:43:47
Didn't take long to shit all over that plan. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:45:53
He is on a 300 baud modem obviously. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:03:19
This community should start with something a bit more obtainable.  Like a birdhouse or maybe a nice floral arrangement. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:37:53
Sure is a lot of bullshit to deal with a vending machine. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:04:54
They removed it because a bitcoin vending machine can't even pay for its own floor space. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:25:26
I don't know why this is so complicated for people in this sub.   You spend your life shitting on and trying to make government benefits vanish and then as soon as you are eligible you hop right on the train with  the people you were previously trying to fuck over is literally a perfect example of a hypocrite.  This sub is amazing.   Practice what you preach... unless you can benefit off of it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:23:45
Pretty  sure this already exists. I can't recall the site but I'm sure someone in here knows it. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:31:26
Yes you must prove your loyalty to the Bitchrist before stepping through  the hallowed doors of @_date: 2014-04-08 10:29:30
Gold was offered first. Lol wtf. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:03:48
No its pretty close to impossible.  There are a shit load of problems with bitcoin but the sha-256 encryption isn't one of them. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:25:24
You might want to invest in some guns and a survival bunker as well. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:32:38
Ah a link to the wonderful tech reporters of the main steam media.  Thanks for proving my point. Saved me the time of looking for examples. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:38:24
I would have just deleted the post but you seem to be as big of an asshat as these guys so I'll just let it ride. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:19:14
Fraud?  Involving bitcoin? No way. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:26:57
Oh also the NSA and the banksters pay me
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:52:56
It's amazing how many people donate to some guy that was mildly inconvienced.  
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:18:54
No he was able to pull out in less than 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:54:09
It's a pretty common up vote fishing comment.   
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:59:19
A coin shop? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:17:34
Betteridge's law says no.   Also the problem is paying them at all not what to pay them in. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:45:42
There's way more than one bad apple. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:19:47
Not reporting pocket change and giving it to the homeless.  What a modern day Robin hood. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:25:35
Hope he is ratting out the rest of his shitty criminal foundation buddies. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:44:36
Yeah,  did you forget that this community decided to just steal the Thai baht symbol. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:45:37
No biggie I enjoy your work.  Gives me a good laugh. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:42:58
New York Time's should fire whoever is in charge of their fonts in the future.

Not so much a game as it is a money pit for the stupid. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:03:40
The first place I remember seeing the Internet in the early 90`s was the public library and you had to get a block of time assigned ahead of time because people were constantly on it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:04:31
You won't get any recent investors posting as most people that got in after November has already killed themselves. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:45:21
Why does every movement on the price chart require some major event to transpire? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:46:16
Yeah that doesn't sound familiar at all. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:35:58
There is no best one.  Download a few different distros put it onto a flash drive or dvd and run it as a live os. You don't have to install anything and can test drive them. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:07:53
I think that's about the biggest insult anyone could have possibly threw his way. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:17:35
Lol that's a big if. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:42:05
I don't recall him placing a bet and if his only crime is not having a crystal ball then a majority of this sub is "two-faced" 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:50:51
Just when you think the current music industry couldn't possibly get even lamer here comes a bitcoiner to somehow make it even worse.

I'll hold them for you.

Heh.  Effort. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:33:19
Pretty sure you are talking to a wall. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:47:19
No its called a gimmick and just looks like a desperate cry for attention.   
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:26:51
He could just do that with Google wallet... Unless his mom is planning on sending money to Zimbabwe or something. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:16:29
Well that's a pretty good way to make people not give a shit about sales. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:23:45
Also people that accept it.  That's kind of the whole intent of this stupid idea. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:59:12
This sub is becoming so fucking pathetic it's approaching unreadable territory. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:39:10
So I was correct it was just butthurt. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:27:04
Welcome to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:03:59
If this shit causes doge to become the go-to tip bot for reddit I don't know if I will laugh or cry. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:37:51
I wish I was joking but that's seriously more than 99.9999% of these guys have ever given to anyone. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:06:18
Only took 8 words to describe it.  I have to admit I am impressed. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:58:59
Then it and bitcoin already have something in common. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:42:31
Some people just never learn. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:02:24
Yup.   Only chance you have of making anything from it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:46:34
Whatever you want to keep telling yourself.  There's nothing I can do with the delusions in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:27:20
Can we get some more phone smashing please?  At this rate you guys are going to run out of brands to use. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:24:34
I think it's the markets continued reaction to the release of the simcity offline patch. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:17:09
Woah everyone don't try to answer all at once.   As you can see from the massive amount of advice you are getting your choices are pretty much nil since most businesses do not accept gift cards as payment. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:30:26
So a software platform that is capable of commiting felonies and being overall shady?  Sounds interesting. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:21:01
You know what else would have been safe in that safe of his?  His wallet. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:32:04
Then a different set of tax laws would apply.  Sorry there isn't going to be some amazing loophole that hasn't been discovered before.  The tax code is pretty comprehensive. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:31:50
Isn't he on the advisory board for Neo &amp;  Bee?  I know for sure he was telling people that everything was fine at Gox right up until it imploded. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:59:32
I remember when it was lemonade stands and the kids would actually squeeze lemons and stuff.   Now it's as simple as dumping a pack of powder into water.  That bitcoin quality. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:22:22
You can't cut funding to bitcoin! You will regret this! 
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:43:34
You seem real interested in homosexual  activity.  
@_date: 2014-04-09 07:00:29
That story sounds really familiar for some reason. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:24:02
What better way to scam others into buying in than outright lying? 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:18:38
No its not new you guys have been drinking the Bitchrist kool-aid for awhile. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 06:11:12
Also the libtards will vote this down the same as they would a thread claiming child prostitution and slavery is bad. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:28:01
Not sure why you are being down voted.  There were many people in this thread warning about Mt Gox and their shady practices for almost a year.  Whenever these things were pointed out it was downvoted to shit by this sub because it was was higher price than the other exchanges.  The people downvoting everything they consider a knock to bitcoin causes so many problems it's almost hilarious
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:41:11
Because they exist only on paper. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:40:54
Sounds like a new guy working. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:26:52
This is the correct answer. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:57:09
No Satoshi swamp has literally been a swamp long before bitcoiners started herding up homeless. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:16:45
No I'm 100% sure you aren't even remotely close to being the first person that has said that. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:35:12
Cool another shitty site to post the same article as the other 30 bitcoin news sites. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:50:32
Best way to make money off that rig would be to try to find some new sucker to buy it off you. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:23:39
The SEC is already investigatng Ver and Voorhees.  Not surprising considering Ver is already a convicted felon.  Let's not for the how the foundation was telling everyone that there was nothing wrong with Gox and everything would be fine right up until it imploded.   But hey whatever no big deal to me it will just be another great day of comedy when the gullible trusting people of this sub get bent over the candy machine yet again just to further the foundations greed. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:04:38
Yeah I guess if we hop in the time machine and head back to 1985. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:19:01
I know when I'm trying to convince people to do something I usually walk down the street throwing handfuls of pennies at them. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:36:26
The Gox price manipulation ended. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:08:51
Maybe they don't have the Internet in Amsterdam. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 23:49:08
So Tulipfutures was right after all.  What a surprise. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:52:15
Basically thermos added one if his goons from the Bitcointalk forums as a mod here and he has been deleting shit he doesn't like especially things that indicate thermos as the shady asshat he is. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:11:44
He fits really well in with the rest of that criminal consortium. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:28:36
No I'm saying just because something is free doesn't mean people want it or even care. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:31:58
Compulsive gambling can be pretty sad at times. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:13:02
Amen brother. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:33:57
That was difficult. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:13:27
As they say there is a sucker born every minute. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:15:20
Well he seems pretty offended about all these wedding bombings and such so renouncing his citizenship seems a small price to pay to avoid all these travesties. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:03:53
This sub also functions similar to a slime mold. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:50:31
If it's such a shitty state of affairs why stay in a country that is supposedly so evil?  Must not be too bad if you remain here. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:53:07
You act as though there aren't people out there that do things just to be an asshole. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:29:21
With such ease of use how has bitcoin not gone mainstream yet? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:25:20
So basically whoever puts in the most money  gets the biggest reward? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:44:57
There is no such thing as an opinion in this sub you either join the circlejerk herd or feel the autistic wrath of @_date: 2014-04-06 00:45:54
And after some quick Google-fu he is indeed on their advisory board.  No wonder he decided to take a "vacation". 
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:12:22
Pretty much all of them. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:15:03
Yeah I'm sure the Chinese are eager to be put to death. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:27:43
Probably because everyone outside of the bitcoin community hates the bitcoin community.  Doge is dumb as hell but at least the community isn't full of douchetard captains of the industry. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 22:17:01
No I was around and you're overstating the difficulty people had. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:26:26
I was born that way.  No extra heat necessary. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:16:15
What,  do you think people that visit here are over the age of ten? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:19:51
I would love to but being at work on a shitty smartphone makes it a pain in the balls to post links. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:21:00
No idea why people in here really think the units of denomination is what is holding back adoption and not the plethora of other real problems.  This place is amazing. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:40:20
The will of the mods you mean.  If  the will of the subscribers was indeed the law of the land then most of the mods would have been thrown out on their ass already
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:50:57
Get a job you spamming asshat. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:00:50
No way.   The crypto i'm currently balls deep into will certainly not fail because reasons. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 01:59:06
Think he is referring to the Bitcointalk forums. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:43:55
Yes but recentley he has also been referred to as btc Jesus in this sub with increasing frequency.  I should have said bitcoin Jesus II
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:23:36
Yeah and so does making a throwaway just to walk through that shitty territory. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:13:26
Well looking at Neo &amp;  Bee and such job titles such as CEO and CFO don't really mean much so why not. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:35:30
Bitcoin literally has one of the worst communities that exists. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:12:20
Why do they need to study it? All they have to do is come in this sub and listen to these ranting lunatics wanting to topple the American government. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:42:37
Please do this and report back. We need some more hilarious stories. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:37:32
OK buddy whatever makes you feel better I'll let you get back to your slaves and child fucking in the name of freedom. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:38:18
I wish he would explain why his skin always looks like it's covered in a thin layer of grease. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:47:24
Not sure what delusion you are referring to I'm just going to stay in my mom's basement and masterbate to Japanese cartoons and continue scamming coins. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:18:41
It's no better here.  A bunch of captains of the industry trying to make a quick buck all the while screaming "to the moon"  in this giant echo chamber.   If you want discussion you aren't going to find much here outside of  giant circlejerk. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:07:31
Christ has a better chance of returning than  ever seeing Bitcoin legit hit 1200.  Hell if it wasn't for the Gox manipulation we would have never seen that number in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:33:15
Welcome to the world of bitcoin.  Mentioning other altcoins around here usually leads to a lynching.  Good luck with this amazing community. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:18:33
The quotation marks in that headline are very important. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:17:13
Then you  should check out the laughs never end there. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:20:48
I know I prefer thousands in lawyer fees as opposed to refunding someone's fleshlight. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:01:40
I would imagine being wildly volatile has something to do with not wanting to fuck with it. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:26:10
Those QR codes look better than some of the tattoos I've seen posted in here. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:29:47
Look man once the delusions start it's hard to get them to stop. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:51:12
Good thing he has a place to go now when the hammer finally drops. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:48:01
I was referring more to the stealing part. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:41:30
Better to flash that nice fancy phone. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:49:03
Just keep sticking money in. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:36:19
And now I see who made the post. Don't I feel like the asshole. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:53:27
At first I thought your name was zings and I thought how appropriate. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:38:13
The goggles. They do nothing. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:29:37
Good point. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:48:00
The biggest, blackest cock. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:56:15
So if the artist drew him as a black guy would that make him African-American? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:27:22
I do.  I hope all of you enjoy being extras from the set of idiocracy
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:48:10
I wouldn't get anything stolen from me because I'm not retarded enough to hand my money over to a company that was an obvious scam for well over a year before their collapse. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:00:29
Why so the nut jobs he is referring to can follow him around and downvote every post he makes? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:01:26
Ask Gox if accountants would have helped them. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:40:58
Seems pretty fucking ridiculous. As if there was anyone out there that isn't considered an autistic sperglord that would actually go through this shit. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:15:52
Emuparadise wishes it was as cool as coolroms. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:22:29
This is the bullshit you will get with any serious issue around here.   Let's sit around and wait for someone else to fix it. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:45:57
Valued and actual worth are two completely different things. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:31:56
You  guys don't even have enough people to take over a single WoW server much less the internet
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:08:48
Exactly what part of this makes him two-faced? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 06:26:17
I had an argument with a guy in this sub the other day and we have actually regressed into the late 80's at this point. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:28:05
Online petitions don't do dick. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:34:45
Is this a serious question? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:13:04
A clue. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 01:56:48
Cashier's check then. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:40:10
I'm the currency you shouldn't spend. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:59:39
Don't worry its rapidly working it's way to the front page. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:23:57
It's been quite awhile. Maybe I should check them out again. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:55:04
Oh boy.  Scripted kickboxing what a blast. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:30:18
Because it was 200 dollars higher than the other exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:36:11
Why is this shit even posted here?  Great news for the nobody in this sub that lives around you. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:38:58
Nobody leaves gold sitting around.  How old are you? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:13:08
Anything that could be construed as a slight against bitcoin gets you labeled as a troll in these forums. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:17:31
Oh its the guy begging to be mod even though it's obvious he couldn't moderate a little girls tea party. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 11:38:32
Lol is this a serious comment? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:38:04
More work than thermos has put in on the forums that's for sure.  You didn't even have thousands of btc donated to you to do it either. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 03:59:23
That's to all 2 of you that live near the area.  Let's keep up the spam though. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:42:01
Oh is it still November 2013?  Holy shit someone get me out of this time bubble. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:41:06
My guess would be a high school freshman. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:35:13
I'm the guy wanting to invest 7 figures and can't spend an hour doing a Google search.   Totally legit. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:02:41
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:06:06
Have you seen the previous replies to those petitions?  Those aren't for getting things changed its for the government to to explain their policies and tell you  that you are wrong. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:38:01
I guess you douchebags now know how it feels when you come into other subs throwing fractions of a penny at people and expect them to be thankful. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:42:24
I don't recall any $10000 coin.  So what part was prophetic? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:25:55
I love how charities are used just to push the bitcoin agenda.   Pretty sad. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:40:11
Wouldn't doubt that for one second. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:23:55
It has amazing anti-bacterial properties. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:26:09
What was it worth when they started accepting donations? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:09:51
Yeah that's literally a hypocrite. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:34:04
A few things but off the top of my head passwords as well as using them to verify you received a correct file. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:31:22
So when November rolls around and nothing  is better are you guys just going to change it to we'll anybody that has been holding 2 years hasn't seen a loss
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:35:18
Dorian should play Satoshi obviously. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:44:23
Quit joking I'm being super cereal. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:27:09
Standard propaganda. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:44:10
I think the problem is you need laid ASAP.  It sounds as if you have a lot of anger and pent up sexual frustration. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:38:31
What the hell are you talking about I didn't switch up anything. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:50:20
I'm not saying it's wrong. Lol
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:22:18
Do you not have a response to him for this topic or are you that desperate  to make him look bad you just c/p an old thread over and over with no real contribution yourself?  Please stop making yourself look stupid. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:38:42
I think your Wow avatars should be displayed and your favorite sports teams,  favorite bands,  and favorite color. Let's try and force the rest of the site to buy into our shitty niche Internet tokens. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:07:32
The Bible thumping hate mongering Republicans are dying off with the baby boomers. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:48:58
It's been there from the beginning. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:35:11
And like most shit posted here its just another scam and another day with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:52:51
I don't mean to come off as harsh either but I've seen it plenty of times in this sub and it pisses me off when charity is used to further bitcoin.   Thanks for updating. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:34:13
Respects users.  Holy shit that's a good one. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:11:32
If by recent you mean something that has been going on and known about for years. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:34:05
So basically don't be a retard and click the first Google ad that pops up. This is basic Internet 101.
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:41:11
Oh right like the last employees of Neo &amp;  Bee that didn't receive paychecks. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:15:59
Well luckily most tips are rarely over a few pennies worth so the fee shouldn't be that big of a deal. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:19:22
It should have read 'this type of post'. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:13:07
Nothing besides their history and past actions. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:13:54
Won't be long until he is using a dictionary to come up with more legit looking usernames. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:50:18
Apparently so because that question gets asked at least 10 times a day in new. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:30:08
I'm not falling for that one officer. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:31:11
Did you order the code red!? 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:29:36
Yeah you don't see that because real investors don't get their advice from a sub full of morons. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:42:22
To the surprise of no one but most of this sub reddit. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:42:58
They have hundreds of times before when they report on this so yes. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:26:14
Yeah that connection is called humor.  It is hilarious watching you monkeys act like you're in the middle of a financial revolution. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:11:14
You can actually make things out of seashells. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:28:13
There is but a long as it contributes to the circlejerk it gets a pass. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:26:41
Santa Claus announced he would no longer be accepting bitcoin donations. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:27:55
OK so Tulipfutures is a professor at a college?   If not your gonna have to be bit more in depth because it's pretty shitty and vague analogy. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:19:29
is the last place you should look
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:41:05
They have traffic. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:12:48
More people grow out of libertarianism by the time they are 25 and don't come back. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 00:50:36
Yeah its just that the easy.  Just tack it on to your already existing system.   No logistics or employee training needed. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 02:29:36
Yeah tipping is already huge around here I've seen tips get almost as high as 18 cents
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:57:43
Yeah looking at their legal history they are indeed in it for a reason. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:48:49
So any thoughts or opinions of your own or just standard buttcoin sperglord butthurt? 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:21:20
I think we can all let out a collective 'no shit'  for that one. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:29:35
Anyone that wants to be technically correct. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:28:34
I'm sure my landlord and the utility companies would have a good laugh if I attempted to pay with gift cards. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 05:56:40
I would argue that it's why most people can't take it seriously.   If you ever want to give something a shitty rep just have the libtards endorse it. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:22:14
If most of you got in under 10  bucks than its almost guaranteed bitcoin is fucked because it isn't seeing any adoption. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:37:41
How dare you suggest that Santa isn't real.  I'm getting real sick of this sub spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:00:58
That's buying with a gift card. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:20:54
Not enough to make up for all the ones already jumping off their sinking ship. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:52:38
I haven't had to show an ID to use a credit card in nearly a decade. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:39:41
Who better to lead the example for this sub other than the person that railed against the government most of her life and then as soon as it was possible for her,  she jumped on that government teat.  
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:41:23
He is so angry that no other sub exists outside of here and doge. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:14:54
No they already have a like button. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:17:25
I'm surprised it isn't in a Ripley's Believe it or Not. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:25:39
Breaking news.  Man realizes he has 20/20 hindsight. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:48:10
Because they like making money? 
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:45:15
I also heard Jesus Christ is returning to earth sometime later this year. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 01:44:27
I doubt you will get many responses as most people that get scammed just write off their losses and exit the bitcoin world completely. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:13:15
So close... 
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:03:54
No I think the standard day to day scamming and overall fuckery does more than enough by itself without any outside assistance 
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:45:09
If yes there would be a good chance I would end up in Satoshi forest after awhile. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:16:08
Oh valid critisism how will bitcoin ever recover? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:35:15
Thanks for the coin bud. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:13:41
I would be surprised if paper is around in any form in 1000 years. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:51:14
A lot of people claim that but they are just making assumptions. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:47:50
I could care less who you are or what you do.  It's always nice to know you won the argument when the other party has nothing to fall back on other than personal attacks to make themselves feel better about themselves. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:29:23
That's been the point the entire time.  A small bit of advertising. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:11:56
Who the fuck keeps their bitcoin on an Xbox?
