No customer funds were lost or ever at risk in ShapeShift hack. Please don't include it in the list of custodial exchanges.

Hey there - there was "accidental" hard fork in DASH earlier today that seems to have caused some issues that we should of cleared up now. If your TX didn't go through yet just send us a support ticket and we will get you sorted out!
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:19:39
We have no hidden fees. The instant rate we provide you before you do your exchange is exactly what you will get, minus the miner fee (and the miner fees are something every exchange must have or transactions will not complete). We have a reserve of coins (which is how we can send funds quickly) and in order to fill those reserves, we utilize various exchanges to find the best prices, then we purchase a certain amount down the spread. The way we make our money is by taking a small percentage from that spread. HOWEVER, the rate we provide you is provided after all of this is done so there are no hidden fees in what we tell you we will send you. If you decide that you don't like the rate we are providing you at that moment, you don't have to do the exchange at that time. Our rates update every 30 seconds.

ShapeShift didn't lose any customer money, because it doesn't hold any deposits. Why is it included in this list? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:11:21
Not to be picky, but isn't the intention of the OP to encourage people not to use exchanges that put their money at risk? Avoiding custodial risk is ShapeShift's entire raison d'être; we built the service as a new way to trade without users risking loss, which is what Bitsquare is working to do as well (and we're big fans of Bitsquare). 
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:39:03
The problem is one of categorization. Instead of just "centralized" vs "decentralized", a more accurate framework is custodial vs non-custodial vs decentralized. On one end, Custodial has counter-party risk, but the latter two do not. On the other end, decentralized has no corporate entity/staff/central server, but the former two do. 
Each of the three have advantages and disadvantages.

@_date: 2016-08-05 01:10:55
Hi Hopeseekr,
There are no ‘unpublished bugs’ relating to the issue you experienced during your exchanges. The wallet you used to make your deposits - Jaxx - is not compatible with our Precise transaction feature as it splits up all deposits into multiple transactions causing your exchange to fail because the system expects one lump sum in one transaction. I’d like to highlight, that while it’s unfortunate that the market moved while waiting for your refund, we responded and had your funds returned to you within 24 hours, during a weekend, when our support staff is limited. We are happy to say your funds were completely and safely returned to you in a timely fashion.
It’s very important to note that it’s inaccurate to call out ShapeShift for having a “bug” when in fact the wallet you were using caused the issue that we then resolved. We have been in discussions with Jaxx about the incompatibilities, and in the meantime ask customers to refrain from using the Precise option when sending deposits to ShapeShift.
And yes, pro-tip for the future, making one ticket per issue makes the resolution happen much faster so there is not multiple conversations going on with potentially numerous agents. Please let us know if you have any more questions about this particular transaction.

Thank you for you kind words ��

A token would not be "denominated" in anything but itself. Someone will have, for example, 100 BFX coin. The price of this coin (measured in dollars or BTC or ETH or whatever) will be based on the market rates as determined on exchanges where people trade BFX coin.

...brought to you by the service that loses $0 in customer money even when hacked. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:48:26
Hello If there is a pending refund for you that hasn't been sent, please open a ticket, or if if we missed your ticket, please send another one and reference the prior one.
At this point those customers that had pending orders when we went offline have been refunded other than several which we are examining for potential fraud. No customer funds have been at risk, please accept our apology if your return got delayed during this hectic week.

Hello. We wanted to reach out to contest this article. No customer funds were at risk. ShapeShift never holds customer funds so no customer is at risk to this issue.

We're not aware of any jurisdictions (except perhaps North Korea and other tyrannical nations) where trading one digital asset for another is illegal. Regarding trust, we've designed ShapeShift to minimize the need for trust. We don't hold customer funds for more than a few moments while the transaction processes. Compare this to a normal exchange site which holds millions of dollars worth of customer money. Consider that it would make zero sense for us to not process transactions. ShapeShift never holds enough money where "running away with it" would be economically rational. Other than that game theory argument, we're honest and professional, and will earn our reputation with time.
The current coins supported are:  Dogecoin, Litecoin, Darkcoin, Blackcoin, Peercoin, Namecoin, &amp; Feathercoin. Expect many more soon.

@_date: 2014-10-20 14:26:27
Because we don't hold user funds for more than a few minutes while the transaction is processing, it is unfeasible for there to be a scenario where it would make sense to run away with money. Compare this with traditional exchanges where there are millions of dollars worth of user deposits stored continually by the website.

Good question. We want to see if any professional artists contact us over the next 48 hours. If there is a great one, we may commit to paying the reward to him/her before they start.  Otherwise, within 48 hours we will edit the OP to let everyone know it's open to the community. At that point, anyone can submit their work and we'll hold a vote with the community later, maybe in a week or so. So if you want to be conservative, wait 48 hrs before starting (or send her portfolio pieces to us and we'll consider her as the exclusive artist)

We agree with your point that order book exchanges aren't going away. They are very important for price discovery.

Hello everyone, ShapeShift here. 
First, we recognize that the "automatically send back to original address" is problematic in some cases. We're working on a solution so the user can specify a return address if he wishes.
The reason it's built the way it is currently, is just for speed and anti-clutter, and ease of use (ie - requiring the least amount of things from the user as possible).  
We just need to add the option in an elegant way, so we'll work on that.
To the OP - we're standing by to help further if Circle is unable to retrieve the funds.
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:26:34
Instead of MintPal, for crypto to crypto, you can try ShapeShift.io which is an instant exchange that doesn't hold user funds (it has no user accounts). So it's not technically decentralized but it removes custodial risk.

Hey all, ShapeShift here.
To be clear, we are not claiming to be a "decentralized service." CoinDesk shouldn't have said that.  We are simply a very easy interface to convert between cryptocurrencies. We remove much of the trust traditionally required for exchange, because we do not hold user funds. When you send your coins to us, we convert and send your new coins back in seconds. Once you try it, you'll probably have a "wow" moment.  We think accounts are superfluous considering the efficiencies brought by Bitcoin, so we made exchange possible now with  no account needed. We're hoping developers find the API very useful as well:

First, BitPay is due serious congratulations and thanks for all their amazing achievements and contributions to Bitcoinland. Thank you sincerely.
However, I have to agree that Tim Byun's comments are unfortunate. Being professional and diplomatic is of course important, but specifically condoning broad swaths of very ugly policies which are antithetical to Bitcoin is bad.
We should not feel the need to suck up to regulators and flatter them. It is unbecoming of an ethical organization trying to improve the world through Bitcoin, and we know BitPay is this. 
So BitPay, while remaining professional, please take care not to succumb to State-worship. You are better than that, and I think we all know that nobody believes Ben Lawsky is "supporting innovation" with the BitLicense proposal.
And again, thank you for kicking ass with everything you do.

Very glad you like it! Our vision is to unify all digital assets, such that they are immediately liquid/convertible into each other. Whatever digital asset you hold, at the click of a button you should be able to switch. We also think leaving money at an exchange is somewhat antiquated (and risky). We just do away with user accounts entirely.

As others have already noted this does not have to do with our particular rate, this is because of the current gap in the bitUSD market : 
Right now ask's are around 240 at the lowest (for sells) and bids are around 206 at the highest (for buys). That is a nearly $35 gap at the moment in the spread of the bitUSD market at the top of each side of the depth chart (and we also have to account for depth in the rate which means we lose a good bit of that price so we can offer a rate with no slippage).
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about this and our rate just reflects the current market reality once we account for depth in the market. If enough market action brings the prices closer again, then our rate will also close as we are just pulling our rate straight from the markets.

We are not a scam, but you don't need to trust us if you're not comfortable. We'll earn our reputation in time. ShapeShift was designed to greatly minimize risk for both us and our customers because we don't hold customer deposits. It would be hard to come up with the calculus under which it would ever make economic sense for us to disappear with a few grand of in-transit funds.

The cost of this project is well into the six figures at this point, not to mention the significant amounts spent on marketing (top banner on coindesk for months, etc). It would be very silly of us to run off with $2000 that happen to be in transit at any given moment.

You should probably expect zero privacy with any service that asks for your name/address/private info.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:38:12
When you say "gains value" you have to be comparing it to something. So if Litecoin gains value in relation to USD, then you have made money in USD terms. If it "gains value" relative to BTC, then you have made money in BTC terms. And you can have a situation where perhaps Litecoin gains relative to USD, but loses relative to BTC... so whether you made money or not in that situation depends on what you're comparing it to.

@_date: 2015-01-30 19:59:24
You are claiming an altcoin like BitUSD or Nubits (which are pegged to the value of a dollar) are "for speculators and nothing more?"  Seems more likely they are a useful alternative digital token and people who may not want to speculate on the volatility of Bitcoin can use them for stability. Other coins have other interesting attributes - don't dismiss every other digital asset just because it isn't Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:04:15
Hi, there. Can you please give me your support ticket number? I would be happy to look and make sure we have responded. Please note, we do not have 24 hours support so we respond to tickets in the order we receive them as soon as our office is back up and running Monday-Friday, 11:30 am EST- 7 pm EST. I would be happy to expedite your issue if it has not already been taken care of. Thanks! ��
Also from what you have said here, it appears you did a specific amount/precise order where you did not send the amount of bitcoin we requested that you send to us in order to receive 4 XCP. Here is an article about how to do these types of exchanges:

If a specific jurisdiction demonstrates that our business model requires a specific license, we would either obtain the license or block that jurisdiction. We are not aware of any jurisdiction under which selling one crypto asset for another (between us and the customer, no 3rd party), requires a license, but of course our counsel watches the legal landscape carefully.

Very few people, after actually completing a Bitcoin transaction, remain cynical. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:09:48
Bitcoin_forever is correct. The specific amount feature will tell you exactly how much bitcoin to send for the amount of XCP you requested. So in this case, it looks like you requested 4 XCP but instead of sending the amount of XCP we asked you to send, you sent 4 BTC. So we completed your request for the 4 XCP but you sent too much and since you did not provide us with a return address, we were not able to return your extra bitcoin back to you. We can fix this easily for you, just let me know what ticket number you have and we will look into it if we have not already.

And this, gentlemen, is why Bitcoin will take over finance. It moves money better.
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:00:58
Okay - coins have been returned to You, here is the tx:
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:55:07
We've designed ShapeShift to minimize risk by never holding customer money on deposit. You only need to trust the site for a few moments while the order is processed. This is far better for security than a deposit model like most exchanges.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:58:44
Let me preface this by saying skepticism in bitcoin is always warranted. People need to be careful and diligent. I'll try to address your concerns...
Transactions with ShapeShift do fail sometimes for technical reasons. We refund them in every instance. You will find nobody claiming otherwise. Certainly you can realize how little revenue is made on every transaction? It's pennies to a couple dollars... that means we'd have to scam tens of thousands of people (or more) to ever even recoup our development and advertising costs. It's an unfeasible scam and would be publicly outed long before we ever made a profit from such a scam.
Further, we think there is nothing wrong with desiring privacy. If nobody knew who we were, and we were holding hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of customer money, then that would certainly be cause for red flags. But we hold no customer money, so I think your concern is understandable but perhaps misplaced.
The exchange rate is simply our rate - just like a store sells products and has a price, we have a price for every good we sell on ShapeShift. Rates are transparent throughout various exchanges, so you can compare our exchange rate with others very easily. We do not "take the exchange rate" from anywhere else - we have our own rate, based on the price at which we're comfortable selling X amount of coin. In that rate is our revenue. There are no added fees of any kind above our posted, public exchange rate. Also consider that our rate has no slippage, which is not true of normal exchanges, so users know exactly what they'll receive. 
The steps we've taken to earn trust is simply this: we process every order on time and refund anything that fails in full. That's really all we can do, and we don't expect people to trust us until we've earned it, so we will continue to do so. And again, we're not holding customer money - we think this is vastly safer way for exchange to work than traditional orderbook exchanges. Hopefully then you can see that ShapeShift's model is an improvement for the industry in terms of security, rather than a danger. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:11:05
Yes, this is correct. If you supply us with a return address when you are doing specific amount transactions, we will return your extra funds to you, but you have to make sure to provide us with that return address. We do recommend making sure you only send us the amount we request, though. Thanks!

The "legitimate" use of ShapeShift is anyone who wants to convert one digital asset into another. ShapeShift is by far the fastest and easiest way to do it. Further, ShapeShift has more direct trading pairs than any other exchange (you can't convert BitShares to Ethereum anywhere in world except ShapeShift, as just one example).

If you use the "Specific Amount" option, the exchange rate is often better than what one can get at a normal exchange. Anyone who is very sensitive to price/rates should use the Specific Amount field on every ShapeShift order.

Yes, please understand that there was a support misunderstanding, which is why we sent the extra LTC. We would never knowingly say anything that was not true about our services. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:12:10
Yes! This is pretty much exactly how we view things.
At ShapeShift we know 0-confirms will never be 100% safe, but we also think that its worth the calculated risk in order to offer users a much better user experience. We have accepted 1000's of 0 confirm TX's through blockcypher + our own auditing system and for 99.9% of those TX's it has worked just fine (including blocking many double spend attempts on the system, of which we get a good number of daily). The few times an attacker gets money out of us by using a new attack vector is just considered the cost of doing business as long as we can learn and quickly patch our system when that happens (exactly how it has occurred in the last 24 hours).
Overall us offering 0 confirms is a small/contained risk on our side, that offers no risk to our users and offers a much better user experience. The occasional successful double spend won't change the economics of that nor do we want to let a few malicious bad actors ruin the user experience for the majority of customers just because we might lose a little bit of BTC on our side occasionally.
With support from the great people at BlockCypher we are confident we can quickly improve the system as new attacks are formulated!
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:59:28
Hi, there. So sorry for this issue. We are working to make our blocking system more accurate, and should have it working a lot better soon. In the meantime, there are a few options that we are recommending that will help your IP accurately recognize your location:
- As long as you're not in New York use a VNP service to change the location to accurately identify your correct location or another location 
- tethering on a smart phone, this allows the phone to grab the IP address from the nearest phone tower, also, we have our iPhone app if you are an apple user that you could download to do your transactions (
- Waiting a few hours or day; re-trying a bit later could help. IP address are always changing. 
So sorry for this. Please let us know if you have any questions about any of this! And thanks for your continued service.

Thanks so much for your wonderful comment. We very much appreciate it. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:22:51
Thanks so much for the shoutout! Just as a side note to all who read, the exchange rate you see when you begin your transaction is what you will get only after the first confirmation happens. We do offer a zero confirmation for Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin transactions but for various reasons, an order can fail this zero confirmation and then it will have to wait for one. Just a little side note :) 
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:29:14
This is good news. Bitcoin shouldn't be regulated by coercive entities in the first place, but this is significantly better than New York's BitLicense.

Hi Jorj - if you want to contact us privately and give us your TX ID's we can look into if something went wrong - we would also be curious to know how you are making your USD calculations as the prices can vary widely based on different markets.
We would also suggest that if you want to receive a specific amount of LTC to use our "specific amount feature" this will lock in the best possible rate for you at the time for 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:44:16
Hi there! Most exchanges usually take no longer than 5-10 minutes at most (many may take only 30 seconds to a minute) but network effect can have an impact on this and its important to look at your TX and see if it has a confirm yet. If it doesn't then you will need to wait for a confirm and the TX will process at the current rate at the time it gets 1 confirm (unless you use our specific amount feature and send within the 10 minute window in which case it will lock in the rate).
As others have said - you can contact our support with your TX ID if you think you have an issue and we will be happy to look into it for you. Our support is sporadic on the weekend currently as we have a small team, but don't worry your coins won't be lost and we will get back to you as soon as we can :)

Depends on the coin pair in question. Smaller altcoin to smaller altcoin will have lower depth (and thus higher spreads) than more liquid pairs like BTC &lt;-&gt; LTC.
@_date: 2015-04-08 05:49:16
A lot of the difference you are seeing is because ShapeShift has to account for depth (as our singular instant rate for a pair doesn't allow for any slippage all the way up to our deposit limit). So purely comparing our buy/sell vs poloniex at the top end of the depth chart doesn't paint a true picture, as you will lose a lot of ground on each side as you add volume and the prices incurs slippage.
This does mean that you are getting a better rate closer to the deposit limit on less liquid coins than you are on small exchanges (on more liquid coins may not make a difference). In the near future we plan to release a parallel variable rate system which will help bring rates down for those who wish to trade a specific amount that may be well low of our current deposit limits.
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:13:20
Yep love this app

Hey there - if you had an issue with an order please email us at mail at shapeshift.io and provide the transaction ID. The coins you receive should always equal the exchange rate shown on the site (unless the rate has updated from the time you first saw it to the time your deposit was received). To get an exact guaranteed exchange rate, you can use the "specific amount" feature which gives you a specific rate for a 10 minute window. Let us know if we can help!
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:46:42

Hey Everyone, we only added XMR yesterday so we are still getting our inventory/limits in order. Its pretty standard for us to have lower limits on most new coins when we launch them and then we up it over the course of a few days/week once we are sure there are no major problems/bugs associated with the new coin and we are able to start gauging the demand.
That being said, we are continuing to up that limit right now. Expect to see those limits continue to rise over the next week or so!
You can also always contact us via our live chat if you need a limit upped on a particular coin and we can move our reserves around to accommodate. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:23:00
Glad we were able to take care of the issue for you - for future reference (and we also sent this via email) if you use our optional return address feature (by entering a return address before you create the conduit), then if it the TX fails for any reason, the coins will be auto-returned to you! 
Hopefully that is helpful for future use!

ShapeShift earns more like 0.5% per trade, not 5% as you assert.  Exchange fees elsewhere are usually at least 0.2%, so on a 100 Ether order, perhaps you can get 99.8 from a normal exchange and 99.5 from ShapeShift.

Hello everyone, ShapeShift's policy is two-fold:
1) ShapeShift requests as little information as possible in order to enable blockchain asset exchange. Personal private information is not needed to exchange blockchain assets, so we don't ask for it.
2) All the information we do have, as a platform, we make transparent. We do not obscure any information. Transaction details like input coin, amount, output coin, etc. are all transparent on ShapeShift. Indeed, we even publish it on our homepage and make it available via the API. 
Since ShapeShift does not obscure information, it would be a horrible idea to use it as a mixer or similar. We state this in our Terms of Service. Further, we will always cooperate with reasonable requests for this information (from law enforcement or private investigation, we make no distinction). 
With this policy, ShapeShift is simultaneously the least invasive exchange, as well as the most transparent.  We neither expose users, nor hide them.

Hi, there. ShapeShift's support line is not open on Saturdays and Sundays. Our normal business hours are 11:30 am EST to 7:00 pm EST Monday-Friday. We are currently answering support issues from this weekend so please stay tuned and we will be in touch as soon as humanly possible. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:11:39
No customer funds were stolen, and customers don't hold any money on deposit with ShapeShift. The orders that got interrupted by the site going offline following the hack were all returned within 48 hours, with the exception of a handful which we were reviewing for fraud. 
We're not aware of "people complaining after weeks"... can you provide a source for that?
@_date: 2016-05-25 10:16:29
It's also worth considering that the arbitrary blocksize of 1MB is causing scarcity which compels many companies to spend precious time and resources developing workarounds and dealing with customer support issues instead of building better products.
The "fee market" is distracting from other work.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:20:12
We are very excited to be attending and sponsoring! 
@_date: 2016-05-26 21:41:56
Are you still having this issue? We were having an intermittent issue earlier that was causing a few tx's to take longer than normal that has since been fixed and your TX should of cleared up by now. If it hasn't please submit a support ticket and we will make sure its taken care of.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:45:03
This can happen occasionally when we get hit with a bunch of requests, we are in the process of considerably scaling our server infrastructure to cut down on it. In the meantime if you just refresh once or twice things should load normally.
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:45:05
We are excited to be attending :) Come check out our booth this weekend and do a demo with us if you want to snag a sweet ShapeShift T-shirt.
@_date: 2016-05-17 05:00:11
Glad it came through finally! We believe we have fixed the issue with the fee calculation so hopefully it doesn't happen again! 
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:08:00
Thanks! I have expedited your transaction to our support team and they are looking into it as I type. You should hear from them shortly! 
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:01:50
Hi, again. Can you actually provide me with the ticket numbers we provided to you when you submitted a ticket to our customer support? Since you have sent us tickets, we will need to locate those and contact you via those orders. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:36:05
Thank you so much! We are pretty pumped about this. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 00:28:31
We believe it has been fixed now with any further outgoing transactions, it seems our node started having fees with congestion today and we upped our fee per KB and hopefully it has fixed the problem. Please let us know if you continue to see issues on new tx's.
@_date: 2016-05-16 18:16:05
What is your order number? Our customer support team is not 24 hours and we are going through tickets as quickly as we can. If you can provide us with your ticket number, we would be happy to look into it quickly. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 16:56:23
Can you post the screen shot of your order? We will reward then :) 
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:52:02
- in order to offer instant exchange we do have to hold a reserve of all of the coins that we support. Our limit is based on a number of different factors, but you are correct in thinking that one of the main things its based on is our current reserve of the coin pair selected.

Network effect of money is real and powerful, but not every digital asset is narrowly "money." There are numerous interesting use cases for digital assets and various niches are best filled by different tokens.

We have tried  a numerous amount ways to get the scam site taken down and unfortunately cloudflare and hosting companies offer no easy way to do this as far as we can tell, nor are they responsive to our requests regarding this. Any help to get it taken down for good would be much appreciated. 
Regarding the rubleCoin we can't really comment much one way or another until things further develop.

Thanks for being nice, have a beer!  1 beer

- We always return coins when a transaction fails for some reason. You may have already emailed us but in the future feel free to also access our live chat when available, sometimes that is the quickest way to get an issue resolved (we are a small team so our hours are limited, but we try to man it as much as we can).
For now, why don't you just PM me your TX ID and a BTC address we can return your coins to and we will make sure it gets taken care of right away!
Also for future reference, for exactly this reason we provide an optional return address on the left side when creating a conduit. If you enter an address where we can return the BTC to, the system will automatically return if something goes wrong, otherwise we wait until you contact us to send it back. We do this to ensure we don't send it to the wrong place, with many web wallets (coinbase etc) its not a safe bet to just send it back to the originating address (nor good practice).
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:32:13
Im glad you got your coins, sometimes it can take longer than others but you should always get your coins or we will get you a refund. The vast majority of our BTC input transactions go through within 30 seconds - 1 minute or so (sometimes less), but there are times when the system will force a TX to wait for at least 1 confirmation. Sometimes you get unlucky essentially and you are waiting for 1 confirm, but a bitcoin block takes a long time to come in (i have seen time between blocks take up to 2 hours although that is rare). 
Someone else here mentioned the return address, which is a good idea as if something goes wrong the system will auto return your coins
Also its worth noting that we have no need of an account to track your transaction in our system as we can look things up by either the TX ID or the deposit address you use to send to us.
Here is $2 for having to wait a bit longer than normal :) @_date: 2016-05-16 18:20:41
Hello - thank you for posting about this, and apologies for the delay in the tx. You're correct that the fee was not sufficient. Our node is using the wrong fee, we'll get it fixed here shortly. send 1 beer
@_date: 2016-05-16 20:32:25
Hey athos21, as mentioned we realize the fees were too low. We're correcting that in our system, but there isn't anything we can do about your TX's which were already broadcast earlier today. 
Unfortunately the Bitcoin blockchain is very full today, check it out: 
Miners just need to confirm the txs, and there was a fee attached, so they'll confirm eventually once the backlog of bitcoin transactions on the networks calms down.

It simply has a different model that is vastly less risky for the users, and vastly less risky for us as the operators. Namely - there are no user accounts, and ShapeShift never holds user balances.  User simply visits the site, sends Coin A, and receives Coin B moments later. There is no extended period of custodianship.

Ahh makes sense, so we are bad because we added XPY (does that mean we "backed it?"), and we are even more bad because we then decided to remove it.

HI u/aktivis,
Sorry to hear about this unfortunate mishap. We'll be sure to get back to you today. I'm digging into the issue now. Be with you soon. We appreciate your patience. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:26:43
May we humbly suggest people try ShapeShift.io instead of hackable exchanges... no user accounts, balances, or funds at risk. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:30:50
Hi u/mrboski,
What is your ticket  Has your issue been resolved yet? We're happy to help. Note: response times run between 4-8 hours and resolution times are on average less than 24 hours. :)

Not quite - you are buying directly from us. There is no fiat involved, only cryptocurrencies. Think of it like a vending machine, or a Travelex booth at an airport. You don't have an account, you just walk up, put a coin in, and get another coin out moments later.
