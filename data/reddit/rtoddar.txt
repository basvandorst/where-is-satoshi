That's right. Segregated Witness goes in in a few weeks then goes live after a majority of minors support it. This fixes transaction malleability which makes Lightning a lot easier to implement.

No way everyone will run their own node nor should they have to. Let's fix malleability so that lightweight clients can participate too.
If we want LN with any significant network effect (pass-through payment channels) without Segwit it will have to be through trusted hardware like Intel SGX (eg Teechan).

Their last FB post seems to address their insolvency and fraud accusations head on. Then I saw that this, their last post was from May 2016. Still, don't give up. Fight for your money. This legal stuff can take years but the squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Miners are blocking segwit on Litecoin as well.  This isn't just about feeling slighted or ignored, they do believe it hurts them economically.  In the short term that may be true, but in the long term a high value bitcoin with ultra fast lightning channels is better for their bottom line than simple linear scaling.

Actually, there is.  It's call Teechan.  Not the perfect solution because there's slight counterparty risk, but I trust Intel won't be backdooring my SGX CPU.  Also, it's perfectly decentralized.

This is not for people you don't trust (although they could verify funds through blockchain.info and then sweep to their address in your presence and keep the note as a souveneir). This is for your own coins or for friends/family you trust.

I only buy when it's down more than 3% from yesterday's low. I've been buying a LOT lately.

I use Blockchain. You can back up your wallet as a json file or 12/24 word seeds, which means you own your wallet if they go dark.

I love my brain wallet.  If anyone cracks it and gets the funds they deserve it.  Brain wallets work better if you don't attempt to memorize a base58 WIF or 32 byte hex string but instead memorize the reasonably complex process to generate it repeatedly.

What happens if your house burns down and you have paper wallets?  Your online exchange is hacked? You get hit by a bus and you didn't make provisions to transfer your brain wallet?  Point is, any method has risks.  
Opendimes are about a millimeter thick, so they're not fragile. Plus you can buy these cute little colored sleeves for them to match your outfits.

We can adopt Teechan to reduce on-chain congestion until the miners give in to Segwit.

The side with the longer chain or greater market share. Of course the markets will apply names to each fork regardless of what they want - eg Bitcoin SW and Bicoin UL.

Which Bitcoin holds more market cap after the split?  That is what will happen with a hard fork. Bitcoin 2mb @ 25% and Bitcoin Segwit at 75%.

Just HODL. Timing is difficult at best and then you have to account for income taxes if you trade regularly.

I assumed it was the upside down smiling emoji, whatever that means.

Changing PoW not only prevents a 51% attack (at least until Segwit is fully established and the dominant chain) it totally destroys the utility of ASIC Boost, the only reason minors could have to resist Segwit.

This notion that every single node has to adopt segwit for it to offer block size relief is ridiculous.

I have not met Mr. Wu but I can see the games he plays on Twitter; pretending one day to support Segwit and the next day singing the praises of Bitcoin Unlimited. I was hopeful the NY Agreement could appease both sides, but I now believe UASF is the path forward for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin won't kill the banks but it will but the hurt on them big time. Smart contract loans will be a financial instrument.
