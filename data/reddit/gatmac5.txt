Yeah but I bought something online today and paid with BCH by scanning a barcode. It was so easy and didn’t have to fuss with credit cards or worrying about whether they would store it on their servers and get hacked. 
I totally get now that crypto is the future of online payments. And offline for that matter. More on that some other day.

I am guessing Bill Gates and Warren Buffet fit this description.

My guess: the markets are too small. Too few people own or even understand Bitcoin. Too many of those who do own Bitcoin are HODLers who would never depart with theirs. 
Let me rephrase the question: why don’t YOU create a market like Amazon or EBay using exclusively Bitcoin?

I didn’t politicize this thread, and don’t wish to now. But child kidnapping rings and sacrifices for &lt;name_your_hated_politician&gt; falls under “idiotic beliefs that one-third of the population will easily believe”. You have made my point.

I expect further dips and pops, in a more or less random walk. Don’t try to time the market. If you believe in ___ as a long-term value store, then don’t worry about the dips. Just keep buying whenever you can, but only as much as you can afford to lose without going hungry or losing your house.

Epstein committed suicide. It happens a lot in prison.

Or invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs, physical bullion, etc.

Good points, I concede. They aren’t typical stock fundamentals but they can be useful.
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:20:40
Reminds me of the joke about the drunk guy who lost his keys in the park searching for them under the streetlight (streetlight effect). Crypto traders rely on technical analysis, despite nobody ever proving it works, because there are no fundamentals to fall back on.

Fakers. I am the real Satoshi. I will reveal shortly why I won’t spend any of my fortune.

Correct, so there is more interest or pressure for buying than for selling. But it’s still not an explanation. 
Did something happen in China?

Over 29.3% of people think aliens from outer space regularly abduct humans and subject them to sexual experiments. Getting a third of the population to hold idiotic beliefs is relatively trivial.

I’m not making any predictions, but price changes are not a one-way street. We heard real-estate never goes down in price, all the time before 2008.

Put my phone down for a day and it explodes. My main point was that investing in stocks, bonds, crypto currencies, etc is better than buying a fast car or a large screen TV. 
Yes, I am probably as old as some of your dads. And trust me, your financial independence will be worth much more to you than that rusted car — even if it did help you get laid a few times. 
As to comparing assets, I won’t do it now but you are probably wise to hold a mix in your portfolio, assuming it’s large enough. If not, pretend you’re smart enough to put all in one basket, and don’t shoot yourself if you lose it all.

We can conclude correlation after a larger sample size. N=1 is an anecdote. The events were probably coincidence.

It means some short-sellers are going to get slaughtered on the next price bounce.

I suspect the two events are uncorrelated.

You’re making the bold assumption BTC won’t be superseded by superior alternatives.

It’s interesting to speculate on the boundaries of future scenarios. At least it gives us, well, reasonable boundaries. 
How did you calculate those numbers? Can you be more specific with the calculations?

If he has such a great scheme for profits, why share them with you?

I am more in the camp of 1 Sat = USD0.01 = JPY1. This let’s us transact a few dollars and pay a few cents in transaction fees. 
You have a basic problem with your premise. BTC aims to be digital gold, not a digital currency. The argument applies more to BCH than to BTC.

Any thoughts on exactly how they are manipulating prices in the way you suggest? Selling has the effect of driving prices down...

Tax cuts don’t add to the deficit? These mental gymnastics would be hilarious if the results weren’t so disastrous. It’s obvious now that forcing a debt default crisis is the purpose, not the unintended consequences of GOP policy. The problem is it won’t work. Bush instigated the crisis they wanted and the Democrats took power. Instead of a massive rollback of FDR era programs they got Obamacare. 
Kill the Fed and end inflation? Bwahahaha it starts off with fantasy and winds up in self-parody. Because politicians have always been trustworthy of managing a currency.... and what we really need now is another mechanism for the 0.01% to park their wealth in riskless assets that are guaranteed to appreciate in value as the the 99.99% stand by idly and watch their economic prospects implode. Yeah huh. Once again, the outcome will not be what you’re expecting.

He had me at “Deficits under Trump are out of control.” 
Indeed. Not just another right-wing apologist for Trump-led bailouts to the .01%.
