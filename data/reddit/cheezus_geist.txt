Perhaps true, but at that point you're forwarding 'the space between' that I had alluded to, rather than the "nobody should have been bailed out" statement that I was arguing against.

kind of a false dichotomy though, no?
There is lots of space between "all of the bailouts" and "all of the crash"

Except that the same pressure that makes a consumer of goods want to save money now because it's worth more in 6 months is the same pressure that makes a supplier of goods want to make money now because that money will be worth more in 6 months.
It can't be an infinite spiral, because as the net present value of saving for the consumer rises so do does the net present value of sales to the producer, which incentivizes the producer to work harder to attract the customer.
You're right that deflation doesn't directly increase consumption, but you can't have a recursive infinite shift into the future for time preference, and in a lazy but long term way hard money promotes economic growth which, in real terms, raises consumption for everyone.
Hard money is by far the most successful innovation in the history of mankind because more than religion, philosophy, or filial love and obligation, hard money is the only sleight of hand that has ever put its finger in the dyke of human shortsightedness.

you're making an objective assertion that morality is subjective.
the fuckin' irony man, it's killing me.

I do not want to stake a claim on the issue, so much as deride those who declare certain issues as decided though they are in fact fertile grounds for ongoing debate and discovery.

That is interesting, I don't know much about Islamic Law, my only exposure being David D. Friedman's lectures on legal systems different from our own.
It is my understanding that there are lots of religious workarounds for usury in sharia.
I would be interested in anything further you would have to say on this topic, or links that illustrate the matter.

Human suffering does provide some countervailing pressure, 20 years represents a large chunk of a human lifespan.
I think letting it crash is not the right choice, but rather than unwind they are doubling down on shorter time preference. 
Each second purchased towards now becomes asymptotically more expensive. 'We' are right now printing a lot of money climbing that wall, and if the course ever reverses it may topple over and crush us.

I'm not confused about the facts, I am saying that I would rather have a wasteful but more peaceful unwinding of the fiat economy than a rapid explosive disassembly of it.

I would consider myself a cheerleader for that scenario as well. It would be a deflationary spiral that would spiral until people's time preference re-adjusted to the new time-value of money.
The money pumped into housing before the 2008 crash caused a hugely distorted housing market where more and bigger houses were being made than people wanted to live in, more housing renovations were being done than people wanted to enjoy, while absorbing resources and efforts that could have instead been put toward greater human wellbeing. Just as the GSEs wasted American time and treasure on housing and associated financial instruments, so too is the federal reserve and central banking around the world pumping money out of savings and into consumption.
This induced consumption isn't important shit, it's the marginal consumption. When you consider how much it improves the financial health of individuals who save even a little bit, like 5-10% of their income, can you really tell me that turning marginal savings into marginal consumption is what we should be cheerleading?
The industries decimated by hard money will be precisely the ones that rely on instant gratification and futureblindness, if all consumption was in the grocery store then the federal reserve is trying to get you to buy a snickers at the register rather than save a little more for next week.
Take any 'short term bullshit du jour' in place of candybars, like cellphone churn or fashion accessories or slightly bigger/curveder/pixelomatic televisions, blahbitty blah etc.

well, case closed guys, this dude has solved moral philosophy!
