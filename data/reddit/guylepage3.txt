I feel as though you're actually not getting it.. The actual point is that once you've verified a blockstack id as the id matching the individual that you believe it to be, it's locked in. Unless you have no memory, which then you have other issues entirely. But just as though I now reasonably verified you as Greg Maxwell on Reddit, I can now keep up to date with all those other accounts you have verified with your blockstack id. Simple. Not difficult to understand.

Please wake up. The world does not run around your Bitcoin core. You're smart I get it. But please take a step back as a human. Think about this in laymans terms and then reapproach it. Then comment back as layman

Great to see Coin Center and the companies involved educating congress on the value and power of the blockchain. Great for the community.

Very interesting to see the consistency in growth once blockstack switched over to the bitcoin blockchain. Says a lot about the stability of the blockchain.

Gotta love how the OPM discreetly tries to sweep this under the rug via their press release title.

And the drama continues. This is going to have serious repercussions to bitcoin. If there ever was a way to roll-out a technology bitcoin would be the pinnacle use case of what not to do.

Wow! These guys are horrible. "Y2K for bitcoin".

Can I make a suggestion? Maybe frame the title of your reddit post to be "Let's compile a list of blockchain uses"

Wow. Very cool. :)

I like and dislike this article. First off, I don't like the title of your post however. I tend to try and avoid headlines that include other companies to grab attention.
I do like that you are challenging entrepreneurs however one of my pet peeve's is to have at least one solution. Even if it is something you don't think will work. And again, it's great to get the convo going for sure.

I think the point is that Bitcoin, the name, is such a hurdle for the mainstream that they are grasping at any name they can think of other than Bitcoin, to so they can sell it to peers and consumers. They seem to be having a hard time selling the term, "Bitcoin", as it sounds like Fisher-Price play money to the mainstream.
