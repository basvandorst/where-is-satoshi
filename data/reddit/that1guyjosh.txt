well I had only just learned about mining today. I have heard of bitcoin for awhile now but never really read into it till recently

I don't own a single bitcoin. but from what I've read and from what I've studied/observed about economics your right in this sense.
To be honest though bitcoin is very fragile. if a major company or companies decide to adopt bitcoin as a form of currency your going to see a major influx of gamers out there who already have the specs to pump out good mining time. 
from what I've read even my rig is more capable to mine than your average computer user, but thats because this is my hobbie and I love pc gaming.
keep in mind selling computer parts is very risky simply because in less than 6 months the card you bought could already halved in price if you bought it before the release of a new generation of models. so expect to lose good money if you don't plan on keeping the parts you buy for this.
 now their are some specifics about mining I'm not 100% sure on but it seems like bandwith and computer rig will play a big part in mining abilities. if thats the case kansas city would have amazing mining potential with the upcoming 1gbs internet service we are to receive at the first quarter of 2012. imho if your not going to use the parts for anything other than mining probably shouldn't waste your money unless you have money to spare and really support the idea set forth by bitcoin. 
but again this is just from my oppinion based on how I know the computer parts market works and from what i've studied and observed from economics.
