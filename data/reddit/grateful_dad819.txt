The main difference between Bcash and BTC is about $15 in fees, max block sizes are determined by miners.  They still measure in MB, not Weight.  Savages.

160 satoshi is still astronomical compared to BCH.

try making a comit to the Bitcoin Github without GMax and his band of misfits, and it won't happen.   The fact is that the code is completely controlled by 3 or 4 people.  Roger Ver doesn't even have any control over BCH at all, I won't call BTC a shitcoin because I'm not trash.   I'm better than that.   BTC is not the bitcoin I signed up for in 2011, low fees and adjustable blocksize is part of the protocol, but has been replaced with Weight which is meaningless.  Greg Maxwell and Peter Wuilie did that, with a soft fork that didn't have consensus.

1MB blocksize isn't anywhere in the whitepaper or part of the protocol at all. However, in the words of DPR, "As you wish."

They don't need to know, it doesn't affect them.  Being unusable due to growing pains, artificial space constraints and overcrowding is different from dead.  My parents told me to forget about bitcoin, because its obviously just for illegal stuff, otherwise who would pay outrageous fees like that?  If we want adoption, the network needs more capacity.  Without that capacity, we might as well forgo any increase in adoption altogether.

On the eve of the full moon, closest to the solstice(Dec.31) I am going to cleanse myself with cedar and sage smoke in a sweat lodge listening to Tycho and Krishna Dass, then jump into a freezing cold river, hop out, smoke a peace pipe in a teepee with a big fire going.   After that, I'm going to carve runes for Thor and Loki into a stump, and sacrifice a goat with an ancient Indonesian dagger.   I will take the goat blood, wipe it on my face like war paint, and dance like a madman with my bros and our ladies until dawn, when I will fall asleep on a bed made of buckwheat after feasting on goat meat and mead.

Crichton is right about this, he was a very forward thinking writer in many ways.  While I am a big fan of his(loved the fractal iterations in Jurrasic Park- shame it didn't make the movie,) he was a climate denier and although I've read a dozen or more of his books, I can't get past that.  I guess he is just a natural skeptic.

Someone is feeling salty.  What's the matter, you never thought to increase the blocksize, enabling low fees and more TX? ouch.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:41:13
Why call it a "shitcoin"? anyone can run a BCH node, it isn't centralized by rule.  I am holding mine, because I don't believe 1MB blocks are realistic in the future for cryptos.  Keep an open mind, I've been in bitcoin since early 2012, and I haven't doubted this for a second, I just assumed that we'd be at 2, 4, or 8mb by now.  Just because they beat us to it, doesn't mean this has to stop.  There is hope for BTC.

Well, Core has Schnorr signatures and LN coming, but LN is still a ways out.   The other chains are not having this problem, it seems as though a small increase could keep
up with the market, but we don't know if this would be enough.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:24:24
Say what you want, but S2X would have been better than this fiasco, if Core had just backed down and implemented their own modest increase instead, like 1.5mb.

 I think it has value much like the way that registering a domain name or notarizing a document does; having irrefutable digital evidence at a specific time that cannot be changed.  The market value for the combined services of a crypto is dependent on supply and demand.  Right now, speculative demand is high and supply is low, although supply is increasing with alts and demand will probably lessen with fees/wait times/complexity issues.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:09:31
Blockstream affiliated Devs having huge conflicts of interest is vastly different from lizard people running Bitcoin.   There is a clear change in opinion regarding blocksize around the time that sidechain businesses started up.  Now, some people connect blockstream to AXA to Bilderberg, but that is the minority.   I think MOST BCH supporters see it much like how the big casinos tried to kill online gambling, a protectionist and unethical pursuit driven by profit.

Unfortunately, we didn't pass 2X(thanks, Core) so the fees cost 10x the lemonade.   They should start a tab!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:15:54
While I agree, I think they have really painted themselves into a corner, unless some type of emergency diversion from the roadmap can be justified.  Now, they will need an increase in addition to a couple of smaller upgrades to justify a hard fork.  Lets hope their self preservation is stronger than their egos.

this is a myth, paying more for fees provides a negligible amount of security.

you don't get "more" security by paying a higher fee, more miners might mine a coin if it is more profitable, but your fee makes little contribution to that, which is dictated by market forces.

@_date: 2018-03-09 17:40:11
??? What don't you get? there is no added benefit of paying higher fees.  The miner gets a small tiny added bit in their block, which they were going to mine anyway.   If a coin is more profitable, it will get more hashpower, and security does come from this, but the prevailing factor in the value proposition of the miner is the market price of the coin, and therefore the block reward.  Learn about coins, these Core trolls want you to think that BTC is more secure, as if a 51% attack is how your coins are going to be stolen(it isn't.)   The added security provided by a high fee is on the order of 0.0000000001%.  When a block reward is potentially $250k, no one cares about a few $50 fees.  I won't pay fees over $5 anymore, I just won't, that's why I use BCH.
