Having savings of $50000 at 30 means you've got substantial earning potential. Even if Bitcoin is wiped out, you can start over. And there's a chance that you'll get very rich.
One piece of advice. Research has shown that happiness obtained by buying things is fleeting, because you get used to them. Better to invest in experiences and memories, because they'll be with you always.

As a truly slow person, I advise cultivating patience. What is the hurry? Whatever the cause of your slowness, try to see it as a gift. It offers you a chance to escape from slavery to the clock and the calendar which is ubiquitous in our society.-

They don't automatically increase it, so it stays at $1000. You can request an increase of up to $10000 per day, $50000 per month, and it will be granted. I did this last week and it took a couple of days

The zerocoin paper described a prototype implementation by patching the bitcoin code.That would be a candidate altcoin right there. You'd have to adjust the magic numbers and come up with a new genesis block. The main problem is the zerocoin implementation didn't rely on the blockchain to store its database. It had a distributed hash table, DHT, to store some of the zerocoin data. You might want to more tightly integrate the two global databases.
And then there is the question of what crypto currency to base it off. I'm sure the patches for zerocoin would apply equally well to litecoin. As long as you're sacrificing backward compatibility, you can pick and choose other attractive ideas from altcoins.
The main trouble is going to be extracting the patches from the zerocoin people. Projects like this always have kludgy, embarrassing code that the authors are reluctant to release without cleanup. That will take many months and they won't do it unless there is great demand.

Delightfully industrial, almost steampunk.
But seriously, this would have many advantages, as he described s. I'm a little worried about accepting zero-confirmation transactions. See the many discussions of bitcoin vending machines. In this case, the cost of a fill-up approaches $100 in some cases. That's enough to justify an effort to steal.

Just yesterday I saw this program that searches your sectors for wallet files and recovers them. It's a long shot, but like everybody is saying, it's worth it to put substantial effort in.

What denominations dones the cash "dispenser" take?
What is the point of the webcam? Does your software turn it on and record when someone uses the ATM?
You need to demonstrate better how the customer receives his bitcoins. I imagine a QR code appears. But your website said something about SMS? How would that work?
In the video, a very technical JSON message appears for a moment.

You may be wondering how it works if you get paid in bitcoins, but sell them for fiat money (such as dollars) later. You declare (ordinary) income at the market price of your bitcoins at the time you receive them, ie. the mtgox price. Then, when you sell them, you have a capital gain or loss based on the difference between the selling price and the market value at the time you received them. The capital gain rules are complicated and you should use a professional tax preparer.

According to the Efficient Market hypothesis, the best predictor of the future price of bitcoins is the present price of bitcoins. No one knows what will happen in the future. Bitcoin could succeed beyond our wildest dreams; but it could fail, for a variety of reasons. The current price represents the probability of the two outcomes. You should not count on price appreciation when making financial decisions today. I believe this implies that you should cash out your bitcoins and buy it today, rather than financing it.

No need for trusted status. Verified accounts can request an increase to $10000 per day, and it will be automatically granted. It just takes a couple of days.

That's easy to say now, but you might be surprised by how you feel when the price starts plummeting. Fear is infectious, and you will be tempted to lock in your gains before they disappear. Generally, we are not good at predicting our actions under changed circumstances. A better guide is to look at what other people are doing. If people are in a panic, and selling, selling, selling, chances are you will be too.

This is really big news.Many are the times I have gone to intrade to get the straight scoop on some contested quiestion. We need a bitcoin prediction market like intrade. Betsofbitcoin has a bizarre payout structure that makes it impossible to derive the odds that a bet will succeed. With intrade, you see at a glance the percentage chance of winning. This is a market oppurtunity.
Reading between the lines, it sounds like bitcoin services don't have a monopoly on losing customers' funds due to lax security or malfeasance.

From reading about this, it's analogous to gold mining. If you find a nugget of gold, that is ordinary income at the fair market value of the gold. That price becomes the basis for when you sell it. The sales price minus the basis becomes capital gains income (or a capital loss). If you treat your mining as a business, you can deduct your expenses, including depriciation on your mining rig. This all applies to Bitcoin as well.
If you buy gold or bitcoins, the purchase price becomes the basis and when you sell you'll have a capital gain or loss.
The only controversial part is declaring ordinary income when you mine at the market value of the bitcoins you mined. But unless you are going to hold the coins for a year or more before selling, capital gains income is taxed like ordinary income. So the various proposals for a smaller basis result in the same tax anyway.
