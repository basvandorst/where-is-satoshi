Scrypt was the solution to Bitcoin ASICs, and it worked for a pretty long run.  Unfortunately, now we have Scrypt ASICs, so it's time to move to the next solution.  Vertcoin is the one.

Yep, but in what syntax?

That's nearly a doubledose.  Most MDMA is dosed at 120mg.  I'll have some Bitcoin tyvm.

@_date: 2014-04-05 17:19:30
But the thing is, when people turn off their rigs, the difficulty goes down, making it profitable again.  Maybe we'll enter a phase where mining consistently yields the exact same profitability as buying.
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:51:23

The possibility that someone like you might believe him.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:17:15
In the short-term yes.  He's talking about the long-term.  If you mine at a loss now, and the price goes up later, you've recovered your loss.  
Edit:  Oh wait no you're right.

I think I know exactly what it is, but I can't figure out for the life of me how you've formed the question.  I'm cycling through various configurations now...
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:38:44
It wouldn't confirm anything.  If it's Dorian, he could sign it, and we still wouldn't know if it was really him.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:05:27
Nice try, IRS.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:28:35
This is true.  You'll be able to see the balance, but won't be able to send or receive payments.

I regret every bitcoin purchase I've ever made.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:02:55
If I sell now, I'll regret it on my deathbed.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:05:14
Thank you - I think I understand.  It looks like I've got a bunch (not a large sum) of altcoins.  Not worth a lot, and I probably can't resell most of this junk...  I might just leave it alone.  If they take off in the future, hey, they're still safe.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:08:19
How do you "sell off some of the forked coins" ?  I, too, have an old wallet with BTC on it that I acquired when the price was $80.  I know the password though.  :)  But I'd like to be sure I can access these coins in 10/20 years.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:45:25
Wait, help me so I understand.  Are you saying that if I transfer 100% of my BTC to a new wallet, and "sweep" the old, empty wallet.dat, it will come up with forked coins?
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:34:20
Well you need to at least know how to wield a spray can.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:19:05
Someone just needs to start a "naming standards" committee and build a respectable site dictating (with authority) how things gon' be.
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:54:29
* I deleted everything cause I was impatient and didn't wait for the blockchain to synchronize.  All my bitcoins are just fine.  /phew
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:35:37
As well as encrypting that wallet in a FreeOTFE volume, and then zipping up in an encrypted 7zip file.
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:34:39
Yes, encrypting in Bitcoin-QT was the first thing I did.
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:51:17
I think I may have been confused.  It was me!  I transferred it out to my "spending" wallet to make a few purchases.  The whole history is slowly filtering in to my Bitcoin Core wallet, and it appears to be okay.
tldr;  I forgot how bitcoin works and panicked
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:53:14
Yeah, I'm drunk.  I'm seeing it all slowly as I synchronize, and all should be okay.  
I might just go ahead and transfer to coinbase to ease my paranoia.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:07:01
Yes, and probably below.  It's gonna be brutal.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:22:00
They just need to devote more time to answering support tickets.  Ignoring customers is the number one way to quickly make people unhappy, and it's easily resolved by simple communication.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:17:45
It won't verify, and will fail the confirmation process, thus never successfully leaving your wallet.  You're fine.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:45:02
Where do I find my public key with qt?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:46:02
my wallet file is encrypted with 7zip and FREEOTFE, so even if they have my passphrase, they'd never be able to extract the dat file.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:29:32
Thanks...  I keep my computer pretty locked down, but that would definitely be safe.
I'm leaning towards the above suggestion about only checking my balance on blockchain.info, but I don't know where to find my public key.  Do you know?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:50:45
I'm trying to wrap my head around what happens to the USD when 100% buy into BTC.  Does USD become completely worthless?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:03:04
I don't think so.  It's nothing.  Zip, nada.  You're anonymous, and only you know your bitcoin balance.  You only report if you convert it to USD, because there's a record of it in your bank.
Bitcoins are like $230 marbles.  The IRS doesn't care about how many marbles you have.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:53:23
So, can we start chanting "WE ARE THE 1%" now?
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:18:18
Sorry, the install options of bitcoin-qt don't allow to specify the location of the blockchain.  It always puts it on the system drive.  And there is no option to "import the blockchain".........
@_date: 2013-09-01 20:59:35
Not entirely true.  I paid money for the Western Union transfer.  I paid money for the BitInstant deposit.  I paid money to the exchanges for their services.  I've just barely broken even.
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:34:58
Last night I randomly received a MyWallet authentication code to my phone, and I had *not* attempted to log in.  Perhaps it's related?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:45:54
I for one hope you're right.  Here's my question:  Will this kind of growth threaten other currencies and eventually spell a collapse of the dollar?  If BTC climbs to $100,000 in 6 years, would that devalue the dollar in a similar way?  
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:59:12
Me too.  Like, $5 would be just perfect.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:30:28
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:45:05
Awesome, that looks quite useful...
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:24:07
I'm totally losing my mind right now.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:20:13
Would starbucks give you a coffee if you told them "check's in the mail" ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:18:33
Wrong.  LTC addresses have a different format.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:02:19
Only if everyone suddenly sells.  How to prevent a crash?  NEVER SELL, EVER.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:32:19
This is also my question.  Are there any examples in history where a decimal in currency has been moved to facilitate ease-of-use?  (not sure of the correct terminology here)
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:32:34
Why not just move the whole thing?  
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:23:24
You also have to consider that BTC will soon rise past the point where it's too expensive for newcomers to sign on.  That'll slow things a bit.  From there on, power will shift to the folks with the largest holdings, and they're the ones that will be sweating.  Their decisions will determine the rise or fall.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:44:56
Someone did the math over at Bitcointalk:
When the last Bitcoin is mined, approximately ~200 years from now, the entire blockchain will be about 10.5 Terabytes.  We'll have MUCH bigger issues to deal with within the next 200 years than hard drive space.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:23:18
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:18:34
Everyone freaking out and selling, plain and simple.  And it could happen.  But there was a time not too long ago when thousands of people were happily trading bitcoins for pennies, and look what happened next.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:09:53
What would happen if it all crashed?  Well I, for one, would buy a shit ton of bitcoins for pennies.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:07:35
This was fantastic - I had no idea there were so many other potential uses for the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:29:57
Agreed.  It'd be easy for him to show proof by simply sending it to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:26:46
Unless it goes to 100,000...
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:32:00

n8tiv just doesn't want us to know he's running around tipping sandwich shops all day.
@_date: 2013-09-01 20:57:25
Well that's just false.  Unless you're talking about purchasing more bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:44:39
Oh, each address is a public key.
So if I wanted to keep track of an offline wallet, I'd want to make one big transfer of 100% of my bitcoins to myself at a new address before taking my wallet offline.  Then I can verify my balance by looking up that public key on blockchain.
(this is just so I can see it all in one transaction, instead of having to look up multiple keys each time)
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:09:48
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:14:03
What would happen to bit coin?  The same thing that would happen to the dollar, the euro, our food supply, our wellbeing, our happiness.  It would come to a grinding halt.

@_date: 2013-04-04 20:48:29
Thank you.  So it is possible...  I wonder if that would have any effect on the actual value, or would people just carry on as if nothing happened?  And I'm not sure who or how we'd get everyone to approve a mass decimalization.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:07:30
Unless they meet someone just like you!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:41:50
Oh I just realized I don't have to enter my passphrase to check wallet.dat.  It only requires the passphrase when sending or receiving.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:31:41
This is the only correct answer.  For now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:20:09


They don't.  It's an entirely different blockchain.  Exact same function, but slightly altered format.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:31:39
Because Bitcoins are going to be too expensive for the average user.  Litecoins give the latecomers a second chance at making a solid investment.

Helpdesk is a fine idea, but you never responded to my ticket.  Consider setting a policy to quickly and efficiently answer each and every helpdesk ticket - even if you think the problem might resolve itself.  Your customers would appreciate it.

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:11
Value has different meanings.  The value of a Bitcoin to a dollar is a certain amount, specified by how much people are willing to pay for one.  The value of a Bitcoin to a marble depends on other factors.
Since there's a limited number of BTC, the value corresponds to the scarcity.  Tying a $ amount to that requires that people actually believe in it as a currency.  Otherwise, it's like Whose Line Is It Anyway, the game where the rules are made up and the amount of BTC doesn't matter.
As long as people keep exchanging real-world things for Bitcoin, it has real-world value.  The true monetary value of a Bitcoin?  We don't know yet.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:52:29
Is there any way I can move the blockchain to a non-system drive?  I only have 120GB on my system SSD drive.
