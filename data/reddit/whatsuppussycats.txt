But unaliveness cannot be confirmed either

I like 
it's pretty much the same as CMC, but cleaner/faster, without ads (so far) and the BTC/bitcoin.com mislead

Tabloid rather than newspaper

Sec reasoning suggests pessimistic outlook for btc etfs in general (non specific to vinkelv). Market will probably take a little while to digest this reality. Public interest / hype tanks ST, creating buying opportunities, imho. LT fundamentals intact, nothing has changed. Good news actually

Not even sure if ETF approval would help BTC in the midterm. Volatility would probably increase, making it harder for businesses to work with BTC... not to mention "real-world" adoption such as accounting etc. 
The later will ultimately be one of the KO criteria for its longterm success, no?

Don’t need his opinion, thank you

Thanks, but I don’t want to buy anything online, I want to pay with BTC right there at the counter

No, he isn’t

Unfortunately that isn’t an incentive at all. Don’t get me wrong, I‘m all for BTC, but most people don’t care about the technology behind it and they certainly wouldn’t run a node out of idealism. Even if they‘d manage to technically set one up. 
There has to be some sort of real world advantage to running a node, preferably monetary.

There is no incentive to run a node

That’s a lot, wow! Thanks for sharing your local insights! Hopefully many of the problems in Venezuela will ease very soon.. wishing you all the best! Good night from Germany

Thanks. You think you could guesstimate some numbers?
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:44:59
How many use crypto as an asset to store funds/safe haven to protect from inflation? Not talking about means of payment.

It also means that these coins will have to be bought back some time in the not so distant future in order to cover...
