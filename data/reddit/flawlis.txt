Just a heads up I suppose. Three people to not lie to: yourself, your wife, and the IRS.

Plus you do not have control over professional services. You are having faith in AWS to manage all of your data. It is risky...hence why government entities do not use AWS.

I mean I see the pros and cons of start ups all the way to massive enterprises using AWS. The pros are you don't have to worry about too much. But at the same time, you lack access to production and development. Personally, I don't want my sensitive information on a public cloud. But hey...that's just me.

It should be on-prem. AWS is a bad idea for sensitive information.

Ya, but this is sensitive information. Bank accounts, credit cards, social security. This isn't pictures on Flickr. This is real information. Putting it in a public cloud. Credit: I work at a top 3 data management company (not EMC/Dell)
