If I need to use paper I'll use cash. Trying to solve a problem that isn't there. What's more people would try and hand over used paper and convince folk that didn't have a reader they still had value.

Anonymity is Bitcoin's Nemesis not China, not the IRS, folk are so naive to think that Bitcoin will be accepted otherwise.

Add to that and this I believe the party is over, for the first time I am accepting defeat.
The real impact of the IRS ruling, UCC Article 9
Someone please tell me in wrong.
In summary if a business with a loan comes with a lien on it from a bank over general assets, accepts Bitcoin and then uses them to (effectively sells them) without their banks approval, then the bank has the right to chase and lay claim to those Bitcoin should the business with the lien be in default.
Worse still the bank can chase and lay claim to every Satoshi  no matter where it ends up until the bank has satisfied it's debt.
Meaning you could be contacted by a bank in the years ahead and asked to hand over Bitcoins that form part of a transaction that you had no part in.
This in effect makes the taking of any Bitcoin from anyone risky as any Bitcoin could have passed through a business in default and consequently your Bitcoin or cash, from the sale of Bitcoin can be seized.
Sorry folks but I think the IRS, working with this code enforced by the banks has successfully stitched up Bitcoin and sadly and by all accounts, to get UCC Article 9 changed is like expecting reforms to the Tax code.
I am hoping I am wrong and if anyone out there has the skills to interpret and challenge the veracity of my comments please let me know. Feel free to tell me that I am an ignorant alarmist, abuse me and prove me wrong and I promise I will be grateful.
As I understand it, Bitcoin is 'moveable property' and that's what UCC Article 9 addresses.

Personally I have written off my coin held at Gox and written it off to my own stupidity. We knew they were weak and we should have keep our distance.

Here's more detailed reasoning.

Jeeez what a thread of rants, reality is they manage their currency and Bitcoin fucks with that. The solution is simple if we want Bitcoin to succeed then we have to deal with anonymity.

Hong Kong exchanges should be worried and you have to bet that the smart guys are hoarding BTC to sell to money looking to escape controls.

Looks very real to me

I believe there should be unifying symbolism.
