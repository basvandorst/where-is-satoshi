Went great bud were good people and friendly

Once again you have not proving anything, offering a raffle is a gamble for me and a gamble for you. If only 50 tickets get sold i lose if 200 tickets get sold i win. Is it really that hard to understand 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:33:07
I can post the invoice of the miners coming to me if you would like?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:34:48
We would do number tickets, like if you bought the frist 100 tickets you would 1-100 and we could just use a random number gen could even stream it so everything is legit 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:04:00
Lol its not a scam you silly billy. And its like gambling in the since its a risk for me and a risk for the the guys buying tickets. Try harder troll
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:16:10
No need to apologize to me you only hurt other people not myself
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:51:37
I have bought 10 of them already for the march batch no red flags in the process so far were friendly and didn't take super long to get response 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:01:35
I mine and i resell Miners so i get both markets, every time i sell 5 miners i get 1 for free to add to my mine, has been working out great, its a little of work but i am retired so i got nothing better to do

Putting on a min amount of tickets just fucks over people because it could take months to hit it, and what if it never hits it then what someone hands over btc and then gets back less since the prices goes up and like crazy

Once again you said it would have been removed like 12hours ago but yet another has happened if you want to troll bro you are welcome but as you can see nothing has happend
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:31:02
No the only reason they removed it was b/c you got butt hurt and wanted to troll which is what you do on almost all the posts you comment, not hard to see a pattern you like to troll b/c of some magical reason. You want to say scam yes but to go cry to mod for no reason is just sad on your part 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:40:20
No lol i havent broken any rules, also to all these comments i have provide a legit answer to the questions
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:44:49
Bud i dont understand what your problem is, you are not adding anything of weight to this conversation, Just saying scam without any proof 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:50:36
I bought 10 of them and I run a small mining farm only at 175th right now
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:56:37
Its not scamming people to offer something like a raffle in the first place. And if a mod jumps in and offers lets use them 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:35:35
easy to not fake stream the the whole thing and upload it to youtube so there would be proof of who won 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:46:00
That would be an Bitcoin Mining rig made by bitmain, the Best miner on the market lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:42
What large sum on money are you talking about dude the tickets are 10$ usd each if 10$ usd is a lot of money to you then you need to skip on out of crypto lol 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:22:54
Ok and what proof do you have of me trying to Scam anyone i have offered to do any of the options you put forward. But yet your only reasoning to say scam is you dont like the idea, without any proof lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:17:23
Thank you maybe next time it will go better 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:46:07
Kiddo i sell these Miners all day and i wanted to do something nice because it was the Xmas season, i wouldnt have cared if i sold any amount of tickets, it wasnt about the money it was about trying to do something nice. You didnt ruin my weekend i have sold 10 miners since i started this post so oh well i dont have to do something nice now and i get to keep all my profits so really thank you lol the only people you caused anything too is the people that would have benefited off a 10$ ticket and won a 1800$ miner so congratz
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:51:26
Ok for one i can show where i have spent 16k buying 10 of the S9's lol so that shows i own them already. Also it was just something fun for people that dont have the money to buy the mining rigs and make someones holiday better. Just because you dont want to do it doesnt mean you got to jump and down saying scam without proof 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:35:12
No one is making anyone do anything they dont choice to to do if you dont want to play the game then you dont got to bud 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:06:50
I am retired for the military so i have income every month so worries about the food and i sell the miners to get able to grow my mine with the profits instead of investing my income 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:43:17
Yes me and my business partner meet the haloong mining team and I am 100% sure I am getting my miners ordered
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:53:44
Not a scam bro have proof before you jump the gun. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:44
I would say congratz to the person that won it and that 500$ would offset my cost of the miner a little bit and it would makes someone Xmas special 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:53:51
Bitcoin is created by mining which in the simplest terms mining is solving a problem by random guesses. So if you own a miner you let the rig run and it makes you Btc based on how many hashes you have. This is just a very basic version

Me and my business partner have a trip to China planned for next week to visit bitmain and now this place to validate are large investment in mining equipment. So far over the phone calls I have had with them no red flags it's almost the same as talking with bitmain.
