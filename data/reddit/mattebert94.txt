Why would you transfer back to your bank every time? Why not just buy again with the money you got from selling on GDAX? You can even use a limit order to skip all the fees.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure if I sell you 1 BTC, then you sell it to person A, who sells it to person B, etc...each of those sells would increase the volume. So I think even though some people do HODL their coins, enough BTC is moving around to keep the market alive and well.

Used bitcoin.tax to help you with this. But basically you convert all things back to dollars when you trade crypto A -&gt; crypto B. It's more like crypto A -&gt; USD -&gt; crypto B. Any money you spent on crypto A is your basis and then whatever the USD is in the middle is your proceeds. Subtract the 2 and either have gains or losses depending on if your USD is more or less than what you bought crypto A for. For which of your coins that you sell, most people us FIFO (first in, first out) meaning that you would take that 17 from the 25. But some people might change that up and use a different group to sell (could take 12 from the 13 and take the 5 to sell). This is usually to change the taxes if it's more than a year (capital gains versus income).

Question about these forks. To get any of them, I would need to have my BTC moved off of GDAX and into my own bitcoin wallet correct? Would this just mean creating a wallet on something like blockchain.info and moving my BTC to that wallet? Or would I need to have a paper wallet completely offline?

Only when you go crypto -&gt; crypto or crypto -&gt; fiat do you pay taxes. In the eyes of the IRS, buying a product with crypto is basically crypto -&gt; fiat -&gt; product. So you would take whatever amount of crypto you "sold" to buy the product at the price of when you bought the product and use that to calculate taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:52:27
The comments on that post are pretty funny. Either people bashed it or loved it. If any single one of them started mining back then, they'd be rich
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:44:45
Then there's no way you'd get thrown into prison for many years or be given a six or seven figure fine. Just do the math yourself if it's that few transactions. Sell value minus buy value for each of your trades. If it's positive, pay the taxes on it. If it's negative, congrats, your taxes will be a little lower.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:46:46
Just wait for a dip. That's the only discount you're gonna find
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:26:28
The IRS only cares about the cost basis and the sell value. So they just want to know at what price you bought the 1.5 BTC. It appears you bought 1 BTC at $125. The other 0.5 BTC was either gifted (cost basis = $0) or bought externally (cost basis = whatever you paid for it). That's it.
1.5 BTC * $140 = $210 sell value
1 BTC * $125 + 0.5 BTC * (cost basis) = buy value
Pay taxes on sell value minus buy value.
You sold within 1 year of purchasing, so everything would be taxed as short term income (not capital gains). If you had held for over a year, then things can change based on "which bitcoin" you actually sold.
Edit: formatting
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:45:27
I've been around the crypto space for many months now, and I can say that I've never seen anyone say buy the deep, so I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that. But I'm guessing that you mean "buy low, sell high". And there's no way to know that honestly. It could skyrocket to $20k in the next hour or it could plummet to $1k. Nobody knows. So just buy where you feel comfortable and only put in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:24:02
Limit orders are free. On the left side, click the Limit tab and make sure Buy is selected. Then enter the amount of BTC and the price (below the current price) that you would like to purchase it for. Leave it on Post Only and then click Place Buy Order. Once the price you set is reached, it'll trigger your buy order and you pay $0 fees. Same thing for selling back to FIAT. Limit -&gt; Sell -&gt; price and amount. Once it hits that, it'll sell for free again.

You're exactly right on all this. But that doesn't change the fact of the current laws on what you have to pay taxes on. It sucks, yes. But in my opinion, it's not worth risking with the possible fines that could happen. Websites like bitcoin.tax make it pretty easy to calculate your taxes and they allow you to connect exchanges and enter in mining income as well as external purchases you make to include in the calculation. The whole system needs reworked, but unfortunately, that isn't gonna happen overnight.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:29:34
Why did you tweet that? Like honestly did you think at all before posting it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:17:38
Yes. The IRS sees any crypto -&gt; crypto as going crypto -&gt; USD -&gt; crypto. So you would sell crypto A for the current USD price, then buy crypto B at current USD price. You would be taxed on the gain/loss of the sale of crypto A. Then the price you paid for crypto B would become the new cost basis. It kinda sucks and requires decent record keeping, but it's the way the gov't wants to do it right now.

Is that doing FIFO or LIFO or some other option? It might not think you are selling that 1 BTC from 2014 and maybe it thinks it was a "different coin" if that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:51:13
Yep that's exactly how you do it. Get your segwit address, go back to legacy and send to the segwit address. Right now fees are super low so you can get away with sending for 1 sat/byte and clearing within hours most likely. I sent yesterday for 1 sat/byte and cleared in 3 blocks for reference.

Oh sorry read your post wrong. You should still be able to use MEW. The tokens are on the ETH blockchain not the ledger itself so it shouldn't affect anything.

Depends where you're looking from
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:34:54
Everytime a block gets created, you'll see a dip in the chart. The colors indicate levels of sats/byte. You can see which color corresponds to which level by hovering. So some people are still using over 100 sats/byte and those are basically 100% getting confirmed next block. So as long as you fit in a color that's being removed every dip, it'll clear. Basically, just send for like 3 sats/byte and you'll be golden.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:20:13

@_date: 2018-02-27 15:44:06
1. Hardware wallet. Ledger Nano S is the best in my opinion.
2. Yes, but move it off after you've purchased since you don't want to keep coins on exchanges. Also, move it to GDAX first since GDAX -&gt; anywhere = free
3. Yes. Either purchase a hardware wallet or create one. There are many helpful links in the sidebar here.
4. Google this. Tons of information online
5. Also Google this. Not as much information, but lots of awesome articles online.

Not sure if you wanted a response, but what I described is for crypto -&gt; crypto. The government can't tax you on "crypto gains" since that isn't in USD. So they "pseudo-convert" it to USD in the middle to calculate gains/losses. Nothing changes on your end when going crypto A -&gt; crypto B. The gov't just wants to know if you made or lost any money on the original investment of crypto A when you bought crypto B and tax you on that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:24:30
To add to this: there have been many transactions in the last hour and 1 of them took a small chunk out of the dark blue (&lt;2 sats/byte)

You can look [here]( to see what fees are clearing through each block. You can look [here]( to see approximately how long it'll take for your transaction to clear given the sats/byte you provide with it.
Edit: Right now if you're trying to send for cheap, anything above 1 sat/byte should clear within probably 2 blocks

No. That's the same as taking a dollar bill from your left pocket and putting it in your right.
As for the gift, as far as I know, there are 2 options:
1) You give it to them and count it as a sell for the current price and pay the gains. They take it and pretend their cost basis is what the current price is.
2) You give it to them and count it as no change in value (no taxes). They then take the coin with the cost basis of whatever you paid for it originally, and then they pay taxes on that when they sell.
Basically, the IRS wants the coin to be taxed on the different of buy and sell. They don't care where it comes from necessarily.
