Done! We just added it : ]

Haha perhaps I will add a little donate button... but for now, I've added the AUD! You can use by selecting the currency in the settings tab :)

All set! We've added the EUR market to the site. Just open up the settings (the little icon in the top right corner) and select your currency : ]

That's a great question. I would be happy to add EUR. I'll reply here when it's up!

Great suggestions. We've set this up to support just that! If people like it, we will definitely expand it. We also have some pretty neat ideas in the works that help realtime evaluate your possible positions.

Haha! Sorry, ya by default it tracks just the live rate of Bitcoin in USD until you configure your personal settings

That's a great idea! I can definitely add that. How about price alerts? Would you find it useful to be notified of certain price changes?

Oh interesting. It appears you perhaps had an issue with the other number haha. Could you refresh that one more time?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:58
Much appreciated man!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:55:14
Great suggestion. I'm adjusting that right now!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:04:58
Thank you very much! I've fixed that issue
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:32:46
