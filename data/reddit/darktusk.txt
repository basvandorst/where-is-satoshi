I have thought for the last 18 months that I had 1.2 BTC in my wallet.. I hadn't even bothered looking in it again..  I was actually a little scared to look after all this talk of people stealing it!
well.. I just looked.. I have 12 BTC not 1.2
WTF man
how do I cash it in?... should I cash it in?

Why the fuck did you not tell them to get to fuck like a real human being would. It's capitalist people like you that fuck this world up for everyone else... Telling us about it now does not take it away.  Are you running the chrome vpn extension now?...

Is there another way?

surely if somebody could track and find said hard drive then the wallet I.D would be retreivable?
