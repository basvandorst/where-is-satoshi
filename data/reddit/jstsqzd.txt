It's not about what people on BTC Reddit think, they've been predicting 100k--&gt; $1m for a long time now. What matters is getting people from outside the crypto world to see it as a better place to park their savings as well as large investors with the power to move markets seeing it as a good investment.

Every time you trade your Fiat for BTC you decrease demand for one and increase it for another by equal amounts...

For huge sums of money that makes sense, but the dollar is fluctuating too we just don't see it because prices of everything are in dollars, and people don't adjust their prices up and down to match the value of a dollar.  
Imagine living in a country where local currency value does fluctuate noticably.  Now imagine the relative cost of goods doing what BTC has done for just the past few years.  Would be bumpy, but quite favorable

"since a bitcoin price is a 1-1 function of bitcoin adoption" @ 5:53
...Really?  This is a vast oversimplification

But a collapsing stock market actually means your dollars are worth more because stocks are becoming cheaper by comparison

At an average transaction fee of 1.5% for visa this would have cost 13 cents to do by credit card!

It's like we are all playing a game of Monopoly and the bank just keeps loaning money to all the people buying up all the properties, while you sit in jail trying to pay your way out and while the rent keeps going up

Because the only way you get money for Bitcoin you've been holding onto is by selling it to someone else and they are buying with the hopes of then giving that to somebody later for even more money and as long as more people are willing to pay a higher and higher price everyone gets more profits until there is nobody left who wants to buy it then the value will collapse. 
It IS effectively a big Ponzi scheme, the fallacy is that so is all money, it's just engineered to lose value to keep everyone working hard to stay ahead of the de-valuing.

This time could be different because stocks are starting to drop and trade war looks like it's heating up, last time stocks were looking pretty decent at the same time.  But market could do a fast turn around and be back to all time highs you never know

Because if he holds out for more, it could collapse to zero the next day and he'd have nothing.  Good idea to have an upper limit, I think for most people it's what amount of money would make your life significantly better.
