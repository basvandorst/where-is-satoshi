Looking at the YTD everything started going nuts in May with big swings after a long term minor rise/steady value. If this were to continue then we should be at about 6k at the moment.
A bull run started in late May and then a lot of people piled on and a lot have pulled out while volitile. There's a correction happening now and looking at the May pricing I'd expect it to drop to between 6-8k before steadying out and everything dieing down.
Europe and America will be waking up soon, so I'd expect another drop once they start trading today.

Bitcoin goes up and down at extreme rates. It can be a wild ride. Some a few weeks ago bought at 12-13k and sold a few days later at around 10k. Just treat it as a long term hold and you'll be fine.

Hopefully today will be a bit more steady than yesterday! Still I did cash out some of my profit for Amazon vouchers at a good time! Christmas is sorted and my Lego collection is building :)

I think we are witnessing the limit of Bitcoin. Exchanges are backed up, pending transactions all over the place. The technology has reached its limit in terms of traffic. Yet the price is staying steady for now, maybe because selling is delayed?

Well it's not 15k anymore. Went out, did some shopping and now it is almost 16,500. When the crash comes it'll be epic.

15,147, someone is making a lot of money. The network is mental right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:28
Transactions have been pending for hours. The whole market is overloaded.

Probably lost a fair bit as the owners at hashocean did a runner!
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:45:08
Haha, source? Face it, it smelt like a ponzi and the returns just weren't possible. I've lost a tiny bit, which I'll be able to make back with the change in mining difficulty and expected rise in bitcoin price. If you've gone in big, Sorry!
They've deleted their YouTube and Facebook accounts, they're probably living it up in the Bahamas by now.

A Bull run Is where a lot of people start buying up bitcoin (if its been in the news etc) and this shoots the value up. The big money boys then usually sell loads of bitcoin pushing the price down and then rebuy around the same rate as before the "bull run" started.
A halfing is where the difficulty doubles in terms of mining bitcoin, meaning it becomes twice as difficult to mine a single coin. Finite number of coins in circulation = slow growing value per bitcoin. 
The last big jump to 20k was a combination of a massive bull run and it was just after the halfing event. Market settled at around 3-4k before slowly growing again.

Its been jumping between 12,300 ish and 11,500 ish for a few days since the bull run. That's kinda steady, which is good. I can't remember how long it stayed above 10k the last time but hopefully it is steady above 10k now.

Relax, it'll go up again. Next bull run will be before the halfing (next year I think?). Keep it as a long term hold, no point selling at a loss. Also a reminder to everyone - don't invest money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:24:55
Even just keeping things steady would be nice. Doesn't need to jump every day!
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:17:42
Yep it's a bull market. People buying in who have no idea what it is :P
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:52:27
I bought £350 worth at $5k ish. If it drops it drops. I'll probably cash out if it hits 20k. Will cover rent for a couple of months!

My bad, withdrew 200 quid using the coinbase card and then 10 mins later it dive-bombed haha.

" Ordering a card costs £4.95 ($6.50) — the first 1,000 customers can get it for free. Each transactions costs 2.49 percent in fees — 1.49 percent in conversion fee and 1 percent in transaction fee. If you spend money in other European countries, it costs 2.69 percent in fee. Outside of Europe, it costs 5.49 percent per transaction "

I signed up, Seems fair enough despite the fees.

Lol good luck!

I bought at 9k, sold at 17 ish. I'll wait a bit to see how deep the dip is. Unfortunately it looks like the market is following wall street right now.
