Obviously your argument and OPs argument exist on a grey scale. 
To what DEGREE is it true ?
How SPECIFIC are your calls and are you trying to TIME them and how precisely ?
Limited supply and untrusted parties transacting with no censorship bakes A LOT of value into its cake already.
There is no reason to bet against it as a general investor but if you're some expert at shorting bull traps then whatever, have at it.

TBH I'm so picky with food at home that on the road i could easily gas up and get their food (had both) and never miss wawa not even once for a single second if i could use bitcoin for all of it.

also if you have anything close to "mostly trusted parties" on your fancy new blockchain FINTECH company then any other database (mysql,posrgres) will be exponentially more efficient and a webapp with user name and password and for each "trusted party". in that situation a company has no reason to use blockchain.

This trend of thought was the first thing that hit me about the transparency of the blockchain.
Its a *two way road* and we have way less to fear than those who are dependent on rigging the system.

Ahhhh yes, the silent and unacknowledged exertion of power and force under the pretext of "your (society's) own protection".
This power struggle is older than time itself but we've got the internet and the pyramid is steady turning upside down as we decentralize.
The de facto power structure better come up with something better than this, and soon, this chess game is about to get ugly for them!
