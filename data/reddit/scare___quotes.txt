Thanks for the info and help. I may have absorbed a little too much r/coinbase panic in my immediate assumption that it's now stuck in limbo, but I'm hoping it just gets bounced back.

Ugh, duh, I did know that, thank you for the correction. I'll also take your advice and switch wallets for my next go at it.

Thank you for this.

Thanks so much for this link. Serves me right for allowing myself to be uneducated on this particular aspect; I underpaid (to be fair, the fee was calculated automatically by Blockchain, and I don't recall an option to pay more, but, still.)

I just got confirmation of the transfer - 22 hours having paid 109 sat/byte. I feel like I got lucky that miners picked it up. Good luck.

I was investigating that as a last resort. I imagine you've already looked into it, but did you try [transaction accelerator]( (oh and, thanks, fingers crossed for you).

Yeah, it started crashing for me just after I confirmed the transaction. I'm OK with waiting awhile if I got triaged late because my fee is low, I'm just trying to figure out how long is "not gonna happen" long.

I've noticed this too. Knew a guy who, it later turned out, ran a darkweb stolen iPhone ring. Also counterfeited train tickets at least once. Clearly knew what he was doing on both fronts, and was well-enough acquainted with systems security. Took few to no precautions hiding his identity, though he knew how, and used his own name and address as the recipient of (get this) Western Union funds from the counterfeit tickets, which he sold. My only explanation for this was pathological arrogance, which I see a lot in the "cyber criminal" type. Interestingly, the dude was still paranoid as fuck, just didn't do anything to assuage that.
