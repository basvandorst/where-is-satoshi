*How???* You make all these talking points, but completely fail to explain them.


That isn't the argument at all. Simple game theory dictates that in a situation where the group benefits from not overusing a resource, but one person would gain a competitive edge by doing so, eventually everyone starts overusing the resource until it runs out. It's called the Tragedy of the Commons, and pretty much the only way to stop it is by enforcing strict regulations on how much of the resource people can use, or otherwise finding some incentive, which would *have* to be worth more than the benefits from overusing it, to give people who don't overuse the resource the competitive edge.
In a sense, many of the abuses of capitalism can be attributed to some variation of the Tragedy of the Commons scenario. For example, companies gain a competitive advantage from driving wages down and forcing workers to work as hard as possible, since that means that not only would they not have to pay their workers as much, but they would also get as much out of their investment as possible, so companies will do anything that's cost-effective at reducing wages and raising production to a more profitable level, *even if* companies would ultimately get more long-term profits from paying workers higher wages and putting less work on their shoulders. Every individual company would benefit from having even *slightly* cheaper, harder-working labor than their competitors, so it becomes a race to the bottom.
*This* is the issue with pure capitalism. It relies on pure competition, with absolutely ***zero*** accounting for situations where competition over resources produces problems in the long-term.

It tastes like liquid Atomic Fireballs. Probably where they got the name.
