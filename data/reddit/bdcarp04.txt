I agree with the first half.  The shipping got delayed on these and what I spent in December to pre-order and have it show up in May was not really worth waiting for when I could have just been buying coins.
That said, the second part of your message about troubleshooting and nagging problems is almost non-existent on these things.  Seriously.  You plug it in, you download the app, and you're mining.
And as far as research goes, the new BTC option they activated today is supposed to decide which coin is most efficient to mine and then automatically convert to BTC for you.  I can't comment on how well it works yet, but I flipped it on today so we'll see how it goes.  :)

I'm happy to answer questions if you guys have 'em.  Not sure how many are out in the wild as of yet.

This is EXACTLY why I bought mine!

I have one.  I like it because it's fairly quiet and doesn't raise the temperature of your house.  The flip side is that it's not nearly as powerful as the big boys, so if you're looking for heavy mining horsepower this isn't it.  It's a good beginner's miner though (or for people that don't have the room or access to set up a larger scale mining rig), and the app makes the thing a piece of cake to use.  You just plug it in, pick which coin you want to mine, and away it goes.  My plan was to eventually turn it into a LN once the option is available, but the BTC option they just activated today seems pretty interesting.
They had some decent founders perks too if you were an early adopter like no mining fees.  Not sure if those are still available or not.
