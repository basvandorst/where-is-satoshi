Which is why any sane large-stakes holder would have a spoof wallet with a small amount in it.

You ignored almost all of my argument for why bitcoin is valuable in today's society, plus you created a new argument that I believe you're retarded even though I didn't say that. Bitcoin can collapse, but blockchain is here to stay. There isn't much that's controversial about that.

You've just described DRM. all someone has to do is capture your media in another encoder and then the DRM was pointless

Actually WaPo didn't say that. Someone they interviewed said that... In the same damn article another person said that if someone doesn't have an understanding of the tech, it might not be the best idea for them to invest. Misleading title.

The biggest value in Bitcoin lies in the technology. For Bitcoin to be completely devalued everyone would have to migrate to a different block chain based currency. The name Bitcoin and block chain currency are synonymous with the public at this point. To say that Bitcoin has no function is fairly ignorant, however. 
Decentralized currency, financial transactions without the requirement of human trust to actually transfer the funds securely, a nearly impossible to hack system, removal of much of the financial overhead required to process transactions, and the ability to verify contracts by attaching hashes to Bitcoin transactions is a bonus. Yeah, not something unique to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is the biggest name in the market right now. That could change, but there is value behind the currency.

They asked someone for their opinion. That is hardly comparable to the WP taking the specific stance you quoted. Plus your headline quote is a fragment of the whole quote. For the layman, cryptocurrency is beyond most people's understanding. The actual quote said 'almost impossible' to understand. And it was the opinion of one of a several people they interviewed. What you've done is shitty regurgitation of partial info.
