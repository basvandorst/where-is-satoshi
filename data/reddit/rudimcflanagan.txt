Well if your're serious and *that* is the criteria for your decision, than you should get out of fiat too, because it has no intrinisc value either.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:42:22
not necessarily. It just means bitcoins are that much more scarce.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:41:19
No. But bitcoins existance and value is the only way anyone can know that. NSA devotes a lot of resources to undermine cryptography. In the past they have successfully sabotaged cryptographic systems and attempted to sabotage others. NSA certainly has interest in breaking ECDSA and RSA and, in the case of RSA may have already done so and have been secretly evesdropping on all SSL comms that exchange keys with RSA. 
Knowing which crypto systems NSA already has broken is difficult because **if** any given crypto system has been broken by NSA cryptoanalysis, that fact would surely be classified, as public knowledge would immediately deprecate the compromised system, and therefor undermine the entire value of the compromise itself. 
However because of bitcoin, in the case of ECDSA we know almost certainly that NSA, (or any other organization for that matter) has not broken ECDSA because no entity capable of doing so is capable of preventing theft on the bitcoin blockchain by those who know the algorithm weakness.

Why are you burning it?

supply and demand. same as anything else.
at any given time, the price that the sellers are willing to sell the same quantity that the buyers are willing to buy at that price is "the market price" at that time.

@_date: 2017-08-16 21:29:45
It has no *intrinsic* value. it just has plain value.
It has value for the same reason anything else has value: people want it and are willing to trade other things of value for it. It really is that simple.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:36:10
this is not ok if they didnt specify that presale. 
Also how can one trust they're not running a fractional exchange? How do we know they are not HODLing their customers funds for their own benefit? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:18:52
Can you explain the current state of segwit, I keep seeing this and keep hearing the date Aug 22-23 2017 thrown around but all explanations seem vague and  says that segwit is already active. I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:43:03
what exactly are your financial services?
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:54:01
No. You can verify the transaction immediately (on the order of 1 second) but this only provides *validity* of the transaction not *finality*. To safely sell goods/services in non-recorse scenarios you need both.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:26:10
cryptography and machine learning.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:09:52
if NSA had ECDSA broken, no they would not want to tip their hand, and they would never want to reveal it. The utility of knowing a crypto vulnerability only exists as long as you are the only entity to know about it. Once the vulnerability is public, the public deprecates the bad crypto and starts using other, strong crypto, which defeats the purpose of the cryptanalsis.
But you are thinking of NSA all wrong, NSA is not an autonomous government abstraction of a person, it is literally people. and is therefore incapable of knowing a break in ECDSA and not stealing bitcoins.

Not quite true. Seeing the source code is a benefit in it's own right. 
Also their are anciallary security benefits to OSS even if you didnt build the binaray yourself, as long as you trust the developer and the binary and source are signed.

@_date: 2017-08-04 03:44:01
Of course it does't. I genuinely believe that, but without source how can I trust it is true?

@_date: 2017-08-04 12:18:32
right but a government agency is not a person, does not have a mind of its own, and can't make decisions. Only people can make the decisions and a group of people of that size is straight up not capable of holding that secret.
Its an anthropological issue not a cryptographic one. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:15:49
One of the most interesting and amazing powers of bitcoin is it that its very existance nearly proves that NSA does not have ECDSA broken.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:50:47
Yea thats what Im saying **if** you trust the keyholder, a signed source commit and a signed binary only needs trust in the keyholder's actions and identity to complete the link right?

Yea there's going to be another contentious hard fork called "Bitcoin Gold" on 20171025. Anyone in possession of Bitcoin (BTC) at the time this fork occurs will automatically be award an equal quantity of Bitcoin Gold (BTG)

Does't S2x still have more than 50% hash power signaling support for it? Isn't it like 80% support right now? Is it odd that a movement with 80% support is considered "dead"?

No Charlie youre missing the point of decentralized money. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:10:22
I don't think that's quite true. Bicoin is in the top 60 most viewed pages on Wikipedia now. Also I don't know of a single person that hasn't heard of it in the US and I hear it's even more popular in other countries. I would be very surprised if the percentage of people unaware of it's existence and purpose is less than 20%
Also China is able to buy it. Bitcoin can be bought in every place in the universe except inside a black hole. As far as legal restrictions go,  China only banned exchanges they still have OTC and people are easily getting around the no exchange rule anyway.

Gdax has no fees at all for maker orders. Not even miner fees for btc withdrawals. You better get your BTC off gdax though before the fork on Oct 25 or else you will lose your free bgold
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:36:14
It doesn't matter. The same thing that happened on Aug 1 is happening again on Oct 25. In the future, you will want to have owned coins before Oct 1. And until you transfer the coins off the coinbases/gdax account, you don't really own them.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:32:49
you're trusting a third party with your private keys so you're already doing bitcoin wrong. 
Very cool hardware though.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:56:54
This is unfortunate but true. People ought to be investing/trusting coins based on the merit of their consensus rules and technical features not the ticker or name that they are labeled which is completely arbitrary.

I think they changed their definition of bitcoin to whichever chain has the higher chainwork.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:42:56
It's a matter of opinion. The block period target is a continuum of tradeoff between transaction confirmation delay and soft fork rate. There is no right answer. I think 10 Minutes strikes a good balance. CSW is a fraud a scammer and an complete bullshit artist talking out his ass about changing it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:05:24
Nope. I was aware of him being swatted and I think that's horrible. I feel very sorry for him and I hope the perpetrator is brought to justice.
But that has nothing to do with the content of his post. It doesn't make it any less douchy, and I sure as hell won't apologize or feel guilty about calling out social behavior that is douchy for what it is. Being a legitimate victim of wrongdoing doesn't magically turn you into some sort of hero who is immune from scrutiny. 
Also my opinion that his post is douchy is exactly that: my opinion, and I have a right to it. Feel free to disagree, I can respect that. But I won't feel bad about having an opinion that no one else agrees with, whether it's because they are afraid to criticize someone who is clearly a victim of an unrelated wrongdoing or not.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:54:35
That's true. but I do know at least one thing about this guy, he made an extremely douchy post. The underlying situation in this particular case is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:46:58
Yes it is. but you must make sure breadwallet give you access to the private keys otherwise you will have a hard time spending the BTG. Ususally this will look like a sequence of 12 or 15 english words.

Yes. the market currently values them at 40mBTC (about $240), but no one can say anything about their long term value, we will just have to see what the market eventually settles on: they could fall to zero very quickly if no one is interested in hodling or using them. 
Also yes, it does kind of seem like "free money", that may be one of the reasons why the price ran up to 6k this morning. However remember that *value* is not created from nothing, it requires new investment into combined market cap. Without that, the value of BTG comes directly out of the value of BTC since the combined supply is inflated by a factor of 2 by the fork. That being said, the last Bitcoin hard fork (Bitcoin Cash) held  value itself but did not cause a significant decrease in BTC value, increasing the combined market cap substantially via the fork, so in that case yes it absolutely was "free money" for all BTC hodlers before Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:22:07
not for long.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:19:41
I don't know anything about this guy or what he does/believes in but based on this post alone, holy shit what a douche bag.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:54:32
No! you must withdraw any BTC that is held in your exchange account, and send it to your own personal wallet that gives you exclusive access to the keys. You must do this before 20171025 to receive the free Bitcoin Gold. If you leave the BTC on the exchange or sell it to anyone else before the fork time you will not be awarded any Bitcoin Gold and the exchange will claim the Bitcoin Gold that otherwise would have been awarded to you if you had the control of the keys.
This is not specific to GDAx or any other exchange. **All** Bitcoin addresses will be copied into Bitcoin Gold on 20171025.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:40:13
No, not if the Bitcoins **reside** on the exchange account at the time the fork occurs. 
If the Bitcoins reside in your **own personal wallet** at the time the fork occurs, then you **will** be awarded an equal amount of free Bitcoin Gold, regardless of the source of the coins. It does not matter what exchange you got them on or who held them before you. 
In otherwords: sign into your exchange account and withdraw all your BTC before 20171025. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:52:16
Well you're wrong. I'm judging him based on a post that he made which was incredibly douchy. I was aware that he was swatted and that's despicable, but that doesn't make his post less douchy, nor does it make me an asshole for thinking that it's douchy.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:55:06
