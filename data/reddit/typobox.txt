Nobody asked how to load the file in a VM!

From the article... Actually seems like that's not the case here.

.25BTC from the Blockchain iOS app.  (Total transaction was just under 1BTC including change output.)

I hate you for reminding me about those.  I really do.

Had no idea they were in Leawood.  I drive by that area all the time...

Freezing will work sometimes, but please, *please* do not do this if there is any chance that you're going to want to use a professional data recovery service afterwards.  In other words, don't freeze a drive unless you are ready to give up on it and do not want to put any money into recovering the data.  You run a significant chance of permanently ruining the drive by doing this.
Still, as a last-ditch effort, it's not half bad.  Just make sure you fully understand what you're doing before going there.

Once you get your first confirmation, the rest will come every ~10 minutes (each block that is subsequently mined).

Interesting... the transaction just disappeared from blockchain.info entirely.

Welcome to Bitcoin, enjoy the ride.

I guess it's possible that it was while things were still affected, though I thought the storm had passed by then.  Was about 0330 GMT on 3/13.

I live in north KCMO and this is awesome news.  If I hadn't just bought a car in October I would jump all over this.  Thank you so much for contributing to the community in such a huge way.

Yeah, the transaction (at the time) was visible from both the iOS app and the web interface, across restarts and whatever else.  Didn't get a chance to check it in the other direction, though I did know that the transaction showed up on blockchain's global list of unconfirmed transactions.
The transaction coincidentally purged itself from blockchain shortly after I made this post, oddly enough.  I re-sent it and it confirmed almost immediately.

Woke me up too.  Laughed so hard, then went back to sleep.
