Hopefully Barclays stop being so hostile towards Bitcoin related bank accounts then :)

Ignore the warning and try and link a card anyway, it should let you. You'll need a "Routing code" if it's a bank account though (should be able to find this on google or by contacting your bank)

Thanks for all the hard work Mycelium team! If you add alt-coin support in the future then there's no need to meet and exchange cash when trading between them - you could have the first decentralized, secure, crypto to crypto exchange :)

Excellent news, now I can sell my old mining GPUs directly for Bitcoin :D

Annoying, must just be UK for now :(

You should be able to use the invite link they gave out in [this thread]( - just click the link and then the "register" button on bitvc.com, it won't ask you for an invite code.

Yeah, but that title is a bit much isn't it? Although not as bad as some of the headlines I'm expecting tomorrow...

Twitter are finalising a deal with Stripe at the moment - Bitcoin tipbot anyone?

Yes this is very annoying, even more so when I was using the site on my mobile and couldn't find the option to revert back to English. Paging @_date: 2014-09-29 15:25:52
Ignore the warning and you should be able to to link/purchase with a card, but linking a bank account requires a "routing number" which you can find online or from your bank.

It should work ok for UK residents too (ignore the message about not supporting banks/cards outside of the US), and you can change the currency denominations in the settings tab.

Localbitcoins, or easiest is Circle
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:51:42
Whilst I find it funny, I do think it's a bit unprofessional
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:24:31
I just tweeted this thread to hopefully he can get involved :)
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:28:32
+1 for Circle
I used LocalBitcoins before this but Circle is a lot easier to use and offer better rates. Got my Visa debit card linked and first coins purchased within 20 minutes of signing up :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:35:26
Yes it is technically possible, but shouldn't be done as it will mess with the [fungibility]( of the currency.

My bad, I didn't read the OP properly :)

Circle should accept your debit card without any other verification details
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:12:16
I recommend Mycelium if you have an android phone, it's easy to use and has some nice features like cold storage spending and watch addresses

Ah sorry I didn't realise! Kinda strange though considering the US must be a much bigger market...

You can get them from Amazon, if you can somehow get a gift card paid for with Bitcoin

Paging - are you guys working on any of these features?
