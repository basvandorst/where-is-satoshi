The news was not fake, just asinine reporting. 
The thing is that you can find a politician SOMEWHERE that wants to ban ANYTHING. That doesn't mean the government is going to ban it. That is why its "fake news". 
Then when it actually comes to a vote it may pass or may not pass by one vote. 
Then even if it does pass it might be overthrown by the courts.......

To rate your life based on opportunity cost is illogical. Everyone "lost billions" because they didn't create Amazon.
One of the best things about Bitcoin is that it doesn't have to be a career. Even though I research crypto every day it doesn't take much time away from my career. 
Although Bitcoin is my plan ฿ and my career is plan A, Bitcoin has been more entertaining and profitable!!!! 
You have to have a diverse skill set and portfolio!!! A hacker can steal your money, but a hacker can't take your skills.
In the wise words of CyptoDaily, 
["Let me tell you something you already know. Cypto isn't all about sunshine and Lambos. It's a very mean and volatile place and I don't care how to tough you are. It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it! But it ain't about how hard you hit! It's about how hard you can get hit and keep on HODL'N! How much you can buy and keep on HODL'N. That's how winning is done! Now if you want to sell go ahead and panic sell. But you gotta be willing to HODL the dips and not point fingers saying 'YOU AIN'T WHERE YOU WANNA BE BECAUSE OF THIS ICO OR THAT ICO, OR ANYTHING!!!'. Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that.](

No one. Decentralization is not a 100% advantageous. It has advantages and disadvantages. 
The poorer people's ability identity anything in crypto, the lower the value crypto has. 
If the blockchain couldn't identify people's private keys, crypto's value would be zero. 
If the blockchain couldn't identify transactions, crypto's value would be zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:13:34
Before I tell you have to know a lot of things.
When somebody asks you "What are you in to?", there are two very different kinds of people who ask you "What are you in to?" People who want to know what television shows you watch, and people who don't give a damn what you like!!! What the second kind of people are really asking "what do you learn about that makes you more money and what knowledge can they soak from you to make me more money!?". If you haven't met the second kind of person (OR THINK YOU HAVEN'T) you need to revaluate your life. 
(To give a anecdote, I knew this career women who is nice during introductions, but is mean behind your back. She made fun of a coworker for being broke, short and 'doing nothing but salsa dancing'. She asks "What are you into" to everyone. If you say anything other than "make money" she thinks you are a loser. She is a awful person, but she got a great job by doing lunches with career oriented people.)
You have to research and think about those people in mind. (Never give people advice! Even to these people. People will follow advice 1% and blame you 100%) Just give knowledge!
Before you research crypto you have to understand money. If you don't understand the history of money and crypto's role in commerce than you are being foolish.
You also have to realize just because a product's fundamentals are good, that isn't the only thing that makes a product succeed. Its about also about what people think will succeed. There is a difference. 
There is also the concept of the price being baked into a crypto. Lots of people buy on prospects rather than achieved goalposts. People buy the rumors and sell the news. 
I recommend reading "The History of Money" by Jack Weatherford.
After that I would research [foreign exchange market (Forex).]( (where people trade fiat currency)
Then I would research stock market technical analysis. I would suggest "Charting and Technical Analysis" by Fred Mcallen.
Then finally read Bitcoin's white paper. 
No one can consistently day trade, so I would follow market sentiment rather than anyone putting anything on a chart. You have to be predictive rather than reactive or else you are buying high and selling low. Because of these things I recommend no one!!! But these people are also part of market sentiment so listen to them as well. 
It's a mixture of predicting and judgement public sentiment 
So this where I am.... I am not a crypto guru yet...
I am going to read "The Internet of Money" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos then I am going to read "Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos even if I can only program very little. 
I would also recommend going to [Investopedia](

This is not about the chinese, its about the chinese government. 
We are not locking anyone out. The chinese governement is locking people out. 


I know, that was the biggest reason why I had Litecoin. It was popular with the chinese because the creator is chinese and his brother had a huge chinese exchange. I was excited by the chinese market. When the chinese government halted exchanges it particularly messed with Litecoin, and wrecked my holdings. (I still have my Litecoins though. I hodl'ed through the panic.)

Mainstream adoption and futures market. Also 70% in a month is not out of the ordinary for Bitcoin. 1000 dollars differences are not high amounts anymore when we are talking about 11k versus 12k.  


Sorta, certain countries are more bullish than others. Think of time zones. When is morning for you and the rest of the world?


There is a how and a why. Its the same for any product.
The why is, people's subjective value in the product, people's subjective belief in the product, the utility of the product, competition, market health, etc. 
The how is interplay of buyers, sellers, and users. For bitcoin it happens on Kraken, Poloniex, Binance, Coinbase, paperwallets, stores, or people trading in person with paper wallets to whatever currency. The users decides the price. 
Anything with a price fluctuates bellow and above the sustainable price.

This matters a lot.
First off if I sold you PS4s and you got dead hamsters we would not be having this conversation.
Decentralization is not a 100% advantageous. It has advantages and disadvantages. Dealing with the actual product/company you want is a problem in the real world. Trademark is pretty discrete in the real world, but there are problems all the time.
If crypto solution to trademarks, legitimacy, and fraud amounts to some guy saying "What does it matter? Some people call it a couch and some people call it a sofa", this only amounts to crypto being less valuable.
The blockchains very existence is to verify and log, not to fudge or have ambiguity. If Satoshi said tomato tomatoe for transactions none would be here.
*edit apparently I need to start selling PS4s... 
What is the purpose of downvotes? Some people gave me a upvote and some people gave me a downvote. Why do votes mater? Its almost like you are trying to label and communicate something..... Some people have no sense of irony....

Yes, your comment is meaningless. Anytime you buy anything with anything you loose opportunity cost.
