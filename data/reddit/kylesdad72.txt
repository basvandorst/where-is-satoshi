You still avoid the one question - what are the metrics that you're using to decide success or failure?  You've already told me it's neither a currency nor an investment and therefore should not be judged on the criteria normal for those.
So what is it?  Open my eyes and show me the potential.  
We heard "2014 is the year of bitcoin!" and "10000 by Christmas!" and "TO THE MOON!" and none of those things happened.  And now you're cheering 2015 is the year of bitcoin.  This isn't a matter seeing potential.  *You moved the goal posts.*  What are the new goal posts?  What is the metric of success?

The number of wallets doesn't matter as I can create them all day long. 
The merchant numbers are absolutely meaningless because it doesn't mean how much of them actually get revenue in bitcoin or how much.  Just because DirectTV takes bitcoin doesn't mean they get bitcoin.
ATMs are also meaningless without discussing how much traffic they are generating and receiving.  
4% growth in media mentions?  i'd wager Blackberry, a near dead brand, grew more.
Hashrate means nothing.  It just means more people are mining with more expensive equipment.  Same thing for github updates.  Commits don't mean success, commits mean someone checked something in.  
If this is the measure a success, I hate to see how they measure failure.

I don't really know how big the risk is but I can tell you I don't think long-term this will be worth a lot of income.  Let's try to take this complex system and simplify it a bit.  
Let's call your cost to buy the unit $X.  If you assume price and difficulty stay constant, your electricity remains free and your unit doesn't break each day past 113 will net you $X/113.  I could be wrong but I think that breaks down to 0.88% profit each day all factors remain constant.
If the difficulty double halfway to day 113, let's say day 57, you end up with another 112 days to break even.  And that's if it stays the same.  Does it mean it'll increase by 100%?  Probably not.  Let's say 10% - you go from 56 days to 62 days.  What if halfway through that it increases 10%?  31 days becomes 34 days.  Your initial 113 day break even is now 153 days, and your profit after day 153 is more like 0.65% per day.
If the difficulty decrease halfway through, it's just the opposite effect.  You end up with a quicker break even and more profit after the fact.  
Prior to December, there hasn't been a drop in difficulty since before 2013 [source](  Is it likely to continue to drop?  Maybe.  It might drop a bit more but I don't see it going much lower personally.
We haven't even begun to talk about price yet.  Bitcoin seems to be staying in the 300-350 range.  Could it do another massive jump?  Maybe.  If it does it's a double edged sword.  Not only will you be able to sell for more, but people will crank up the mining.  More profit to be had means more mining to be done.  If it goes down, the difficulty might go down.
Finally, I'd look at the rig you're looking at.  Are people happy with them?  What's the mean time before failure?  What happens if it breaks?  Will the company replace it quickly and if not, will they replace it with something better?
In the end, only you can decide what risk you can absorb.  I'm not familiar with your finances and what you have put away if thinks go bleak.  You *might* make some money with it but the odds are not in your favor however fortune does favor the bold.  
Will it be a long-term money printing machine?  No.  It'll die long before that or fall back in processing power sooner than later.  If it were me, I'd invest in a stock with consistently high dividend yields and just buy some bitcoins to play with.

I haven't paid a single fee to my banks this year.  I have not paid a single ATM fee.  I realize I am a single entity but most of my friends fall into the same category.  A few pay ATM fees.  
As a store of wealth, this year bitcoin has been terrible.  A person who stored their wealth there would have lost 40-50% of their money.  A person who held it in a basic saving account would have earned 0.50%.  A person who invested in a stock like Microsoft would've seen a 30% growth and 2.6% in dividends.  [Source]( 


The average Joe doesn't care about bitcoin and I'm right.  How do I know?  The average Joe doesn't use bitcoin.  Do you know why?  Because it's too complicated.  It's too risky.  The average Joe doesn't want to watch his money lost 50% YTD and the average Joe doesn't want to spend his time securing his PC against every attack vector.  Survey 100 people on the street in any town and ask them to tell you what an attack vector is.  I'd be surprised is 20% get it right.
Money motivates people but people are lazy.  They want the path that costs them the least amount of resistance.  They don't want to learn about hot and cold wallets.  They don't care what a public or private key is.  People want to make it rich easily not jump through hoops.


And how many people own how many % of the bitcoin?  Let's say tomorrow morning we wake up and bitcoin is the new currency.  You think there isnt' a wealth divide?  You think there's isn't "poor" anymore?  All you have done is shift it to a select few.  The poor will still be poor.


Of what?  How have banks hurt you?  How much in fees have you really paid?  Or are you just reciting rhetoric?

So, what happens if your mortgage or costs are $1000/month, and you price it for $1000/month in BTC.  What happens when the price drops?  Are you going to accept the loss?

How will bitcoin fix pricing run by private companies?  


My neighbor, a fedex driver who thinks you use bluetooth to stream netflix from your computer to your DVD Player, has heard of bitcoin.  It was written up in an article in Rolling Stone.  It has been on the news.  There are lot of places people can hear about it.  People just don't care.


It's not even the buying and selling that's a problem.  It's the keeping it secure.  


Like?  A lot of things performed well this past year too.  


And yet, major investors tend to stay away from this.


They won't?  How so?  Will they have more money to save?  Will that money earn more interest?  Will they have access to the basic necessities at least cost?  Will healthcare cost less?  Will food cost less?  Explain to me how the poor suddenly stop becoming poorer in this new system?  
Let's think about it this way.  Joe has 1 bitcoin.  He's poor.  Joe lives paycheck to paycheck.  He *needs* to spend that bitcoin *now*.  His kids need to eat, his rent needs to be paid.  Sure, tomorrow it will be worth twice as much but that won't do him any good if his kids are dead.  But let say he figures out how to do with only a 0.5 bitcoin, now he's richer because that 0.5 spends just like 1, right?  Do you think prices stay the same?  You think that the food and rent he paid 0.5 BTC will still be 0.5 BTC tomorrow?  No.  Those prices will rise too.  


Are you kidding me?  Seriously?  You said "**I love a good debate, which means I love hearing both sides of the argument.**".   You want to debate, I'll debate.  You don't get to cry the I'm picking everything apart.  Defend your point.


It shows.  My advice - grow some hair on your balls, get a real job, spend a few years actually seeing the world before you deem it as fucked.  Maybe you'll realize that you're being spoonfed bullshit because you're willing to eat it.


You don't know what fucked is.  I had a coworker who grew up communist-era Russia.  Another coworker complained about the US government.  He talked about how the US was a totalitarian regime against its own people.  My russian coworker looked at him and became to rip into him.  She talked about how friends of hers were kidnapped by the government in the middle of the night because they spoke out against Mother Russia.  She talked about trouble makers got sent off to labor camps.  I don't think he ever understood her point.  I don't think he ever wanted to see her point but hopefully you will.  You literally to do not know what fucked means.  Trust me, you never want to see it.

To make money, of course.  A wealthy investor could easily play the market buy buying in at some amount, invest a huge amount driving up transaction volume which could in turn drive a price increase.  As long as the increase in their investment is more than they spent to increase transaction costs they profit.

The other option is a lot of small wins to make big wins.  Even if you only make 0.01BTC on a buy/sell loop, if you repeat that enough it'll add up.  Even more so if you can automate it.  It really is no different than the stock exchange in that regard.

Adoption is a key metric but how do you measure it?  Coinmap.org isn't 100% accurate.  There are businesses listed that no longer take it and there are business that do accept it that aren't listed.  And that only paints a part of the picture.  One million businesses could accept it but if the total revenue generated is $100 is that adoption?
And cash can be measured with profit and loss.  Bitcoin can be measured the same way for a business except I'm guessing most business aren't breaking that out.  If they are that's a go-to statistic and I'd love to see it.

No.  I started in bitcoin just when mining was becoming impossible for the little guy.  This isn't a movement about freeing currency.  This isn't a chance to change the world.  Do you Mt. Gox, Neo &amp; Bee, and all the other scams were just singular occurrences?  Do you think it was just coincidence they showed up?
It's everything they claim to be fighting against.  It's greed.  It's scams.  It's thieves.  It's the worst of the worst taking an unregulated economy and raping it time and time again.  As long as there's someone to hold onto the bag, they'll give it to you.  They'll tell you you're fighting a war against the rich when in fact all you're doing is giving scam artists a few more bucks.  
If you want to invest, invest but treat it like a penny stock.  Put no more than you can afford to lose, avoid emotional decisions and remember that there are people much smarter than you just watching and waiting to take your money from you.  
I haven't lost anything.  I invested next to nothing and pulled a little less.  Best of luck to you.

It didn't have to be.  You know why?  If there's three exchanges selling a commodity and one of them is priced higher than the others, the other adjust because arbitrage.  People will buy the commodity on the cheaper exchange and resll it on the more expensive exchange.  In turn, the price on the non-corrupted exchange will also increase to match demand.  


It didn't.  Did you know that pets.com received more venture capital than all of bitcoin startups combined?  Venture capital doesn't mean success.  It just means there's funds there.  
Let's discuss those companies.  PayPal takes it for very small and finite subset of products sold using PayPal.  Have they released numbers yet?  
How about Microsoft!  What advantage, outside of cashing out, does buying xbox bucks with bitcoin have?  None.  If I have credit card, I'd best to use that.  If I don't want Microsoft to have that number or I only have a bank account, I can give it to PayPal.  If I hate PayPal, I can go buy cards at the grocery store.  
And Time..oh!  Bitcoin will the saving grace of print media..
You forgot someone!  Overstock!  3-million in sales.  1-million of that took place within the first two months of adoption.  Only 11,000 customers paid that way.  Visa processed will process that today alone.  
That leads me to another point - it has been five years and bitcoin still has not processed as many transactions as credit cards do in one day.  And that's even including all the transactions that aren't even an exchange of good or services.   That is adoption.


So what is the real use of bitcoin?  Enlighten me.  Tell me how to measure the success or failure of it.

I really don't know what to say to that. While my wife doesn't quite understand all of why and how I invest she at least understands the overarching goals of what I'm doing.  
If the money you're using is both of yours and has a risk of impacting future financial goals you should talk to her about it.  She doesn't need to understand the blockchain or the history of bitcoin but she should be aware of the fact that you are investing a part (at least, I hope it's a part) of your future in a high risk investment.  
As I said, my wife doesn't always know all the details but she has a general idea.  I also talk to her about when I make risky bets, let her know why I made it, how much I did and what my tripwires are (both high and low).  
Remember, you're a partnership.  It's not just about the I anymore.

No.  It's not a good tip.  Is there any proof to Wall Street being interested?  So far they've avoided it with a 100' pole and don't show any signs of stopping.  Does bitcoin and regulation work?  Isn't the dream they sell that this is an anonymous decentralized market?  Why would involving wall street suddenly make that better?
I feel like you came here to feed your confirmation bias.  You want people to tell you you're about make the right decision and that's dangerous.  Just ask yourself before you invest any money, how will you feel about it in 10-months and 10-years if it goes to shit and you lose it?

You mean a currency feeling the pain of a psychotic leader causing economic sanctions against his country?
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:07:27
This is the most rational response I've had!


The problem is with transactions is a transaction in bitcoin isn't necessarily the transfer of money for goods and services.  It can be the repositioning of cold and hot storage funds.  It can be me being bored and decided to flood random transactions to myself.  It just doesn't matter.  
Adoption by companies *is* a good metric but it's only part of the equation.  Flooz and E-Gold, among others, were all adopted by companies but if they're not processing transactions using it then it is meaningless.  
There's a pattern I see with bitcoin adoption and companies.  Company A (big or small) announces they now accept bitcoins.  For a period of time, two months in many cases, they see a surge in volume as people shop there and then suddenly it's dead.  Overstock saw 33% of it's transactions in the first 3-months of the year.  66% took place over the remainder.  The total for all that?  $3,000,000 moved.  My math be off here, but for [2013]( Visa processed $1.1 **T**rillion dollars of transactions in *one* quarter.  Assuming 90-days for the quarter, that's over a billion dollar in transactions a day.  


I'll give you that.  It has improved.  I don't think it's improved enough.  If you want users to use it, it should be seamless and easy.  They shouldn't have to be concerned with hackers just waiting for them to mess up random number generation.  They don't want to worry about wild price-swings affecting their shopping ability.  They just want to buy their milk and eggs.
There's a long way to go here.  People do not complexity while shopping.


Regulation can't stop it but it can hurt it.  It could enough red tape on it that it is even more difficult to use, carry, etc.  My thought here is once you start to regulate it you ultimately take away what makes it different than a credit card, wire transfer, or even cash.


No regulation is worse than that.  No regulation means Mt. Gox will happen again because there is no governing body auditing things.  No regulation means there won't be protections for consumers who are scammed.
This is where I think the disconnect for bitcoin and adoption happen.  The average person does not care about fractional reserve lending.  They care that when they buy something they get what they said they were going to get at the price they were told they were getting it at.  
The shopkeeper does't care that he has to wait two days to get the money from the credit card because he's already built around that.  He doesn't care about the fee, he's built around that.  What he does care about is the fact he takes in $100 and that at the end of the day it's still worth $100.

I don't know.  I'm throwing out speculation here but what if tomorrow people say a 20% growth in transactions.  What would happen?
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:55:23
is correct.  It is very unbecoming of changetip to be airing such information and accusing me so.   while I did talk about being banned, I never said why and nor does it give the right for a company to start spreading information about what transacts between us in a public forum.  
Perhaps it's time I speak to my lawyer.  Thank you .
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:13:17
And this is why transaction volume is meaningless. You know what is sad though?  In five years, even with all these fake transactions, bitcoin still does not have as many transactions as one day if credit cards.

@_date: 2014-12-23 17:24:56
Are you accounting for difficulty increases?  If tomorrow, the difficulty increases by 10%, your profits will decrease.  Yes, the difficulty dropped recently but that doesn't mean it'll drop the next time or the time after.  It might, it might not.  
What about if the price goes down or up?  What's the best case scenario you expect from the price in the next 113-days vs the worst case?  If you do have to deal with your worst case scenario, how much longer does it take to break even?  How much shorter is the best case to break even?
What about a combination of the two events?  Can you afford to be out the money for a 113-days or longer?
What happens if the unit breaks before the break-even point?  What happens if you suddenly become responsible for electricity?
I'm not saying it's a bad idea.  It could very much work out in your favor but are you able to absorb the loss if it doesn't and have you calculated all the risks?  It's easy with confirmation bias to ignore the fact the difficulty could go up or the price could go down but you should be thinking of those.
Ask yourself - if in 4 months you don't break even how screwed are you?  What about in the even longer-term like 40-months?  Does this affect your ability to buy a home, a car or feed yourself or your family?
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:43:37

Can you show me stats on adoption growth?  Can we then compare that to e-gold, flooz, and the other multiple of web currencies that no longer exist?  
And what's new with development?  Some wallets?  A decentralized ebay that's pretty damn difficult for the common man to use?

Solution to what?  World peace?  Wolrd hunger?


Or they just don't care.  In the global economy, the unbanked have bigger problems than moving money and the banked just don't care enough to deal with the difficulties of using bitcoin.


The problem is this is often viewed by people as cultish or evangelism.  Nothing will turn people off quicker than that.  
 &gt; TL;DR The success of Bitcoin is **inevitable**, we just need to do our part to spread the word!
I don't think you're using that word correctly.  Bitcoin may be successful but I doubt it's inevitable.  Blockchain technology, sans bitcoin, is much more likely to survive and become an integral part of daily life than bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2015-01-03 22:32:28
I believe that a few months of silence may be the best thing but it could also be the worst thing.  During that time, companies can focus on innovating based of what they saw with bitcoin and other payment technologies (apple pay, for example) and might even come up with something graet.
The question is can bitcoin survive without the constant cheering crowd or will it just fade to obscurity like flooz or egold?  And how long until there really is a problem that only bitcoin can solve?  If it goes too long, it'll find behind in all things and ultimately be left behind.

You might not want to take business advice from me since I'm a troll and all, but I see two things.
One, that's not a funny joke especially when it has the potential to cost you business.  What if he thought it was funny to put up something like, "I hate crypto!" or "Now with 10% more scam".  You might want to get that under control.  What if he's left other things around for your customers to find?
Two, the link where it says "CRYPTOMADEMAN Approves" takes you to HashTalk where it shows unfaltering support for Paycoin.  That's a direct link *from your site* and thus looks like an endorsement.  I'm not saying it, I'm just saying that's how its perceived.
As I said, I'm just a troll but you seem reasonable and I think you're getting shit on unfairly.  Take my advice for what you want...

That depends on what you want to get out of it.  If you're looking to ride a wave to the moon, it's very possible you're too late.  The bubble has popped and continues to deflate.  Others will argue that you're too early, and you just need to hold on for a few years.  Either could be true.
If you're looking to send money to people across the world quickly and regularly, it's a pretty good technology for that.  Are you currently doing this and having issue with your current technology?  If so, the answer may be yes.  Just remember to compare apples to apples.
If you're looking ot buy things you'd not want associated with your credit card and don't want to buy in back alleys, it's also good for that.  Is it good for general commerce?  Maybe.  If you already have it, sure it's great but I don't know if it's worth the effort to try to buy just to pay for something.
Long and short, you got to decide.  Look at both the good and the bad.  Personally, bitcoin offers me no advantage over credit cards, paypal or cash.  I don't believe in it as a revolution against banks because I have no issues with banks.  I don't see it as an investment because it's far too risky.
Of course, I'm a troll so take what I say with a grain of salt if you like but unlike others I have no vested interest in if you buy-in or not.
tl;dr Who knows, buy-in if you want to but don't spend more than you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2015-01-21 19:28:52
Depends on what you want out of it.  
Do you want to become rich by 'investing'?  No, I'd avoid it. I doubt the massive spikes of yesteryears will happen again, and if they do, it won't be for a long time.  
If you're interested in it, put a few bucks in.  It's neat, but is it life changing?  No.  I don't pay interest on my credit cards, I don't pay fees to my bank and I don't want to deal with being my own bank.  To me, in the end, it's not worth the hoops I'd need to jump through just to buy stuff in the places I already buy stuff.  Add in the volatility and then there's really no reason for me to use it.
Of course, you *should* be the one to decide.  Look at the good and the bad, ask yourself how would you feel if you lost all the money you put into it, ask yourself how would you feel if you made it rich from it, and figure out what risk you're willing to take.

Arbitage.  If one exchange is up, they all go up. They equalize. Of course one bot can do that without much work.

Price down, issues with deposits. Are we looking at a major failure coming?  Have they ever been audited?

I agree that it's better to load risk earlier in life than later but in this case it sounds like he doesn't have a stable base.   What happens tomorrow if their income goes to zero?  How long can they survive and how quickly will they need the money?
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:41:08
Since you were so polite, I'll say yes.

Thieves used to steal cabbage patch kids and furbies but I don't see either of them being a currency today.
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:00:33
It is literally the only thing bitcoin is useful for that cash, credit card, paypal, western union, etc can't do better or with less risk.

It's only 80% as filling as it was yesterday. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:13:33
This is probably a bad game.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:57:53
Oh!  That's right everyone who has bitcoin right now is up 4000%, right?  No?  But surely you expect 8000% growth by the end of 2014, right?

7 transactions per second is more like a crawl towards that goal. But hey, it's a good start. It's better than 6!

All the technology in the world doesn't matter if tuners don't want it.  And that's the problem bitcoin faces.  It doesn't solve any problems *an average person* cares about.  Most people don't have issues with transferring money between friends, most people don't care that there's interest on their credit cards, not everyone needs to send money across the world instantly, and most people don't want to be their own bank.  
I'm not saying bitcin doesn't have utility.  It does.  It can behave like a currency, but if you're not already invested with it there's no reason to buy into it just to buy Xbox live points or stuff from overstock.  And because of that the average person most likely will never use it.  
I think the one true killer app it has right now is facilitating black market exchanges

Happy new year to you as well!

Who was the auditor?
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:27:31
I'll make it easier for him!  [Here]( are my comments.  [Here]( are my submissions.  
He can choose to ignore everything I say, but unlike most people in this thread I have nothing to gain.  I'm not trying to lure in new customers.  I'm not trying to scare people away.  I even pointed out some positive uses of bitcoin in my original post. 
And instead of engaging his question, you just threw some money at him and told him to *do it!*.  No "here's some good and bad", or "here's what people might say" or "what do you think you're late for?"   Nope, just sell him the product and hope he buys it.
I am a troll.  I am probably even an asshole.  But at least I'm honest with my advice.
@_date: 2015-01-01 02:49:14

She mentions that she's excited about it but with no reason why than a company received money.  I'm interested in a discussion.

Next you can host parties where you talk about how awesome your job is and try to get other people to join your "network". Each time someone on your network signs up a business you get a small cut. Then they start to have parties and you get a cut from their cut of their recruits revenue. You could do this for many levels and be rich in no time!

Go ask Ross how anonymous bitcoin is right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:18:01
Maybe but generally I'd say doubtful right now. Most modern browsers should be better than that.

If you have to ask "Am I too poor for [insert risky investment here]?" the answer is yes.  This goes for penny stocks, this goes for junk bonds, and so-on.  If you don't have at least a few months of savings you should be focusing on that, not speculative investments or gambling.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:37:13
I kind of look like that only different.

In my entire life, there has never been a situation that I have needed my bank opened for hours it was not already open.  Between credit cards, debit cards, ATMs, cash on hand, PayPal and online banking I've just never had a problem that I couldn't solve.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:52:23
Do you have a stat to quote on that or are you pulling that from thin air?
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:32:30
Why not put it into savings bonds, saving accounts, stable ETFS, dividend stocks or anything else that might actually be stable for the next year?
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:22:56
What about 4?  That's elmos favorite number.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:35:04
This.  This.  This.  The root problem most people have is bad personal finance.  Investing in bitcoin isn't a good idea if you're not already stable.  Same thing with high risk stocks, same thing with junk bonds, and so on.  Personal finance and security first, risk later.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:37:30
Well that's not very nice.  I don't think you're an idiot nor did I call you any names.

Why show it?  Unless it's face to face no one will notice the delay.

Build it into the app/wallet rather than block chain. User chooses a time frame and the transaction is delayed by that long before the all actually sends it.
