Yes, but you've sold the bitcoin and it gets transferred to the buyer of the contract, so why would you care? That was the whole point.


If you buy a contract, you don't put up BTC as collateral, you put up USD.
I think the author is not aware of how futures contracts work.

Yeah I heavily disagree. JS is mandatory for web applications, so yes, it's an incredibly wide spread and adopted language because most companies have no choice. But that doesn't mean it's a good choice for scripting. Particularly in this case. Why would you care about performance? This is such a simple script, it's not like OP can't wait an extra 50ms.

Stupid that people are down voting you, because you can have your opinion. While I disagree with your choice, there is no absolute truth to what is better. Programming languages are tools, and you can use a screw driver to hammer a nail. I don't prefer to do so, but you're entitled to make that choice.

Curious why you would call Python a sloppy choice and then recommend Javascript? If anything, I would flip that suggest around. Python is a super popular scripting language for a reason.

This is actually a decent metric for "software development", at least you can see the amount of activity and how many people are active contributors.

Lying about fees is a deceitful practice and makes people think Bitcoin txs are way more expensive than they really are.
Just be open about the fees you are charging, don't lie about how you make money. Isn't that part of the reason so many people hate banks?

Link to very bitcoin-friendly infographic?

Not necessarily. It could just be used as a reserve currency with products / coins built on top of the reserves and issued by those who hold the reserves. The underlying bitcoin could be easily verifiable by the issuing bank / organization if they chose to do so, and likely only those who chose to do so will be successful. Unlike other assets based on reserve currencies / gold that are difficult to verify and likely manipulated.
Also LN and second / third layer ecosystems will continue to evolve. This is a feature. The base protocol should be expensive, clunky, and slow. You don't need 10,000,000 nodes (future estimate) to verify and forever keep a record of your coffee purchase. That's insane.


Care to explain why? I think this is an absurd idea. When a newer, harder money is introduced to an economy, it always slowly eats softer money. This is a historical fact and it is almost always non violent.


Why would this be painful? What makes you think this is unprecedented? It happens all the time with generational inheritance from hard working motivated parents to undeserving, lazy children who have never had to work for anything. $32 trillion dollars is in the process of being transferred from Boomers to GenExers right now. Also you contradict yourself on your own point:


These early adopters constantly liquidate as they see astronomical gains will continue to do so. The currently wealthy are already buying. They won't be entirely left behind. There will be a transfer of wealth, but it won't completely inverse and make the wealthy poor. It will just give some power back to some other types of individuals. That's a good thing.

"A **private key** in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin [addresses]( generated for the wallet."
You and the scammer both sent money to the scammer's wallet that was re-skinned to look like you had control. But you never had control.
