We seek refuge on dollars because our currency sucks, as he said on that post our pesos lose like 40-50% year over year.. when dollars remains the same... and thats why we buy them (we are not even talking if we want to travel, taking pesos with you will be worthless, the exchange rates are hilarious on any other country, it's like carrying toilet paper).

Check your email and try to find out which pool site you used! That's where I would start..

couldn't agree more!
someone just gave me $2 worth of LTC and now I can't stop thinking about getting home (at work currently) and claiming my price! lol
I don't have any BTC though, but I might convert this later.

Please let me know what happened with your money, I was thinking of using OKpay in the near future, hope you get all this sorted out.
