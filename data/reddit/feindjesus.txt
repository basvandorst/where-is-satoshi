Maybe if you go through an exchange like binance. there are other means to get 1 satoshi such as through a DEX. Waves Tr fees are 1/3 of a cent and no minimum transaction size.

Dont be lazy it took many hours to be proficient. top 3
2.Reddit (coin specific info good place to find whitepapers)
3 bitcoin wiki (a little outdated just depends on the information you need)
Ps if you don’t want to find the research pay some bozo 3k to take their class

One idea that comes to mind is look for exchanges that have fixed transaction fees and do not discount for high volume. Even paying 0.25 % transaction fee really adds up

TA cant predict anything but it can identify specific market scenarios that have a higher probability of one outcome versus another and using a correct risk management strategy will allow you to create a profitable strategy.

Name 1 ICO in the last year that it is critical for them to have their own coin. Meaning they have done something that so different it cannot be handled by another blockchain

Ive built GPU miners in the past. The only thing I can think off is make sure to do a power consumption calculation before getting started it seems like that miner could be over 2000w potentially too powerful for residential breaker. Another issue you may run into is mining software. Honestly its been a couple of months for me but i know most popular mining softwares have limitations for max amount of gpus. As well id recommend closed case over open (sizable temperature improvement). If you have some questions feel free to dm me. i also have some AMD RX580s still in the box if you need help getting gpus.

In order to mine a block you take sha256hash(hash of the previous transactions + timestamp + nonce). Lets say the nonce=x a random selected number,  0000&lt;x&lt;9999. So therefore it will guess over and over until all options failed than it it will use a new timestamp. The network difficulty is constantly adjusted so the time between blocks is 10 minutes. If network difficulty is 100 then any hash &gt;100 can win a block. Finally the timestamp doesnt have to be exactly on time lets say their is a 20 minute grace period so as long as a miner is using a timestamp within the grace period the block can still be valid. Since block 551218 is from btc.com (mining pool) and has zero transactions. They started mining before a miner started on block 551217. They ignored all transactions because if they accidentally include a transaction from block 551217 then their solved block would be invalid and discarded by the network. My understanding might not be 100% correct so if anyone that has more knowledge please correct me. 
Edit: I am incorrect in assuming they started mining the block before the previous block was computed. The clocks of the miners were not in sync as stated by dam76

Thanks for the clarification! I edited my answer
