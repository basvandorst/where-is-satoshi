I cashed out several 100 at the $1200 gox high went all the way down to less than $300, cashed out a few more for a house at $600,  Still got house,  Still got coin to pay for house.... It no big deal plenty of smart people cashed out.. Miners do it every day and the ones holding now are going dump first slide they see.

BCC is a nightmare for any exchange. The main wallet is basically supported by 2 devs who are pushing out patches daily and forcing the entire industry to shutdown for a day mostly because one group of people want to make some new money on a new alt coin.  Most exchange already cant hire support people fast enough and this is just one more piece of shit to deal whit

Bitcoin cash is just an excuse to launch a scummy alt coin of the back of all the hard work and support that has gone into creating bitcoin in the last 7+ years.  It deserves to die a horrible death and its holding the industry at ransom forcing it self onto the markets by way of a hard fork.
