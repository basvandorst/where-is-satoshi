No, obviously they are charging their „richer“ customers even more, just in other ways. But if you dont have anything going on they somehow have to find a way to charge you for their service right?
Banks dont have to offer their service for free. If you dont like it start up your own bank, charge nothing and see where it takes you.

I dont know man he was very informed he described the technicalities of Bitcoin and its current downsides like transaction fees and its inherently inflationary basis that makes it impossible to mass adopt and that it has to be possible to "add more currency" as more people use it. He even made the distinction between traditional Bitcoin and DAG based Cryptocurrencies and explained its differences.
He said he tried it out himself and created wallets and bought and sold some and that Bitcoin is good as a risky speculative object but not as a currency.
