References? I'm interested in this concept but don't find a lot of respectable-looking places to do it with a bit of quick research.

That's an old article from a previous incident, not related to today.  (Way to go BitStamp not putting a date/timestamp on your articles.)

Define "total economic collapse" in your scenario.

[BitQuick.co]( lets you buy BTC with cash deposit at large national banking chains and many credit unions. 2% fee on top of whatever sellers are charging, funds within 3 hours (usually faster) of receipt submission.

Thanks, glad you liked the piece!

Yeah, everything looks legit to me. If an attacker managed to get all of that to check out they've probably got full control and the game is over anyway.  Better to assume it's legit. :)

Check out  for same-day (within 3 hours of uploading a receipt) purchases using cash deposit to major bank chains. Not credit card, but you said and/or instant. :)

If you actually want to make a difference in emerging markets through microloans, check out [Kiva](kiva.org) - you won't get rich, but you will do what BTCJam claims was their mission, with a heck of a lot less risk.

Yeah, I understand trying to prevent a panic, but a little confirmation (or denial) from an alternate source (twitter, website, all of the above) would be nice.

FWIW my Capital One Mastercard is failing - while their app reports they're approving the auth, Coinbase says they're rejecting the billing address (which I've verified is definitely correct), so something appears wonky there too. :|

Use Bitquick.co - deposit cash into a seller's account at a major national bank or credit union, get BTC within hours, often minutes. Prices commonly around 3-5% above Stamp.

Either you get regulation and the traditional banking system, or you get this. Welcome to the free market that is Bitcoin.

Bitquick.co just came back and generally releases within 3 hours for funds deposited with cash at major banks and credit unions across the US. I've traded well over 100 BTC with them and highly recommend their service and support.

"For a profit" is questionable. You have to find and lease the space, deal with any applicable regulations, have plans for theft/replenishment, pay for the actual ATM... it's definitely not easy. Here in Boston I know several attempts to run them have failed. I've considered it but the above factors make it pretty tough to feel confident about making any significant profit.

I'm not sure what you mean by "all that". The 1% arbitrage was essentially nothing but fun, especially since it was volume limited. But it was still essentially free money for very small amounts of time. 
I'm FinCEN registered etc for my LBC trading, which is also probably so small volume as to be not worth it, but again, it's a hobby / interest in supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, and didn't cost me anything but a bit of time for research and registration.

Have you contacted Trezor support? I haven't had hardware issues but when I've contacted them about software things they've been incredibly responsive and helpful.

I checked out bitsquare after several posts here - doesn't seem safe or secure at all, and has virtually no order book in USD. Just looks like a P2P skinning of LBC to me.
