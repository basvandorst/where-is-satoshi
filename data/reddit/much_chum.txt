She's happy now and you'll both be happy in the long run. Sounds like a winner to me!

You actually have a tonne more protection than if you bought on a credit card over £100 (s. 75 etc), meaning the cc companies are potentially more at risk, so I don't blame them for taking this stance as it may actually lose them a lot of money. However, if my bank decided to stop me buying crypto I would leave them within a week.

Does 0.000035200 BCX count?
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:05:50
Exactly. Very early days.

Yeah on a transaction to transaction basis there aren’t many differences regarding fees. The wider viewpoint is the reason we keep having cycles of boom and bust in fiat terms is the debt based banking system and how central banks need to control inflation/deflation to keep it going. That wouldn’t be the case in a crypto/blockchain world. The only reason BTC etc looks volatile is because we constantly look at the fiat equivalent rather than the use case. I’d much rather pay the same amount of fiat in crypto as a fee as it is a universally fairer financial system.

Global debt 300% too. You have to wonder where all those interest payments go to ��

You’re paying the bank for advancing the money to you. Who is getting the benefit of the interest payments on national debt?

Which pinky?

So you’re saying it will gain stability over time? Good. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:34:34
Calm down dear. I didn’t say you were incorrect.

I’m more curious what the guy is hiding between his nipples and bellybutton. Those suds aren’t there for no reason!
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:36:23
Except I didn't. I read it and simplified it. Sorry if I'm not playing your game right.

Some cryptos are better than others
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:07:29
Imagine having to sign up to dial up Internet these days. Nowadays they’re all plug and play pretty much. That’s what we’re after with crypto. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:10:28
So you think it's going down more
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:40:42
Hehe ;)
Unless you control the price your opinion is just an opinion. Your opinion matters, ish, but it can’t hurt folk. If it does they should study more and disprove you or learn why you are right. I hope we’ve hit the bottom but I hoped that at 10k, 8k, 6k...I did see a lot of predictions at the start of this year saying a 3/4K bottom so I’m fingers and toes they were right. However, I’m just enjoying the ride now, wherever it goes I feel like I don’t have much to lose. Que sera sera!

So what’s gonna happen to BTC in 2019/2020?
