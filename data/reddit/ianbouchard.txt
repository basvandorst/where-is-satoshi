I would respectfully submit this is the hipsterization of weed. This is very "recycled paper seasonal menu on a clipboard in a Brooklyn eatery" kinda thing. 
Did they mention fennel? Fennel would seal the deal. Or quinoa.

Bezos is no dummy though. You know it's on his radar and there's an Amazon Bitcoin play in the works

Yes - you certainly should be able to, if someone who mines is considered self-employed. You should be able to write off the electricity used too.

Wow. I'm really proud of you - you didn't use the word "asshat" even once. I couldn't have done this.

$112 on 73k page views works out to about $1.50 CPM. Not sure who you were using for traditional advertising before but I'd think you can monetize better than that with traditional display and PPC ads. Especially given the fact that I don't think it's likely that you'll get a $100 action every month.

Yeah thats in line with what I was expecting. Thanks for sharing. 
However I totally understand OP's point about moving to an ad-free model powered by donations.

How do I compare the processing power (in GH/s) to the current difficulty and hash rate to figure out how productive a miner might be? I know there are calculators out there, but I'm curious to know about what difficulty and hash rate mean and how to read them?

He's prob just trying to drive the price down because he missed the opportunity to buy low

I've got a question more about cryptography in general than just bitcoin specifically but this seems like a good place to ask. 
I've always wanted to know how hashing can be repeatable but also irreversible?
How can distributed parties hash something (email address, credit card etc.) that produces the same result reliably so that a third party can determine if the hashed strings match, but the hashing algorithm is unable to be reverse engineered?
