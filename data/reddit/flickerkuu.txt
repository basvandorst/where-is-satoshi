I can't control others.  Like I said, I warned them, and this is what we get.  The reality is your getting mad at people trying to comfort and help you. It may not seem like much, it may seem like an insult, but you can't change the empathy the Dogecoin community has. They may look like a bunch of jokers coming over here, but go over to the subreddit and see thread after thread labled "we need to help our bitcoin brothers" and "lets start a donation fund for bitcoin".  You guys have a right, or are understandably mad. That doesn't change the attitude of Dogecoiners. They are trying to help the only way they can.  I understand tipping pennies seems like an insult, but where do you draw the line. Do you have an exact donation amount that is NOT an insult? See how that works, you can't just make up a magic amount and tell people I only want that donations, you start to look like an asshole.

I agree about the double spend, but the time it takes to verify the transaction makes a big difference in the "real" retail world. 
You know what else is innovative? Having a big dumb happy dog face on the front. People like safe, familiar things. I know everyone thinks marketing is meaningless, but everyone is wrong. The amount of non-nerd/computer heads getting into crypto is a big innovation. That is something this community is truly blinded about. "Normal" people are afraid to jump into bitcoins. They aren't so afraid of dogecoins. Bitcoiners should be thanking Dogecoiners for this.
 In the end, the general populace has far more "normals" than techno-nerds. If you want your little clubhouse to have more kids in it you better focus more energy on marketing and less on dissing other members of the community.

$800 is for two tickets. Once inside, there is no money exchanged (except for coffee and Ice, which the profits are donated to the local town).
It's a gift community, so if you want a beer at the corner bar, you go in, and ask for a beer. You pay nothing. If you are nice, you might give something back to the bartender. This could be an orange, a home-made necklace, or a tab of X. Who knows. You could also give them a hug. There aren't any rules, per-se about what to give and how.  There are no corporate logos or companies inside. There are no booths selling crap.
There's plenty of free massages, drinks, rides, art, ect. They just don't cost admission or anything. 
$800 is a little light. After you buy gas, food, and shelter to cover yourself in 114F heat- you might run a little higher than $400 ticket + $400 of supplies.

Let me call a whambulance for you. Hey when the internet came out did you complain it was a copy of Aarpnet. Yeah that stupid thing sure didn't go anywhere did it.
You realize Doge is UP on the U.S. Dollar and it's "crashing" on the chart because of bitcoins price and the coupling right? Probably not, that would take a second of thought or research. No chance with you. 
 Some of us who bought around 30 don't think 163 is much of a crash, but hey- you're the "expert"  so you kno everything right?  You sound a little jealous actually, and really young.
 If you don't know the reasons for having bitcoin coin alternatives or the benefits alt coins actually bring to bitcoin than you don't even have the slightest clue about the crypto economy, and because of that I'm done even talking to you.  
I'm guessing it's people like you that make it so everyday a new guy rolls into our subforum saying "Screw those guys, i'm hanging out here."  Yeah, people like you are causing people to unsubscribe here and go hang out where people talk maturely and nice to eachoter- even thought they say "such wow" they still have a multitude of better things than the ignorant vomit that falls from your mouth.  Have a nice day. We're done interacting forever. Tagged as "child mind".

I was working in Vegas and found myself in a club where Tiesto was playing. I had full access to his beers, was inside his VIP section. The only thing wrong was the fact his music sucked.

I shrugged, I agreed, The "billboards top artist" sounded like white noise. Why people like this guy is beyond me.

Yes, I can make stupid correlations just like you. Why are you such a cry-baby that coins are derivatives? Maybe if bitcoin didnt have such a long confirmation time we wouldn't have to.








No, it's my way of usefully judging the value of a coin, instead of pairing it with another volatile entitiy. Try and keep up.




What are you like 12? Calling people a retard is pretty juvenile, and very disrespectful to actual people with disabilities.  You miss the point. You're attitude and some of the attitude of your "friends' are driving people AWAY from your community. What kind of idiot does that? Ask yourself. Bitcoiners are leaving this forum because they don't want to stoop to your level. How is this a good thing for YOUR community? I could give a shit about numbers and reddit, I'm trying to get through your tiny pea brain how some of you are driving people AWAY with your bad attitudes and vitriol.

It's super easy to cry about a solution, but less so to actually do something about it.
You are asking for an almost impossible thing.
You want a decentralized, unregulated currency to be centrally regulated. lolwhut?
If it were "that easy" to fix a 51% attack it would be done.
The question is, should we care?  Why would Ghash destroy it's business to double spend for a few minutes?
This isn't happening. Worrying about a theoretical attack where the attacker needs to spend more resource than he can gain is silly to me.

But it's NOT one miner. It's MANY miners under the control of one POOL. That's a distinct difference because: 
If fishy things occur, miners will leave. They don't have control over that. You are saying that ALL the miners have to conspire in the 51%. I don't buy that happening. People will leave before too much damage is done. The blockchain will notice fairly quickly, so any gains made will be negated by the gains lost by not being trusted anymore. It just doesn't make sense.
Yes, a murder COULD occur because someone has lots of knives. If there is no motive to murdering someone, why would anyone risk all the negatives associated with it and do it when their chance of being discovered is quite high and happens rather quickly. 


I thought it was more like 12, and no one ever gets the % right anyway, but lets say it was 5 days at 60%. Guess what? Nothing happened. There goes the theory. If you are going to say that the sky is falling just because 51% exists, then you also can say when it didn't happen the theory was wrong.
If not when they get 51% then when? Are they "waiting" for the best time to attack? Why not now? See... it's not going to happen. Why would it. No one has shown me a proper motive to even do it. It's still all theoretical. Most of my mind experiments come up with, "who would ever bother doing this?"

@_date: 2014-06-16 22:33:05
Ok, I read the article but it's the same stuff.
The simple argument I have is this: The amount of capital it takes to create a 51% attack is way more than what you could gain, and if you succeeded your "gain" would be devalued by your own success at weakening perception of security.  Who would do that?
The only possible motive for someone wanting to do a 51% attack is destroying the whole bitcoin network in general. To do this, not only do you need some $200million USD of asic hardware that is more than currently even exists, but once you started successfully 51% attacking, the network would notice, and you would be stopped. So that 200 million just went to waste after a few blocks, and the community ignores your fork and carries on.
In both of these scenarios bitcoin continues to exist. In both of these scenarios the attacker gains little to nothing and loses overall. 
I'm not seeing an entity that does something "for the lols" able to come up with 51%. I don't see Ghash, who "kind of controls" 51% going against it's current legal profit stream by suddenly attacking the network. I also don't see someone hacking into Ghashes master server and controlling that, if that's possible- and then if they did we would notice and stop it before any real damage.
The media is mixing up Ghashes pool of thousands of people for "one miner" controlling 51%. It's literally in headlines that "one miner controls half of bitcoin and it's security is already 'shattered' ". That's a laugh if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:30:40

Just because people are posting about it doesn't mean it's happening/ or a problem.
Ghash posted something to dispel the FUD and tried to reason with people as to why it's not really a problem. Just because they posted a response, doesn't mean the other side is correct.

$800? Hmnn. I wish.

Where do you get the "seconds" in digital transactions? To verify the coins are in the address, it takes at least a minute with doge, and probably 10 or more with bitcoin. Without completely destroying the point of digital transactions and working through a third party, a merchant will never be sure in "seconds" if they received the funds.
Lots of normal people take it very seriously. If they didn't there wouldn't be thousands of people throwing thousands of dollars at it, not to mention energy and time building apps, b2b systems, etc.  It's a lot easier to take something seriously when it's friendly and not smug and uninviting. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:24:30


Ok, how does this relate? I can also REMOVE my miner and hashing power if I decide I don't trust them. If the community notices something shady, they will flee. Problem solved. I think this is a good thing? Not seeing your point here. :(


I disagree. Waiting for someone to write something down is not faster. Jokes aside, yes, I really don't believe Ghash or anyone else will act against it's own interest and destroy the system that it profits from. If it does, we will notice before too much damage and no one will use them. Problem solved.


No let's *NOT* say that because it isn't possible. Even if you COULD buy $200,000 worth of ASICS the SUPPLY is not there for your demand. Do you think the whole world will suddenly sell you their ASICS because you asked? Nope. 


About as much as I did before, little to none. I don't need to trust them. I don't use them, and if I did I still wouldn't trust them very much. I store my stuff cold and off line, and if I use an exchange I'm in and out. I don't keep any worthwhile money on a pool, either.  As a user, I don't worry about them very much because of my beliefs, so I don't NEED to trust them at all.


There's a lot of 007 stuff going on there. Sounds like a big if, and I'm not sure how they could trick us all into losing millions of dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:04:08
Some might argue that the massive posts about it also damage the community, and the public's perception of the problem.
I'm not against looking into solutions to a theoretical problem. However, I don't think the amount of sky is falling posts, and horribly mis-informed and incorrectly worded news articles is helping anyone.

Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.
Right now, it locks your drive and that's how you find out about it.
You are asking for a ransomware to be written to just sit dormant for a while and wait for a backup drive to be attached, and then used. No one is going to do that, they are going to hit the drive immediately, or they might get taken out on the next virus scan. Who knows how long until the user backups- maybe a year, maybe never. Ransomware isn't going to wait.
Not saying your scenario is impossible, it's just highly unlikely.
My point was, they can get my computer now and it doesn't matter. I have an unattached drive with my computer on it that is backed up no more than 6 days ago.
They aren't getting to that drive, so I always have that backup ready. No one says I even have to ever put it on that same computer again. The fact is, I have my data in un-encryptable form.

I avoid like the plague but I've caught a bit of story in passing.
I'm in your area, I might like to visit and even document this professionally. 
I'm more interested in the farming than the mining really, but I'm a crypto enthusiast having somehow survived the mt. gox fiasco somehow and was a big bitcoin evangelist early. I still hold 99% of my humble bitcoin. I also run a Dogecoin information site.  
The farming is really interesting, however. Wondering what kind of yields for self-sustainability one could have in a desert.  Good luck with your project!

I had issues getting bitcoins out back in the day. Tried to cash out, right when Wells Fargo froze their 5 million or whatever.  Ended up finally after months re-converting my balance into bitcoin, then sending that to Coinbase, where I cashed out and turned my $50 into $1000.
