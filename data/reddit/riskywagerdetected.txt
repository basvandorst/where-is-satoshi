Why can't there be companies who hold coins for you in an online wallet, and provide an insurance policy keeping them secure, just like a credit card or a bank?

But they can be trusted with cash.  As long as they realize that bitcoins are like cash, should be alright.  There are things like the bitcoin debit card concept that would make things so they don't need a computer in order to use it.

Except this is off-chain transaction so it doesn't bloat the block chain, and furthermore, can happen instantly, not requiring waiting for confirmations.

Ah, that makes sense, so hopefully the merchant would have an account with you, so that the transfer could happen immediately, but you'd still for the sake of transparency put in a transfer on the blockchain?

Couchsurfing forbids monetary gifts, but a token amount just for the novelty of it might be interesting.  There's also ways to send bitcoins to them using their email address (gives them a place to claim their coins).  Cascius coins are interesting, in that it's more than just the money.

I liked the way things were going before the bitcoin foundation tried to wrestle control.  Maybe they should have forked it, hmm?

Well without having gotten buy-in from the early adopters, they declared themselves the official voice of bitcoin, with authority to negotiate with regulators etc. on behalf of bitcoin users.  That's pretty bold (and powerful) to claim they speak for me, when they do not.  In addition, they pay the salary of at least one of the core developers of the bitcoin protocol, and you must acknowledge the phrase, "don't bite the hand that feeds you."

NewEgg has fanatic users.  Bitcoin also has fanatic users.  These groups overlap.  By accepting bitcoin, NewEgg would achieve legendary status among computer nerds by being the first major retailer to take bitcoins for electronics purchases.

Such things don't exist yet, but conceptually, I believe this would be the way for those who are not computer literate.

The way I see it, the number one use of bitcoin is routing around absurd government regulations.  This includes moving money oversees (getting around capital controls),  paying for things that governments or traditional payment providers ban (such as VPN access, drugs, etc.), and investing money in ways that is frowned upon (microinvesting in third-world countries, etc.).  
The other big path forward I see for bitcoin is ushering in the era of a global world, where imaginary lines on a map go away.  All of these ideas require doing things that are currently deemed illegal until either governments capitulate (internet is a great example here), or huff and puff but can't do anything about it (file-sharing).
