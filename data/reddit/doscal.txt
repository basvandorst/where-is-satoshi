Another day nearly gone with no replies, comments etc etc. Hugely frustrating. @_date: 2017-05-26 11:47:50
Im feeling very very uncomfortable with it all. Scoured the internet for their contact details... To no avail. Just a wall of silence from them.

I will post updates on how this progresses... Not cool Kraken. Client money should be your priority!!!!!

Yes, i understand they may be busy... But not getting back to people who have absolutely no idea where their deposits are is unacceptable. This should be a priority beyond almost everything else!! Still yet to hear from them despite mentions today and dm's.

Do you know when I will get a response - This is crazy.. and grossly unprofessional re what they are doing.

Thanks - the reference was included for timely process. I can prove this from my swift copy.

by the way, their japanese intermediary bank said they are having many many ppl ringing up with the same problems. im gonna start contacting their staff via linkedin emails if they dont at least get back to me with a personal response! 
Should have gone with bittrex - i hear their customer service is excellent.

I rang the japanese bank and they were unable to give out details.

Hi there - I eventually got my money back. Contact the kraken guys on reddit - they will fasttrack... Im still a bit disappointed with kraken response times. Employ more ppl ffs!!??
