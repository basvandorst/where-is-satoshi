just don’t spam your opinion, and you’ll be fine.

is there an app for that? or just the website?

his bearish comments were overly repetitive. in every comment, every reply, he kept reinstating the same thing, over and over. kinda like you are doing now. even though i made no accusations of him throwing any personal insults, you felt the need to reinforce that point, again, like you have done in every other comment, over and over.

@_date: 2018-08-29 22:10:25
damn why did you sell bro?

since you understand that price is being manipulated by a small few, what makes you think this is the end? what makes you think they are done with their pump and dump game when they can continue to manipulate and profit?

lmao thanks for giving us round the clock price updates. good to see you’re using your time to do something “good and useful”.

and why would whales allow a true crash to happen when they can continue to pump and dump and profit over and over?
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:13:09
people like you crawl out of your holes everytime there’s a dip, then disappear when there’s a surge. i’ve seen it too many times.
