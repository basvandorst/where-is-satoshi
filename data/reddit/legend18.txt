Check all the bank statements, every transaction on every credit card, then hopefully you'll find the website she used to purchase

@_date: 2017-11-09 03:09:45
I don't have the information necessary to get an answer, all I know is that coinbase will take $1.99CAD, I'm not sure if there's a fee or buying on Quadriga nor do I know if there's a fee to transfer from Quadriga to Coinbase.

That's why I came to this sub. No better way to gain knowledge than learning from others more experienced. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:44:27
You are 100% right. In my defence all my investments add up to $110 so It's not thhaat bad. I cannot imagine the stress of having over $10,000 invested. I check every couple minutes and I have only $110 invested 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:40:42
I just invested in BTC, ETH and a super small amount in LTC... I am so confused. Not sure if I should sell or hope for the best ..
