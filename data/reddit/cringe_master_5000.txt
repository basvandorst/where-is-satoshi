The thing is that the people making those videos profit off of affiliate (referral) links. They make commission by getting people on the cloudmining service.

Final nail in the coffin. I am never coming back to this subreddit. Mods should've strictly made a no-memes rule and had a separate sub, something like r/BitcoinMemes for memes.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:56:19
This subreddit is the face of the bitcoin community for other redditors. And they end up coming here and seeing shit memes like this. Compare this with any other technology related subreddit and you know there is a problem. r/Linux r/Android r/VirtualReality

Thank fuck.

This subreddit has GOT to stop posting Wolf of Wallstreet memes. It's really cringeworthy. (And I would know. Check my username.)

Man up and buy some fatass stacks of crypto.

It's always worth selling crack to kids and late night hooking even if you don't make any money.

Is there a way 2 speed up the process???

You should use Mt Gox instead. Much more reliable.

GIVE IT BACK!!!!!

Do u have a degree in Bit Coin though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:56:30


Oh, I was just joking. Mt. Gox is notorious for going out of business and losing a LOT of peoples money. Please don't send them any money if it's even possible to. :P

Easy plan to gain capital to invest into crypto:
- Go into massive credit card debt
- You have two goddamn kidneys. Sell one.
- Become a human test study for medicine (Look for sketchy darknet scientists if you really want a big payout) 
- Do some late night hooking
- Sell crack to kids (If you find this step unethical than just sell cocaine (AKA diet crack) instead)
- Lastly, if you're REALLY desperate....become a Roger Ver shill.
