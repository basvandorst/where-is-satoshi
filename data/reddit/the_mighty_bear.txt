It's not. Commodities like gold has a tangiable value, it isn't priced purely on speculation. The same with most stocks. The company you're buying stock in is presumably actually worth something. Bitcoin is most similar to a currency, albeit an extremely volatile one.

You could always look at the the great depression. There was 30% deflation during that time. The money in your bank account was worth 30% more after the crisis than before the crisis! 
Damn that was a good time for the average American! Or wait...

If they were 100% sure they would have sold all other investments, shorted Bitcoin and made a huge profit. Did they do this? No. There is always uncertainty.

Isn't that exactly what is being done in the picture?

That is not a realistic choice you would be able to make.
Are you arguing that 0% inflation or even deflation would be good for the economy?

You're not explaining yourself very well. It seems you don't really understand what you are saying and trying to end the discussion by claming I don't understand.
Could you just tell me what your point is? Why did you bring up another definition of deflation? Why is "my" definition useless?

This is a pretty basic explanation, yes. Although it needs to be expanded upon since it lacks the demand side. Inflation can be defined as the ratio between supply and demand for the currency. If supply goes up or demand goes down you will have inflation while if supply goes down or demand goes up you will have deflation. There are many factors that determine supply and demand. 


I don't know why you are putting words in my mouth but yes. Deflation is a decrease in the general price of goods and services. 
Both definitions are true, I am not quite sure what you are trying to say. It feels like you're arguing semantics rather than trying to say anything relevant.

But comparing it to holding cash is stupid, holding cash is bad. It would be more resonable to compare it to investing your money, in which case both pictures would look the same. 
This isn't even considering the fact that the comparison relies on bitcoin increasing in value.
The whole comparison pretty much stems from believing inflation is bad and deflation is good, which shows a very limited understanding of how our economy works.

I expected to be filled with people who are relatively interested in economics. It's scary how many people seems to have no clue how economics work.

So you basically want to redefine inflation as "an increase in money supply". Why not simply just use that instead of trying to redefine an already established term? It's just confusing.
But I agree, this whole discussion is pointless.

Raising the fees would make mining more profitable increasing the amount of miners.
