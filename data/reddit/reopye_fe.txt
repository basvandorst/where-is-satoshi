God, the circlejerk in this sub is just unbearable sometimes.

I normally like to predict when bitcoin crashes are coming according to the average "euphoria level" of the submissions here... I give it 3 weeks to a month before a minor crash.

Agreed. It has the markings of a bubble all over it. A *tiny* percentage of the people owning bitcoin are actually using it for its real purpose at the moment (i.e. exchanging value). The vast majority appear to be speculators. This might change when a large corporation takes it on - say, amazon, eBay or google - but for now, the only reason its price is increasing is because of the increase in speculation, not use.

1) I'm British
2) I don't know what veep is, sorry
3) I heard it from my aging father who loves the sea and spends most of his money on his pride and joy, a 22 foot Cape Cutter.

There's an old yachting proverb that says "To a yacht owner, the two best days of his life are the day he buys a yacht and the day he sells it". Yachts *hemorrhage* money, especially if you don't know how to sail one and have to pay a crew.

Speculators like you are only a hindrance to bitcoin. What is the intrinsic value of a currency if nobody spends it? Unless people get off their ass and start spending their coin, it will never achieve global recognition as a source of value.

I don't know, but this is what worries me about this currency. All over this subreddit you see people talking about how they only buy bitcoin because they believe it will make them money as an investment. This is totally epitomised by the "to the moon!" comment that I see everywhere here. People aren't investing because they like the functionality of bitcoin or they plan on spending it - they're looking to make a quick buck. 
Unless you're a talented forex trader, you don't do this with currencies. Currency is used to transfer value and you buy whichever currency is most useful to you at a given time and in a given place - if you're in Africa you buy dollars, if you're in Europe you buy euros etc. I worry that if a major vending company doesn't take Bitcoin on soon and make it worth using, there will be a general realization in the community that it isn't used for anything, resulting in a crash from which it may never recover.
But I could be wrong.
