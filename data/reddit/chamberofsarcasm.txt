I guess I need  a better explanation of what you're referring to. Are you saying shady exchanges will start selling their customers' coins off, on the sly, then claim they were hacked?
Why do you think they will start doing that now? As opposed to a month ago, or in May?

I've been watching the CME's every day for two weeks, and if I'm reading them right,  they haven't missed a mark. BTC stayed (and settled) within their H/L limits every day. 
I don't think they have to move them that much right now, since the SK and Chinese markets slowed, and regulation fears in the US are keeping people cautious.

It’s a volatile market. Look at the days before and after the December surge and all time highs. It’s not always a clean ascent. 
Just make sure you don’t put your entire house into it. If you did, wait til it climbs back up (above you buy-in price) and pull some money back out. 
Voices in all corners believe bitcoin will go past its previous high this year. When? No one knows. It may drop before that, too. 
Many people are treating this like a lottery ticket that is instant and infallible. It’s not.

What’s interesting about this is that despite all our guns (I live in the US) we are a very complacent population, nurtured by comforts and distractions. We have visible corruption if our elected officials (Citizens vs United, I’m not talking about Trump specifically), more surveillance than ever (and it’s not slowing down), but we shrug or tweet or say “How dare they?

Well see what the results are of all the tariffs and trade wars. Our housing debt is higher than it was in 2008. I know the big crash in 2008 was caused by the maddening CDOs , but at some point, a squeezed economy (tariffs) will have a result.

Um, we COULD build something big and great but right now we send jobs somewhere else. Ironically, a lot of foreign car companies build cars in the US. 
China's edge comes from cheap , plentiful labor. It's their industrial revolution right now. The difference is they have the advantage of modern science, so they learned from our energy mistakes and are setting themselves up for solar power in a big way. 
Big electronics may be designed here but they aren't all built here. NVidia has TSMC build their chips, for example.

You’re right that our companies are doing s good job but they sell internationally so many things can affect their success. If other countries fall, their buyers fall too. And they may pull money from our stock market (although some store money in our market). 
If our AI computing companies can’t get chips from China, that’s a problem. Same with Apple and other device companies. 
Between housing loans being easy again, sub prime auto bubble growing, and tech stocks storming above valuations (I know they tend to), there’s just a lot of factors that could hurt the market.  That’s all.

So it could be done or it could drop another 12%. 
Interesting chart though. 
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:46:15
One thing I learned (after two years of mistakes) is buy in slowly. If it's dropping and at a price you like, spend like 5% or 10% of what you were about to spend. Then if it slips, you keep DCAing on the way down. If it turns around, fine, you lost a few decimals of profit but it's a smarter play.

Thank you. People forget that weed was highly illegal not long ago (in most states). Let's say marijuana came to the US in the early 1900s. So it took 100 years for it to be (nearly) legalized.

@_date: 2018-11-15 10:34:10
First, I didn’t say billions were a regular sale, although the owner of that OTC company said they’ve done billions in revenue. I know that no bank owns all the bitcoins, but I think they’re acquiring them, and it’s not hard to buy thousands at a time. 
I started following crypto whale, which tracks when large amounts are moved. I’ve been shocked at the amount of money moving around. Tens of millions of dollars going from a single wallet to another. Multiple times per day.

I’ve listened to about 9 different podcasts in the last few months that talk about OTC sales. One trading desk said their smallest sale is $250k. So yes, I believe OTC sales are very big. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:22:45
It's all relative.

Physical delivery still doesn’t require it being broadcast on the chain though. Back in the day people sold bitcoins for actual cash, delivery drives.

OTC means they can buy/sell large amounts without affecting the price.  It’s why they do it: to prevent slip. 
Say I want to buy 100 oranges and the stores (exchanges) only have 20 oranges each. 
If the price of oranges at the store is $1/orange, and I start buying all the oranges up, other stores will raise their prices. but I have a friend who will sell me 100 for $.89 , privately, the store won’t know and  the price will remain stable. 
One OTC company started investing heavily in BTC in 2010 so they probably have quite a few of them. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:31:45
We also pretend BTC isn’t centralized even though it is. Is wasn’t by design, to be fair, but the mining requirements has created an environment that led to centralization. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:31:30
I do not own BTC, for some of the reasons you mentioned. I think their politics is standing in the way of their innovation, and other companies will replace them (Flame suit on).  They were necessary to start this technology, but destiny as a usable currency seems to be fading. 
I do know about tulip mania. A common reference in the argument against crypto. (Not sure if you believe all crypto is without value, or only BTC?)
I think we are in an evolutionary moment in the tech, and there's a lot of rough edges to smooth out. A currency will struggle if its too volatile (and they all are, right now, hence the success [brief] of tether), but there are use cases for fast, cheaper transactions. Stabilizing it is a challenge, and smarter people will figure that out. 
It also seems to be a new kind of investing in ideas and tech, that legitimately gives some opportunity back to the regular person. Stock institutions have had the upper hand on IPOs for over a decade (read about Goldman gaming that system), and you can only invest in companies (in the US) if you have a big net worth. Some argue that's to protect people from losing all their money, but it also hampers us from opportunity. 
It will be an interesting year, as more eyeballs focus on the industry. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:12:50
I wonder if people will pull their money from BCH (as soon as they’re able to) and run back to the stability of BTC.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:27:13
They’ve seen drops but has there ever been a drop of $500B in market cap? The market cap was 50 time’s smaller only 8 months ago.

I agree with your theory but the same mentality that drives to buy more (the hope to earn more money) is the same reason we would sell it all. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:25:01
Exceptional post on all points. Good explanation of how it works and thank you for mentioning it may not be great for Wall Street to come in. 
OTC sales are already in the billions of dollars, sometimes in a single month. So plenty of BTC have been bought up. 
Between otc buys, futures, and shorting, I think Wall Street has a lot of clever mechanisms (and knowledge) to mess with the little people like us.

This is awesome but square only works with debit or credit cards, right? You can’t connect it to your bank account. (According to the site I saw ). 
Since CC companies blocked bitcoin purchases (via exchanges like Coinbase) will they do the same on square? Or has that function already stopped?

@_date: 2018-02-19 20:18:16
True. I guess the value acts similarly to a share. As bitcoin gets more popular, for any reason, the value seems to increase. A strong buzz can drive a stock price up as well. 
Then there’s the fact you can use bitcoin to buy things, unlike stock shares. 
One is supply and demand based around popularity and possible value, and one is a currency. It’s very interesting.

Also, no site actually tracks true volume because the clever, rich, and institutions are buying OTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:50:27
Reading more, I think you're right (and I'm half right). Square cash connects to your bank account, THRU your debit card. You don't enter the account/routing number themselves. Square cash also (now) works with any US CC (AMEX, VISA, MC). 
I guess we will see if CC companies can block Bitcoin purchases done through Square cash, with a CC. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:36:01
The technology is different from the value storage, though. If you own an apartment you can rent out, that is a revenue generator. If you own stock in a company that generates profit, you benefit from it. 
Crypto is a new frontier. Some act like stocks (NEO/GAS) with dividends of sorts, but to profit from it you have to either exchange for fiat or exchange for goods or services. 
A technology’s ability to transmit money quickly doesn’t add value to that data itself (the currency) does it? For example, when western union started exchanging money in, say, Italy, its ability to transport dollars to Italy didn’t make people holding dollars in America more wealthy, right? 
I think there’s a lot of confusing terms and definitions of “value” right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:09:59
Because people hope to sell it for a profit? Not everyone, but a lot (not just BTC).

I agree with that. Shorting for the long term means you fundamentally disagree with the idea of bitcoin existing, which is silly since there’s a history to prove it’s gaining popularity. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:56:16
Few reasons. 
If you’re long on it, shorting it at the same time mitigates your long losses. 
If it’s falling, you can make fiat by shorting it, then buy at a level you prefer. 
If you’re good at riding the waves of interest , you can make money both ways.

BCH should be looked at as indicator the power of marketing has over coin values. It’s a 3-figure coin despite all the negatives said on this page. I like to think the market can shake out bad players, but with robotic social media and some hype, it’s easy to turn the populace.
