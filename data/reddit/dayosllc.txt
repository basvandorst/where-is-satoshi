@_date: 2017-12-06 03:03:03
Who cares.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:43
Not good to buy high and sell low.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:16:40
It does mean that. Some words are omitted, such as it being USA instead of USOA.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:47
They did open it, and then recently paused it due to some issues.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:18:11

I'm selling my $5 billion before you do!
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:41:54
Doesn't terrify me .. makes me happy .. I'd scoop up as much Bitcoin as I could.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:11:46
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:48
There might not be one.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:27:42
No one has a crystal ball.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:02
Use limit orders at GDAX for no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:33:41
If you profit - don't avoid paying taxes. Simple as that.

Buys/sells are free for limit orders and it's free to transfer out of GDAX.

Be patient? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:25:13
Costs $0 if you use limit orders through GDAX.

The dip came a week ago ... went down to around $14,200ish.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:38
Not fucked, just have to have patience.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:25:19
Yeah you can.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:22:25
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:39:43
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:21:52
Which means someone just bought 200 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:32:19
No one knows when it will dip or if it will.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:22
Yes maybe, who knows.

I had some BTC on Kraken but never got my Bitcoin Cash ... how did you get yours?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:14:34
The fork hasn't happened yet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:04:58
Yes, but no new block has been mined on Bitcoin Cash side yet, so that coin hasn't been created yet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:32:06
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:09:18
Check out 
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:05:36
The next block still hasn't been mined for Bitcoin Cash yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:04:27
You could join an online rewards site such as  You get points for watching videos, completing surveys, etc and can then redeem them for Bitcoin and gift cards also.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:59:52
I don't know how to claim it from Trezor. I have to send it to a Bitcoin Cash address, but not sure how to get that from Kraken.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:52:45
The fork hasn't happened yet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:24:58
who cares
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:48:15
Can anyone get logged into Kraken?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:35
No one is checking Coinbase since they aren't dealing with Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:18:05
Buy it though!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:59:24
Just dont sell for a loss anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:35:41
The more you eat the more you gotta dump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:37

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:23:42
Should have and if's ... :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:11:07
Deposit cash on Coinbase/GDAX and buy from GDAX with no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:55
It's unburstable.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:49:05
Nice job. 
Volume (24h) sort doesn't work well. Some amounts are off.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:11:11
You would want to sell at high and buy at low, not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:09:52
Yeah, but fees are free if you use limit order or if you want to transfer out.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:36:04
Whenever after they buy or sell $100 worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:13:18
Yes correct.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:17:08
Buy a little bit now at least. Don't keep waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:45
Use limit orders at GDAX for no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:52:05
Why sell? Now's the time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:17:02
Seems like in about 23 hours they'll switch back to BTC as it will be more profitable then for them. Right now BCH is. Check out  for more info.

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:07:50
Dont we all.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:17:13
Yes you will have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:48:41
No one knows. If we did, we'd all do it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:02:50
Sure, go ahead and send me the coins. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:32:08
So what will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:31
Then don't go there lol.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:30:49
Buy some now and then again later if it dips. If it doesn't dip just buy more then too.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:23:58
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:33
No dip here.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:17:02
This happens in 10 months from now, not 12.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:17:54
Well that would be something else that's not evil.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:47:21
No one knows what the price will do.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:26:17
True! :)

Can't read it since you have to login/signup.

It's all a guess.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:00:58
No - don't ask for handouts. This should be removed.

instaGC is better
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:36:23
I'd let it expire.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:53:55
Lots of alt coins are being traded even though the project may be dead.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:42:32
Yeah but next week this might be the cheapest it'll ever be again.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:48:54
Send from GDAX instead ( fee-free ).
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:26:32
In 76 hours or 137 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:21:02
You'd make $4 if you bought $100 worth at $7500 and sold at $7800 so not sure if it's worth it trying to buy back lower. Just HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:44:03
Just buy a little bit at a time. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin at once.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:24:28
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:04:30
Yes it's possible.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:57:23
Yes buy some now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:15:05
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:08:38
No, keep waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:52:36
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:15
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:21:26
Buy 0.0023 more so you have a better looking number.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:44:54

Woohooo! Go Earth!

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:50:01
AMD and Overstock
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:53:21
There is no fork now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:13:40
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:27:30
This appears to be focused on ICOs and issues with celebrities saying they aren't endorsed when they are etc.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:05:46
It's flip flopping it seems.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:50:07
3:13pm is the best time
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:11:42

Don't ask for donations. Read the rules. You'll get banned from here. Suggest you deleting this yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:45:06
" almost zero fee " --- the fee is zero not almost. :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:29:06
Make a copy and maybe store it somewhere else at a different location as well.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:19:39
Whatever works for ya. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:19:36
Just buy now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:08
It's always went past previous ATH's, so ....
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:21:56
Most places will have a wait on things to ensure everything is running properly.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:01:04
Give it time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:49:46
Yes it would be.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:51:47
I'm selling at $9985ish.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:13:59
Yes correct.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:19
Wave bye-bye.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:24:01
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:48:39
Never a bad idea to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:00:27
Buy more now, if you can, to make yourself feel better. :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:26:09
Nope, but should be a good time to buy a little bit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:16:26
I'd trade back to get BTC so you get the new Segwit2x coins when the fork occurs.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:27:11
You should only be worried if you try to cheat/hide money that you owe to the IRS.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:11:40
How can you join or buy into the ICO?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:47:43
Bitcoin ... and it's a fork, not a split.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:26:06
Yes fun fun.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:59:46
GDAX limit orders are fee-free.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:16:57
Must be doing something wrong, idk. They pay out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:10
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:45
No - false.
It was bought by Amazon ... checkout the Whois (  ).
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:40:24
Yeah I bought.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:19:30
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:50:33
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:00:20
For example if you have 0.15 Bitcoin you'll get 0.15 worth of the new forked coin. No one knows what the price will be once the fork occurs or if it will go down or up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:30:34
What dip?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:40:15
No problem!
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:04:08
It's always went past its ATH each time so ....
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:29:15
No one knows for sure what to do.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:38:15
Transfer it to another wallet/exchange and then sell from there.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:53:14
Do some now and some later (whenever and if it dips).
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:44:59
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:09:28
My opinion is it will go up and down.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:57:29
What is there is no dip after $10k? :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:12:20
Sell some if you want. Don't have to sell 100% of what you have.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:58:39
Old news.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:38:50
Or maybe BTC will drop to what Segwit2x is and Segwit2x will raise to what BTC is.

@_date: 2017-11-08 13:18:18
I do both types. If I buy for longterm, I immediately send the amount to Trezor to hold it there. If I buy to trade, I just keep it in GDAX and do the buy low / sell high stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:52:24
LOL yeah, first time I saw that too just now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:43:16
Buy some right now and then a little bit over the course of each day / week to cost-average it out.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:48:39
Yeah I'm keeping the history and I just have a lot here and there so much easier to report the overall difference than each single one.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:57:27
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:36:40
Really is, instead of just waiting and waiting. :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:05:29
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:19:17
Yes - just do it - even though you may not like or agree with it. Gotta do it.

"When all the dust has settled in January 2018, and there is BTC, and BCH, and B2X -- can I spend each of them individually and uniquely? That is, can I spend 1BTC Jan 1st, 1BCH Jan 2nd, and 1B2X on Jan 3rd? Are they all treated separately, despite all having the same private key?" -- yes you can spend each separately
"If I spend the 1BTC, do I lose the ability to spend the BCH/B2X?" -- spending BTC has no effect on your other coins since they are separate
"If the value of 1BTC is $10,000, and 1BCH is $1000, and 1B2X is $100, will my old wallet / private key be worth $11,100?" -- yes
"As people continue to fork bitcoin, will the value of that lonely 1BTC continue to compound with each new fork that appears?" -- it's possible. no one knows what the price will do.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:07:02
Not there yet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:04
Can he re-attach it if it drops past $10k and rinse/repeat?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:03:42
Sorry to hear but please check the rules. Don't ask for donations.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:14
GDAX - no fees if you use limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:29:34
Forgot an option ... " Posts such as mine. "
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:09:48
Buy a little now ... just in case it doesn't dip.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:45:13
No one knows, sorry. The price was just a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:58:31
Sending from GDAX is fee-free.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:27
I know was just kidding.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:35:31
You'll get the extra coins with having it on Coinbase. You're fine.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:07:32
50% chance
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:04:10
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:51:06
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:50:50
Transaction fees for the place to accept cash are none while it could be 10% or so for accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:57:20
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:36:27
Yeah seems to work out alright.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:35:43
No one knows. Just guess.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:12:36
It's always a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:08:20
It could. No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:33:44
Just continue hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:59:31
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:59:26
GDAX (fee-free)
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:44:08
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:39:05
Too long and doesn't make much sense and already lots of websites created that explain BTC/cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:30:48
Crash to $8,250 level.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:44:44
Not really much at all. After you earn 500 points you get access to the live chat on that site to talk with other members too.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:01:36
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:36:42
Sorry, that page doesn’t exist!
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:54:10
Make one.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:04:02
Easier to use a site like instaGC where you complete task, watch videos, etc to earn points and then redeem your points for rewards such as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:08:14
Yes keep waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting ...
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:52:29
Sure why not.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:22:29
It says " sent from my space ship " ... seems fake.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:32:41
It was OKCoin, here's an article - 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:06:10
Maybe in 20 years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:20
I had a huge buy order in at $9005 go through!
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:17:38
Go ahead and get some.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:21
Never too late.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:58:00
Around November 16th, could be a day or so early though too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:34:03
Ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:10:44
How would we know?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:57:07
Always a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:15:04
You could be waiting forever if you wait for it to drop.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:54:32
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:34:33
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:52:11
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:34:17
One year ago the price was high to everyone then too. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:50:33
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:42:15
Do it.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:36:10
GDAX because no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:42
This may be cheap. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:06:24
Check out instaGC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:12
Chooo chooo
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:09:49
No, more like 2 months and 30 days.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:11:49
All three.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:49:24
Transfers out of GDAX are fast and free.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:27:36
It's possible.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:43:40
I do some usually. I try to buy at the lowest I think it'll reach. Today if it gets around $6950-$7100 I'll buy some then but otherwise I won't. I always use the limit orders so there are no fees (GDAX).
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:03:21
If you have 0.26 BTC or 0.003 BTC etc you will get 0.26 or 0.003 etc of the new coin B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:45:29
$6,905 at the moment (according to GDAX).
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:02:01
If if if ... :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:49:07
Old news, and don't really need a video for it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:53
Well? :D
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:15:30
At least you wouldn't lose the BTC. :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:34:49
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:39:19
Even if you bought at 5 USD you would have probably sold around $ 130 or whatever so don't get caught up about that. :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:23:33
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:37:15
Yes if you have 0.6 Bitcoin or 3 Bitcoin etc you'll get the same amount for Bitcoin2x. So after the fork you'd still have the 0.6 Bitcoin or 3 Bitcoin etc and also will now have 0.6 Bitcoin2x or 3 Bitcoin2x etc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:17:22
Each time Bitcoin has made a new ATH it has always passed it up to make a new one.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:19
At least buy some now and then wait a little bit to see if it drops more or raises ... then buy the rest at that time if you wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:48
Wonder who it is. Bet he hates having the pizza rubbed in his face all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:46:30
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:52:45
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:38:44
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:34:06
Huh I don't get it. Why is 21 BTC needed?
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:21:09
Just buy some now and some later. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin at once. You can buy like $ 100 or $ 500 worth or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:41:17
Best site to earn from is called instaGC - check it out if you haven't yet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:18:09
K keep waiting. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:40:54
50% you guys are not incorrect.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:23:10
Market orders aren't fee-free.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:26:02
Buy from the exchange and then transfer it away.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:17:25
GDAX is 4 hrs after ( could be sooner though )
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:06:53
The title should be " A " not " An " ... looks good otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:03:16
HYIP are scams.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:15:21
bury a copy in your backyard
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:04:12
Yeah but you would still have the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:50:12
50% chance of it coming
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:58
Not anymore lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:59:44
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:23:46
You can earn points from instaGC.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:10:02
Deposit cash to USD wallet on Coinbase then transfer the USD funds to GDAX and use limit orders to buy at GDAX. All of this is fee-free.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:09:33
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:11:39
Who knows, but before I buy more I'm waiting for the next decline.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:02:37
If you owe a tax - pay it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:16:37
That'd be murder.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:32:56
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:38:28
Yes I second this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:48
It's really dead this time though, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:59:41
Time to buy!!! Why wait til 6700? It won't reach that if you wait!
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:37:36
You can earn some from a site like instaGC.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:37:56
This was long ago. You'll have no Bitcoin Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:42:38
No fork.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:20:22
Everyone will cashout on Cyber Monday so they have more money for deals.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:02:00
Nice math ... what if you own 3 Bitcoins? Can you do the math on that? I'm tired ... :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:48:35
Buy from GDAX instead of Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:59
The days of buying in at $5k are over.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:13:51
Bitcoin gift cards? There is no such thing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:48:26
Do it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:14:18
Sell at $6,838
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:33:54
Maybe make a plaque or something that shows the amount of Bitcoin he has and show his wallet address on it along with a QR code. Check this out -&gt; 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:08
Buy more if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:29:06
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:38:43
Price will be $1,281.55
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:26:23
Yes I have before.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:33:25
It may.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:31:19
It can be NO fees if you buy using limit orders. :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:09:01
It may.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:09:23
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:28:51
Kudos to him.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:04:21
Yes correct.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:20
The perfect time to buy would be when it dips to the lowest amount before going back up again.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:04:03
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:03:15
In the grand scheme of things that's not much different and just a couple $'s off.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:25:36
Segwit2x fork was cancelled.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:55:55
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:11:24
Yeah too late lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:40:30
If you think it will drop sure then wait for it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:42:38
$500 off of ATH, so it's good. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:25:22
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:17:55
Who knows for sure
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:51:27
Transfer it from GDAX instead of Coinbase though, to save fees.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:38:49
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:08:15
GDAX limit order (fee-free)
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:06:47
You can use limit orders for no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:52:54
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:57:09
Do it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:47:05
Sell sell sell lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:45
Means the price is going up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:15:38
This is the dip. It's -500 from it's ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:42:09
Login at Coinbase and click Accounts and then click Receive next to your BTC wallet and then send the BTC from Xapo to there.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:02:56
Wait til it goes to $0 and buy it all. :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:50:44
You should only trade futures if you're from the future.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:00:50
Yes correct. Some say it takes value away from Bitcoin, but the cap of Bitcoin would still be the same. It doesn't change.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:06:43
Who knows
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:24:21
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:14:08
Limit orders and transfers are both fee-free.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:18:59
How would we know? No one knows.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:27:31
Go for it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:33:59
Yeah each time it's sent somewhere new there is a fee involved.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:10:03
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:05:33
Have one word tattooed on each tooth.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:50:07
$0 to infinity is more like it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:37:31
Everyone has to take a dump now and then ...
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:37:26
Just buy now and ask questions later.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:59:56
If you have an accountant, consult with them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:01:04
Ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:19:18
Can earn points at instaGC and then redeem then for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:55:10
However much you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:43:03
Keep waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:09:59
If if if ...
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:52:18
You would pay tax on any profits.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:42:12
Cool, good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:57
No - false.
It was bought by Amazon ... checkout the Whois (  ).
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:22:32
Coinbase can do this also through their app.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:45
If you buy and sell with limit orders on GDAX there are no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:33:27
Who knows what will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:41:44
Maybe. Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:31:08
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:26
GDAX, owned by Coinbase. Offers fee-free deposits and transactions (use limit orders).
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:08:34
According to  it's back on!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:14:47
Yeah wait ....
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:22:26
Use GDAX for no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:11:18
Everyone has some regrets. Don't let it get to you.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:27:20
You can get opinion without asking for upvotes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:39:29
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:49:39
Say you lost it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:11:45
The Segwit2x fork isn't going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:06:58
Send Bitcoin from GDAX instead of Coinbase (fee-free).
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:49:15
Never a bad idea to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:26:39
Yeah keep waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:19:15
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:03:05
No one knows. Just guess and do it or don't.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:45:02
Only lost $1,000 if they had a full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:57:36
Here you go (  ).
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:13:42
Sounds good. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:59:46
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:36:18
Yeah, always.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:50:18
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:31:12
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:59:39
Do some now and some later.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:42:26
Because it wants to.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:25:54
I'd buy 1/7th of a Bitcoin every day for the next 7 days.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:28:33
" We reach " sounds a little weird ... :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:46:38
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:45:30
You could just buy from Coinbase's exchange ( GDAX ) each month and use limit orders so it's fee-free.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:31:09
Keep some "USD/cash" balance in GDAX and you can certainly trade instantly.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:43:52
No matter my attitude, you still can't buy yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:10:20
Why did you put it off?
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:12:38
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:53:49
So is "YoBit" getting all their Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:06:31
$98,870,652,237 according to 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:49:09
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:55:58
Whenever you sell it back to USD, whether you move it off of Coinbase or not, is when the taxable event occurs.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:14:16
Never too late.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:19:41
Whatever works best for you. Kudos.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:57:45
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:36:37
IRS views Bitcoin as property.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:27:40
Congrats... too bad those are Zimbabwe dollars though. ��
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:07:09
J.P. Morgan ad? Likely means you have went there or searched for it before recently.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:35:54
Ouch, sorry to hear.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:38:09
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:13:14
I sold a little bit, just to get a sale in and will rebuy if it goes down. If it goes up a bunch more, oh well, at least wanted to get a little sale in. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:22:44
You should transfer from Coinbase to GDAX first and then from GDAX to Trezor, so it's all free.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:55:43
Do 1/4 or 1/2 now and the rest soon whenever and if it dips again. If you do before the fork yes you would have equal amounts of both.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:06:53
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:42:19
Bitcoin Gold fork happened over 10 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:51:11
Not a good idea to sell while it has no replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:43:33
In my wallet. :D
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:13:51
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:14:44
Woohoo.. let's hope!
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:30:08
You would deposit cash to Coinbase and then once you have it there, deposit it on GDAX and setup the order there.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:16:07
Create business cards with the info. :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:46:35
Doesn't matter and would only make others feel bad?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:15:28
Still worth $300+/share.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:36:39
Nope lol.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:07:27
Yes this! All fee-free! ^^ :D
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:07:34
Last I heard they do not have relay protection so if you were to dump your "Bitcoin Gold" right now you could also be sending your Bitcoin away too.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:57:19
Not sure sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:47:58
For "bigger" sell walls you can just look through the order book and look for the higher amount that's for sale and what price it's at.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:42:56
Yes SegWit2x fork around Nov-16. 
Perhaps it may cause a price drop. Hard to tell.
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:27:34
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:33:32
No, this post is wrong in many ways.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:31:18
Who got the $40 million if he lost it?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:18:11
Yes, because of the fork you'll get new/free coins of the new coin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:53:43
Fees on GDAX are better though.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:07:14
Coinbase is not nuts if you know a work-around. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:11:13
I like those who panic sell because I can then buy cheaper. :D
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:35:40
It could.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:27:18
No one knows what the price will do and yes you must use your real info.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:18:25
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:45:11
Trezor 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:29:51
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:05:29
If you use Coinbase again, transfer the funds to GDAX first and then buy from a limit order (fee-free).
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:42:32
Have your parents or family member buy them for you.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:34:38
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:32:57
Why buy lunch now? Wait til later. :)
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:56:12
Any profits are taxed, no matter which "coin" it is.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:39:30
Coinbase / GDAX has been best for me.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:48:47
More like every minute. 5 minutes is too long. :D
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:58:11
Seems like more would buy before than right after.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:39:28
Yes you should use your real info. If you don't want to, then don't buy cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:19:42
Wouldn't everyone regret not buying in 2013? lol
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:15:30
Glad I left them a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:07:03
Fork if I know.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:46:17
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:00:01
I'm buying now to get the free coins from the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:00:00
Carries over.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:44:25
No one knows.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:10:21
Not sure.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:56:20
January 12th 3:30 PM EST
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:38:51
Not 6.1k anymore ... $5,860ish now. :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:38:56
No, fork me.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:30:04
Don't forget about taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:22:56
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:51:31
Haha nice.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:30:50
The first ones I bought are ones I want to long-term hold, so the FIFO method wouldn't really work in that case.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:50:03
It's Coinbase's exchange platform.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:25:16
Gotcha. :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:08:48
Don't transfer from Coinbase to Trezor, instead transfer from GDAX to Trezor (fee-free).
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:19:47
Just report everything and you're fine.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:49:45
Get the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:55:10
Yes, it's always a good time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:18:05
Going to keep it for him. No need to touch it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:15:31
Sharing an account isn't recommended. Just get your own each and be separate.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:50:05
Just hold it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:52:10
Yeah, it was going down before the announcement.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:21:14
The BTG fork already occurred.
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:41:32
If someone knows your address and you don't want them to, go ahead and transfer whats yours out of it to a new one and don't use the old one anymore. If someone sends something to it, leave it be and don't touch it I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:20:52
Should have bought the Bitcoin 9 months ago.. :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:34:53
No, it will fluctuate.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:36:35
Yeah thanks, I got the 163.6 but forgot to take it times 100%. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:59:09
Invest what you can afford to lose. How much would you invest if 1 BTC = $100? You can think of it like that if you want.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:23:48
You can buy fractions of Bitcoin, doesn't have to be what 1 unit costs. You can buy $100 worth or whatever.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:47:02
Make him do it himself lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:48:32
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:14:26
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:52:00
Nice job! If you buy more, go through GDAX and use a limit order (for no fees).
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:53:58
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:04:05
Well login/signup at GDAX and then deposit cash or bitcoin there (from Coinbase) - they are linked, and then just withdraw bitcoin from there and all their transfer are fee-free.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:32:09
Every 4th day. :D
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:24:21
Use limit orders on GDAX and you'll deal with 0 fees. :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:38:29
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:51:42
Always risky.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:02:06
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:25:04
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:16:41
Just means the fork will occur sooner than estimated.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:54:00
Some now and some more when it drops more, if it does.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:40:56
Can't buy yesterday. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:54:13
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:36:38
It will likely go down some (I think at least).
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:08:58
Join Coinbase but buy through a limit order on GDAX to get it fee-free.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:11:37
No fees if you use GDAX and use limit orders. :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:47:20
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:59:52
It's always a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:07:24
That stinks.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:38:08
Maybe yeah, it's good to diversify.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:35:35
I know. :D
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:36:42
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:57:54
Send from GDAX instead (fee-free).
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:02:01
It forked 24 hours ago lol.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:18:42
Yes only you got it lol.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:09:33
Idk exactly
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:08:16
Haha thanks, but no, not trying to hide or get away with it, just trying to figure out the best method to track things and report everything properly.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:47:35
Yes good advice.
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:13:37
Trezor is good to store at.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:52
Yes perhaps.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:27:29
Yes, with their limit orders.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:22:50
Sell! Hold! Who knows!
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:23:32
Fork was two hours ago.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:14:44
Use limit orders at GDAX for no fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:37:34
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:43:00
1 is usually all you need I believe.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:36:24
They wouldn't be jipping you. If your transfer doesn't clear til after the fork, then that's it. You should have submitted transfer earlier.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:34:51
There is also a countdown on Bitcoin Gold's site - 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:26:17
Yeah basically.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:41:24
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:15:32
What state are you in?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:01:27
People are and are buying things.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:20:48
Just refer him to Coinbase and you get $10 in Bitcoin if they purchase $100+.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:52:20
Just report and be legit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:47:36
You can buy Bitcoin whenever you want.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:11:25
Following ...
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:24:00
To start, you can try logging into each site and see if it's there.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:34:43
Do we need miners?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:02:56
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:08:45
Yup. :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:01:10
Patterns don't really matter and don't help.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:22:57
I think it will.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:35:00
No it's not possible.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:38:07
Fees are free if you do limit orders at GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:24:26
Withdrawals are free from GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:09:37
You can use Coinbase's exchange ( GDAX ) and buy/send fee-free. :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:24:44
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:40:39
I'm waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:14:43
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:13:21
Yeah, thanks, that was quick!
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:13:15
Buy from Coinbases' exchange called GDAX instead to save on fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:08:24
I'll take the free shitcoins though and sell them for free bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:49:32
The fork happened about 36 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:10:49
Just crypto doing crypto things.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:20:29
Have you tried GDAX?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:18:41
Trezor is good.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:54:57
Prob should have read first before buying, but check out all the links in the sidebar &gt;&gt;&gt;
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:54:59
If you transfer from Coinbase's exchange ( GDAX ) to Trezor it's fee-free.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:32:16
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:36:18
Here are the current ones on GDAX (  ).
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:26:32
Yes nice idea! I asked one of my sons if he wanted a toy or a bitcoin and he said toy. LOL
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:38:28
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:08:00
Here's some info ... 
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:56:30
Yeah it's too late. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:07:09
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:51:18
Each transaction has to be mined.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:58:24
No, not allowed here. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:37:18
Yup, and most don't have a clue. :o
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:29:14
Transfer all your cash over and then setup limit orders and there's no fees for anything. I use Coinbase / GDAX to do this.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:45:10
its not that, just that these types of posts are not permitted 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:38:17
What % am I in? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:43:47
I got a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:45:52
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:31:49
Lets call it the Fork of 2040. lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:45:09
Buy at least half or so now.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:35:56
Looks good, nice job.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:16:00
Will afterwards I'd think.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:46:35
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:17
No one knows what it will do.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:50:17
It'd be a nice time to buy if it were to crash though!
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:06:49
It will raise 3.3% up to two hours before the fork and will drop 7.8% immediately following.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:05:48
No, don't beg. Read the rules.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:07:50
Yes, believe so, but can't remember. I've had an account for years with them.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:59:20
"Over the past few weeks, we have seen conflicting reports regarding the actual Bitcoin Gold fork date. At first, it was scheduled to go ahead when Bitcoin Cash was created, but that plan was scrapped in the end. The official date is still October 25th, which is just two weeks from today. Launching this fork so close to SegWit2x will have some interesting consequences; that much is certain."
Source -&gt; 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:28:39
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:44:10
Or join sites where you can earn Bitcoin instead of trying to mine it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:40:34
I'm waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:53:55
Free if you buy from GDAX. :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:27:59
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:07:03
Those are zero's ( 0 ). An o or O is too wide ( O ).
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:45:59
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:41:31
Yeah I just forgot the important x 100% part.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:36:14
You won't have time to verify your bank if you haven't yet, since it's already the 19th and the 21st/22nd are weekend.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:20:15
Bitcoin shirt with a bunch of forks on it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:58:19
Bitcoin should remain Bitcoin and Segwit2x should remain Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:38:05
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:53:35
I'd go with something be annoying over mistyping and losing out on money. Hopefully someone can suggest a scanner that works though. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:35:20
Maybe buy like $250 USD worth of Bitcoin right now, and then wait for the next dip and buy $250 USD worth then. Do that and maybe if it goes up a bunch after a $250 buy, sell $125 worth or so, and then rebuy when it dips again. Just an example of what you could do.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:13:57
5-10% would be a good amount to be in crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:12:42
Old news, it went back up. :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:46:19
So sell soon and then buy back later on?
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:37:45
Yeah it would save on fees.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:34:55
Buy some now.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:16:05
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:43:17
Have to report taxes on any amount.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:36:02
$370.97 at the moment.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:52:11
Seems like a subscription would be cancelled if you don't pay your bill.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:34:26
Sounds like you shouldn't, since your parents told you no.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:18:33
It's 1 BTC, not close to 1 million dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:59:37
Be honest.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:40:50
Don't buy from Coinbase. Buy from GDAX instead, it's Coinbase's exchange but the fees are free if you do a limit order.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:06:02
Use GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) for no fees.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:56:44
Buy some each day and it'll be best - dollar/cost average method.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:11:57
They said they were getting in now at 5.5k. :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:37:05
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:15:07
Who knows.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:59:44
Buy a little bit now, then buy the other if it dips a bunch or whenever.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:59:14
You would have both, as long as your Bitcoins are somewhere that provides Bitcoin Cash support. Coinbase will not.
