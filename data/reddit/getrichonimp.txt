  I'm very open minded and let a lot of women into my life. One disaster after the next and they have certianly influenced me not to deal with them in terms of my time and finances!
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:55:37
The market values it as a store of value. As a user I HATE THE FUCKING SLOW TRANSACTION SPEEDS AND FEES
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:31:37
Run you ignoramus. I will get my segwit coins sell. Once the fork happens I will jump into alt coins as btc drops like usual after a fork and look for the most beaten down alt. Keep your head in the sand bro!
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:22:29
Bullshit. Everyone said BCH would get dumped hard yet it sits at 1200 USD and a top3 coin. Yeah ok buddy
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:33:26
Just hodl and sell high tbh
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:56:46
Ok so where's the solution???
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:18:02
This was funny but bitcoin really needs to fuck off and leave bitcoin cash alone. Both serve a different purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:53:43
Bitcoin cash is closest aligned to the white paper akak satoshis vision. I don't think anyone cares about s2x, it's really not offerring that much value outside of shaking up the mining scene. 1 mb upgrade who gives a fuck?  Litecoin is a shitcoin imo
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:01:28
Umm no I sold "bcash" because of the fudding campaign on this subreddit at lows, I received free bitcoin cash but the people on this sub convinced me it was a shit coin. They were wrong and I'm pissed for acting on their fud. I would have ALOT more money right now if I had not listened to their ignorant opinions!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:30:29
Because people who hodl BTC also got the BCH forked coins... think! Great thing about BCH is I can actually use it!
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:00:08
I just laid everything out in english. I was scammed by this forums fudding and lost out on profits selling my bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:07:07
There has always been control over bitcoin, just out of curiousity, do you know who controls it right now? (who has the most to benefit from it's current direction)
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:02:29
How do you know? There was a boat load of people telling me that bitcoin cash was going to 0 on this forum and I believed them. I sold on the fudding from r/ bitcoin and  sold near lows. It's up 4x that ammount currently. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:31:23
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:45:51
After watching the price go down to 300$ and now seeing it at 1200 USD I think there's a fat chance. People are aware that it is a hedge at this point. One goes up the other goes down. All apart of a balanced bitcoin portfolio!
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:45:53
It fixes a major problem which is transaction times and fees. More innovative then what has been proposed so far with offchain transactions. Overcomplicating things so blockstream makes profits on sidechains is not the way of bitcoins future. Blockstream only influences bitcoin for their own gain. This was never something that was discussed in the Satoshi whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:05:13
Look at it this way. If you have an understanding that bitcoin cash might get 40 -60% returns in the short term (which has already happenned for some who bought at support) over a 15% segwit 2x dividend. It's actually worth your while to buy it. That's what I did and it worked out quite well. I will probably buy more bitcoin cash after the fork as well because who the f knows whats going to happen! Hedging your bets is always smart. I have no attachment to any particular coin right now, I'm just trying to adjust my strategy for what works the best!

I mean it seems like a really good oppurtunity to arbitrage

That's what people were telling me at 300$ I sold and now it's 1500$ who was duped???
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:52
Dude they fucking ripped us off fudding Bitcoin cash. Who benefits? Well I'm sure they backed the truck up and bought all of the bitcoin cash that the users of this subreddit dumped because of the fud. I'm fucking pissed off to. Btw how was it fake? It legit went up to .42 btc. It's not like it was fake pricing you could have exchanged your Bitcoin Cash for Bitcoin. I feel completely cheated by these fucking pieces of shit fudsters knocking Bitcoin cash when it clearly is a huge fucking market. OK im done ranting, I reccomend nobody listen to these cocksuckers calling bitcoin cash a shit coin, bcash, etc etc. HODL ALL YOUR BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:21
Calling bitcoin cash a shitcoin when it's market cap is $20,164,777,381 makes absolutly no sense. Sell me your shitcoins for a few bucks since their trash as you say.

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:09:53
I understand I am accountable for my decisions and certainly basing them on morons who call bitcoin cash a shit coin, alt, bcash was extremely stupid of me to give any credibility to. Lesson learned. I now objectively look at Bitcoin Cash as a plausible competitor to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:42:31
Unbelievable. You are so full of shit. The people backing it are known bitcoin supporters since the beginning and beleive in bitcoin being adopted by everybody.. YES EVEN THE POOR. People like roger ver were instrumental to adoption. If you disagree you're clearly ill informed.  Small ammount of developers??? There are more working on cash atm than there are on team core. They pulled off the fork without a hitch unlike segshit 2x. Also if you haven't noticed the adoption rate with people accepting bitcoin cash to bitcoin is outpacing bitcoin. Fuck off with your trolling.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:40:47
By definition your argument does not hold up. Bitcoin was designed to allow for forks if there were disputes with the code. I call bullshit on the "Friends let friends know bcash is a scam". I listened to you fuckers and sold my "bcash" for 4x less it's current value. Bitcoin cash is a viable option and it did not die off like everyone here claimed it would. I'm sick of this subreddit fudding bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:07:33
The momement segwit was added to the bitcoin  protocol is when it ceased being bitcoin. See what I did there?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:27:40
Why? I've been accumulating btc from alts for over a year now. BTC has been the reserve currency from my perspective. After a run in an alt is over I dip and take my extra btc. I hold no alts. I do own bitcoin cash but I don't consider it an alt coin. There is a ton of volume and it's a top 3 coin. I understand technical analysis and trends and have been very successful. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:43:46
Thats what people on this sub have been saying and now it's double the price. I wish I never sold my bitcoin cash tbh especially with this upcoming fork. Everyone calling it a shit coin and a scam were way off. This is a top 3 coin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:11:53
I'm assuming because alot of people who own bitcoin owned bitcoin cash. This sub refused to give any credence to bitcoin cash and called it a shitcoin, alt etc. I beleived the bad actors on this sub and sold at lows (300 dollars) it's now 1400$. Couple that with the censorship on the boards and people are becoming pissed at whats going on here. I should have never sold my BITCOIN CASH. It still pisses me off to this day that I believed the fud on bitcoin cash and sold for a huge loss. I would have 10's of thousands of dollars from bitcoin cash if I did not sell FUCK
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:11:00
It literally shares the same blockchain which is bitcoin. You may think it's a fitting name but that isn't it's actual name which makes you sound like a moron. I can't find one single reputable exchange calling it that or any reputable news site calling Bitcoin cash Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:34:19
No fork is created =. You know what pisses me off. Everyone here was calling bitcoin cash a shit coin, alt coin whatever, I sold and it seems like the market actually likes bitcoin cash with exception to this forum who is so bullheaded in their echo chamber approach I can't listen to you guys any longer
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:49:10
I mean that's what is actually called everywhere outside of this subreddit...
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:29:11
: D
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:41:36
It's anti segwit bitcoin 1x and pro bitcoin cash. Bitcoin cash is clearly a viable alternative at this point. It's held onto the top 3 coins and is almost a hedge with the competing segwit chain. I think bitcoin would be better off revoking segwit 1x tbh and let b2x run segwit
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:59:50
We need decentralized exchanges ASAP
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:19:49
Why is a third party necessary and the devs lift the cap on bitcoin and increase the blocksize or find a way to compress transactions like graphene?
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:56:51
Lower the transaction speeds and increase the fees more this will fix things /s
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:28:58
Ok by that logic the holders of Bitcoin Cash would gladly give me 300$ per bitcoin cash, wtf are you talking about, are you retarded? If they bought my bitcoin cash at 300$ when everyone here was talking shit I'm sure they're not thinking." Wow I got ripped off with Bitcoin cash. I mean I'm up 500%... !??!?!"
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:53:05
Cheap imitation? So the bitcoin blockchain with an upgraded block size that fixes transaction speeds and frees is an imitation?  Litecoin is an imitation along with a ton of other alts.  Bitcoin was designed to be allowed for forks to keep interests in it decentralized. This "imitation" that is worth 20 billion dollars is testiment to the fact that bitcoin is actually working.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:08:25
The whole idea is to be trustless independent on a third party. So you can go with blockstream which is a centralized organization that is going to charge fees on sidechains or you can go with a bunch of miners which is actually less centralized. lmfao at calling me ill informed you brainwashed nit wit
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:02:17
I will keep my eyes on the whole space in general and will capitalize where I can. Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:56:41
Not shilling I diversify don't worry bro. I just don't have the blinders on like all the people downvoting me LMFAO :D I'm open minded :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:06:55
If you actually believe that its a shit coin why wouldn't you sell it? That makes NO sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:59:05
It innovated because it upgraded the protocol to be more friendly to the average user using the bitcoin chains. You can't even call it an altcoin at this point. It's the third highest market cap coin worth billions. You're not fooling me bro. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:06:16
I agree, listenning to people on this forum is not a smart thing to do. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:15:35
Wouldn't you be pissed if you were railroaded by bad actors on this forums bashing an investment you owned because of your ownership of bitcoin? I was rinsed of my bch because of people convincing people that it was a shit coin. It's worth 1400 USD PER COIN fuck off with your bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:27:51
So far both have put alot of cash into my pocket. You do you. I have no issue being a contrarian. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:51:27
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:19:54
So what? It looks to me like people might treat it as a safe haven with all this BS fork crap happenning. The current devs have refused to do anything about the slow transaction speeds and fees for their own gain, why am I the one burdenned with sympathy??? Money talks bullshit walks. I'm pissed I bought into the whole "BCASH is a shit coin" I sold based on this communities sentiment and I walked away from ALOT of profit based on  "it's a pump" blah blah blah fuck you
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:33
I'm from the same camp. Bitcoin cash and bitcoin share the same DNA. Bitcoin cash is only solving a current problem that core is not willing to change.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:34:16
Bitcoin cash is not a scam. I sold because I took the advice of this subreddit because of all the garbage shit talk instead of holding. Suffice to say I LOST profits for listenning to all this trash talk. Bitcoin cash is the third largest cryptocurrency and makes sense from an economic perspective for bitcoin. EDIT: DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE CALLING BITCOIN CASH A SCAM. IT COULD BE INSURANCE IF THIS FORK GOES TITS UP
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:52:12
Don't worry blockstream will figure out a way to charge you on the side chains for fast! :D
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:31:28
Been in this space since btc was .50c and am certainly informed. What a horrible quote to bring up. A large part of bitcoins popularity is in direct correlation with it's price. 
Do more research, things aren't so cut &amp; dry. : /
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:32:14
I wouldn't listen to this guys. Not because I like the fork because assholes from this sub told me to sell my bitcoin cash because it was just some "shitcoin" "altcoin" "bcash run by caresalesman scammers" etc. I Regret selling because of the lies I was fed by this community and I lost thousands of potential dollars. HODL onto all coins. Who knows whats going to happen. Take this from a guy who has already been burned by taking this forums advice. HODL ALL YOUR COINS!!!!! Who knows what will happen. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:02:34
It is innovative in the way that it found a solution to bitcoin's current problem.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:52:38
Another stupid baseless unfunny anti bitcoin cash meme. Top 3 cryptocurrency. Deal with it. I'm still dealing with losses from selling mine for cheap as everyone was calling it garbage but how can a coin that's worth 1500 USD be garbage. FUCK OFF WITH THIS SHIT
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:35:09
You're rich bro
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:59:22
Please stop calling it Bcash. It's BITCOIN CASH. Want to stop the divide in the community that has created your hated "bcash" then respect other peoples views on bitcoin. So fucking annoying.
The top three cryptos are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin cash not bcash
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:13:10
The tech is cool. Transaction speed and fees are not. The current core devs have been dragging their feet. What a fucking disaster shit show this rodeo has been. There's so much blame thrown at 2xrs when at least they are trying to fix serious issues. These coins like bitcoin cash will keep getting spun off and creating more drama
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:07:04

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:40:29
Not true and what a shitty message to send out. Bitcoin should live on, it might not  be cores vision but who cares. Core did not create bitcoin to begin with and have created MASSIVE divides in the bitcoin community! Keep your coins and let the best man win. I'm not sinking with cores ship if it does. I'm open minded to what will work in bitcoins best interest in the future. Hold onto whatever you got. Things are going to get interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:17

I completely agree with this statement! If only I knew about this advice before I sold my "shit coins"
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:43:05
I really have no animosity against these people.  They are only promoting a vision of bitcoin that existed not even 3 years ago. Fast transaction and lower fees so EVERYBODY can use it. The whole idea of bitcoin is to bank the unbanked and I do believe this technology should benefit people with money and the unfortunate. Although this comment will most certainly be banned because I this goes against the narrative of bitcoin core but blockstreams owner is a bankster and they want to profit from a slow bitcoin with side chains. So comparing XRP to bitcoin cash is a joke that's actually closer to bitcoin at the time being with bankers being involved in bitcoin. Also ripple does not have bitcoin blood. Bitcoin cash is still of the Bitcoin blockchain and they ARE brothers
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:13:44
Isn't that why they made bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:01:37
Actually didn't know about this, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:17
It is actually a part of the chain of Bitcoin so technically it is. You mad bro? People like you are dangerous and are an attack on the knowledge of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:14:21
Bitcoin cash is a fork on the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin was designed for this in case the communitiy had a disagreement to AVOID centralization. The market will decide not your bs rhetoric that slanders bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a brand, it is not centralized and to think that is to destroy the idea of Bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:24:45
I did already to hedge; my issue is the constant shit talking on this forum about it. Fudding caused me to panic sell. The market disagrees with the fud.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:37:18
If I'm using a crypto to buy or send to freinds yup. Otherwise Bitcoin is too expensive to move when I want it. I will buy more bch if I need to stock up as it's still inexpensive. My brother used his to buy an ant miner because they only accept bch. In the future there will be more adoption so fees won't be so high!
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:39:34

Bitcoin Cash is a Lambo compared to the model T "Bitcoin legacy" in terms of use case in speed and fees. This isn't even funny. FUCK OFF WITH HATING ON BITCOIN CASH
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:50:31
If it were so untrustworthy why is it that all of the top exchanges allow for it's trade.  If it were such an untrustworthy project why is it valued at 20 billion dollars? Why the hell am I being downvoted - nobody wants to adress the elephant in the room? Whatever
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:05

@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:13
How can you be sure when BTC is bringing in alot of interest these days? Although I agree spam could have alot to do with it. Don't the spammers lose money doing this though? Catch 22 is it not?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:38:18
Low fee - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars???
Can OP edit this please. It generally costs a few dollars per transaction!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:34:34
The market is always right. Money talks bullshit walks and I got bullshitted along with a whole bunch of others on this sub. PERIOD
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:31:26
Bitcoin cash was an upgrade that returned Bitcoin to being a quickly transacted low fee crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:45:39
Funny meme but you're off.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:55:01
r/btc cares about bitcoin cash. I largely agree with them. Bitcash is a safe haven while the Segwit bitcoins fight this thing out. Huge volume lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:21:56
By that logic you should have no issue with this. Since no chain has died there is competition that is alive. It is up to people to decide which one stays alive. Bitcoin cash in not a hack of Satoshi's vision it follows it closer than the current Bitcoin core. Bitcoin cash uses the exact same chain that bitcoin has used in the past. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:12:39
When it comes available on coinbase I'll be a buyer - what the hell is taking them so long to get it, I want it at a low price!!!!!

No, I would not reccomend anyone sell their bitcoin cash. I'm pissed about everyone convincing everyone it was a shit/alt coin. It's a top 3 market cap coin. I'm starting to think the reason for fudding Bitcoin cash is for greedy pieces of shit to take them from the weak hands.  Worked on me. STOP PRETENDING LIKE ITS SHIT TO SCARE OTHER PEOPLE. I GOT MAJORLY FUCKED OVER AND AM POORER FOR LISTENING TO FUDDERS LIKE YOU!
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:44:47
It brings fast transactions and lower fees to the bitcoin brand. Which is new to bitcoin since the last couple of years and has been a concern by the vocal majority of bitcoin hodlers.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:25
Alright let's come together and agree on fast transaction speeds and cheap fees. Everybody on board? NOW FUCKING FIX BITCOIN FUCK!

It's bitcoin cash bitch
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:28:47
How could I be when I've used bitcoin since it's inception and have always paid next to nothing or pennies per transaction? You might want to think for yourself instead of being a sheep in an echo chamber . But you like being a lemming, right?  I pay as little per transaction as possible. It's called being intelligent.

Unmasking the Blockstream Business Plan all that time ago I specifically wrote about sidechains and the Blockstream business model and how Blockstream plans to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users off chain and over to sidechains where they can profit. Part of the post about their revenue model said: Blockstream plans to privatize sidechains through the limiting of the Bitcoin blockchain and generate revenue through subscriptions, transaction fees, support (consulting), and custom development work. Their first client as it turns out is major bank and financial firm, PWC. source:  Because of my post and at the time there really was not much information yet on Blockstream, Gregory Maxwell private messaged me about the post vilifying me calling me a liar and also saying to me "You greedy, controlling fuck" among other nasty things. At the time it was my word versus his and he called me a liar for publishing the business plan and how Blockstream plans to hold back Bitcoin for their own profits. Today I have a bit of vindication as news has broke saying that: "Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware" source- Adam Back Blockstream CEO. source:  By Blockstream's own CEO's admission they are in fact saying what I and many others have been saying for a couple of years now. The aim to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users to sidechains is no longer conspiracy theory. It's black and white and has come directly from the CEO of Blockstream. It proves that Gregory Maxwell is the liar and 2 years ago was lying and has been lying ever since!
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:43:35
The very existence of a decentralized money is justified by the invention known as "Proof of Work".
Proof of work is the flux capacitor to bitcoin's DeLorean. It's what makes it decentralized consensus possible.
A rejection of Proof of Work governance by the lead developer of a bitcoin software is incredible.
This is an amazing moment in bitcoin's young history.
This will prove if Satoshi's invention can work despite the LEAD DEVELOPMENT TEAM not having a clue how bitcoin works. If it does, awe inspiring.

I am absoultly not ignorant but thanks for the ad hominem fallacy.
Core could always incentivize people who run full nodes to get stakes of btc. My issue is there have been plenty of solutions to issues that are coming up as bitcoin grows. Rather then deal with the issues there is a kicking of the can down the road which easily allows for other interests to capitalize

Unmasking the Blockstream Business Plan all that time ago I specifically wrote about sidechains and the Blockstream business model and how Blockstream plans to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users off chain and over to sidechains where they can profit. Part of the post about their revenue model said: Blockstream plans to privatize sidechains through the limiting of the Bitcoin blockchain and generate revenue through subscriptions, transaction fees, support (consulting), and custom development work. Their first client as it turns out is major bank and financial firm, PWC. source:  Because of my post and at the time there really was not much information yet on Blockstream, Gregory Maxwell private messaged me about the post vilifying me calling me a liar and also saying to me "You greedy, controlling fuck" among other nasty things. At the time it was my word versus his and he called me a liar for publishing the business plan and how Blockstream plans to hold back Bitcoin for their own profits. Today I have a bit of vindication as news has broke saying that: "Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware" source- Adam Back Blockstream CEO. source:  By Blockstream's own CEO's admission they are in fact saying what I and many others have been saying for a couple of years now. The aim to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users to sidechains is no longer conspiracy theory. It's black and white and has come directly from the CEO of Blockstream. It proves that Gregory Maxwell is the liar and 2 years ago was lying and has been lying ever since!

I completely agree, although you could argue it's the reserve currency and it deserves a premium but I don't think that should be the case to be inclusive of everyone no matter how poor they are.

It's a fork not an attack. If you don't like b2x sell for btc. Also the fork seems to have spurred alot of upside to bitcoin!

These forks have been good for bitcoins price, whats with the NO2x, what if 2x is better also?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:46:47
I thought bitcoin cash would be dead but there is alot of beleif in it. It's competing with ripple for top 3. Definately not dead.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:39:06
Yeah I agree and I definately did not feel insulted lol
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:59:48
You're happy that they are creating this contentious toxic atmosphere that could destroy bitcoin and turn it into a settlement layer subscription fee based system. Careful for what you wish for. Your btc might be the altcoin soon.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:04:03
Completely agree. Bitcoin should be something that people want. Slow transaction speeds and high fees are clearly an issue and ARE NOT BEING ADRESSED. I find that the enemy of bitcoin is the bitcoin devs at the moment themselves. Why not resolve this issue so we don't see more forks because people want a streamlined protocol? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:05:19
In debt, not student loans, but I'm happy I never sold and yes I do own a single bitcoin, maybe a little bit more than 1 ;) I haven't sold any since picking them up although I could take care of my debts with that lol
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:32:51
With all this talk about attacks on bitcoin,  blockstream seems to be the biggest enemy. Is it any wonder there is a push to upgrade bitcoin. Just lmfao at downvoting a well researched comment, poor baby getting mad?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:32:08
Maybe you don't care but alot of people do. I cringe at high transaction costs and slow transactions.  If you've used bitcoin for a while you will know that it was not always like that, it was actually much better years ago for these reasons. I think we can have our fucking cake and eat it to. Then any fork is a distraction. UNFORTUNATELY this is a HUGE ISSUE creating a big divide in our community.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:19:08
I'm not on EITHER SIDE. Either way it's best that people understand what's really going on. Both are corporate funded takeovers. Is it any wonder why this contentuous bullshit is happening. Both sides are wrong. Both sides need to leave bitcoin as fucking bitcoin. Upgrade the fucking thing properly with out biases. Make the transaction speeds fast. Keep the fucking fees low. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:36:38
Thanks, I honestly want the best for Bitcoin and our community and this pissing contest is pissing me off

Hey I think we can all agree on that!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:16:14
I've been watching both sides of this debate and it is not one sided. You should take your own advice. I see it as competition. This was literally how bitcoin was designed to be. The best bitcoin wins. I do agree that there are people who have their own interests in mind but it will come down to which one is used the most. We actually get to chose. I want bitcoin to be great and so do a lot of other people. I want it to be what it's not right now. I want cheap transaction fees and quick settlements. I've sold locally and it annoys the hell out of me that I have to wait 15 - 45 mins for a transaction and spent 5 - 15 bucks to do it.

I've been following bitcoin since 2008. I am not. I am not purposefully slinging harmful rhetoric. I am asking why we can't work together. It's these kind of comments that make me think bitcoin is going to be fucked because everyone is so bullheaded in their own positions. The lack of introspection in these matters is worrying which is why I posted to begin with!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:14:54
Is it just me or would you guys prefer to keep your btc to yourselves and not large corporations
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:33:02
I really haven't missed the point because people I talk to who are owners complain about all the positions being taken when I think a resolution can be found that the market place can agree on.

I don't see it as an attack. I see it as an unwillingness from ALL sides to come together to make the best bitcoin possible. If it was nearly perfect already these "attacks" would only be a laughable distraction. Am I the only one who sees this?
