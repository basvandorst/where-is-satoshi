I would not go to jail for this.
1. I will be using a fake gun.  The cops would know I never intended to hurt anyone.
2. I will offer the clerk 1,000 bits after the fake robbery.  If he likes it and wants more I can offer to sell him some bitcoin for a discount.
3. The media does care and will listen.  This is literally the future of humanity we are talking about.  If we don't fix our current system soon lots of people will be hurt.  Only the very few of us here will survive.
I'm starting to think your a troll and have reported your post.  You are violating rules.
