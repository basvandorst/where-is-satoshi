The next step would be to lien CW estate for the 5 billion.  Now take what they can take including BCH and BSV holdings that are NOT part of the original 1.1 million bitcoin along with all current company assets.  Also lean the 1.1M BCH and BSV from the splits.  Basically everything CW has.  The Australian and US Governments should also lien them all.  CW has some real financial problems when they start to find ways to collect on this decision.

Same thing happened last night.
Multiple transactions in showing unconfirmed immediately on the blockchain.
Then seven hours later starting just before the drop, all transactions confirmed in the same block.
I have no problem with delays to blocks because different miners choose different conditions to mine; however, to get all these in the same block 7 - 10 hours later appears manipulated.

That was the recommended one hour transaction fee at the time.  That means every miner on the planet held off to that fee and one beat all of them to two block times of transactions.

Noticed a trend.  Transactions not being processed for hours then massive confirmations and price drop.  Is someone wash trading and somehow blocking the confirmations?  How can 20 transactions be picked up in a block but the block does not confirm for seven hours?  Why would those transactions not be scattered and picked up in other blocks during that time since they are still unconfirmed?  It appears someone can mine transactions but hold the block for confirmation for hours.

That remark does not help the guy with the problem.  As I said, I have not used them for years.  As far as I know it might be a computer virus that pops up with any wallet.  Even your favorite one.  The point is, watch out for phishing see if others notice the problem.  We need to know if this is an external problem or is it part of the poor wallet as you mention.

The real scam address is above.  The link does not work but you can put the address in any block explorer.  This link shows what was on the victims website when logged in with the https padlock.
here is a link to their scam screen
She clicked request payment thinking that was how to receive the bitcoin I sent.

Looks like scam on [blockchain.com](  Sent client funds, and they logged in to view the funds received.
The address bar clearly shows inside [blockchain.com]( with padlock [  a picture to join trading and asking for a receive or donate address.  She claims she did nothing and [blockchain.com]( signed and sent all her funds to a scam account.  Reviewing the account shows it has scammed 118 bitcoin in 554 transactions.
I have not used them for years, so not sure how they make the picture show in the back office with all account information and her logged in.  Either the virus is inside [blockchain.com]( or she was redirected when trying to go to the website and log in.
I know that [blockchaininfo.com]( is possible to go to and the domain is no good.  So might have got to scammer that way and entered credentials thinking they were on the correct website.
