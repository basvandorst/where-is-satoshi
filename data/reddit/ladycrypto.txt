This would be a good meme if I didn't work in tech support, because turning it off and on again fixes literally everything almost half the time.

He's clearly saying he's the CEO of the website. He has no hand in the development of the coin and if you legitimately believe that Blockstream, with the entire core team on their payroll, is more open and decentralized then the 4 separate teams working on BCH that all work together to implement changes, you are a fool.
Just because Martin Shkreli likes Wu Tang doesn't make Wu Tang shit.

He actually got that shave yesterday. He's just waiting for the $60 transaction to confirm so he can leave.

/s? Holy shit
Trying to spin the high transaction fees as positive in any way just reeks of desperation.

It'd be a real waste of money to lose every coin you own due to a keylogger or some other virus. 
You are completely responsible for this money, none of it is insured and no bank or corporation is guaranteeing it's safety. 
In addition, if not a hacker than for sure the NSA already has all your passwords and pass phrases if they were generated from an online computer, so you need to consider if that's anything you're concerned with.

This is just human nature. You'll get more people making offers/putting offers up for round numbers.

That's not civil forfeiture though. He was actually charged with several crimes. Bogus ones, but that's not the same as just taking someone's property because it seems suspicious to be driving around with $100,000. They were actively trying to catch that silk road guy, if I remember correctly they had him surrounded by undercover agents and they had to wait for the right moment to spring into action and arrest him before he could turn off his laptop.

How would civil forfeiture even work with crypto? Just don't tell your password and use your backup. Also just don't have shut loads of cash on your person.

Site went down during the BTC price plummet. No one could sell to save money, no one could buy at this sweet low.
