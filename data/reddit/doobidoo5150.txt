I would rather cut my own hand off than invest savings in Facebook coin.

All you need to know is what a ledger is and what distributed means. The implications are extremely broad and can be looked into endlessly but ultimately understanding distributed ledger is all it takes.

Spending a half a million dollars on something to sit around in traffic like everyone else seems pointless. If you live in Germany and have the autobahn then maybe you could actually get around faster.
You’ll basically lose $100,000 the first day you drive it off the lot. Just that could be large down payment on a rental property which would be an income generating asset instead of a liability.
Spending that much money to look/feel cool seems like pure insanity to me.

UI for sending and receiving currency has already been done 1,000,000 times. What kind of bells and whistles are you looking for exactly? In your words, what problem would you like them to solve?
When people complain about UI most people are literally just afraid of using hash addresses and won’t use anything that doesn’t abstract them away. There are already blockchains with federated identities for those people.
If you think Libra is not anti-crypto then you do need a lecture or at least read the bitcoin white paper.

Unfortunately, that’s already solved problem and it is very hard to do without sacrificing privacy, decentralization, or having to trust your private keys to a 3rd party. Bitcoin core is the way it is after careful consideration.
Here’s the main reason I believe you are wrong about Libra. Facebook is one of the largest companies in the world and they spend millions every year on lobbying. Now they have incentive to lobby for legislation that props up Libra and shuts down its competitors. 
Facebook lobbyists will try to be the ones writing future legislation on crypto.

Electrum is just as straightforward as using VenMo. Libra is not going to do shit. UI is not something that needs R&amp;D money.
Libra is 100% anti-crypto. Just another example of the problem bitcoin was invented to solve. It is a centralized ledger with a reserve to manage inflation. It is not a cryptocurrency and it will do nothing to help move society forward or add to the industry.

Yeah but he’s new blood. No way he holds through another boom and bust. 50-100k is a good take on 2-3 year timeline.

If someone stole $120,000 from my house and the cops came like a year later and gave me $27 I would be more pissed than happy.
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:13:34
Yes, if you consider 50-100k life changing.
