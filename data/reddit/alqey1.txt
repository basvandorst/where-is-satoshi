“So who makes the decision”, I think you need to research bitcoin a bit more, and while your at it research Austrian economics

What does this mean, is that bad or good, can someone explains what this means. Thanks in advance
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:34:52
Ya, would still go with a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:18:40
No, think 10 years from now not 5 minutes from now
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:37:36
Ya that’s the best choice! Buy from the company who actually makes the product, not from third party’s. Don’t share you 12 word or 24 word pass phrase with anyone, and don’t write on an electronic device ever, write on a peice of paper
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:12:13
Ya thought so was just wondering why someone would voluntarily do it
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:31:18
First thing is you need a hardware wallet (Ledger,KeepKey,Trezor) buy on Coinbase, which is an exchange, from Coinbase send to Hardware wallet, but wallet from original manufacturer

Well let’s you bout bitcoin at 7k and it went to 11k, so you want to sell (buy low, sell high) but you intend to buy again when it goes lower, so it easier to just trade your BTC for Tether, then it would be to convert it to the actual USD dollar, because if you wanted to buy again, you would have to convert all your UD dollar back to BTC, which would take longer than it would take to just convert it to tether and hold tether in a wallet. Because if you want to convert 50k worth of tether to BTC it would only take 5 min, where converting 50k in USD to BTC would take a while, idk if banks would allow you to do that much

I would get a Ledger Nano X or Nano S

“Who makes the decision” , what are you talking about, no one makes the decision. It’s decentralized, that’s the point
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:37:55
I’m kinda new to Crypto, but I think Tether is what is called a “stablecoin” it is always worth around the same as the US dollar, I think the point of this so instead of converting you crypto to the actual US dolla, you trade it for Tether.  XRP is a crypto currency that people believe will go up in price, so basically like any other crypto
If I’m wrong, I apologize, someone can correct me

Thank you

Pretty easy, just setting it up takes like 15 minutes, it’s worth the safety
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:10:43
I think you will be fine
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:31:57
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:33:19
So did you voluntarily give your bitcoin or was it like you went to the site and it automatically did it
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:33:25
No cheapest is prob KeepKey, can get a wallet on your phone but not as secure
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:46:37
oh ok thanks :)
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:22:27
Thanks for the comment man, do you use different because they offer different services/coins or it your money is more “spread out”
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:23:20
But wouldn’t you have to send BTC to that new wallet, and couldn’t you see where that BTC came from?
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:14:12
It’s Keeps going back below 9K because of your guyses damn memeing
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:56:45
can you further explain why, thanks
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:23:26
Sorry haha
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:08:25
Yes, I don’t know what exchange your using, but you should be able to click on whatever Crypto your using and there should be a “receive” option. It will give you a QR code or a copy of the address, give that to whomever you receiving it from

I would think owning 1 BTC would be above average, especially in the future. There are currently estimated to be 36 millionaires in the world and there will only be 21 million (less in circulating) BTC ever
Might be wrong just my opinion
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:34:09
Thank you very much for the information, this fully answered my question :)
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:42:01
Ok thanks man :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:14:32
Would get a hardware wallet if I were you
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:50:16
My bad, I was actually telling my self to make sure I put millionaire wife but still forgot haha
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:51:34
Thank you :)
