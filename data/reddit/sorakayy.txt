Yep and to add on that with an example. 
Let's say i have $20 (unspent output), if i want to give you $5, my $20 becomes the input transaction. Two new outputs are then created, one is my $15 change and your $5. This new output gets changed into an input when you spend your $5
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:24:49
Low fees. Right now with the increasing demand, I think there are more transactions happening. I'd recommend a bit over the median transaction size, maybe 0.45 to 0.60

True, they're both not backed by anything, but one argument for it is that bitcoin is backed by trust. The deflationary element of bitcoin helps with the argument. Consider Zimbabwe, their money became worthless because the government started printing tons of money leading to hyperinflation. You cant have a $100 billion zimbabwe note, go to a different country and expect to be received $100 billion in exchange. 
Similarly, if this happened in the US today, trust in the US dollar would evaporate and it would be useless, especially since it isn't backed up by gold. Bitcoin on the other hand cannot be inflated because you cant mint new coins above 21 million. This makes it is more trustworthy as a currency/asset. You can go to a different country, use bitcoin and the only difference would be the price rate per coin. and bitcoins are usually pretty close in price throughout the world, correct me if im wrong.
One day you may not be able to trust USD, but you can always trust bitcoin

havent used electrum, but you can look at the transaction on any blockchain explorer and look at the inputs and outputs, hope that helps
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:52:28
That is pretty weird. Seems like a good amount of people are having verification issues with Gemini. No luck with their support?
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:45:47
thats awesome! have fun and dont forget to hodl with us when you start buying again cos its only gonna get better :)
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:35:16
Oh, totally forgot to factor in the increase in demand for Bitcoin as well. Makes sense now, thanks
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:38:12
Ahh forgot that you can't bring more than a certain amount in certain countries. Do you think putting it in a luggage (non-carry on) would be a bit safer?

I believe both are equally as good. I just got my KeepKey in the mail today and it's awesome. Trezor is an extremely good hardware wallet since it's been around for a lot longer than others and has a superb reputation. I believe KeepKey's source code and is based off of Trezor's, so in that way they should be pretty equal in terms of security. The top commenter's point about Trezor's different wallet function is pretty cool too. Though I do like the larger screen on KeepKey.
One minor thing about KeepKey that is sometimes a hassle converting BTC to dollars as there is no option to see dollars. It's great mental practice, but at times, I'm just lazy
In the end it's purely preference (I love KeepKey), but most of the people in this sub always recommend either the Trezor or Ledger nano s, which are both amazing hardware wallets
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:09:39
I dont think so, hardware wallets usually create a new wallet with brand new private keys when set up. Hardware wallets are usually open source which im sure coders make sure that there is nothing suspicious about the software. This would mean that employees/manufacturers should have no incentive to put compromising code, lest they want their company to fail.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:05:20
One day, how long have you been waiting for verification?
@_date: 2017-02-20 09:49:12
Sorry I think trust is a wrong word. I know that bitcoin works because it is trustless but what I meant is that you still have to trust the trustless aspect of it, I mean why do people, like me, hodl it? 
So any major country (china, us) that involves bitcoin can influence the pricing right? Sadly as much as I hate to admit it, we're kinda reliant on countries accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:16:36
easy way to figure out is to go to google and convert btc to usd (or any other currency you use) for a rough estimate
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:09:17
Gemini has cheap fees. I know you can use ACH which takes longer to process (took 3 days), but there is a wire option as well and I believe that you can receive coins relatively quickly. I just have never tried that option because I don't know my bank's fees when it comes to wiring money
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:59:21
 is the best exchange for Canada from what i read on this sub
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:42:01
Lol I respect your opinion and assumption, but know that I don't waste my time "hitting faucets"
What I'm mainly concerned is how a single country can depreciate a global economy by ~10%. Is it because they have so many miners/nodes? We lost value and then appreciated at an average higher than pre-pboc. Being a decentralized currency, trust is important, but why do we see one country make such big difference
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:17:50
It was and is a super interesting concept and its history, in the short time it's been around, is fun to read about.
I recently bought some stickers last week for cheap using bitcoin and I was like, "damn, this is super easy, beats having to input debit/credit info."
All my transfers into wallets or testing transactions have taken 10-20min which has been sweet. Love Bitcoin
What about you OP?
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:58:59
Yep, as long as you reset the device I'm sure it's safe, would recommend buying it from their actual site though

try using exchanges instead of Coinbase, which is more of a broker. I can vouch for Gemini personally but that is because i have not used any other exchanges yet. Im sure Kraken would be good too. You have to option to use localbitcoins or an atm if youre in a hurry, but be prepared to pay premium price
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:22:45
Sorry, a tad out of topic, but reading this got me worried a little. I use Copay for my petty cash and i know there is multi-sig, but is there any way that i can be both signers without having to have my laptop with me to sign?
Right now there needs to be a Touch ID in addition to my password to spend any amount.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:05:05
yep, block cypher states it's a medium miner preference fee: 
you can always try to use the transaction accelerator: 
hope that helps!
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:45:05
This is one of the many reasons why Gemini is the best exchange
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:32:08
Awesome. Thanks for your response, I'm not flying any time soon, but just read a couple posts these past couple weeks about the extremely small likelihood that they may do that. I'm sure a few people were wondering as well, the more you know the better.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:49:15
Just checked up on your transaction, glad to see it confirmed with 6+ confirmation a little bit ago!

I would've recommended the txaccelerator that everyone says to use, I personally haven't used it, but apparently they shut it down recently. Other options would include Child Pays For Parent or the other, could find info here
But for me, I don't necessarily know how those work and would just wait it out or something. Hope other kind people can lead you to better solutions.
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:06:25
oh ok, i was under the assumption that btcd was different as well. so hypothetically speaking, suppose i got a bitcoin dark wallet, (not sure what btcd is/does, more private transactions somehow?) it gets sent to the same blockchain as the bitcoin network right? if that's also the case, would sending bitcoins to a btcd wallet and then back to a standard wallet be kinda like mixing or am i wrong about this too.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:40:46
consider Gemini, going through the verification may be troubling, as i heard many comment, but it really is much better than coinbase. You'll have a limit when it comes to coinbase and 20k-30k may be a red flag to them resulting in a suspended account. the fees are lower and easier to deal with whem it comes to limits for Gemini.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:09:56
Isn't the 0.30-0.50 range considered normal fees?
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:39:12
Sorry, what do you mean that the transaction isnt listed on blockchain? it shows up, but has been pending on unconfirmed for about 2 hours?
@_date: 2017-02-19 04:47:00
that compatible software is any BIP39 wallet. I believe, and someone correct me if im wrong, you can recover your wallet on electrum, multibit, or mycelium.
As for security, the source code for KeepKey is based off of Trezor's
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:48:08
Nope, your best bet would be to look at options of getting an amazon gift card and selling it to someone. I havent done much research into that, but im sure you can find stuff online about it? it seems like paypal would be your second best bet. But many people do not like trading with that option because you can do chargebacks(?) with paypal/banks, leaving the seller with lost bitcoins
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:33:44
Judging from the BTC differentiation, you didnt lose $100, it's only around 20 cents. that is most likely from the transaction fee. Im guessing it is too low and that is why it is taking a while.
for future reference on how much you should use as a transaction fee: 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:05:06
yeah it was too low of a transaction.
 to find out future transaction costs.
either you will have your coins get returned in 3 days or you have to wait for it to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:38:08
judging from blockcypher, your transaction says that your fee is medium miner preference and that isnt so bad, should not take longer than a week. maybe within a day or two? But if youre really worried you can always try the transaction accelerator: 
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:16:07
Id like to add that dips generally happen in market. But bitcoin comes back and shoots upward again. Throughout its history, it's gradually been increasing. Why do the people on this sub use the term hodl so much? It's cos we're in it for the long run. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:01:43
can you post the transaction id? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:50:49
Since they are using Coinbase to sell it, will it be any different (verification &amp; price) going out to buy it in person at Vernon Hills versus just purchasing bitcoins on Coinbase online?
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:40:02
really depends on the size of the transaction. but yeah right now it's around ~50 cents.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:18:39
Transaction fees are not based on how much bitcoin you spend. It's by all the outputs in the address.
1 transaction in an address of 0.11 btc will be a smaller size than 1 address with 10 transactions equaling 0.11 btc

Ohh that's the problem. Your USD and bitcoins are separate. Right now, you can only withdraw the 300 in USD and you can withdraw 0.00013625 (17c?) in BTC.
You havent traded USD for BTC.

np. if you have any other questions about how bitcoins or how things work feel free to private message me
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:39:27
really depends on the size of the transaction and the fees. I bought a VPN service with bitcoin today, like 7 dollars with 50 cent transaction fee and there was a confirmation in literally 2 minutes (usually takes like 10-25min). I guess people would complain that 50c is too much, but i dont think its an issue.. yet..
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:23:32
Yeah I thought the teller would be kinda like local bitcoins in that it would be anonymous. At that point I just signed up for Gemini.
That's pretty good that you can buy up to 10k. Granted it would be like $1000 in fees and totally not worth it, but hey it's a step in getting bitcoin more publicly available
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:42:54
There is no transaction with that hash in any other block explorer ive checked except for the link you put up
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:41:45
Can confirm, went to a bitcoin teller in Chicago. Needed to show id and was struck with a ridiculous rate of $1144/btc when market was $998/btc. Never again.
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:55:53
I'm really confused as to why some people cannot get verified. It's safe to assume that Gemini works for your state and you sent in a picture of your ID and a bill or bank statement less than 90 days since issued that proves that it is in fact your address?
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:20:07
You are on the withdraw bitcoins section and you are inputting the correct address in which you want to send your bitcoins right? It should calculate the fees even when you max out your withdrawal. That's kinda strange. I would try and create a ticket with the support.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:04:43
Not tax, but you will have to pay premium.
You can try Paxful as well maybe
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:24:37
yep scam
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:02:35
If it's an app on your phone, you can go through your past purchases/downloads to see the wallets you've had. Hopefully you still have the recovery key. Other than that I'm guessing you used a main desktop wallet like electrum
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:59:28
As many have stated in this sub over and over, not your key, not your money (something like that). Keeping it in an exchange is risky.
As for your investment, it's a hit or miss, no one knows whats going to happen. Hopefully you didnt put more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-03-01 02:38:34
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:00:20
id say like 45-50 cents for an average transaction size
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:40:24
yep, go to 'buy' choose 'btc &lt;- usd', and im sure youll figure out how the graph and everything works.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:16:24
Bitcoin addresses do not expire or reset. As long as you have access to the wallet, you will have access to that address. As for accepting bitcoins as a payment for a service, depending on what that may be, you should look into something like Bitpay and set up a merchant account 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:41:14
is it not? that's strange. I would think that any ledger product would have roughly the same source code.
yeah i think trezor is still open source. looking at the post 2 years ago saying it's not open source makes me double-take, but if you look through their github, you can see a lot of their code
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:23:23
During the time ive compared exchange price/btc, I think that Gemini usually has one of the lowest prices
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:19:56
no problem. if you have any questions about anything at all just message me and ill try to answer to the best of my knowledge
@_date: 2017-02-12 04:08:37
Seriously? I purchased yesterday morning and they have yet to pull the money from my bank. I figured it would take a couple days.

txid: 6a684af76273025c72d2730977272e0ffb12ffe64a8c234aed4eddc20fa081bd has one confirmation so that isnt stuck in limbo, which is a good sign
it was simply a double spend problem.
address 1KaHdwHaD3n2B8X3SYgudKqEr5aQjizkDE sent it to the same addresses except a 0.0001 difference. Im guessing that created a potential conflict because it thought that the address was trying to spend the same amount at two different places, even though it was going to the same place
txid: 70cf7c36fce85dd01643cf732026537fb85faf9cdfb7f6a075c58b614bad7a8a should be confirmed when the 1st transaction (address: 1Q3ZSE44kVQXzzPHG8SgMBudXwcieRWxKm) is confirmed by the network stating that it now has the balance to spend
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:13:44
Let's say i have $20 (unspent output), if i want to give you $5, my $20 becomes the input transaction. Two new outputs are then created, one is my $15 change and your $5. This new output gets changed into an input when you spend your $5
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:10:40
Anything over 6 confirmations is considered completed and irreversible.
Im sure it all depends on how much bitcoins is being transferred. As a merchant selling coffee, im sure that they only require one confirmation because it's not a huge loss if someone double spends and they would rather not wait for 6+ confirmations.
Someone buying like 0.1 bitcoin would rather play it safe and would want more confirmations so that a double spend would be less likely
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:26:23
What do they mean by miner fees to invoice? I use Copay and there already are transaction fees which essentially go to the miners. Would this be for like their debit card? im confused.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:13:35
Most likely fees. Blockcypher states that the fee is of medium miner preference, which explains why hasnt had a confirmation yet. Since bitcoin is rising in value, it means more people are buying/selling as well. This results in more traffic on the network.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:50:48
Don't keep your bitcoins in exchanges. Not your keys, not your money.
Learn to use the right amount for transaction fees - 
Look at the sticky post for beginners and use those exchanges to buy your bitcoins.
Don't try and mine or invest in cloud mining
Learn the basics of how bitcoin works, but don't worry about BU and Segwit until you understand bitcoin a little more
Don't buy more than you can afford to lose
If you plan on hodling a lot of bitcoins, consider getting a hardware wallet like Trezor, KeepKey, or Ledger. You're investing to have a peace of mind, you don't need an x amount of dollars to validate buying a hardware wallet. Plus if digital currency takes over fiat, you'll already have a hardware wallet that supports cryptocurrency 
Try not to panic buy or sell
Electrum for desktop/ mycelium for android/ copay or bread wallet for iOS
I may be forgetting some other basics 
Have fun and welcome :)
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:17:02
you can also just google ".829483btc to usd" on the safari url and not close the page. When you reload the page, it will keep your btc amount while refreshing the current rate/coin.

It will return to your wallet after 3 days if there isn't a confirmation. You can always try RBF (replace by fee), CPFP (child pays for parent),   transaction accelerator, or wait it out. I haven't tried any of those suggestions personally but they're all viable options. If I were you, id just wait it out. 0.0006 btc/kb seems like a high miner's preference, unless your address size is just large
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:47:05
You can send them a pdf of your online bank statement, which hopefully has your place of residency. Thats what i did when i set up for Gemini. I dont see why Kraken wont accept that as well considering it is still a bank statement
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:52:01
Yeah, definitely cant go wrong with it. Its source code is based off of Trezor's so you know the security is top notch. It's easy to use and set up. Ive only made one transaction with it so far, but there was a confirmation in literally 2 minutes, fastest i have ever had confirmed.
There are a couple things that I hope they will add later like sending in dollars or writing descriptions when you transact or receive, but im sure they will considering they're relatively new. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:24:09
Third party would mostly likely be attributed as coders or developers. The beauty of hardware wallets being open sourced is that anyone can read the code and see if there is anything shady implemented within it. If there was, they would let others know resulting in the company's name being tarnished. Ledger doesnt become a reputable hardware wallet by having malicious code.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:36:17
Ohh it just clicked, alright, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:02:26
I saw it and got greedy hoping it was going to go down a tiny bit more. Sad i missed it, but super proud of bitcoin's resilience so far.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:10:53
Is the money that you have in Gemini on hold or has the ACH or wire fully cleared? It can take about 3-4 days from when you fund your account to being able to withdraw it
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:07:22
That's too low of a transaction fee. If it doesnt receive a confirmation in three days, it will return to your wallet.
you can always try  to speed up your transaction
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:48:05
Ill try to help as best as i can.
Judging from the armory offline wallet, i would say that security *should* be similar to any hardware wallet. There are only a few people whove commented on using an armory wallet but again that is not much. armory wallet, being an open source, is a good sign that there arent any malware on it. IMO i would rather get a hardware wallet if you can afford to get one. It is easier to set up and use.
I have a keepkey and considering they base their source code from Trezor, there are no risks when connecting a Trezor to a computer, even an infected computer. What the hardware wallet does is keep the private keys in the wallet at all times. It never goes to the computer nor does it have the ability to extract the key from the Trezor. All the computer does is use the extension to ask permission and the wallet signs it.
Firmware needs to be updated to make the version more stable or have better UI for users. I have never read up on an instance where a hardware wallet had to have an update because of a potential threat they were unaware of. This would have usually been solved before becoming a well known company like Trezor.
I think the safety in entering recovery words really depends on the security of your computer. If you have a keylogger or anything like that, it will be less safe entering your recovery words.
But (and i could be wrong about this) there is a pin, associated with your wallet, that you have on your trezor that jumbles the number order making it less vulnerable to keyloggers and the like. 
edit: sorry just read your title clearly. I am not a Trezor employee lol but this might help on the last question: 
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:46:07
quadrigacx - best exchange in Canada, stated by people on this sub
gemini - i use this exchange, im sure they operate in canada as well
localbitcoins (im sure you know that already)
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:10:05
You should go to localbitcoins and see the rates at which people sell per coin. For paxful, I don't have much knowledge of their reputation nor the technical details. Just seen it in the sub a dozen times that people have used it
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:10:04
I have never heard of those sites, but i am sure you that sites like those are scams. This is like falling for a Nigerian Prince. No one is going to double your bitcoins. People are not going to give you free money through interest, especially with cryptocurrency.
Your best bet to increase bitcoin is by learning and buying alt coins or tokens and selling/converting those profits for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:35:51
Yep, thanks for making the case, I was actually considering that fact, and I do appreciate your counter argument.
To be honest in my opinion I'm pretty sure it's contingent on market value consistency and possible rules that exchanges, like Polo, may apply for doing so. 
Considering crypto allows you to "Be your own bank" people should really consider what that really means. And the shortest explanation is, "don't trust people with your money." you can't complain to someone once it's gone. You learn from your mistakes, but I don't want anyone to experience that first hand
