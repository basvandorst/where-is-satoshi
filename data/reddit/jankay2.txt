 So If Bitcoin crashes to $1, its still not a crash? Because surely there are those that bought them at $0.05 a piece so its still a good return right? Dumbass

Well you can believe Bitcoin is the future of monetary exchange or that its Jesus but believing somthung doesn't neccessarily make it true. I believe I'm a Jesus reincarnate, but does that make it true? No

Bitcoin is not a currency and it'll never be.
Everyone getting on the bamdwagon isnt on bc they intend on using it as a currency, theyre all on it bc they hope that it'll make them rich. Its a gamble, not a currency or an investment.
