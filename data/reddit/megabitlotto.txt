Hi there. We can assure you this isn't a scam but it *is* quite new. You can learn how the lottery operates (and find out how to enter) by reading the sidebar at Regards

When the first draw is made we will release code which will duplicate the drawing algorithm. You'll be able to check that the draw was fair (and see how it's done).
We probably won't have a website though.
Trust will only be gained over time as drawings occur fairly and with regularity, and as the pot size increases. We spent a lot of time developing the drawing algorithm and want this lottery to be an ongoing success.

If you're talking about background: we have, collectively, over 30 years' programming experience. Two of us are business owners and one is a university professor.
If you're talking about giving out our identities: no, sorry. If, in the future, the lottery becomes popular the last thing we want to have is the scrutiny of our government, which frowns upon any lottery except the one they run. We really have a long term view and don't want the lottery shut down.

We hope trust will be gained through regular predictable draws, time, and larger pots.
Thank you for your feedback!

Total payout ratio is the same, 1 in 20.

Many lotteries have approximately 1/20 odds of winning at least something. We tried to mimic this with the second and third place prize pools.

Thanks for bringing this error to our attention. The miners' fees should have been taken out of the 2% administration fee rather than the 8% rollover. We're going to correct this error in the drawing software in time for the next draw. Also the previous fees charged improperly have been returned to the lottery pot and the transaction has been marked so that it won't be considered to be an entry.
The code for independently determining the validity of winners got put on the back burner but we'll get this done *before the next draw* and it will be posted to Concerning odds: the odds of winning the main pot are determined by the entry amount and the total pot amount. The larger the pot, the larger the entry amount needed for the same odds. Second place and third place odds are 1 in 50 and 1 in 20 respectively. Since there haven't even been 20 entries for any of the draws yet it's probable that there would be no third or second prize winners.

We've all been long time users of Reddit, but created an account specifically for the lottery.
We recognize that this is going to take some time to gain legitimacy. Once prizes are paid out regularly for some time and the pool gets larger we hope trust will come with it.

has been running for about 6 weeks, and we have the algo for drawing on our SR.
Nobody seems to be too interested in a lottery at this time, however. :(

Lotteries are typically a popularity play. Each person makes an entry with little but stands to make much depending on chance. Perhaps there is "trust" involved in entering the lottery, but you can do so with cents. Requiring "credentials" for betting 1 euro sounds like simply arguing to argue.
Why are you trying to make it sound like we're asking for piles of money?

We'd love to have feedback on ideas for promotion. As lotteries can be a sensitive issue politically we've decided against setting up a web site.
