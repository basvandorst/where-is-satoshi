That would be bad business.  Good PR, but bad business.  Every customer knew their funds were not insured, and that there is no FDIC for bitcoin.  The customers were as negligent for leaving their money there as bitfinex was for lax security.  Bank robberies happen, we all know that.  That's all this as.  Welcome to the wild west.

I use a combination of coinbase and bread wallets, but then I don't have a large amount of coin yet.  When I get up to the 21 club, I'd get a hardware wallet or paper wallet.  I think a hardware wallet would be just as easy to lose as my phone, though.

Actually, you own the copyright upon registration, but registration is a prerequisite to enforcement in court, in addition to providing additional evidence of when and who created the thing.

The only way to get that is to start buying them at that price.  You start.

Based on my experience with my business, you put a bitcoin logo on your website, then wait for the one other person in your state who's heard of bitcoin to need what you sell. I'm still waiting.

I don't have a position, and really, if we want bitcoin to be anything other than a fringe pop-culture thing, neither should anyone but the developers.  I don't care how many dollars there are as long as mine still spend, and I don't care how big the blocks are as long as my btc still spend.  I don't care how many processors are on the next intel chip, etc.  It's a matter for the developers, but really should be transparent for the users.

I've tried a few, and settled on breadwallet for my ios devices.  It's very simple to use and no frills.

Not being witty, OP is being an ass assuming his mother can't learn anything and, since "the average person" can't be trusted, he's implying he is above average.  In fact, he was just as average as anyone else until *he* learned about bitcoin, as were the rest of us.

I was pretty surprised after jumping through all the hoops to verify, i made my first buy from coinbase only to be told my btc would't be delivered for almost a week.

Have them take screenshot before they send it and attach the picture of the address to the email.  Or call and have them read it to you.  have them text and email the address to you, and compare.

Good point, but not a defense in a court of law. OTOH, the trial's already over, so "defense" is irrelevant at this point, and error at trial is the issue. I think a better question would have been "what error occurred at trial" that made the conviction unjust?"

My son is always asking to be allowed to get his drivers license.  But I think the average person can't drive and I think I'll handle all that for him instead of teaching him how to do it right.  I'm way above average, and he's not, so there's no way to learn.  Despite my being above average, I'm too ignorant to teach her.

Unfortunately no, my employees are a bunch of luddites.  We've actually worn out more than one electric pencil sharpener.  Maybe next time I use an independent contractor. . .

I think you meant to say grand larceny.  Even a theft of $.01 is larceny.

I do real estte closings for a living; there is no such law.  If your deposit was over $10k, they need to source the deposit, but that has nothing to do with the loan.  If you made a string of deposits just under $10k, they may need to source those, to ensure you aren't trying to get around the $10k rule.  Again, irrelevant to any loan.  The fact they need to determine whether you borrowed the funds is a bank policy determination, again, unless it's a HUD  or FHA loan, no laws are involved.

This is why this sub is toxic to new users - assholes like yourself that provide absolutely no help to a valid question, and instead belittle anyone curious about improving the use of bitcoin.  Go fuck yourself.

Nice idea, poor execution.  The first thing I searched for, dozens of results, all the same.  Needs work.

I've bought a few games on steam with btc, it was virtually instant, no waiting at all.  I bought something else with bitcoin, can't remember what, and it was the same way.  Depends on your vendor, not on bitcoin.

I searched for "sig" initially, then "Sig p20" (which was a typo and got no results), then "sig p220."  
I used this site quite a bit for christmas shopping, but basically to find out what sites accept bitcoin; I found it easier to then go to the site directly and use their search feature.

So bitbet is tracking the wallets customers use to pay them? 
Seriously, though, any evidence to back up your claims?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:03:13
Yeah, I figured that out a few minutes ago.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:16:49
Sorta; I make regular buys and hold until I have enough to buy a boat. Doubt I'll find anyone willing to sell a boat for bitcoin though, so I'll eventually have to cash out.
