I think my favorite part of that interview was how obvious he made it that he wasn't wearing pants. I was originally planning to vote for Jill Stein if Sanders didn't win, but now I think I'll vote McAfee. [serious]

Amazing video, I can see a strong trend of the man hating pants.

I would get the same song and dance from USD-&gt; EUR as well, it looked like it was just the bank trying to find the worst plausible exchange rate over that time. (I once had a difference between 1.08 on the spot market and 1.17 by the time it hit my account a week later.)   
   
If I'm holding a few BTC anyway it makes it easy to just make a buy order on the USD market and sell on the EUR market at exactly the same time and it effectively doesn't matter at all how volatile Bitcoin is.

My self interest says "yes".

If Apple only needs 6-10 engineers less than 4 weeks isn't it already ridiculously broken? Does the FBI not have 6 to 10 engineers?    
  
Edit: What I'm saying is that this sounds like pretty shitty encryption if Apple even has the **ability** to unlock it. What you people are describing is a backdoor.

Why would you think the NSA wouldn't also have this "secret" key at this point? If the system was truly secure then Apple shouldn't have the ability to unlock it no matter what they do. All you did was describe an existing backdoor.    
  
If Satoshi or the core devs had a secret key that could just unlock your bitcoins then they wouldn't be considered secure at all. The fact that it's possible for Apple to unlock this thing means that the NSA has already had the ability to unlock it for some time.

Kinda, yea. I'm an engineer and I still don't fully trust my hardware or data security (or physical security for a paper wallet) enough to keep that much "cash" on hand. Banks were a thing a long long time before we left the gold standard for that very reason.

It's almost like each system has advantages and disadvantages.

Of course it's all legal precedent, I'm just making the point that the idea that Apple **can** and the FBI **can't** is absurd. The legality is another question, but we all know how many fucks they have left for that.

What prevents the NSA from stealing this key and making their own 3rd party software then? If Apple **can** access private information by any means then that information is in no way any longer "private".

I can't imagine a world where the NSA doesn't already have possession of that key.
