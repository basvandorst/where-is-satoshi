Made my deposit mid day the 5th and contacted them late on the 6th. Tried to contact them two more times through the contact us. As said too, I tried to contact bitinstant here on reddit twice as well recently. I know they got swamped with emails and apologized for not getting back on their blog but it would be nice to know when my funds would transfer.

Will do, thanks for the response. You wouldn't have happend to make any purchases from them recently would you? Successful?

Im letting you know right now, I have emailed and called more than once with no response. I have even sent you a message here on reddit but nothing. $320 bought on or about the 5th up until now has vanished into thin air. I still have my receipt and account number from zip zap. No one seems to be helping me. Will you?

Good news man! Wish I could say the same.

Makes me feel better that im not the only one. What have you been trying to do about it? I contacted Rachel a few times who first said she would send the info to tech support to deal with it. Then multiple times no reply. Emailed with Seth who said he would make things right but nothing. Then last night after making yet another attempt to contact Rachel she says all transaction should go through in the next few hours. Well its the next morning and nothing. With the rise in price I highly doubt they will give me what the cost was for BTC at the time of my purchase on the 5th. I really hope this company makes things right and not be fraudulent. There seem to be a few more people on their blog as well that have not received their BTC.
