interesting. where/how did he accumulate this wealth?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:23:46
he has 50k btc?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:35:07
people fail to realise that btc value comes from speculators, not from its use as a currency - which is incredibly low.

ah nice, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:48
replace the word bitcoin by dollar and it starts to make sense
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:19:28
Congratulations, and very nice of you to do this!

good ol' buy at ath strat

lmao... every single word within the b/w/ area in the circle has an orange glow because of anti aliasing. the original image must have been orange in a black background. then op changed the background to black and the letters to white using a simple fill. all the letters thus have an orange hue. the 257 was added in a different step than the other words. but we already knew the 257 was special since it doesn't occur in the whitepaper. the orange border around 257 is of no significance.
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:06:27
this is exactly what i'm saying. the difference in hue indicates that the 257 must have been added in a different way than the other text. my guess is that op used some word-cloud like software and then edited it after (add the btc logo, change some circles, change some other shit).  
  
people are reading into these edges too much. it's just a bitmap artifact. we already knew 257 was special because it's not in the whitepaper. not because it has a faint orange glow, lol.

i think it's gonna have to do with that small dot on the back of the B and with attacker success probability.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:55:18
not in this png
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:25:59
because the protocol only accepts words from the bip39 checklist...
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:14:14
it appears you are stupid, yes  
  
you're looking at the address from where the 1 btc came. the real address is 3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:18:11
i don't know. this is the list:

@_date: 2018-05-22 18:34:25
private key? we're probably looking for a seed
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:06:05
have you tried the order at which they occur in the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:44:34
not all words in the english dictionary can be used in the 24 word phrase, only frm the bip39 list.
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:38:38
it's nice, but i think there are some more useful tools:  
- light up all bip words  
- only light up circle, B or area outside
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:56:27
that's literally in the puzzle description
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:05:01
just pasted the whitepaper in a word counting tool lol

i believe the scaling is by the log of n, where n is frequency. this is an excerpt of the frequency of words:

the base won't matter
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:21:20
It's been found. Not by me, sadly.   
*edit: nvm, they added instead of removed. lol
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:42:16
well, they wouldn't make it very interesting i think. but maybe there was an additional selection step. the original white paper has about 920 unique words. so i think that putting all words would make it too crowded.
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:37:42
people have noticed the capitals.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:08:15
the orange edge is on all black &amp; white text. i suppose op made the image in black first, then filled some text with white instead of orange and a black background instead of black.

you got off relatively unscathed

i don't understand it. why can't everyone just keep to their own preferred coin? why would you, as someone who clearly isn't interested in bitcoin cash, give suggestions to what name it should bear? what exactly is your problem?  
  
disclaimer: i'm not a hard proponent of either coin, just fucking tired of seeing shitposts like this all the time.
