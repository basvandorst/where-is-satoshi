China can move to a consumer economy...  America was like them too once.. buy all your junk now while you can cheaply

yes plenty of scammers abound, kind of glad bitcointalk is dead right now... but KNC came through with good intentions..  glad my spider senses diverted me from BFL to them last spring and I get a few of their miners next week
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:47:26
I'm in the same boat.  I've been selling consistently on BTC rise and last week coinbase went into a ditch.

more like some incriminating evidence on that forum so best to hack it oneself, turn off and run to the hills ... with all those funds too
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:12:03
because meme's expect people to engage in ['line thinking'](
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:49:30
Olaf, can you respond to emails???  Lots of concerns on funds NOT reaching bank accounts
@_date: 2013-10-07 02:16:49
not really,   SMF is better for normal people
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:04:41
They are cracking down on casinos too..
[casinos have to comply too](
Probably why they push those member cards onto you..  saying you earn a few points while it helps them track who you are....  i guess at some point they will be mandatory in all casinos..  no card shown, no dice
@_date: 2013-10-07 04:14:05
oh god... it...lives.. again....   the trolls...  they are legion
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:46:32
ARISE CHIKORUM ARISE
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:53:06
They also fear slowing of the economy..  if you remember the days before everyone had a credit card (pre-Reagan) people didn't didn't go into crazy debt and lose their right to freedom..(ie: standing up for yourself is way easier when you have enough savings to go on for years)...   since many are in so much debt now, they fear losing all their stuff and lifestyle.   That is why they will increase property taxes, and any other fees as last resort (extort?) before it all blows up.. There used to be 3 generation homes too and still lots of privacy, but now people tend to live by themselves but blab on facebook anyway.. O.o  
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:06:12
it was a troll carnival too..  a bit quieter on the internet without it
I think the bad was outweighing the good on that forum anyway, time for a clean slate
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:54:57
Yeah it is a mess..  I have many sales in limbo the last week.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:54:17
Coinbase is forcing us all to take your approach
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:05:53
if it is so insecure, stop criticizing it or you'll add to its anxiety..  give it a xanax or something
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:52:59
They seem to run out of cash too...  everything is in the slush for weeks now
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:04:41
hey Coinbase just cancel all the sells in the past week that you have tied up ok??   just like when you went ahead and cancelled a lot of buy orders when btc crashed to ~180
oh wait, this time it is in YOUR favor to go back and manually correct things
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:17:13
hopefully all the bitcointalk trolls are lost forever!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-05 02:23:34
maybe the forum admin got stuff to hide..
maybe he figured with the SR dustup he can roll with any funds
maybe he got a deal with escrow guys like John K to bolt and ditch returns on Avalon chips group buys and split the dough
maybe..he's just a douche
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:54:56
Chase is the source of all evil...   of course they do not want to touch bitcoinated kryptonite
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:11:52
stomping on your comment.....stomping on your comment!  must go downz must go downz!!
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:09:02
you and 50 other people that want to be the new forum.. this will be chaotic for months until one forum gains trust
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:32:23
maybe he already has a pile of money and not a pile of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:34:44
omg you are a girl (dark &amp; edgy too, probably hot) into bitcoins,  we should all give you a few just for that!!!  :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:06:24
I doubt all of our banks just now put us all on hold in their fraud depts. unless the feds are on some kinda crackdown
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:00:40
So great we live in a free fucking country...  everyone guilty until groped
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:00:20
hopefully all sales of miners ends and we who have, rule the have nots!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:23:34
i luv my dark alley 4chan meets wall street chikun pit
@_date: 2013-10-05 02:11:27
ya, and it will sit on a best buy shelf just waiting for you to pick it up and plug in and make money.. lololol    like that wouldn't be cornered in 2 seconds if cheap or price adjusted higher like asicminer ready made miners..  why don't you buy those??  they are available all the time...    
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:01:09

there's no 'smart money' without 'dumb money'
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:03:51
we should all move to facebook and turn off the rest of the internet
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:09:55
yeah what to do with all these millionz but sit and ignore
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:58:52
i never use the internet, or clothes, so I am safe
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:37:49
isn't IKEA right down the street??  think that would of rubbed off on them...
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:10:42
They want to SELL THEIR CHIPS AND MINE THEM TOO!!!
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:33:20
They seemed backed up on sending funds too... I have been selling but will stop if they can't release funds.
No wonder their price is all time high, people aren't trusting they will get their money from them anymore.
