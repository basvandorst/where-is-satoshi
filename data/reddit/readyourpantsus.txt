Dachte, das steht für honest opinion.

Thanks :)
Reading exact opposite statements it would be real hard to believe all of them and while i did do about 5 or 6 hours of research (which is nothing - i know) i just came out more confused than after 10 minutes into it and settled at "i'll just buy some and forget about it for a year."
But by what will you guys estimate when it dips this time? Does everyone just go by feel? Are most on here people actually making their income with it and investment pros? Seems silly.

Good thing the other two in this thread told me to use those two haha. I think i should just try to sleep since i have to be awake in 6 hours and my thinking just keeps going more insane about this.

"Transfer to a Paper wallet"?
I think i'm going to do that with an amount i'm willing to lose since that daily up and down would be too much for me anyways. Maybe look into it monthly? Feel like you might miss out trends. Or just ignore that all in all?

Ah, makes sense you guys are so happy about everyone accepting it then. Interesting that all of those guys here are people who have this "bigger picture" in mind. Like while i think this is a great idea i would only jump in to make my bank account bigger. (As bad as it sounds haha)
Seriously interesting, thanks for the insight.

That's what i thought. 18 years old right now and fresh out of school so that won't come any time soon. Also i don't think i have enough life experience to make it a valid decision to invest more.

Ooooh, i think i get it now. The idea is to get around taxes?

You guys are hard. I have 90k savings and would feel super bad about just investing 2,5k in something of which i have no real idea if it'll increase or if i'll only have 1k tomorrow.

Can't you just sell the amount of BTC you need and use it to pay with your card?
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:11:52
Sorry, no real clue about bitcoins but reading this thread it feels like this is pretty much gambling. Still i try to get some serious information since i have 90k savings and don't really want to put them into the bank. Still worth it to buy now? Something i could read to know how this whole thing works?

Why is it important to diversify? Just so you don't lose it all if one goes down? What's the difference in the end? BTC is predicted to go up to 60k this year.

If one has 90k savings and no real job how much would be wise to invest? Just a personal thing? Shouldn't be doing this so tired but damn does it seem impossible to sleep after seeing this. Like is this any different/safer than just going for the lottery? Since my dad lost about 140k (80% of his money) in investments i guess i'm biased. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:15:03
For who is daytrading? I don't see how you predict in a matter of minute when it will dip or is it just by feel? Genuinely interested despite not thinking i could ever do that haha.

Is there a platform to handle all of that as an european?
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:16:09
Have 90k and wish i had known about bitcoins still being worth to invest a few weeks earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:34:21
That does make a lot of sense especially if i just invest 1-2% of my savings.
