So you're going to vote and then what? Force all the miners to do what you say? Unless you're running a pool or mining solo, you're not even part of the debate. Nobody cares that a bunch of reddit users want 8MB blocks. If you don't get your way you're just going to up and leave?

They don't process your transaction. You're more inconvenienced than they are. Transaction fees are such a small portion of the bitcoins they make.
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:38:47
You can't do that. That's the point of bitcoin. If more than 50% of the miners want to raise the block size to 20MB tomorrow, they can, and there's nothing you can do to stop them. The question is, do you join them? But, that's all unlikely because everybody has a financial incentive to calmly agree on upgrades. Causing havoc lowers your wealth.

Hey, many people have told you not to do the transactions for various reasons, but I think you'd also run into technical difficulties depending on how your transaction inputs are set up. If before the presentation, you send $100 worth of btc to your mobile wallet, it's going to be in one input. When you go to send that to the first person, it will create a change address. Depending on what wallet you use, you probably won't be able to spend the change until a block is found. If your inputs were lots of small chunks, you'd probably have no problem. You'd probably want to test that with paper wallets before doing it during an important meeting.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:24:18
You can't enforce those decisions, so they don't really matter. You still have to convince the miners, but now you have the argument that "see, everybody wants it." I don't think many of them will care.
@_date: 2014-08-27 04:51:12
Nobody will come up with a use for that hardware. The asic is much more specific than hashing. It takes an input (difficulty, last block's hash, and the hash of transactions), and spits out a valid block hash, time, and nonce used to generate that block. Everything in between is hard coded on to the chip.

Supply problem? Is there something about the number 21 million vs 10 million? There is no supply problem because bitcoin is divisible. Even if we only had 1 bitcoin, we'd still be fine. Just add more decimal places to the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:10:53
I checked btc-e and bitstamp earlier today and they were good. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:52:32
The amount of bitcoins available does not correlate with usefulness as bitcoins can be subdivided. But I'm aware that there are plenty of other issues with that, like the fact that someone could own a million bitcoins and the total liquid available on the market is 10. We would never get to that extreme of a balance because that would give to much manipulation power to a single person. There are other issues that I'm aware of, but don't feel like going into details. But on a basic level, if everyone hodl and demand stays constant, the value will go up. Now that's not really practical in real life.

So, let me get this right. You invested in this obvious ponzi scheme without doing any background research because blockchain listed them as a partner? Their website listed an address and a registered license number. Did you make any attempt to check if those were even valid? 
They were so textbook ponzi scheme that I don't even know where to begin. How did you think they made money? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:46:49
A financial investment is something you hold to sell later in order to make money. I think your wife wouldn't be very happy if you sold her ring. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:56:54
One of the major key points of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anyone. Why would you blindly trust blockchain like that? Did you even reach out to blockchain to see if they had intended to list them as a partner? Did you look up what the requirements to being listed as a partner were?

Nobody has mentioned it yet, but there is a reason nobody wants to sell bitcoin at market value with PayPal. The seller has no guarantee that you won't reverse the transaction. PayPal has also been known to freeze accounts. There's a large risk for sellers who accept PayPal, so they charge a large premium.

I know what you're trying to say, but the term server has no connotation of being used as a "trusted machine that you rely on for data". It doesn't have to be trusted and the data doesn't have to be secret. Please don't change the definition of a server. You could say that "nodes" or "peers" are a more accurate term, though.

The bitcoin network is a set of servers that, just like any other servers, could go offline at any time. The chance of that happening to any one server is pretty low. One of the cool features of bitcoin is that it's distributed. If one server goes down, it's okay because you can get the exact same data from any other node. The chance of them all going down at the same time is almost zero unless there was some sort of targeted attack.
The trust-less feature comes from the way the bitcoin was designed. The severs don't hold any of your private data, and you can verify the data you get from the server, both from other servers and by verifying the block yourself. That's where the "proof of work" comes in to play. A server can't just create a valid block, because it takes a significant amount of effort. The greater that effort is, the more you can be assured that the blocks you are receiving are not malicious. It's not worth it to generate a block to give you fake data. 
Decentralized is similar to distributed, but one party doesn't own all of the nodes. You can verify the same data coming from different parties. So the term you're looking for is distributed or decentralized trust-less servers.

That's effectively just gpg on top of a block chain. That doesn't really solve my problem. It actually makes it worse. Once someone steals my initial private key, they have access to every message I sent or received with it, because the messages are stored in the block chain. Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:54:53
Yeah, that's the point. It's okay though, because most of us do trust the developers and developers in general that have read the code. We trust them because they all come from different organizations and nations. The code is open for any developer to read. We assume that if someone found a serous bug, they would have exploited it or reported it already. 
It's a managed risk that most of us are willing to take. But if you don't want to take that risk, the code is available for you to read yourself.

@_date: 2014-04-06 17:55:17
The asic is a hard coded silicon chip to mine bitcoins. There are certain inputs to creating a block, such as the Merkel tree of the transaction and the previous blocks hash. It takes this info, structures it correctly, and brute forces the double sha algorithm with a random "nonce" value as one of the parameters. This is a very specific operation, and no password has the same structure of a bitcoin block. Asics can not be used to only perform some of the routines above, and they are not programmable. If, for some reason, you found a hashed password that matched a bitcoin block hash, it would be the first known sha256 hash collision, and would have huge security implications.
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:42:52
Coinbase is good, as well. If anyone is running linux/mac, you can open a terminal and run this command to see if a website is vulnerable.
    echo -e "quit

If that doesn't return anything, the website is not vulnerable. If it does return something, check the version number to see if it's in the list of affected versions.

Block generation is really easy. That's why the network has a difficulty value. This value essentially says how many leading zeros your block needs to have to be accepted. The number of leading zeros of a hash cannot be predicted by its contents. That's why we have to brute force with different time and nonce values. That's where proof of work comes in. Since there's no way to knowingly create a valid block with enough zeros, you had to have done significant work to find it.

EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, Visa. You're talking about the Chip and Pin cards with the chip in the middle. I think they usually have NFC.

I believe what you're talking about is if you have enough nodes on the network, you can get a pretty good overview of how a transaction is propagating over the network. Most nodes will reject a second transaction, or double spend, that conflicts with another transaction already in its pool of transactions waiting to be added to a block. The nodes don't have to do this, but most do. One way of double spending is to create two different transactions and announce them to opposite sides of the network at the same time. It's a race to see which node finds a block. But, if you can watch the transaction on the network, and all of the nodes have it without a double spend transaction, you can be a bit more sure that a double spend won't happen even without any blocks confirming. This won't protect you from someone that owns a lot of hashing power, or is doing sneaky stuff with nodes not announcing the transaction. Let me know if that needs clarifying.

Crypto is most definitely NOT the most popular direction of investment or financial activity. The whole thing is just buzzwords. Total bullshit.

I think the hard part about creating a credit score for bitcoin is that credit scores are a measure of how well you pay back debt, more or less. I think this is the type of thing that needs to be talked about when someone wants to implement loans in bitcoin with some type of smart contact.

Is it just me, or does this seem non linear? If it's doubling, it's exponential. Even if it's linear in-between the doubling, it's approximating exponential in the long term.

Yes. They closed trading a while ago. He opened it up for a short period towards the end of the bankruptcy filing period to sell goxbtc for a fixed rate. He had to claim a certain amount to the trustees. I think it's just a domain that he is recycling for business opportunities.

Yeah, that would probably protect you. I don't know how this possible attack works, but there aren't any known vulnerabilities with trezor that I know of. I'm pretty sure you're still save if you plug the device into an infected computer, but it's all risks and tradeoffs. We can't be sure there aren't vulnerabilities that we don't know about, yet.

It seems like the topic you're actually curious about is public key/private key cryptography (also known as asymmetric key cryptography). Plenty of people are trying to explain it here, but you'll have better understanding being able to research it online yourself.

I think an id or passport would be really easy to fake for a picture. Not photoshopping, but making a fake id that looks real in a photo but would never pass if you saw it in person.

In fact, LukeJr already wrote the code.

I believe this comes with the tradeoff of a user not being able to verify, after the fact, that their vote was counted. They could wait for block confirmations and delete their private key. Nobody can make you prove how you voted if you deleted the private key.

Three article explicitly says that the trezor firmware is signed, which is what I was talking about. The modified bwallet firmware is not, which is why it still fails security validations. So sure, you can modify it, but you could have modified the signed trezor software with the same result: unsigned firmware.

You could open a blank text file and press the button on the yubikey about a hundred times(or however many you feel comfortable with) to have the codes just in case you need them.

No, it's not a similar process at all. Did you even read what you linked?


It's an audit done by a third party. Mt Gox had a third party audit done by Roger Ver, too.

That site literally lists no websites that use it, and it still has Mt. Gox in the documentation.

I don't think you can do that if the binary is signed, which I assume it is. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Every time a new block is found, essentially all account balances are updated. Private keys control the funds in your account. If someone gains access to your private key, they can send your bitcoins somewhere else. Your account balance is something that you cannot copy nor duplicate thanks to the block chain.

That's exactly your problem. You think, how could that possibly be bad, let me open the file to see how this scam works, BAM, they've got code executing on your computer looking for wallet files. Don't ever open files like that from the internet. Did you know that you can embed arbitrary executable in a pdf? It's considered a FEATURE.

Yeah, the only person I know to have ever done that was Mark Karpeles. 


Have you ever seen an exchange do that? It's not really a typical process if nobody does it. It's a theoretical process.

That's not his point. He's trying to show that there is no customer protection like there is for a credit card.

He's not trolling, he's just saying it's nerve racking as his first experience. He's not asking for anyone's money, and it seems to be sorted out already.
