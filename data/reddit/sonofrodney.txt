The thing many people never see about this bubble argument that prices going up in the long term and bitcoin being a bubble right now are not contradictory statements.
Right now it can be argued that bitcoin is in a significant bubble, that is popping as we speak. It can also be argued that after the "panic" phase the price will return to a healthy level and it will go up again, and might bubble in a few months/years just as it did before.
IMO this is the most likely outcome, but as it's bitcoin, who knows.

Almost all of the arguments are valid and point to it actually being a Bubble, and your experience is laughably short for you comment to mean anything.
I Keep saying this on this sub: bitcoin might be the currency of the future AND in a bubble right now, there's no reason for both statements to excuse each other. Long term growth is measured in years,  not months.

The idea that bitcoin can not possibly be in a bubble since it dropped before is stupid. Those were bubbles too, it returned to the slow but steady mean, and now it's in a bubble again.
Bubbles can and have happened multiple times in many cases.
And there are many good reasons to believe bitcoin is in a bubble, the high prices coupled with reduced usability of the core function is a very good indicator.
But since it's bitcoin, really who knows, it could very well go up again. Since public opinion changed against it though, unlikely.

Thats what the mean is my man, there can be multiple bubbles and crashes in the lifetime of and speculative asset.
Bitcoin might crash hard and return to a sensible growth. Might not either.
