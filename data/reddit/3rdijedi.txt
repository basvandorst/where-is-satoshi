You cannot ban bitcoin . . . You can try but its like catching water in your hand. It just slips through your fingers. As soon as people (the masses) realize this, banks are doomed &amp; world will change forever. To ban bitcoin you need to ban English. Letters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or if they use mnemonic seeds, then English all together. 
That. Is not. Going to. Happen. 
Better off banning freewill. Air. Or water. Those make more sense than English.

Follow the coins through addresses within the outbound transaction trees at best you can find where its sitting, the address, and follow it each time it moves to a new one, this can be done with tiny amounts over 1000s or more of addresses though. Then you could at least notify authorities/LEO at time of spending if that'd do any good at all? Better hope they dont tumble or convert to monero and back to btc. Very little chance of recovery but rippers could atleast see justice... get HODLing asap and youll be fine in no time. In future could multisig prevent instances like this if you used two signatures under your control? If attacker only gets one your still protected? Or have a 3rd party/buddy control a 3rd signature to unlock access after your 2 multi signatures are verified?

CIA/NSA destroy world financial &amp; banking systems ...? that seems to be counter productive. Wouldnt you need Tricky Dick Nixon Fun Bucks (USD$) to continue the complacent consentual based system of "slavery" we call fear of loss? Cypherpunks had a say in this creation, without a doubt. In fact, I think it was the guy that created RSA(RAS?) encryption or helped develop PGP encryption that was thrown in jail for creating a good encryption protocol under pretenses of international weapons/arms trafficking that must have  resonated in the bitcoin protocol creator's minds. I believe Vinny Gupta talks of this in UlteriorStates. Cryptography after all is seen by the authorities as a weapon. lol To get around this cryptographers share information legally, not software which is illegal??? Usually by printing or copying a piece of software's source code will skirt this restriction. The people behind bitcoin studied this thoroughly, Merkle, Diffie, Helmand(?), etc's work. Its why bitcoin utilizes merkle trees, pgp encryption &amp; public and private key  (unidirectional) encryption protocols. Taking the banks out would not be in NSA/DOJs best interests. At this point its the old saying: " if you cant beat them join them" type logic. If its not running through their minds (DOJ) now then they must still think they can flashbang and raid a math problem into submission or threaten imprisonment on a number ���� maybe indict the MIT team behind its open source software licensing so they can guarantee a warranty canary with licensing restrictions in silence. Isnt that what happened with TOR and one of its developers/creators? If I recall correctly the difference is that they utilized the developer (an individual person) through an indictment/subpoena to appear in court as a point of pressure for the program, i.e. install a backdoor security flaw or zeroday in TOR software protocol or we go after you, your livelihood, your loved ones, &amp; your freedom. Bitcoin is resilient to this in some degrees, but if a similar approach were to be used to pressure MIT directly or an individual bitcoin core developer then we will be very thankful for majority consensus rules &amp; protocols, rendering the attempt a useless waste of resources &amp; more importantly, squandering the precious time available. That said, from my understanding, and this is the beautiful part: if im correct, all financial, banking, trade, government, law enforcement, etc (all besides military) based digital data storage systems/servers use SHA256 bit encryption. This means if bitcoins encryption is prematurely broken, before we vote in concensus for SHA512 or SHA1024/1028? bit encryption protocols to be implemented, then it puts a green light in all the black hats and nation state cyber hacker teams that all the money in any system globally can now be broken into/will be broken into for someone has already done it. Not just bitcoin/alts but all financial storage systems for fiat/forex/stocks as well. To break bitcoin you break all of 'the system's' security as well. Anyone who can add to or correct any of this feel free. Military, to my knowledge, use 512 and higher as the standard today for basic/non-sensitive data. Either way trying to crack the btc protocol without trampling the other industries encryption is like a soldier standing on a bouncing betty with his enemy 1 foot length ahead of his own feet, take one out and both go down simultaneously. The beauty of bitcoin. Wild card bitchesss, bitcoin just cut the financial industries brake lines.

Back and forth and back and forth. [Probably rumor mill/chuffa bs]
Like it today, hate it tomorow... every week.
India could have filled the Chinese mining industry's void. Come on Modi wtf are you doing. Cheap power, tech sectors rivaling other Asian nations (bar Japan, China, &amp; Taiwan), mass of tech savy English speaking potential work force that could benefit immensely, &amp; all the while making India (Bangalore/Mumbai) the first to endorse bitcoin industry behind Vietnam, China (eh?...ify these days?), &amp; Japan [the true Asian bitcoin gungho fanatic believers]. Which would be huge for India. 
India is sleeping on their chance at 1st world tech sector demands. Sad. Hopefully the Indian people will take their futures and fates into their own hands and do it any way. Otherwise Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, &amp; Korea(s?) will fill the void before India/Nepal/Bangladesh/Bhutan can begin to go online. Stop fucking around India. Why aren't you making your own 15 or 16nm ASIC chips? What am I missing besides tea time &amp; cricket?

Headlines of the future: Governments ban freewill!
 Or ... 
Governments try to ban bitcoin and realize they have to ban English letters, words, &amp; numbers 0-9...
Oh wait... yeah thats gonna be tricky. Better off shutting internet down, but thats too late since we already have satellite nodes now. Plus all world commerce/economic activity would come to a stand still, or near to, without internet i.e disaster. But lets say hypothetically emp/solar flare/internet blackout occurs, it doesnt matter you can run node to node connections without internet access, therefore creating a second internet like system based on the store of value behind bitcoins protocol. This is, of course, as long as the machines containing the copies of the full blockchain ledger are not fried by emp/Solar flare, then reconnecting wont be a huge issue. If you can get access to power or a non fried machine the rest would be trivial. Its like intranet but within bitcoins protocol. Today we piggy back on internet connections for the nodes to connect through but already this is changing. Now with lightning network and atomic swaps/Schorr sigs enroute there should be no reason why we cant integrate that same type of node over ip connection with mobile data networks and again the blockstream satellite nodes.
What a beautiful time to be alive, eh comrades? The Digital Renaissance perhaps? The Binary Revolution? 
Im sure a lot of technical users will rip this apart but essentially this is how the network works. Loosely &amp; simply put from one of the first 50,000 miners active on network from back in 2010 on to today's point of view/expertise. If your not running a full node, setting up LN, &amp; getting ready for new developments/studying new tech releases then I am worried many will get left behind in the future of this industry. Get your node up and running today, learn how to get LN up &amp; running asap so you can start earning payment channel transaction fees for putting up proof of stake to open a channel or a few. You cant ban water, air, or an idea. They can try but we are all here doing our part ;) at least in Bitcoin Realms. Allan Greenspan still hasnt re read the white paper lmfao (im kidding but who knows how far off this is). Most people have no clue how this tech works. Example; there aren't actually addresses, we simply call them addresses but in fact they dont work like that, instead they are generated from the original hash into the private key&gt;public key. Accounts/Balances/Addresses, all of these are terms to add confidence &amp; comfort to a tech that doesnt work like these terms/concepts in a traditional way/sense in/of application to the banking/financial systems, the obsolescence to add comfort to a new realm for those who arent ready for the future. As Andreas states: many people will request/demand that banks slow btc transactions down to 3-5 business days &amp; add 5-15+% fees, like in banking. It comforts the masses in its adoption out of fear of change or fear of something new. A lot of people are going to get ripped off by the dying dinosaur bankers/regulators/bureaucrats...and Exchanges. 
Any Master Bitcoin Jedi Veterans want to add to/improve/correct/clarify on any of these points/concepts/theories please do so. The more I learn the less I feel I know in the bigger scope, but god damn is this knowledge quest addictive &amp; fulfilling. Feel like Neo following White Rabbit to Morphius with a flash drive/microSD of data more valuable than most realize. Stay safe comrades!

The ledger nano, nano s or HW.1? These are all different wallets. Which are you describing? Just USB ones with no LED screens? 
 I thought the nano &amp; HW.1s were basically an encrypted flash drive while Nano S has OLED/LED screen and is of a more advanced design. This being the next step down from the Ledger Blue in Ledger's product line which looks like it has a SSD/Battery pack (?) embedded under the OLED touch screen (Ledgers Big Boy Hardware Wallet ,$$$$). 
Heard good things about Ledger...BUT this sketches me out with the HW.1s/Flat Nano wallets...which are a good deal to buy or give away as gifts or in person BTC transactions with a physical token/totem, like a coin or bill note. 
Nano S it is I guess. 
Trezor &amp; KeepKey I've heard mixed reviews (the latter on the bad side), but bitBox seems to have potential (microSDs with encrypted wallet backups?) though much lesser known or publicly/time tested as the others. IMHO. 20-40 times would scare the shit out of me. Good luck comrade.

Mneumonic Seed Phrase. Pretty much Gandalf casts a spell of 12 words and he summons your BTC out of the digital ethos of the global network. So smash phone and computer, smash all phones and computers, smash the internet... and your btc is still safe.. as long as you have the 12-24 word phrases that mneumonic seeds use &amp; gave you at time of wallet creation. Selling your coins through a 3rd party will always have a fee of some sort. Bitcoin Core QT hasnt let me down since i started in 2010. Dont get why ppl have so much trouble with this. Electrum uses Mneumonic Seed Recovery, core does not. Bitcoin.org/ satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org (?) AAntonOP on youtube for bitcoin nerd porn. For electrum... try their site...If your ok losing everything youve invested leave it on coinbase but learn from gox, btce, nicehash, and all the future exit scams or losses that come with trusting a 3rd party with your coin. Eventually you'll get it. Use Linux if you plan on running core. Generate private keys offline, be concious of whats left on screen in case of malicious screen capture software (more of a concern on windows os). Stay safe and welcome to the revolution.

Dude read these comments. Ppl are straight up re tard ed in this community. The higher the value, the more idiots come in lookin for lambos. Ppl think coinbase is "the wallet". mt gox... might as well be talking klingon to a priest, try btce or nicehash, you get japanese &amp; mongolian language outputs. The only way ppl will learn is by losing out from stupidity. Just remember for every coin lost the value of the remaining coins skyrockets. HODL on Young Padawans the Force is Strong with this one.

All the more reason why Andreas is a much better Ambassador for the Bitcoin tribe. I agree with you about greed but isnt that the point of btc, to put the greedy fuckers on the chopping block for the world to say "fuck you, your out". So far its worked on Jihan, Ver, &amp; Vorhees fairly well, actually almost everyone whos gone against the original core values has been tossed aside. Look at craig wright he literally has just said hes satoshi a bunch over and over, while slipping up, and we're all over his bs scam lol. I mean its still early days of this. If this was the internet tech boom then we havent even got to Napster yet lol, its maybe netscape vs internet explorer days �� i think of bitcoin like obiwan Kenobi. Every attack on bitcoin just makes us all grow stronger. The more hatred and intensity behind the attacks just make the attacker weaker. Bitcoin the Binary Revolution. BTG S2X was closest attackers came, and look where we are now from that FUD before fork. 9% i think is what they had of network concensus? They bailed called it off and surprise forked following sunday, regrouping to lick their wounds and plan the next attack. Now we got BCD bitcoin diamond??? Bitcoin silver bitcoin uranium and every which coin fork planned in upcoming future. Would any of us be surprised if Original Bitcoin Classic came out? Lol you'd probably hear your older loved ones tell you they got a steal on 10 bitcoin for 50$ in 2022. Hell maybe back to back simultaneous forks off of Bitcoins chain to Original Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Classic. Confusion is the new weapon. For now.

Limited supply of 21M yes but way less will be able to be used after all lost coins are accounted for come 2140+. Not sure how many have been publically recorded as lost, encrypted with no password access, or dead owners. Fried HDDs &amp; flash drives as well. Think in next few years we'll see 1M out of circulation. Plus satoshis genesis block reward arent being used to date, so if it stays that way then another 1M+ are locked up out of circulation as well.

Actually by 2140 it'll be way less than 21M. Your missing idiots losing hdds, passwords, &amp; keys. Computers getting stolen/tossed or fried too will take away from that number as well.

Its a sticker, like on a collegiate qualifying exam. How they seal the tests. Once peeled the future buyer can determine if the coin has been tampered with. Even if the balance is still present it doesnt mean the seller cant withdraw the coin's wallet's balance at a later time leaving you with a gold coin worth... well.. only the golds value or 1/9th of 1 bitcoin (if 1oz). The seal lets you know that no one has ever had access to the private key, thus the balance still intact. The new buyer can peel and check for a 2nd level of added confirmation but ruining resale value as a collectable. Or just seeing seal/hologram intact would mean to a knowledgeable collector that the coin is legitimate. To me this seems like a gold coin labeled a bitcoin with no real backing of basis on bitcoin (i hope im wrong) like the copper coins that old ppl buy off amazon thinking they bought bitcoin for a great deal ... *sigh its a fuckin copper coin. No disrespect if it has a qr on other side it could be likely legitimate. Anyone who knows more about this type of coin please add to or correct my points brought up.

Sell shit for BTC, anything has a higher price online for Bitcoin, and you can ship to anywhere in the world, less overhead if you have digital goods to sell then you just instantly transfer them and get paid for unlimited selling inventory products. Open bazaar, bitify, bit premier, bitcoinclassified.net (&lt;-verify online first and reviews, looked to have been compromised recently), glyde is like a shitty early days amazon, and r/bitmarkets are all good places to sell pretty much anything aside from illegal shit for BTC or even other alts like LTC on a few in case you have various portfolios of different holdings. Localbitcoins is the shit!, Pretty much trade anything for btc and most times its near instantly. Paxful has similar promised features, can't speak for myself since I haven't tried it yet, seemed to have higher fees and charges. There's also a site for trading your trade skill, work set, or professional talents for BTC, can't remember the name, usual programming, scripting, site graphic design (or apps) like projects. Other times stupid surveys and shit that seems scammy to me. If you have a good computer with at least a gtx1080 (or 5) you actually still can mine, despite the neighsayers claiming it's impossible. You can't directly mine sha256 algo's with your computer, you can but you'll fry it pretty quick and get nothing for the cool ozone smells and loss of machine, at least at today's mining difficulty curve but you can mine alts and have them automatically converted into BTC, Nice Hash works good for this, don't ever reuse your primary btc wallet address for these kinds of things and never ever use an online website wallet, your asking to get scammed. Always make new wallet addresses for each new site you use. This way if one is compromised you don't loose all of your assets. Nice Hash won't pay out until you get to like 25-30$ or 0.01xxx.. btc but with a few 1080s and a i7-7700k you'll make upwards of a few hundred dollars a month, yes.. as bitcoins not alts. Nice Hash picks the best, and most profitable, algorithms based upon your system drivers, hardware, etc. and the current market rates for different crypto coins, you never see the other coins just btc for selling your machines hashing power to nice hash's different cypto mining pools. There's a profitability calc on the bottom left ~~header~~ **footer* of their main site that will tell you if your hardware can make a profit wherever you are and your local electrical rates / kwh. The more machines the better, but there is the issue of the GPU demand v shortage because of these types of rigs. So good luck getting a set of 5 gpus for msrp, seems to correlate to bitcoin demand too haha. I think even Nvidia and AMD made comments about how their cards are good for other stuff besides mining too... (*randy marsh head scratch looking down). Bottom line, you can never have too many bitcoins... ever.

Go the ATM route, you'll get a piece of paper, that's your bitcoins (stored in the address keys) when you understand how to safely use them add them to the wallet of your choosing, from some reading up Mycelium and Electrum are some of the better lightweight phone wallets. Otherwise just do it over your phone on local bitcoins and pay the extra +/-40% over market rate price, since you can literally do this anywhere in the USA instantly if you already have the giftcards purchased with the paid in cash receipts in hand as well. Those are your two best options. Where I'm at we don't have many BTC ATMs since NY's bullshit Bit Licensing Laws went into effect (most tri state atm operators ran out of NYC). Or you can take your chances with the exchanges left and still functioning like coinbase, bitstamp, poloniex, bitfenix, satoshi tango, bitmex, bitso, or any of the others, but from my experiences they only fuck the little guys over like yourself and you get screwed at the worst times. Picture trying to get a perfect head shot on COD across the level but as you pull the trigger you get network lag and side step and out of nowhere the (exchange's) player gets a knife kill on you across the entire level. That's how i see exchanges, and I don't feel they will be around too much longer (2-5 Years tops, unless they solve these issues with the trading bots trading at the most opportune times for the big money investors to cause market to go sideways in their favors and in the exchanges favor). Cash in person is good but the people are going to be weird 9/10 and if they aren't weird on the surface then they probably eat peoples organs and haven't got busted yet. There are a lot of shady stories from ppl who've gotten robbed over transacting in BTC or being cased by rippers/jackers who come to their places after they go to sleep to pull the robbery. Drug robbery style high-jackings basically. Or you could build a rig to mine coins or buy an Avalon 741 and PSU and set that little guy loose. If you use a phone wallet for live transaction between you and a second party seller you won't have an issue as long as you wait till you get 5-10 transaction confirmations, the atm route you just get the btc in hand as a paper wallet form the you can dip and no one has to be the wiser. Some do require you to link an ID or Credit Card/Bank Account to the transaction, try and avoid these since your identity will be tied to the coins. That's the only reason I suggested someone giving you better advice of how to get them back when you first posted. It can take people a long time to understand the process and risks. I'm just trying my best to give you a full list of possibilities of what your walking into but if you do it right you can probably make 200-250$ profit in one day once you break the over market % you end up paying. Then your going to start to see good money as long as the market doesn't tank because Satoshi turns out to be the DOGE dog in real life, or CIA or some stupid shit like Bruce Jenner. Take my advice with skepticism but I have been in this world since those two papa johns pizzas from UK to Florida for 10,000BTC and I've seen a lot in my time in this realm. Most important is that if you do not have your private keys, and you only, EXCLUSIVELY, then you actually don't have any bitcoins at all. A lot of fagtards don't get this concept even with all the exit scams and darknet scams. The other address you use for the public to transfer you money, like getting a check in the mail to your mailing address for work. You never share the private key, not with anyone or your money is there's if they maintain control of the key (have a copy of it). The paper receipt can make it any easier for your situation. You can hide them in a random book and read up on here and other forums until you truly find the best wallet for your situations, how you want to spend them, are you planning on vending/selling items like ebay or amazon, investing/trading, etc. If you've ever bought a pound of weed then treat this encounter and experience the same way except that you can get it out of a vending machine and it's traded on the stock markets now. Same kind of risks, since your dealing with a high value high demand commodity. Don't think LEO will help you either, they are well aware of the value and demand for BTC for their own portfolios as well. Unless your a Winklepuss Twin or Bank of America CEO, your on your own. Just more reason for concise advise that you can look at at a later point in time when things make more sense to you. Eventually if you get hungry enough to attain as much BTC as possible all of these methods will help, even trading although I knock it. I've seen a lot of people turn around and make insane amounts of cash going short or long in a few months time frame with BTC and using the defuckt market exchange sites. 25K$ in a few hours if done proper, a pro can turn that into a lot more by carefully buying low and selling high for multiple entry points and exit points during the same run. Had one buddy borrow 10K and pay the lender back in cash in less than 24hrs made about 8000$ profit. Blew my mind to the possibilities.

amazon my friend, get the cheapest 1 oz coins you can find, portland will have btc atms at a closer to market rate! Go forth young bitcoin padawan! You can get better rates on bulk coins of silver like 20 or more but it's usually close to 1oz market prices, idk forex i'm a crypto specialist. Other sites will offer slightly better rates but you loose your one stop all shop from your phone like amazon, plus you have to put your faith in other sites outside of amazon with their customer satisfaction policies i.e. insurance. I have traded silver and gold for other's crypto investment portfolios but not for my own portfolios. Mine comes from the mines of morrior (houses filled to the brim with gpu/cpu rigs, canaan avalons, &amp; baikal miners mining alts or btc and converting them (alts) to btc through nicehash miner) primarily with any extra side fiat i come into contact with into BTC through whatever is the most feasible and best rate i can come across at the given time of intended purchase. Sometimes it's regret, sometimes it's joy, but it's always: Why didn't I buy even more last dip??!! If i could get my hands on a D-Wave quantum processor and dial that puppy in for it's quantum sha256 equivalent algo i would absolutely start trying to figure out how the fuck i could fill the basement and first floors of said houses with the cryogenic cooling systems... but to get to a fraction of that startup capital I'd have to cash(opt) out, and fuck that noise, not ever! Oh i haven't used paxful but i've heard decent reviews, do your own research before committing to buying and don't take my word for absolutes. Localbitcoins are solid though i can vouch for them, just don't use something stupid like an itunes gift card or you'll never get shit (last i looked it was over 8000-10000$/itunes gift card purchased BTC).

KeePassX will hold everything but put your private keys on paper and only generate the private addresses disconnected from the network and internet. Once your wallets locked and all private keys are off screen you can reconnect to internet and network and allow the network to register and verify your new creation of your private key address. This is only safe if your machine doesn't have malware or a 0day on board unbeknownst to the owner of machine and wallet (sleeping, or watching for valuable data) since the private keys and qrs are a huge target for scammers. I have a machine specifically for this that has bluetooth and wireless gutted from inside. Once i close my key address lists I reconnect manually over cat6 for the network to update my new private key creation. Remember someone can screen shot your desktop with your wallet open and if your qr private keys are open and visible on your screens then you are potentially compromised (maybe not today but definitely sometime tomorrow / in the future). You can have the jpg or png image saved indefinitely as long as the original owner hasn't dumped funds to another wallet, then the QR can still be drained 100+ years from now. Just some food for thought. No phone wallets either, and you already know not to use web wallets [I hope].  I use jpgs of my public addresses on my mobile and have someone over the fone confirm if my wallet has 10+ transaction confirmations before leaving or calling the deal legit. No private keys or wallet access stored on any of my mobile devices (bluetooth never on), as well as no passwords or phrases stored on them; either in case of theft or loss, or hack. If anyone feels this is overkill please elaborate your reasoning. Then when it hits 10K$/BTC ask if it's still overkill.

I did read about something with blockerupter USB ASIC miners being used as a block reward lottery type mining approach. You have something like a 1/70,000(?) chance that you win once in 365 days of the year, which is better than a lottery's odds. Now you have to keep them plugged in and actively mining 24/7/365 for that 1/70,000 shot at getting the luck portion of the btc mining reward. It also said you had something like a 1/250,000 chance to win that block reward through solo mining with luck in a day's odds so that's 365/250,000 [1:684.93] chance in a year on top of your yearly 1/70,000 odds. If you had 10 usb erupters then it gets a lot more likely, but that article/post could have been 2 or 3 years old since it was talking about block erupter mining and the difficulty is obviously different at the times of writing that and this. But the block reward today is what? 12 something btc or did it halve? 6.5btc? but still to power a usb asic chip for a year shouldn't cost very much in terms of power and equipment faults, besides usb fans. Literally your bitcoin lottery does exist. I know this had nothing to do with your posted point but it reminded me and i thought i'd share. Feel free to verify and fact check my accuracy. You are right though, mining today with even one ASIC mining machine (Avalon 741 or anything else) wouldn't really give you a huge reward with your competition around the globe in the super mines with pooled hashrates and computational power. Very good comparison though. I mine alts and convert to BTC through nicehashminer, used to pool mine on bitminter (among one of the first &lt;250,000 original miners active on network) back in the earlier days with ASICs before we cashed out and sold the equipment pre bitmain rapeage back when butterfly labs were a bigger player in the early days of '11-13. Now just gpu rigs frankensteined together all across the lands working the digital mines of indentured bond servitude thanks to nicehash.

Probably when you meet them you verify that they have the same code or vice versa you each take each others VC and enter it in sites transaction windows as you/them send the verification instructions. It seems to be used to prove the person being met is the person who contacted you for safety and to ensure no man in middle to physical robbery of sellers. If you want to do it from anywhere instantly with Amazon Gift Cards you can do it really easily but you pay upwards of +40% over market rates. You have to use cash to purchase the amazon gift cards (if you use debit or have no receipt you'll pay far higher rates closer to 60% over rate), have a cash purchase receipt and make sure to only have one gift card / receipt just to be safe of all sellers so you can get best deals if some have some other criteria for you to buy from them. Sometimes you get some hungry sellers worried about fear of loss who drop below market for a larger buy order. Rarely though and doubtful now post Segwit2X you'll see below 3500-4000$/btc. No hassle with markets or exchanges locking you out during peak moments or crucial trading times. You just need to meet their terms and make sure they are reputable. Local buy / sell should be interesting. Be smart and know your surroundings, if your transacting over 3000-5000$ USD in states you could be getting set up by LEO or Federal Agents of IRS or Federal Reserve and they'll just civil asset forfeit the funds on the spot if you can't show proof of legal ownership. Check out the shoes, you can always tell a cop by the footwear their wearing. (This shouldn't be a huge problem now, but in near future it will be a major one (if and when exchanges start going down))

I been learning off of trading view, rule of thumb is like reddit. Do 180 of what ppl tell you on there, a lot of ppl tell you bad info to help their favor. Really stupid shit trying to make it just like a stock or commodity of public trading interest. But you can use that type of mindset to your advantage if you have any idea about BTC, Segwit2x and bip148 drama was a great time to play the market in your favor. Wait for next media drama storm and check it out ahead of time so you can start to understand market trading, i sure as shit still don't. r/bitcoinmarkets will have more info for you for sure.

I was only comparing it's viral growth and cultural success to that of mobile phone networks social movement and the internet tech boom and modern aged internet generation social movements (like the tulip mania socio/cultural movements of Holland; Yes it was economically driven but it still was a cultural society's perceived status based norms that fueled the demand). It's scarcity is entirely in itself (Bitcoin): &lt;21M (accurately more like, maybe, 18-20M with corrections for loss or inaccessible accounts) BTC to ever be mined. That is what makes bitcoin valuable, along with it's newly imploding demand for BTC as there are more buyers and less sellers (i.e. demand v. scarcity = +ATHs, in fundamental bitcoin theory of "I want that.. but you don't have any to give, I'll pay more then to anyone who will give me that _ !?").

Agreed on no one broadcasting internet to the island, but what about satellite internet? Coverage a no go in Cuba? But if your paying 200$ a night for premium hotel and internet service i don't think they would give a shit. + You can throw them even more for letting you function. You could operate on the off hours once or twice a day so you wouldn't have to use crazy amounts of hotel's bandwidth. Preev.com the price of btc to CUC &amp; CUP, it's actually really similar to USD rates. But this is market rates, you don't charge market rates, you can charge 10,000 a btc if you want honestly since you would have cornered the local market. Usually with my experience with networks and ISPs complaining with crazy high bandwidth usage means, "we'll shut up and leave you alone if you give us more money"..."more money please?" If there is satellite network coverage you could use a prepaid satellite internet hotspot to do it anywhere on the island, or in the world remotely for that matter (as long as you get cell/Sat coverage). So what do you say? Wanna start a Cuban Bitcoin Local Exchange Services (CBTCLES)? Maybe we can watch Star Wars with Raoul Castro and smoke Cuban cigars while he reminisces of times with Che Guevara and the Cuban resistance. LMFAO Cuban's could really benefit from this world.

Anyone mentioning the point as to what happens if a cluster of these bad boys or the predecessors to the quantum D-Wave processor systems today start to try to mine SHA256 algorithms? Did I miss something somewhere or will this hike the difficulty curve for the mining tech to a new level that the public sectors can't compete with for block rewards besides the luck reward factor? ASICs would be the old CPU type mining in comparison and I don't foresee the next tech to come out from ASIC besides the Quantum Miners for private or "research" market sectors.

trade with an amazon gift card then. Your town has a drug store or dollar store or wallmart that sells amazon prepaid gift cards right? You won't get market rates but you'll actually get your btc and forego the DOMO of not going in sooner. Its actually really really easy you just take pics of each card in packaging when your ready to transact you give them the scratch off code with the paid for cash receipt (as long as there reliable and have good feedback, don't ever send the codes right from the start, if the seller has weird rules and they cancel the transaction then they have your amazon gift card code), you can do it over your phone or on pc/mac/redhat machine. Once you upload everything the seller asked for he'll say ok i'm initializing the trade. Coins go to the site on localbitcoins and then you get your coins sent to the address you specified in localbitcoins, never ever leave them in a website wallet, not ever. Then once you have them you confirm the transaction was successful and you can review the seller as a courtesy for not efing you in the a. Again your going to pay upwards of 40% over the preev.com averaged price but then again how many ppl actually get btc at the live rate from any exchange for under 10-25K$ in trading capital invested? If it's made illegal tomorrow and it goes to over 10K$ a btc your going to be happy you got them regardless of over paying. The other option is to use bank transfer features but the IRS will go after you after certain amounts are deposited, just like the Colorado and Washington state shops that have their business, personal, and non cannabis related business accounts seized and taken by federal government. If you make the bank more money they will likely leave you at arms length but if you take then they will audit your ass, even for petty amounts of cash used to buy coin, &lt;20,000$ deposits at once (transaction). You could also just drive to the neighboring big city and see whats available in the areas for local in person cash trade, although you will guaranteed meet some weird ass motherfuckers, might as well be morphius and neo your going to meet with. Or my favorite and a pretty damn good deal, trade 1Oz 99.999 Silver Coins or 1Oz 99.999 Gold coins for a much better rate for BTC, you have to mail them and it does appear to me to be a pretty good opportunity to burn someone, but if they are reputable then it would have to be several big orders for them to try and scam you out of your XAG or XAU for BTC. paxful.com and localbitcoins.com can help you find different deals around the globe. Are you in it to make a quick buck (&lt;1000$) or go long (?&gt;10M$in 25-40years time) and put your faith into the next internet/cellphone like game changing technology?

Correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't this the same thing they (governmentz) do to the legal cannabis industries around the globe? Both of which sound like the banking term: bail-in, which is basically **Yoink*, accounts seized to recoup banks personal asset losses. Good examples of non cannabis or BTC related issues would be Cyprus, Malta, and Greece. Each followed a similar strategy, basically straight up robbery of the bank account holders legally earned assets to save the head of the banks. Time to stop using your banks and start using BTC as your bank exclusively, they will do it to your other bank accounts through other banks as well as any business accounts you have, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but at some point soon they will close all of your accounts, this has been going on in the US for better part of over 20 years with legal cannabis industry. They figure Bitcoiners and Ganjaheads don't get to have rights that the rest of the world are entitled to and also won't cause a big problem if the account earnings were generated in a legal grey area. Hey do any of us even have legal recourse? Haha India has / is setting up regulatory laws now, you may be able to fight it later once legal framework takes affect, but knowing India, you'll have to wet a few beaks out of pocket along the route (best option but crooked as shit) likely result actually being they just take your hard earned crypto or rupee and you start over and don't use the banks this time. Hope you were in &lt;the 1.0BTC club brother. In the states if you use the bank transfers for selling btc and earning big money, you'll absolutely be audited by IRS and that's only if they feel uncomfortable about shutting down your account and claiming your funds for their own, for whatever reason you give them; honest business owner with bank for 20+years, deposits large sums of money into different accounts held with bank over long time frames before use or reallocation, everything legal and clean, or even the local branch relationships you have with certain individuals in the bank (least likely potential to help you). Without a doubt the banks hate loosing money to BTC Sellers = low hanging banker bail-in bait. Buyers however won't have a problem with buying over bank transfer for maybe another year or two unless you handle volumes upwards of 50-100Coins /day-week, but once price goes over 10K$ they will certainly come after you like IRS will in next year or two when they realize to go the other direction from sellers to buyers in terms of who to audit and look for rounding up more claimed assets to seize. I wouldn't be surprised if in next 5 years if buyers with average purchase volumes of 5-10BTC could be targeted for quick generation of seize-able assets and properties. 
BTC to me comes off a bit like fight club; 
Rule  of BTC: Don't talk about BTC, to anyone.
Rule  of BTC: Don't talk about BTC, to anyone.
Rule  of BTC: Don't talk about BTC, to anyone.
Rule  and so on
I hope that this is proven inaccurate in next two years by developing new tech but the Federal governments of US and India, as well as all other nations, will want to gain more income from cases like this, my guess is probably to buy more Bitcoin hahaha probably through some shady ass shit like the ETH/BTC platform through Ethereum off the hedge fund &amp; tarp loan specialists behind Ethereum's market capital funding. If we go the stock market route it will be regulated into a shit hole as best as the governmentz can, if you can kill it through regulation (you can't but you can slow it's value growth). I feel like the weighted true price of btc without market manipulation in favor of big money investors trading through bots to trade at the most opportune times for themselves and drive the market sideways for much longer extended periods of time in order to slow it's total growth over time in relativity to a short span of time (say 1 year), is likely somewhere over 4-5000$ today / btc. How many ppl actually pay market rates or even close to them? I know for myself I either pay under (non knowledgeable or wholesale bulk sellers desperate in the dips) or over market rates nearly every single time but almost never on the averaged market rate. For someone using services outside of an exchange, person to person trading, local area network exchange, or even trading an item or service for minimum 4X it's USD$ estimated approximate value the price of BTC can range, today, from 3200-10000$+/BTC depending on if the seller is "I'm high on fucking crack yo give me itunes cards" or just greedy. To my knowledge none of this is taken into account by the traditional Bitcoin Exchange markets. They only focus on their exchanges and not all of bitcoin's averaged value as a whole, this could cause sellers to always pay in a small scale standardized rate vs. actually what ppl around the world are willing to pay for BTC. Seems that the stock market think tanks are just trying their best to run BTC into another stock type trade-able commodity where they see all of it's benefits in the end, kind of like trying to catch a bucket of falling water between your fingers if you ask me. Pointless. I will be surprised if all the exchange markets in US aren't shut down by 2020-2025, assets seized and all, obviously new methods of BTC trading will come to fruition, likely P2P 'I have coins you want this' trading services around the globe. Banks are not your friends [FULL STOP] 
Use your BTC wallets as your bank accounts, again though phone wallets feel to follow similar practices where you get charged by many like bank fees and hidden costs that you never expect. I'm sure "legally" if your still trying to play by their (govmentz) rules your going to be loosing to the rules of the few's governance of the many (Not because you did something immoral or wrong but because you competed with the entitled, and they fucking hate competition). So I say fuck it, close/cash out your bank and trading accounts buy BTC locally with RS and make a laptop or desktop machine your designated wallet machine, use it for nothing but that, don't use Windows or Mac, go with a Redhat/Linux distro and in my opinion (if someone can recommend a better, more secure, time proven way please do so) use Bitcoin Core QT as a full node with a seriously well made passphrase for your encryption. I use a desktop for my main full node machine and a laptop with it's wireless and bluetooth disabled (ripped out) that i connect with my assets to the internet only once I want to update it and sync with networks most recent transactions, i still run a full node on desktop but i have the control to manually connect through cat6 to Ethernet port for my primary "BTC Vault" laptop machine so that as soon as I'm updated I can disconnect and run no risk of being compromised. I do not use either machine for anything but the designated task. Desktop = 24/7 Full node, Laptop = My Wallet with assets technically not cold storage but mostly stored coldly off of network until i sync. I also backup my dat files every time it syncs for both wallets, even though the full node is not utilized for any transactions, just left empty and running to support the network. If I wanted to I could route the laptop to the desktops full node through porting so that all of my laptop transactions go through my full node through the on board terminal client in bitcoin core qt, buffering it from the other nodes by however many factors i choose to set (number of machine jumps), but that would defeat my intended goal of keeping my laptop only connected when I need to synchronize with the network for security purposes. I also offload all my dat files to either flash drives or microsd (not so trusting of microsd still, had some corruptions happen early on in late 2009/early 10 that left a bad taste in my mouth), or cd dvd if i choose, but more likely, so others could recover the assets, I use paper wallets, especially for small increments as gifts or for trade to get people pumped and into BTC. I laminate them in plastic and then store them in vacuum sealed mylar bags, 2-3x for safety, keep them in a fire proof safe and some buried around the world ;) By having them in Mylar/Vacuum Bags you can tell if they have been tampered with as well and know if someone opens or reseals them, just added security. By doing this you remove a chance of attack from your machines, i also back up the blockchain data every few days on an external hdd, so I can start up and begin again if a machine is compromised. Don't fuck around this shit is your (our) future, you don't want to end up broke, well too broke that is. In India trade gold or silver oz coins for BTC easy with the right traders. And remember CryptoKidz: Bankz are Not Your Friendz, ever. Never ever ever!

install bitcoin core qt on an external hdd (usb 3.0 if possible) then load it (the backup.dat files &lt;-***** make a copy) into bitcoin core qt if the update/network sync is past the dates of your mining experiments then likely you did not receive a payout and the 0.0 balance is accurate. Again though you may have been paid around 2013 when the crash happened (so pools wouldn't have to pay you as much) or around the 2012 mark depending on if the pool is still around (and was honest to pay miners their leftover btc change [below minimum payout thresholds]. If you were accidentally pool mining without your knowledge, it happens to ppl. But if you were solo mining and you had the hardware running for X days or Years then once the update/network sync reaches the rough estimate X day of X year + a year, give or take, over your estimate of turning off your hardware's date, you should have any payments generated from mining, if 0.0 then you didn't earn a block reward. Simplified you don't have to wait until today's date to absolutely know for sure if you have anything or not, you'll know within 1 year or so of the date you remember last using your hardware for mining (before you shut it off for good), if it gets to 2015 and it still shows 0.0 then you got nothing. But that said there is always the chance that someone accidentally sent you btc to that address, so i'd go with the external hdd and just check for shits and giggles. who knows maybe your loaded. think its less than 160gb for the whole blockchain today.

Make your own charity and use the revenue to fund something of your choosing so you know, at least to some degree, whether or not your funds are being used for said end outcome. All you need is a page or site where you can host the address QRs and you can cycle them every few weeks or months to not have to worry about getting attacked or hacked. As long as no one outside of you tampers with the qr address I don't see how it could go wrong. A school, a clinic, a shitty road that no one will fix for whatever reason, fuck hire a clown to hand out joints or clean needles to passersby in some rough part of town.

It's unstoppable so why not let the inside divide it for you to cause market flux and turmoil (seems to be the logic of the continued failure rhetoric). Soon it will be far beyond the vast public majority's economic reach. The upper class cannot wait until BTC is valuable enough to transmit billions or trillions at once into a flash drive and carry that across a boarder tax free and unbeknownst to any along the trip. The segwit2x and hardfork drama just means another price dip for the ones paying attention before it becomes out of reach for the middle class and lower upper class income level groups. Honestly how many of you have been at this since BTC was worth less than a penny? And how many remember the 2 pizzas and deciding to try mt.gox in its genesis days? Bitcoin's just getting started. Start scrounging your GIF and JPG meme folder collections for your best Vegeta "over 9000" memes. The individuals with the most BTC in the next 50 years will be the families who run the future world. If you haven't seen this yet then I apologize but your missing some of the greatest and most controversial points of BTC. A ban would be the next best thing to quadruple the price over night, but that's not going to happen, if it does then that means the regulators are scared shitless.

No one is answering how to buy the coin? Seriously by the time this bloke tries and purchases his first 500$ he'll be lucky to get .1-.15BTC and that's if he can get it at the current (future [Tomorrow, 3 Days from now, Next Week, ETC]) rates from any exchange on a volume of only 500$ worth?? (Roight?!) So unless your going to pay anywhere from 25-75% over market rates for a local or instant gift card transaction your not going to be getting any btc by the time it hits next quick rush higher prices. Buying at 2800 is better than buying at 3200 but then again a few weeks ago 1850 was a good entry point as well. Like i said i doubt anyone can actually pay for only 500 (or even 1500$) worth at a rate comparable with a live market average between all exchanges, more than likely you'll pay over market rate in fees and exchange bullshit as someone puts in a massive buy or sell order to change the exchanges rates conveniently in the house's favor. Best bet is to find someone who will sell you the coins locally as long as your not in NYC (cue paulie shore* illegal illegal illegal Roight?) you can do this anywhere and you probably will only pay 10-25% over market rates. I'd go all in at once and wait for best price since you decided to go in, if you've missed the opportunity to buy in at the initial rate you first saw then go in the next dip if you can (that is using a market exchange route of acquiring them). My two cents, I'm not a bitcoin trader, i'm a HODLer for life, since this is r/bitcoin and not r/bitcoinmarkets &lt;- those fuckers love their technicals, but got no fundamentals (BTC Specz) and they get a purple raging hard on for nice fancy chart specz every time.

Antimatter lubricated barrier sleeves of darkmatter with a hint of gold and rare earth metals for matter semi conductors and conductors ;P Forget the fact that it can power the entire infinite dimensional planes with infinite watts of power but also could destroy said realms of existence... more like a darkmatter/antimatter reactor generator/... or a bomb... a really really big bomb. haha no instead of 0s and 1s they read in 0 and 1 and both 0&amp;1 simultaneously (a qubit?), all matter and energy related to the physical &amp; metaphysical components of our Earthly realm. But you can't get that antimatter/darkmatter energy generator without a quantum computer of equally powerful relative size. And cooling today's early prototypical and analytical test models (usually) take up an entire floor or two of some University Quantum Computing departments (UCSB), that's a lot of liquid nitrogen for cryogenic cooling. Then again this could potentially give someone the answer to infinite power, i.e. light speed propulsion is a thing of the past. Forget about fusion or fission we're talking instant and unlimited perpetually replenish-able power, how to control that and not end life's very  existence in every single realm in parallel dimensional existence of every world, planet or celestial body is beyond my sci-fi reasoning. Anyone want to develop off this go nuts if you understand what the fuck darkmatter or antimatter for that matter (or dark energy) actually means (entails), you'll be closer than some of the most learned scholars, research scientists, and brilliant minds of our modern time.

Also what I was thinking! THEY'RE INSIDE OF THE TOASTER!  (Like Zoolander). Break that shit open and see what you find hahaha if they paid 3000BTC for the toaster then there's no point in not breaking it open to find out since you would already own it at a cost of 3000btc or 0 btc, but if there's a chance that they hid 3000 btc inside then you might just want to say fuck it and take the sucker apart to confirm or deny the findings for yourself. Anything etched (key or passphrase) in the metal on the bottom plate or inside on the flat walls or flat metal surfaces of the housing? I'd smoke a bunch of weed and go Munich on that toaster, search it like its a fucking toy maker's bomb.

They're all awesome. Imagine 20 years time from today's "media" coverage of what's going on. 
EDIT: In 20 - 50 years anyone who has some small amounts of BTC &lt;1000BTC and living outside of the US, Russia, China, or Europe will become a target for massive black ops hijackings of these assets. Whether from organized crime syndicates, cartels, or government agencies on behalf of the nation's interests. You can guarantee Venezuela, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand (Hey look Alexandre Cazes had this happen less than 2 months ago, woops a little early for my predictions), Iran, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh (once they un-ban them), Philippines, &amp; Indonesia, not to mention the eastern European nations; such as, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Monte Negro, Romania, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Hungary, &amp; Turkey. The more chaos ensuing in each nation the higher the chance, watch Greece, Cyprus, and Malta for future smaller scale examples.

Except that bitcoin has scarcity compared to fucking tulip bulbs haha. It's more comparable to the internet movement or the birth of cellular phone technology/infrastructure. Are we still in cell phone mania? Or Internet AOL aids-like-discs galore festopia? We're not going anywhere but up, comrades, colleagues, &amp; fellow bitcoiners! You've heard of the Industrial Revolutions of the world throughout history and this is the birth of the Digital Revolution of today's world. 
Best part, notice in the painting that the cart is going into the sea and that there is already a cart or so in the sea with drowning fanatics. That's what happens when you make Pokemon cards or Tulips your financial backing, might as well invest all your assets into chocolate-fucking-pudding. Or if your a Jerry who thinks collectible R2D2 coins will increase in value because he was told they would, make sure to get the warranty Jerry or the bitcoin insurance policy (Great deal jerry! btc are only 10K$/btc with the insurance policy what a steal?!). BTC is the worlds most simple and honest free for all instantly transacting unlimited accounts savings account type bank account available in the world. Just these tuliptards will be the ones who loose out. The ones that think bitcoin is a physical metal coin that you insert into your fone like an old copy machine are the ones who'll loose. Look at the BCH fiasco and how many tards are probably thinking their getting the deal of century ("?But its got bitcoin in the name, how can this not be a bitcoin or a bad deal??" *In randy marsh's voice). Not the ones who have understood the concept and theory behind btc, and have been here from the beginning days. I think satoshi said something along the lines of if you don't understand it i don't got to teach it to you and convince you of it's value or potential.. or something or other to that effect.
Good post OP, isn't life all just a bubble waiting to burst. Sounds like a way to scare away the masses while the few informed scour up all they can the usual ways pre bitcoin genesis. ETH is the true candidate for tulipmania haha

Never underestimate the power of the Indian nation, they have never been conquered by China in history, the British maybe but not China. Correct me if I'm wrong, plus you have the Tibet card. haha Look at Afghanistan, ppl forget that Afghanistan has never been conquered by a foreign invader in history, British, Russian, American, Fail fail fail. The people of the Hindustani regions are some of the most resilient and gifted minds on earth. Archimedes likely would not have given us the formulas we use to this day for everything, even if unknown to us, in our lives from buoyancy to GPS navigation, the azimuth, and 3 dimensional aeronautical navigation base points for today's infrastructure and world logistical support had he not learned formulae and concepts of mathematics from teachers and students of ancient Indian mathematicians and early day mathematical scientists. You like the clock on your wrist, thank an Indian because the concept of measuring time by sundial was from an Indian mathematician and basis for the modern clock. Space travel would be nonexistent for humans without the Indian people and their surrounding brethren &amp; neighbors. Calculators&gt;Abacus &lt;- Made by an Indian of the ancient greater Hindustani regional empires. China will never conquer India! Everyone on Earth will be dead of nuclear fall out before more than 10,000 Chinese troops make it across the Himalayan boarder territories and India's vast and powerful military eliminates them, all soldiers would die from nuclear fallout on both sides of course. I could see Iran backing Pakistan and being more of a "real" nuclear threat in near future to India, except that they seem occupied with hating the fuck out of Israel compulsory and perpetually indefinitely (Iran v. Israel that is). It's literally nuclear atomic dick measuring contests all over the world right now. The old powder white wig British fuckers and old rich dusty American super elite have forgotten that all of this is in the hands of the digital age, the youth and their laptops and desktops, soon mobiles and the next future tech that actually can gain access and fuck everything up for everyone while they measure their dicks. I don't know what's worse that war games is looking more likely or that water world is... Fuck. Oh yeah the Chinese might cut off your fresh water supplies from the Tibetan plateau though..

Paper wallets laminated and vacuum sealed for long term secured storage, be careful setting up the paper wallets they can be tricky if you try and withdraw partial amounts of the total btc deposited into the wallet. I believe safest way to use them is to just print more wallets before making a transaction you deposit the varying amount needed for spending into the secondary wallet and then dump the first one into a new paper wallet. Something to do with one time use paper wallets and loosing the leftover btc satoshi/ "change". But you have to be careful that your machine is not compromised while you generate the private keys and private key QR images, if someone sees these and screen captures the keys they can snatch your btc whenever they want to (sooner or way into the future when your feeling comfy with your retirement plan), a major flaw with paper wallets until someone comes up with a paper wallet qr printer like in the btc atms, but as a standalone usb piece of hardware. But then again if you have to pull a Walter "Heisenberg" White and bury several hundred million in cash, you won't need 8 55 gallon drums to safely store it underground and since there's 0 metal involved in the entire paper wallet setup you can bury it without fear of it ever being found by metal detector or even through seismic scanner equipment used in archaeology, i.e. not even the CIA could find it if you didn't tell them the location or coordinates. But if you want metal, so you can find it with a metal detector then this might be the best option:

Mine alts that automatically get converted to BTC with NiceHash Miner. Depending on your hardware, you'll get pretty good returns with a few (2-5+) GTX1080 GPUs running with an i7-7700K CPU. Got to be on 24/7 for you to really make any thing worth your time, but it'll take the price of your electrical rates / Kwh and account for that in your costs v. profit summary. The higher the BTC price the better it is to mine, with whatever is available as long as it will mine something that will add to your total BTC accumulated, and not just do jack shit compared to it's power consumption. Any machine below 2010 probably won't make you anything, but many machines all pointed at the mining client with your same btc address will all accumulate into one account for payout. Look at it as having R2D2 for a slave and he just makes bootleg cds and then goes and sells them in the subway stations, he's got no choice, you flip open the dome and override the free will unit and pre-program his work routine in manually. But if you get like 20 or 100 R2 or R5 units together then you have a slave labor workforce, minus their fuel (power) costs. And BTC is more valuable than CDs or anything that could be traded outside Uranium or black market organs from rare blood types. So you'll make a shit load, if you can cover the cost of electrical consumption. Good luck getting multiple GPUs for less than or = to MSRPs. Quite a demand for the high end models.

I'm not a psychologist or therapist but to me it just seems like excitement of something new to the bullshit we've all been spoon fed for ...ever... Seemed like concern of security to me. If it's serious OCD then print a bunch of pokemon card like paper wallets, you look at them, still there, check again when you can't resist the urge, no risk of compromising assets. Same with ludicrous encryption tek i posted about. Both will work, many combinations of this and that in between the two extremes that will ensure safety and security. It's actually quite fun making sure your shit is safe. Banks just tell us it is, the minute you leave after your deposit your money is gone to the next person in line. As long as they can keep the ponzi going they can operate, and if they can't they likely take the least legally  likely candidate account holders (the poor who can't afford the good attorneys / friends of bankers) to bail-in or seize all their assets to recoup loss. If I had OCD i'd say fuck banks and throw up the Wu Tang Clan sign and put my cash in a shoe box on top my fridge like Red and Method Man's old day setup. Then liquidate that cash to BTC ASAP. 1850$ days a month or so back would have been a sweet entry point, hopefull LN and Segwit drama will cause price flux.

giftcard on localbitcoins, usually receive in under 10 minutes, +/-100 confirmations within the first 24 hrs of receiving transaction funds to your desktop or hardware wallet. Unlike exchanges you get the funds directly into any wallet you want, vs. using the exchanges online wallet (exit scam, fed raid, new exchange withdrawal transaction thresholds, or new terms that bar you from access or trading based on your international/national regional jurisdiction ISP's location out of thin air one day costing you your exchange held assets). It's bitcoin, rise above the old ways. But that said you will get better market rates on the exchanges v. local bitcoins unless you meet in person with cash. I think recently rates for amazon giftcards have been upwards of 10-25% over market averages, but then again it is instantly (but in lower volumes/transaction) available in your wallet.

buy a prepaid (with cash) 3g/4g/lte network wireless internet hotspot&gt;netbook/laptop/desktop [powered by PV/Wind turbine/ Generator/ Other] - Running bitcoin core for your transactions. You can use the laptop or a prepaid mobile to transact on localbitcoins with prepaid amazon, ebay, giftcards [must have a cash paid receipt or you'll get raped on btc to card exchange rates]or cash by mail. If you can make a trip into a local big city with BTC ATMs that's also a valid way to get some btc fast and reliably (some require id, some require credit card on larger volume transactions - avoid those atms). Locally bought for cash is the best transaction as mentioned before. But other methods you could do from middle of the forest as long as you had off grid power &amp; pre paid internet/mobile network service, and said cash purchased giftcards with receipts which you can get at any pharmacy or grocery store in most western countries. If you don't like banks then I'd put all your cash savings into BTC. It's like a bank account where you get significant interest rates on your cash deposited into said account. And it fucks the banks over little by little haha ;) Only put what you would want to deposit into a savings account or retirement portfolio, this way it's no different than having it in that respective type of bank account, but in your total and full control. If you have gold or silver they trade well for BTC as well. Use cash for everything, get receipts for sellers if they might require them for the trades. Nothing will be linked to you if it's small transactions each time. Little by little you'll make good interest on your investments, and then not so little later on (5-10year time frame). Prepaid phone can be thrown away after your done doing transactions in town. Don't use website wallets, don't keep your btc in exchanges, and don't use mobile wallets if you really want to be offgrid. (A mobile with a removable battery and SIM are best for being truly off grid and/or in conjunction with a farraday lined bag or pouch). The same maybe done at a later point in time if you wish to abandon the laptop and prepaid internet hotspot (once you've "cashed out/closed" your account or if you have transferred it to a hardware wallet or paper wallet, (to) take it into town to trade for cash, goods, or services). The satellite internet service would also work if you have access to a receiving piece of hardware (+dish/antennae) and a prepaid sim or contract with given satellite service provider. It'll likely take you a few days to up date the blockchain ledger in the bitcoin core client to the newest transaction, make sure your machine (laptop/netbook/etc) has at the least +500gb of hdd space. Over prepaid network internet hotspot it could take as long as two weeks or more to get caught up, don't do a transaction over the network without waiting for this to update so you can see how many confirmations you receive per transaction. ATM's are different since they print you a paper wallet, go nuts with those, you don't really need a software wallet until your ready to spend them, since you have to unload the full balance of each ticket/receipt/atm paper wallet or you lose the remainder most times to a second un-recoverable address (no access to).

Fail. Each country rolls back on BTC Bans until they get 2nd and 3rd ... and so on places on the world economic financial podium of who has the most BTC (Digital Gold). There's no stopping BTC, not ever... Unless satoshi is Bruce Jenner or DOGE dog, or CIA or Mossad (or a combo of the aforementioned). There's no failure in sight, short or long term.

I don't use Mycelium but i'm sure others can vouch for it (or not). I'd look for bitcoin atms. Portland should have at least 100+, and I hear the rates are anywhere from 8%-25% over market rates across the US so comparable to in person cash trade (usually the lower income level of the area of the atm's location the better rates). I use core client on desktop and use printed QR images to scan in person, i verify using my laptop at the time of trade until i get about 10+ transaction confirmations for the given transaction (proving that it's valid and actually present in my wallet) then i leave or go get more cash to buy more if it's a good day. Phones sketch me out, either the parts about getting robbed for a phone with 100K$+ and no legal recourse or protection, or getting hacked and having your private keys snatched over an IMSI catcher (Again Portland, Seattle, SF would have trouble (being prone) with this method of interception/attack due to all the hackers and tech industry individuals in the regions trying to get a quick buck without detection) or malware with screen capture capabilities. To my knowledge unfortunately Mycelium is one of the better phone wallets (light weight wise). With the ATM's you get a paper wallet receipt printed so you can just hide it like a piece of junk paper on your person, you can scan it into a desktop wallet or cold storage wallet whenever you want to to ensure that atm operator doesn't snatch the private keys at a later time or if they are forced to shut down by federal government. If you do go with Mycelium you can just scan the qr off the receipt and send it to your phone wallet, but there are fees involved with mycelium that (?) are higher than full node clients like Core QT where you can set it to a minimum of 1000 satoshi / kb (if you don't mind waiting for all the confirmations since it will be low priority on the network for validation) it will save you some satoshi. DO NOT USE XAPO, it's literally like the south park episode with stan and the bank... If it's a tiny amount and you deposit it into the vault they'll pull the famous "...anddd it'sss goneeee, step aside sir this line is for customers who have an account with this bank". Asked me if i was happy with my transaction for +0.00000000 BTC???? 65,000 satoshi gone. Glad i did a test run before committing to there "wonderful" debit card like services (chock full of transaction fees for you to give them your btc while it grows in value in their possession).

Just be knowledgeable of how to hold cryptos. Trezor or Ledger would suffice. Put private keys/passphrases somewhere safe in hard copy (analog; paper and pen). I have been hearing bitbox is a good 3rd runner as well as key vault as a close tie. bit box uses microsd which sketches me out from past experiences of having some corrupt and loose data, but if other users aren't having issues then it seems like a great possibility to have all your account assets and data encrypted on a microsd card, that shit will go anywhere without much detection. If your really OCD then you might want to spend some time looking into ways of better passphrase selection and encryption. Use a program like KeePassX to manage all your test passwords and sequences of phrase words. There's a link floating around somewhere about dice generated randomized true cold pass phrase processes. You just roll some dice, but if your a nerd you can really go crazy ocd with it and use different polyhedral die to select different books or volumes of books and words per line of page etc. You pretty much just run your own D&amp;D dice rules for selecting information then you pick the word outcomes generated by your die rolls. Rolling just one or two 6 sided dice three or more times makes passphrase cracking a thing of the past. But you need to use the pre-generated word list that i spoke of before from that site. The latter mentioned method of using polyhedral die to select volumes of data sets to choose a word from a list is not something a human (maybe 1000 generations if Humans survive that long) or even the early quantum computers will be able to crack haha. You feeling extra 0y and 1y then throw it into a text to binary translation program then encrypt the results in sha256bit encryption ;P OCD Overkill extreme but no one will get your bitcoin, not even you if you fry your machine or loose your recovery phrases and private keys. But fuck it if that happens then you just make the remaining BTC worth more due to scarcity increase. Your KeePassX passphrase should not be stored on a machine, ever, just when typed. A lot of encryption purists will say never to type your important passphrases into a computer that has ever been connected into a network connection (i.e. risk of compromise) especially if you know and understand the risks of 0Days and what that can mean for pulling your private keys or private key qrs off your screen with screen capture. We're not talking Borris from goldeneye type hackers we're talking NSA elite and Tempora out of GHQ folks who don't care about laws or barriers from your data, your shit will get stolen, if not today then at some point in the next 10 years. Single screen shots can cause generated private keys to be compromised without actively being made present until much later down the road. When the game changes, this guy [u/volimsmes] maybe doing just fine with his BTC savings haha. Good luck comrade.

Offer training, and "normie" transitions into the BTC/bitcoiner's realm. Theres no restrictions today to my knowledge in bitcoin consultation agencies. Likely it would fall in under tech consulting licensing depending on your local jurisdiction's laws &amp; regulations. Explain wallets, private/public keys, mining setups, market events, stats, its honestly endless possibilities but dont sell your time and effort cheaply. In under 2-3 years the block reward halves so the scarcity and demand should double, i.e. your clients should be thankful for info you provided them before that point in time. Why not have a contract written up waiving clients rights at legal recourse, a hold harmless document where your terms could state no legal obligations, only use at your own risk type services offered. Hope this helps.

Canaan Creative's new Avalon 761s &amp; 821s, a pallet of 60 is the minimum order from Canaan. The avalon 10 will blow bitmains miners out of the water. Good luck though. Miners are already on back order and their production isnt even finished. Even later models are already sold out. Likely going to Beijing, purchasing in person,  and shipping them back air freight vs a month shipping over cargo ship route will provide best option. All info can be found on Canaan's site. I'd avoid Bitmain (Jihan Wu, &amp; Bitcoin Cash Defectors) like the plague, especially when setting up an operation of this caliber. Why not get the most out of your mining farms capabilities. I think you can run 20 miners / raspberry pi controller.

In terms of Civil Asset Forceiture: Isnt the property seized, the very individuals (although possessions) on trial? Not the defendant (op). It's the possessions that are legally being charged as commiting a crime. A winning court case for each item is needed if you want to fight to get back what was lost? You can prove yourself innocent but how can you prove inanimate objects did or did not commit a crime? The OP will be charged for the crimes or attempted to be charged. Regardless of verdict/outcome, the rest of seized assets will follow this logic. So once he wins his case he'll realize his possesions are still being held for the same alleged crimes he was already tried for with no way to defend themselves (material possesions) or prove otherwise. To my knowledge this is with each and every cataloged item seized. A separate court case. Most just walk away and call it a loss. Uncle Sam sells your hard earned possesions and goes on to next low hanging fruit in local communities. It can be a stack of cash, a car, a fine china set, your pog or pokemon card collection lol, you name it. 
I've heard of swat taking little kids unopened birthday cards, cutting the cards open and taking the kids birthday money from grandparents stating these letters/cards mailed from out of state were directly tied to the local crime involved at the property. The parents legally ran a Michigan Medical Cannabis Dispensary (Catch 22 Federally Illegal, if thats not self incrimination then what is). Their bank accounts for the legal state business were closed/bailed in and the accounts tied to pre dispensary businesses (construction or contractor builder business) were also seized although having no relation to the other business of concern. Its about self funding the local operational budgets for the next fiscal year through incentivized civil asset forfeiture. 
If you dont have a picture of Sauron the White telling the Orcs to go hunt the Hobbits playing out in your head over and over from this image then you may be happily complacent in this process. Or Imperial Stormtroopers kicking in doors looking for droids, pillaging as they go. Used to be known as pillaging, today its called civil asset forfeiture. Best of luck.

All of those thing truly have nothing to do with bitcoin other than being related to Cryptocurrency. Its like saying bitcoin a dog is the same as a whale both animals both mammals but completely different. ICOs mean nothing, banning exchanges is actually regulating a handful of compliant (ya we'll play ball with PBOC) exchanges, p2p is the real threat to China so that actually makes a little sense. But that said, are you Chinese ? If so then you can answer these questions : arent torrenting and piracy illegal in china? Do ppl still do that? How about drugs? Still illegal but something tells me you can find weed in the vast Chinese empire's landscape? China wants to control the money flow. And most importantly Chinese rural areas have a surplus of cheap to near free power that pre mining farms was barely touched on. It provides far too much money to ban it. Likely china will go the route of supporting BCH and Bitmain. Perhaps other mining hardware will be banned ���� more likely. P2p is the future and cant be stopped.

From my partners experience AMD will get you more ETH based Alts,i.e less earning since ETH is less valueable and less stable, but they are cheaper in overall costs (amd gpu cards). So if you choose to go with AMD try your best to amass at least 4 gpus / motherboard/rig -machine. 1 AMD each won't get you very much. Use Nicehash's Profitability Calculator on the site. Keep in mind when the value is high you make more profit for the same amount of return on mining. In your situation you could just use 1 ASIC  miner and document the results of the 1 miner in Nicehash's SHA256 mining algo pool. Trying to figure out the best way for you to get a little return to see what this is all about. If you can afford to round up an old Butterfly Labs Jalapeno ASIC for a few hundred $ used up to a older canaan avalon + psu then you'll be set and actually see some return. (Keep in mind your going against warehouses filled from floor to ceiling with thousands of these higher powered ASICs, that is your direct pool competition). The redditors here really gave you a lot of good info. Even if not for your paper then just to nerd out and gain more knowledge about a future industry that will rival the internet and cellular phone network tech. Good luck comrade! An example is that a GTX1080ti Can make you 80-100$ US / month of mining. Thats with 1 card, if you ran 4 your looking at roughly pulling 320-400$/ month just from the 4 GPUs in array, + mayb 10$/month from an i77700K cpu in combination. So maybe 330 -410$/ month at todays value and difficulties. Thats with one of the best systems built out of Intel and Nvidia parts available on market today in terms of using a GPU/CPU based mining rig. You'll get more with a Canaan Avalon Creative 741 7.3Th/s ASIC miner but then again you'll pay more and theres nothing to build, you just pop the psu power sockets into cards pci power ports on the miner and bam plug in and connect to network and your mining to your node,wallet, account.

So true, you got everything spot on. Use the Scarcity, Demand, Fungibility, Divisibility, and easily transportable argument and show him that it's better than gold, the thing he thinks the Dollar is backed by. If he got his economics education skillset training during the 1960s then he knows Nixon abolished the gold backing system to the FED Reserves Fiat printing system. Then point out that golds entire economic success to date has been over a time frame period of perhaps 25,000 Years of Human's existence [at best, i know i know, a controversial debate]. So odd that bitcoin surpassed it's value over 4 fold in less than 10 years time... think about that... with a scarcity of more than 200x that of 1oz of gold.

If they try and ban crypto or BTC it'll just screw the Chinese people out of potential profit. Miners would sell their coins online (just illegally) or move them offshore. But it's extremely doubtful that china will ban mining bitcoin since it's a huge profitable industry for the locals in rural areas with access to cheap power. Personally it just seems like attempts to see how much market turmoil crying wolf over and over for the umpteenth time can cause. Fuck the fuss keep buying when its cheap and HODL long time!

Use nicehash miner, you can mine alts and convert directly into btc. if you use enough second hand computers you'll get a payout in time if you start soon. You can use excel and chart the progress each day. You can print each days data sets from the nicehash pool and your specific workers each. The mine would be all the computers, running together off of all their different processors both gpus and cpus, you probably can't use anything below a win 7/8/10 machine or it wont' mine, 32bit machines are out today with nicehash to my knowledge. Why not chart the price changes percent wise per day in excel and note how much you make and lose on a daily basis as the markets globally go up and down with the FUD. Mining wise your going to see less than 0.01-0.05GH/s / device if lucky, with LBRY you usually get anywhere from a few H/s to 10H/s appx depending on your processor and the algorithms selected that your specific system (computer) can mine with the best performance and payout. Likely if they aren't powerful computers you'll loose some money in electric. Nice hash is a pool automatically. Go to the site and go to sell hashing power. You just point all your different computers, or ASIC miners if you had them at your address and all the workers join your cluster on nicehashes different pools. Technically your mining all different cryptos, whichever is worth the most BTC, and you get them once you reach 40$ or something like that so 2 -3 months if you use 4 or 5 decent computers. Gaming rigs will work anything with a powerful cpu or gpu. Intel is much better than amd, i don't care what the haters say for mining the extra price makes the difference. You would have to be diligent though to all extremes to make sure you were constantly entering the data sets into excel day by day or hour by hour, a lot of manual work unless you can program to have it pull from the sites data and update automatically. But none the less you'll prolly see some money if your system isn't too weak in terms of overall combined hashing power (H/s). You can also do what u/KevinKelbie said and show the live statistics of the global markets there are several sites for this. 
That should keep you busy for a bit.

A battery in any fone means your location and movements are traceable.  Same with a SIM. A journalist going to meet and interview a member of Al Queda is required to dismantle their mobile fone and remove both the battery and SIM as per insurgents instructions. This isnt new. A fone being manually switched off means nothing unless the battery and SIM are taken out. Early cruise &amp; Surface to air missles were able to lock onto specific phones signals to take out valued payload targets in late 80s early 90s (&amp; probably earlier). If memory recalls in Chechnya a case of just this is documented. A farrahday bag will also prevent any chances of calling home or allowing tracking by using a signal-less barrier. It has been said that even with battery removed, the SIM can still trickle pings of passive data enough for an organization like NSA/GCHQ to actually pin point your location. The whole ' i got nothing to hide ' argument is going to be put to the test by 2025.  If your btcs worth 100,000$ or more each would you want a beacon directly to you? How about 10,000,000$ each? Lmfao you do bring up lots of great points and very well put. Airgapped machines are best imho and not practical to carry around on your person, yes. A battery in terms of encryption security is irrelevant you are right, but in terms of just providing a strobe beacon its power they are its instant kill switch along with pulling the sim out. Why not have an airgapped mobile for your btc wallet (spending purse for small purchases) device &amp; a prepaid for your comms? Everything youd want to do on the airgapped handset you could access with usb or microsd. Porn in bathroom while on the job? np ill just load up a 256gb micro sd with the raunchiest shit possible, ill prolly get fired for being 'that guy' lmfao but its doable. If any of you have heard of IMSI catchers then airgapped is sounding pretty damn good right about now. IMSI catchers imitate the nearest local network tower but are operated by a 3rd party remotely in between end user(victim) &amp; tower. Essentially they gather all of your GSM/Data network metadeta, conversations, etc. And send them directly to the 3rd party's (attacker's) IMSI catcher before it relays them to the tower. Now imagine not just big brother using them or the feds/police  but darkweb sickos trying to kidnap ppl for experiments. Or maybe your in California enjoying your BTC wealth and mexican cartel want to sniff your data to see if your worth jacking? The possibilities of future danger are just coming to light today. Im not a tech specialist by any means but if this shit is in my grasp of comprehension then someone is already doing it. The best phone is no phone, a pay phone haha, or a landline phone from somewhere else. Anyone who thinks im crazy just watch Citizen4, a good american, &amp; kim dotcom caught in the web. All your digital life is on a server, every porn video, every shady site, every political opinion. Not just from today or post 9/11, literally from day 1 of dial up networks going online. This isnt a joke, if not serious for us then for our children it absolutely should be. But if all of this seems like paranoia then please by all means give apple your money this year and next year. I used to have respect for apple then i jail broke the 3 and realized how much better it was haha. Then i got an android and flashed it to my own install preferences without the bloat ware.

The Chinese use what is known as Stadium Diplomacy in most African nations. I.e. what do you (african nations) need most? Football stadium it is! And then they ensure the terms of the loan are unattainable thus insuring more financial assistance is required. If Namibia has a few new stadiums in last 5 years on google earth then this is the case. So yes China influencing Namibia could be a potential realistic possibility although the law/bill mentioned is outdated and pre cryptos in terms of market exchanges operating. That said, so is the the anti espionage act which is still used to this day to rape dissenters and brand them as spies for public crucifixion as punitive damages for standing up/dissenting.

Hear good things about ledger's 3 products and bitbox, keyvault i hear is similar to trezor but should support shapeshift in the near future (all in one from within the hardware if i'm correct so you can convert alts into or from btc) but would rate it 4th out of the ledger bitbox trezor rankings. Paper wallets are the shit and can't be beat if you know how to use them. I.e. unload the full balance to a secondary desktop wallet or hardware wallet before you try and spend them then reload them if you feel comfortable with that and reusing the private key. (Some paper wallets are set up for 1 time use though, I believe.)

Careful, there are a lot of late arrivals from iFone lover realms in to the crypto realms today. You'd think your point would sink in with apple-folks but to no avail. Its like Fry in Futurama " idc shut up and take my money".

Your point of jail breaking your mobile is why Apple and Sony are such d-bags with unlocking, you realize how much better the end user can improve on the technologies capabilities and capacity for improvement, i.e. The unlockers may be able to come up with something better on the creators design, then Apple/Sony shit their corporate shareholder pants, and sue sue sue cease and desist away.

Wind turbine array fields would be more efficient for higher power loads, like a Chinese warehouse mine full from floor to ceiling with ASICs. PV is better for DC output loads directly and more of a burst type of power drawing load unless all the prime hours of sunlight are stored in a DC battery bank, in which for most applications I would assume you would loose power in the DC to AC inversion to power most household, business, commercial, or industrial systems from computers to cooling systems. Desktops, Servers, ASICs (Use one of the two power supplies of an atx psu or a rackmount server psu) are all AC only type applications. You can use them with solar but the load will not be as efficient. Laptops, Raspberry Pies, Arduino, Mobile Phones, Xbox/PS are all DC in theory (that brick on your power cord is converting dc for your battery to AC (outlet power input)). If you can grow weed offgrid with battery banks powering 10a 120v 1Kw HID lights in series of 2 strings of 4 - 8 lamps on PV then you can mine on it with no problem. But for anyone besides Musk/Bransen/Gates/Or Big Time California Growers the cost of PV and the Mining equipment costs, upkeep, etc. will be at least a 2 year ROI to repay the loan or begin to see a profit (at todays value) on your original startup investment. Flywheel Energy Storage Systems may be a thing of interest for miners some day to store power in a more concentrated area than a room filled to the ceilings with 12v(24,48,96,128v) PV batteries.

*"I can't give ou numbers but..."*
That can't be entirely accurate since a few GPU Rig Systems can mine a block of alts that convert to 1BTC in a few years of mining you could get today's block reward (12 or 6.5 or whatever BTC for the complete block reward). Not solo mining on your own or with one machine (GPU/CPU rig) but with 4 or more 1080Tis in each and several mirrored machines you absolutely can mine BTC (in actuality your mining alts but you get BTC as the payout) It's not cost effective but for many still trying to learn how to mine GPU/CPU Rigs still put in some good combined network hashing for all the noobs going from Gamer rigs to miner rigs. Need proof look at AMD and NViDiA stocks ;) Think AMD even had a press conference where they essentially were like "GPUs can be used for other stuff besides mining too..." [in a randy marsh voice with sarcsam] Also why you can't get a GPU or 4 at MSRP of the cards online especially not in bulk, the demand is so high because of mining, BTC and ALTs that the GPU industry has had to evolve.

I guess in a way, but more of in terms of more points of connection for miners to verify transactions validity instead of just a few connection points. Itd be cool to get paid to run them for supporting network before 20XxM cap is hit but post mining for coin days this combo of miners hashing power and full nodes as a pool of users transactions will be the profit incentive for the bitcoin network. Hopefully by then 4 satoshi transaction fees will be about 100$ lmfao im not doing this explanation justice. Someone more qualified in tech realm should be able to break it down more clearly. Bitcoin.org/ will answer most questions. Think andreas Antonopolous also covers some elements of full node operation in his youtube channel: AAntonOP, youd have to watch a lot of them to find the spots in regard to full nodes.

Also bitcoins are stolen primarily off of a network or digital device connected or offline from a network through using human error and stupidity to their advantages. Like convincing the end user to store their btc on their web server wallet or a phone based wallet. Or pulling the private key request tactic as below, some tards will fall for it. If done properly you should never have a problem. Then again if your generating your private keys / qrs on a machine connected to a network i'd say your chances later in life of having your coins stolen is pretty significant as skill sets and technology advances. If you know how a paper wallet/cold steel storage works then you can always go that route and be digitally hacker proof, but not IRL Physically smash and grab proof. Most ppl forget about screen capturing private key qrs at the time of generation and saving them for that rainy day unbeknownst to the end user/victim. Wouldn't be surprised if NSA/GCHQ tries their damnedest to round up as much as possible for later claiming once value climbs. I think we can look to the weed community for examples of what will be in store for publicly outspoken bitcoin advocates once the value hits enough incentive for rippers to want to take the risk of tearing a house apart for a flash drive, micro sd card, or old hdd in a home invasion type robbery.

Satoshi did say if you don't understand it I don't have to explain it to you. Think in simpler terms, 0s and 1s. 0s mean you don't have bitcoin or your private keys even if you were told or think you do. 1s mean you have something and your private keys are in your possession for you to guard and control in a responsible, safe, and understanding manner. Start with that mentality. Everything on a computer is in binary in one degree or another. That's the first step in the most simple of terms possible. Technically your keys are in a second hand form of binary (if i'm correct) like if you were to use Morse code to send your buddy your btc private keys (but not sure how you would translate caps and lower cases) over blips on a telegraph line or by using a flashlight and cover to S-O-S light signal the key. The tech goes much much farther but it relies on a few things that have been around for the last 15-20 years or more. If you don't like his delivery try other sources until you have a ah ha eureka moment where the two speakers/experts points match up in your own mind and click. If your still having trouble watch the 1 hour youtube video loop of him explaining "if you don't have your private keys you don't have any bitcoins". If it doesn't sink in after 4 hrs all hope may be lost for you.

Use public and private PGP SHA256 bit encryption to encrypt the list then you can just digitally transmit it to them all in one or give them a lotto ticket with word numbers in person. You cant decrypt it without your key or their key in order to read it. Give them the pgp key on paper. Im sure theres some service where you can login over x days before it triggers and sends from time AFK besides google. Your idea is sound in theory. You could also give them a dictionary with words underlined or marked and only tell them if need be or if issue/risk seems likely.

mine alts and convert to btc through nicehash miner. 13 GPUs can be used on an ASROCK board for BTC mining from a while back it's a socket lga1151 board i think. Scratch the AMDs and upgrade to Intel, ignore the skeptics, you can still gpu/cpu mine. You can't directly mine sha256 algos or it will hurt your system badly, i.e could fry it/cpu/gpus but you can mine alts and have them converted into BTC through mining clients and pool services like Nice Hash miner. Your not going to get gpus at the real price and not in quantities more than 1 or 2 at a time, never for 12-14. Not sure if you can use a 4way pci splitter to add 4 cards / pci slot. On the asrock it's got 13 so you could have 13X4x in theory not sure if this will work only in theory it is possible. You need many psus though over 1500w each. ASIC would make you a lot more money and save you costs on hardware upgrades unless you bought 1080Tis or the next gen gpu to come out from nvidia but again you'll pay top price for nominal upgrade in performance. If you want cheap system and cheap i.e. small income then use AMD gpus and cpus. If you use nicehash use Intel/Nvidia or Canaan ASICs. Had a buddy say his rx 480s only gave him ether (?) which didn't convert as nicely as Lbry or Decred algorithms in BTC amounts. You don't need SLI or Crossfire so all you need is your GPUs to be connected to the PCI ports for them to potentially work. Some boards will have limitations. Not sure if newer cards will limit the total number that can run simultaneously. For the cost of the system build you could get several canaan avalon 741 7.3th/s that only take up 1050/1150w of power each. Nice hash has a profitability calculator as for all the trouble shooting you will have to hunt and search for all the info to make sure your components integrate and function properly, since it's a custom system. You won't get rich today. But you will make a couple hundred-thousand bucks a year with one of these computers. More if you replicate the system time after time. But ASICs are the way to go in terms of profitability in BTC mining of SHA256 algos directly. Hope you like high electric bills.

should let you import file inside core &gt;file&gt; dropdown menu import. You will have to have about 140-150gb of free space to sync to most recent block (be able to spend your coins and receive transaction confirmations), networks been busy since you left haha. if you have a passphrase/password that could also be the issue, hope you didn't forget it or loose the paper copy or your coins are fuct (i.e. locked for good). If done right you will instantly know because everything will resume where you last had it (transaction &amp; balance wise). u/DigitalGoose has some good input. Also if you overwrote it that could be an issue, always make a copy before fucking with your wallet.dat files (backups).

That's because time is ticking before the scarcity goes into overdrive ;) Poor poor normies. BTC is just now beginning to be out of reach for most of the poor in 3rd world countries around the globe. By the time midwest US moms and dads cash their beanie baby collections in they'll be lucky to get a few satoshi. All of these big wig critics publicly criticizing BTC are doing their jobs, distracting the masses while they gather up all the BTC they can. If this isn't reminiscent of the south park episode of cartmen in the cave trying to eat all the plastic gold treasure without stan, kyle, and kenny finding out then people are fucking blind. To ridicule it in the media means you just bought yourself another few days tops at 4000-4500$ to buy all the dumb-asses coins back for cheap. It's in their own best interests to shit all over their competition while they follow that old philosophy silently inside their heads "if you can't beat em join em". People in finance who say they aren't involved in BTC are either stupid (and not involved) or lieing (and are). Their so scared and they don't know if they should jump ship and bail to BTC safety or stay on their sinking ship as their bosses bail to BTC and leave them behind to go down with the Fiat turd-ship.

Sounds like bank just wanted to not let him have money for btc. Banks are doing this more frequent. Say it was under investigation and close account while  bailing in the accounts funds for bank to recoup losses from crypto folks. If you give banks your crypto fiat earnings then they got no concerns, but if you take money out of bank ($$$$$$ over time or many account holders who do the same) and they cant stay afloat. Sssssshhh they're dying in front of us, dont let them know that you know that they're wounded, like a rabid animal. Haha In US this sounds like a SRA (SAR? SRE?) Idk i obviously dont like/use/or support banks. But basically they report your account as suspicious activity in regard to potential criminal activity. Ultimately most times they close their accounts. Some time at all bank accounts, even other branches. As has been the case with most individuals in the legal cannabis trades, low hanging fruit. Essentially take banks' oppositions' money or anyone who can't legally fight back. Used to do it to porn stars and other "undesirables" (*in Nixon voice) within certain communities. If bank warns you not to touch account funds they can pull this shit though, part of signing up for an account, you hold them harmless to rape and rob you, no lube. Bitcoin friend, no rape. Bitcoin Good! Read r/bitcoin post about PNC Bank calling account holder and asking him if they were buying bitcoin, called it suspicious activity. Proceeded to ask them what they were using bitcoin for, likely closed their accounts. A bunch of others said same thing all over. Next day Im watching AAntonOPs youtube channel. You know one of bitcoins biggest community members and info gurus, ad comes on for PNC Bank... WTF? They so scurrred ROFL.

The Chinese use what is known as Stadium Diplomacy in most African nations. I.e. what do you (african nations) need most? Football stadium it is! And then they ensure the terms of the loan are unattainable thus insuring more financial assistance is required. If Namibia has a few new stadiums in last 5 years on google earth then this is the case. So yes China influencing Namibia could be a potential realistic possibility although the law/bill mentioned is outdated and pre cryptos in terms of market exchanges operating. That said, so is the the anti espionage act which is still used to this day to rape dissenters and brand them as spies for public crucifixion as punitive damages for standing up/dissenting.

Following Bangladesh's lead, likely. Probably taking close accounts &amp; notes of the Maduro situation in Venezuela too. Any country whose economy may easily be threatened and / or are, majority wise, corrupt governments will go after BTC. BTC means change for the rule of the few with bigger sticks than the rest. Surprised its taking people this long to realize its unstoppable. Any one in nepal, you can probably charge 20,000$/btc now if its officially banned. With illegal status the price quadruples over night because of risk &amp; demand, just be safe the consequences should determine the potential value. If India is wise they'll use BTC as an official parallel national currency tied to the INR &amp; XAU like Vietnam is working on. A lot of climbers/mountaineers would have paid to climb Everest if expeditions took BTC, probably could have charged double.

Bengaluru tech sectors (already involved but not nearly enough). Rush hour soap boxing in train stations/chai halls/local dhabas (gatherings on breaks). Telling every one of the lowest income levels in populated areas that they can be in control of their own finances/bank account providing freedom. All tech students should be in, if not already, go to tech universities' canteens and spread the word. 9/10 wont care... until they see the price �� Graffiti works too lmfao. If Mumbai can write "bean bags" and mobile numbers all over the city walls then "bitcoin revolution" may get some wondering wtf is up. Chai wallas &amp; tiffin delivery services as well have huge word of mouth potential. Sooner India realizes balls in their court (sorry i meant on their cricket pitch) the faster India's economy can get a jump start back to 20RS to the USD. Nepali and Bangladeshis would absolutely pump money into Indian economy even if not legal. As could the Tibetan Refugees in Himachal Pradesh utilize new market for remittances to Tibetan people in PRC. 
To get mining up and looking like an industry, a state with cheap power would have to embrace the mining by opening state exemptions on power consumption for massive operations. Lots of cheap hydro electric in the north, good air quality, and aside from a few months of summer, stay relatively cool year round. A few state officials/figures get their beaks wet and India is in the loop. Just my input. A fellow Hindustani could verify some of this as plausible or fowlable? Why Mumbai Stock Exchange isnt accepting, trading, or speedily trying to allow/"regulate" (haha) BTC is beyond my reasoning. Clocks ticking though for sure.

By running a full node you are supporting other network users to connect to your node. If you safely maintain said node you help to create a little psuedo digital island of bitcoin network usage between users, eventually this will make operator of node some transaction fees? By running a full node your saying its ok bitcoin community i support you, you can hop from my machine. The more nodes active securely the better the network will run (i.e. competitive fees?, speed, &amp; overall honest end user authenticity over malicious actors on network attacks??). What am i missing here lol, come on Veterans join in?! Bitcoin.org/ run full node using bitcoin core qt will explain everything in depth. satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org will also cover earlier days of full nodes, back in the good ol' days. Never been a more important time in BTC realm to join together and run full nodes. Just dont run it in/from/through NY, Bangladesh, Nepal, Venezuela(worth the risks), Bolivia, Ecuador, Nairobi, &amp; Lithuania ... wtf NY seriously?

Jameson Lopp to my knowledge supports 2x. Id say i hate the dude because of this but he uses sound logic and reasoning behind all of his  arguments for 2x. He comes from tech end background so as a techy he probably sees promise in new abilities &amp; potential upgrades like in Lighting Network. Seems like the dude is way ahead of most and just trying to get his hands on newest tech to test, cant blame him. This said he is only voice in community that supports 2x that I will say that about without involving the verbiage of them licking my butthole afterwards lol. Dude got swatted because he gave only good points on 2x, even if i dont agree with his views on 2X he does back his points up solidly. Bet it was Roger Ver, that dudes a dick lmfao. 
Edit: correction! hes pro smaller blocks! Hurray win for Bitcoiners team! Thanks for clearing it up. You obviously understand more of what he says than i do ^__^ kinda was getting butt hurt having to defend his pro 2x arguments haha or so i thought. Fuck Roger Ver though!

Bitcoin.org/ look for "running a full node" section you'll be able to easily set it up in core qt. If your not using core already then it will take 130-150gb+/- of disk space to catch up and sync with network to most recent transaction from initial install.

You can buy anonymously with cash purchased prepaid amazon cards (&amp; matching receipt) too but you usually pay anywhere from 15%-25% over live market averaged rates, unless sellers get scurred and desperate come the dip. Although you can do this literally from anywhere and have BTC almost instantaneously. Not a bad trade off to show people how to do it. Good deals on gold and silver from a few sellers offering cash by mail. Again dont mess with people who have low feedback ratings or you could get ripped off.

Lopp's solid in my book. Pro 2x anti 2x, either or, his reasoning and logic is primarily sound in whatever he choses. Although I do agree that the  company is all over with internal beliefs and values of core dev team and original visions. As long as he doesn't go Roger Verr / Jihan / Wright on us, I'll back up Lopp's perspective to the best I can (knowledgebase i personally can comprehend), whether it be based on his interests in bitgo and regulated operation of his interests or with his overall philosophical views on what bitcoin should be and work towards. Dude is quite cryptozen. If anyone in our community gets crypto bushido it's Jameson Lopp. &amp; Andreas Antonopolous haha.

FUCK BANKS! Thats why we have bitcoin. You'll likely get audited. Smart move not answering. They likely think its for drugs or criminal deep web shit. But if you said investing they would refer you to IRS or FTC/SEC. Your taking too much of their money and they can't figure out how. How can they give normies their money when the bitcoiners keep taking all the bulk of the cash on site lmfao. Bitcoin is working and killing the banks along the way. Go withdraw all your assets from the bank, if you have other accounts with different banks close them too. Eventually they'll go after those accounts as well. Cash and money order if you need to use payment services to live. Whatever you did you did such a good job that their considering bailing in your account to help them out some. Feel 100% certain you will get audited soon too.

Making anything illegal makes value go 4 fold overnight as does its scarcity &amp; demand. BTC in Europe would be 24K$ by following morning. Look at Zimbabwe trading at 10K$ and its still legal. The IMF/World Bank does not want that because it will cause instant panic(fanaticism) in non banned nations causing more problems as everyone else stockpiles (HODL Time). Sounds like a solid plan. Spain killing everyone in Catalonia seems more likely though... Or atleast the heads of the separatist movement. Either way BTC will come to the rescue. Catalonia.. then UK hopefully, as economy struggles, the Brits in Low and Middle Class will turn faith to Bitcoin over the Stirling. Hell anywhere with internet and electricity can benefit.

Lawyer is never a bad idea if your looking at felonies or record affecting shit charges. Scaring yourself will only make you look guilty of criminal activity even if none was commited. Best to play it calm and cool. Walk in there with an attorney, or team of attorneys, and hostile takeover that bank branch before noon lunch at the Brazilian steak house. Then sell off all of its assets. Slick hair back like an 80s guy and call yourself a shark not a sheep. If its a felony charge and law enforcement has verified the claims by bank's authencity, LAWYER UP!

Nice hash isnt really mining. Your selling your hashing power to buyers. And your not directly selling to Bitcoin miners (SHA256 algo) rather alts' algos to respective buyers. Youd make more mining on a pool, direct bypassing nice hash, for a particular alt based on your hardware. But nice hash will work as you describe. Watch your temps. Dont use their web wallet. Use bitcoin core v0.16 and let it sync with network to the full 165+gb for full blockchain. Make a "receive" btc address and use that for nicehash. Try to only use that address for nicehash. If another "hack" happens, bail and never look back. The i7 should do well mining monero. Not sure gtx1080tis best route without nicehash but if you try the legacy version of nice hash it should tell you what algo your gpu does best on after benchmark. If you leave bitcoin core up after its fully synced youll also run a full node (as long as your routers firewall port 8333 is open) helping the network. We got less full nodes online than dollars in btcs current price. 1 per IP. And if you got no btc in wallet it really doesnt help at all. You wont get btc in wallet from nicehash until you hit minimum of 0.001BTC though. Somethings to keep in mind. Or Buy a Canaan Creative Avalon 841 and 1300W ATX PSU. 
Best of luck.

The hotels have internet. Just operate a full node on core qt signalling bip148 from one of the hotels with better internet speeds and you become the only Cuban exchange wherever your machine (laptop) is ;) Shouldn't have any problems sending or receiving btc that way. What are you waiting for get on a plane and take this to Cuba already! SELL SELL SELL BUY BUY BUY Just don't do it in Bangladesh, Ecuador, Bolivia, &amp;/or Lithuania or you could get locked up... if they find you that is...

Go to nicehash's site and run the profitability calculator on the bottom left side of the page based on your variables, you'll make money. More than a dollar a day. GUI mining is essentially what your running through nice hash as well as a CPU mining algo of the most profitable potential on your given hardware, drivers, software, etc. So you are running whatever will make you the most at the present time. It is technically pool mining for alt coins through a multitude of algorithms for all profitable alt coins today. Vert maybe included, the difference between what your asking; Running one client v another option etc. is the same thing as Nice Hash, i.e. all will be rolled into one. If vert coin is not included then it maybe more profitable to just mine the alts and have nicehash convert it directly to btc for you (obviously they're going to take a small fee for using their services out of your earnings, my assumption is that perhaps up to 20% of your total hashrate goes to satoshi for their own earnings). Yes it's the year 2017 anyone without ASICs or a warehouse full of S9's or Avalon 741s from floor to ceiling and a 500,000$/month electric bill can't get BUTTLOADS OF BITCOINS! but you can get bitcoins *period. It's like saying 100 pennies doesn't equal a dollar. Or that 1oz of gold doesn't add up to 1 kg of gold if collected and saved?? You'll make at the very least 1$-2$ per day running nicehash, but do your research first. If you have a nice dedicated system you'll atleast make 300$ a month with 4 newer GPUs 980-1080 ranges. For someone who doesn't know how to mine this is a way to turn your computer into a virtual slave while you work a regular job, an android 24/7 indentured bond servant if you will. Think of it as your own C-3P0 but instead of letting him do nothing you make him work in a mine 24/7 and you make the money while he takes the physical risk of cave in or mining accident. Just a way to make you money, not today but much later in a world of tomorrow. To try and mine BTC directly without an ASIC you would fry your equipment fairly quickly. If your machines going to be on 24/7 for the next month anyway you might as well run the miner and see what you make. The idea is that you want any form of bitcoin from 1 satoshi up to 10,000,000 satoshi +. If you have enough power (literally KwH &amp; Hashing Power) routed into it you can make good money, but you can't do it alone. Don't be mistaken you are GUI Mining vs ASIC Dedicated mining but none the less I doubt for today there is much better.

nicehashminer, you mine alt coins and they are converted to btc automatically through nicehash but you only get paid when you reach the monthly threshold if you use an external btc address (recommended) outside of their site/online wallet. It's about 25-26$ to withdraw as of today/yesterday. If you have a gtx1080 or 4 you can make +/- &lt;100$ / card / month after power costs if your paying less than 0.10$ / KwH for electrical costs. Your machine pretty much has to be on 24/7 dedicated to only mining with your cpu and gpu on the most profitable algorithms (pre-configured when you run the benchmark tests for nicehashminers program) which means you can't really do shit with it while it's mining. No gaming, No movies, maybe a little bit of online browsing but that's pretty much it and still not recommended. Your anti virus will flag the 3rd party mining clients so make sure you exclude the install folder when you install nicehashminer or it won't work. It won't make you money like 2012 or 2010 days but it will add up fast and you'll make something from a machine or two (or 20). The more computers you use the better but you got to make sure you don't burn up your machines and you got to cover the electrical and parts costs to keep them running 24/7 without failures or machine downtime. A watercooled 1080 or 1080ti would likely run smoother and fetch you maybe up to 120-125$/ card for the 1080 Tis as well as a liquid cooled cpu i77700K i think you get like 10-15$/month. You can also use an ASIC miner to add to your hashing power through nicehash. What you want to do first on the site is go to sell your hashing power and you'll be able to start setting up your machine for the mining host software to run all the applicable software miner clients (ccminer, gpuminer, nhqminer, etc.). It's all automated just follow the sites instructions and you'll be mining in no time. Just don't fry your shit.  But ASIC are the way to go for mining, Caanan Avalons are supposedly quite nice. Fuck Bitmain.

glyde.com for little things like fones, tablets, games, electronics
bitify.com for anything like ebay in auction or bid form
bitpremier.com &lt;- seems to be what your looking for high value items (must be graded by bit premier before you can post the listing to sell). All art, jewellery, collectibles and small things have to be over 5K$ for them to entertain the idea of listing it or asking you to send the items in for grading. Real Estate, Planes, Boats, Nano-Satellites, Cars, Truck loads of Books or Cases of Tequila anything lavish and high priced &amp; this is the place.
bitcoinclassifieds.net for your craigslist like posting and sales market
use a search engine like duckduckgo or lougle to verify links are legit

The main Cuban National Hotel (Hotel Nacional de Cuba). That is the main hotel for tourist's in Havana with the best internet available in Cuba (if you have the money to afford it). So 200$ + / Night is the cost of operating in Cuba to be the exclusive Cuban exchange in the country, that's really not too bad. You would have to print paper wallets for the locals who know of BTC they could then exchange them for one of the two local currencies. WiFi will be shotty at best (satellite internet?) but still that's one way to bring BTC to Cuba that will work (at the initial demand levels in country, until they grow more popular). Otherwise wait until they open up their country to AT&amp;T and Verizon based Telecomm towers and mobile networks where the locals can then use light wallets on mobiles to transact over bluetooth or wireless in the hotel while you do the transactions. I have not been to Cuba myself but have had many friends and colleagues who have &amp; I really don't see how this wouldn't work. Either your going to transact for the client basis of the hotel, $$$$ Cuban Nationals and Foreigners or your going to transact for the local people with lots of small $ transactions through paper wallets.

bit premier will take a collection of anything high value as long as it is appraised at over 5000$ to send it to them for grading. Or if you want try bitify and run your listings like an ebay store, with buy now rates vs. bid rates, you can also set it up to have users offer you a price below your limit to see if you'll take it. Between those two sites you should have some luck. Bitify deals with a lot of digital goods as of right now, but has the potential to be just like ebay for btc and ltc and with any item.

It's not illegal in Cuba, you can host a bitcoin node in the hotel and they won't care. Just pay your hotel bills &amp; tip well.
