The problem is that once your company becomes successful then the parasites (lawyers) come flocking in to sue your ass into oblivion. It is a huge huge huge problem.
It even happened to me. I had a small educational technology company and a major textbook publisher sued me saying that I was engaging in infringement of their copyright (I wasn't). In their claims, they pretty much just made up a bunch of complete bullshit. I had never even seen the book they were saying I was copying. Then they pretty much told me to cease and desist or legal proceedings would occur. I talked to a lawyer about it and he said it would be expensive to fight the battle and told me to shut the company down. I wasn't making a lot of money at the time but the publisher felt I was a threat to the business model so they got rid of me by making up bullshit lawsuit. This is over copyright but the same thing happens with technology patents.
Needless to say in my current business ventures, I make sure to have all my bases covered especially on the legal side of things.

Just click the ad until it disappears lol. Every time you click, the owner has to pay a fee. If you report it to google then google just deletes the campaign but the owner doesn't really get hurt financially. They can still use their funds to put up other ads. It is a cat and mouse game to say the least. 
Next time, just tell everyone to click the ad, that way the owner gets screwed financially.
