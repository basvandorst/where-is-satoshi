A retarded business decision... why would I do business with a company that could cut off my finances if I do something that offends them? It makes no sense.

You are retarded

'Come back in 5-10 years'. Ah, yes, a true bitcoiner. Selling low and buying high. I like his style. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:21:29
No. Only hodl, buy, or spend BTC at vendors directly. Cash out and miss moon.

He owns the rats... Bitcoin is their poison
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:21:25
Or you just spend and replace after you buy something the same day... it's  manual for more but imagine somebody more talented than myself could develop a software wallet that could link up with an exchange and as long as long have enough fiat on the exchange it would place limit buy orders for the amount of btc you spent that day.

We're below the dickline! Now's the time to buy - we'll be back above it in no time. Buy when everybody is selling and sell when everybody is buying, right?

At least use gdax if you're going to coinbase. They are the same company but the fees on gdax are much cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:02:47
No sell. Hodl until Bitcoin is exchanged more frequently than cash for everyday transactions and Bitcoin's price typically varies by a penny a day. Guesstimating that day is in 2040.
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:50:46
And buying April 6th would've meant big gains if you bought and then sold once it reached the line again right?

I have a trezor and am happy with it. It's intuitive and easy. And I'm not just shilling.

I would say that's the big plus of crypto. Keep courts out of it. If you lose your money, it's on you. Get it off exchanges as soon as you buy it.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:02:30
That's not an accurate comparison. To me, 'cost of accessing the internet' is analogous to the cost processing a Bitcoin transaction, instead of the price of Bitcoin. Tx costs are going down, but the value of the network as a whole, or a single Bitcoin, will go up as a result of more users.

TA crypto experts are useless. There are billionaires that have enough power to impact the market and f over shorts. And they don't share what their moves are... The only way for a pleb like me to make money is to buy and replace immediately / hodl. The whales can't take my money if I never sell, and I stick to a monthly deposit schedule and won't buy a penny more - no FOMO.

We've read history books. And go live in Venezuela if you still believe in that shit.
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:39:16
That was a bit high. Looks like the average is 8%

A bitcoin atm, but the fees are high... think of it as paying a 10-20% tax now that doesn't go to incompetent government politicians
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:52:26
I'm seeing a massive pump right now on gdax.
Edit: And a 140BTC sell wall at $8800. Is that what a whale looks like?
@_date: 2018-07-05 04:56:20
ATM fees are generally way too high... 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:59:05
Wouldn't you own the same amount of Bitcoin - it's just worth more? Or did you buy in more?
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:23:26
Sounds like his friend is an African Prince who will give you 3 of his 100 bitcoins but he needs a private key and $500 to share them first

No, John McAffee made a bet on Twitter that Bitcoin would be worth a certain value sometime in the future (I forget exactly how much and when). But if it doesn't come true he said he'd eat his own dick.

Taxing meat, farmers, and plastic are all things we need to survive too... The idea of a carbon tax isn't bad, but I'm practice it would be horrendous.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:52:20
I'm a huge Bitcoin supporter but adopting Bitcoin as a country's currency is retarded at this point in time... Yes, I would love for my currency to be able to fluctuate +-30% any given day. That would be lovely.

Look at this retard. I thought Dems were supposed to be progressive... But like all politicians they just want power
