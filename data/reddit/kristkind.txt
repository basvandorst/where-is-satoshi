@_date: 2016-08-02 13:48:59
Why if you are a trader of course. Sold some BTC for ETC a week ago, and man was it a smart decision. Cashed most of it out in fiat already. Market is moved by short-term sentiment magnitutes more than by long-term potential, which might or might not manifest.

If you believe in it as strongly as you say, then max out every way of credit you can get hold of and put it into Bitcoin *all in*. On the other hand, and I don't mean to be rude, Bitcoin doesn't give a shit about keeping within the range of your lines. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:31:13
To be sure, he is talking about potential. Bitcoin right now is for many reasons (like too small of a market cap, lacking fundamentals - which are being improved, but still somewhat shaky) not attractive for big players. 
Hedge Funds are very competitive by nature and if Bitcoin would be interesting enough, they would be in already. I personally think that with things like 21.co, etc. it's probably only a matter of time.

Head up high, Mr. Burger. I believe that Bitcoin will carve itself out a respectable niche.

I'm from Europe. The Euro is basically a German currency, as it's valued pretty much along its economic power. Now economically weaker countries like Greece or Portugal, but even big ones like France have to use the Euro as well, but to their disadvantage, since the Germans are outcompeting them. That's what the inflation target was for, but Germany didn't keep to it.
I know it's not a currency war in the classic sense, but neverless the basic semantics of 'currency' and 'war' seem right to me.

@_date: 2015-12-06 23:08:55
I think no. Adding shoes to the equation is just stupid. SETLcoin won't hook you up with shoes either, so why even go there. 
If you use a colored coin for an asset, or bitcoin for money, you don't have to trust Goldman Sucks or anyone else, with SETLcoin you do; hence the latter is an inferior product (at least when it comes to settlement).
It's like when Kaminska once said bankers are miners. No they are not. This woman is just a high-profile troll/banker's shill and there is no need to agree with her unless she starts making sense.

Yes you do - unless you can proof the existence of the good on the blockchain (e. g. a digital good). However with SETLcoin you have to trust in 'whoever is swapping', but also in who is managing the coin itself. Not with Bitcoin hence it eliminates one level of trust.

Yo, lemmings. NATO/IMF - in short the elite - is pushing Europe towards the boarders of Russia. Tried that a couple of years ago in Georgia and now again. You know what would happen if Russia was to do that to the US? Oh, wait ... that happened in Cuba in the 1960ies. And what did the US do? Freak the fuck out is what they did (and what they would immediately do again). Also it is hardly ever mentioned in history books that the US had had completely encircled Russia with nuclear missiles via European allies. But hey, that's all OK cause we are the good guys, right? It's almost criminally insane how ignorant people in the west are. 
Putin certainly isn't exactly a nice guy but what he manages to do (and what Europe and the US don't) is respect the circumference of a superpower. If you like it or not but that is probably the most important ingredient of a peaceful world.

The decentralization of bitcoin is revolutionary and the most important aspect of the thing. However, to the small user/investor who is targetet by this sort of publicity it just doesn't matter. They don't get the concept and it's not necessary to introduce people to bitcoin through it. "Cash of the internet" is how Gavin describes it to the layman and in my opinion very wisely so. If people get interested enough they will read up on it anyway. The first step is mere recognition.

TL; DR: The EBA works in favor of the biggest banks in Europe."Too big to fail" will get "too even bigger to fail". Then they will fail. 
My prediction: The EU will use ever harsher measures to save itself from the incoming "bloodbath", while Europe's national politics will shift further to the right as a countermove. Right-wing parties will brand themselves as saviors and further undermine consensus in the EU. The Euro will eventually fall - at least in the form it exists now. Newly introduced national currencies will be relatively weak, under attack by speculators and further pressured in ongoing currency wars. Some currency will be needed for supernational settlement. It won't be the Dollar, Euro or a European national currency.

Basically, we have no idea what exactly they are up to. Judging from past impacts of their products, it might be a game changer though. Looking back on the development of digital currencies 3 - 5 years from now, we well have had at least 2 - 3 "WTF!? Never assumed that would happen!"-moments. This thing here might be one of them. 
All we know for now is:
1) Apple re-allowed bitcoin apps in their stores - why? It would have been easier to keep them out if they wanted to compete with and marginalize bitcoin.
2) Imoney will (presumably) be restricted to use in apple stores and within countries that can be considered US-friendly regimes (i. e. the western world) - anyhow, that is also the main market for bitcoin right now.
Edit: You might be able to trade your Imoney though, and that's where it gets interesting.

The role of the $ will diminish in the coming years with or without bitcoin. Monetary policies and politics (e.g. recently pissing of Russia and China) have been incredibly irresponsible and the bill will be footed (just read up a recent piece on the petro-$ on zh).
Maybe in the end the US can be happy to have an alternative to their once glorious, but now crappy and corrupted dead prez.
The problematic thing about it is, that US are going to trigger another probably big war trying to evade that tidal wave. Espionage and war is all that is left in the US-toolbox. The empire is about to collapse and the will try to take everybody with them. Ukraine is just the beginning.

The biggest problem with deflation is debt deflation. This could be a problem in the bitcoin economy: Say the inflationary phase has ended and we have 21 million coins in the economy. If I lend somebody 2 coins and want 2.1 back - where is this 0.1 coin going to come from? You necessarily have to take it away from someone. That is an issue. Inflation eases the pressure to pay down debt. In the end it's not about money, but the wealth created through money - and that has worked extraordinary well for the western world in the decades following WWII. The problems came with war spending during the cold war and the rise of oligarchical finance.

Inflation is not a problem as long as real wealth for the masses outgrows it. Some central banks tried out Friedman's model of steady growth of monetary supply - his suggested cure to the Great Depression - but guess what: it didn't work and was replaced by inflation targetting, which is still in use today. A lot of guys who according to r/bitcoiners "don't get it" have a way deeper understanding than those who just assume that the parameters of 'bitcoin-maths' are super perfect. What's so perfect about it? The pre-planned monetary growth is pretty random. The economy is a living being and feeding it one shrinking spoon every ten minutes just might not be the perfect solution conjured up for a currenc - if that's what bitcoin wants to be.

You raise a good point. However, Eurozone introduced QE after the US did - even though the most influential German economists and bankers (e. g. Jürgen Stark in the ECB and Jens Weidmann of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German CB)) opposed it severely. Some months later even the Swiss felt pressured to do the same to remain competitive. Chinese economy too heavily depends on exports to the US and also do the Chinese CB hold vast amounts of US treasuries.
Everybody who is relevant still follows the US. It took a world war to take the reserve currency status from the British and it will take another one to take it from the US.

How do the following two statements go together?




Either it is phony or the real wealth is there. I think I know what you mean though. I see the real problem in the super wealthy elite syphoning off growth - as was increasingly happening in the last decades and has been spinning out of control in recent years.
However, I don't see why a breakdown would automatically change that. Take a look back at the 19th century: Wealth had to be clawed from the oligarchs in violent battles.

thanks for your reply and the link. I have just watched it. I wrote my thesis about this topic, so it was mostly an additional perspective for me. 
It's very interesting to hear you are from Brazil, so you naturally have a different view on things since you have grown up in a different environment. By the way, I am from Austria.
Now, to be honest: I am not convinced by your evidence. The Heritage Foundation - like the Cato Institute mentioned in the talk by Friedman - is sponsored by big capital interests. Actually both of them were responsible for pushing the free market ideology on society since the seventies. Milton Friedman - apparently the father David Friedman - had the chance to test their theories in Chile under General Pinochet. His economic advisors came from Chicago University and were students of Friedman. There are many things to criticize about their approach to society and economics. Let's focus on the worst ones: corpses all over the streets and in the rivers to push a doctrine upon society that in the end didn't even work (for a brief but effective summary by a highly regarded investigative journalist see 
I feel that the libertarian agenda sounds all nice and is very seductive because of its simplicity. It can afford this simplicity, because it was hardly ever tested in real life. When it was, it failed miserably. I am not a fan of our current politic and economic system at work (I am really not) but that doesn't mean that the opposite of it would be great automatically. 
The assumption that private always trumps state just doesn't hold. Two more examples: the privatization of British railway systems has been a catastrophe: with neglected infrastructure that have led to fatal accidents. In Vienna (Austria's capital) public transport was privatized: the result was a significant drop in quality and a jump in accidents, because drivers had to work overtime for private profit. So according to the theory of the efficient market there should be a ready competitor. There is none. If there was one then that would only translate to an increase of price for everybody since it is not easy to build up the necessary infrastructure. 
An especially horrific example was water privatization in South America, e. g. Bolivia. It increased poverty by 2 % and led to violent battles between the police (who defended the interests of US-corporations) and the general population (see  for a brief overview). 
Man, where to stop? Just think of heavy metals in children's toys. By the time anyone realizes the danger like "We should buy different toys" the child would be seriously ill or worse. Things like that just don't work without strict regulation. 
Besides, and I think that is a relevant factor in Brazil: How is the free market supposed to protect public property like the climate or nature in general. (I know Brazilian government is doing a great job in destroying the remaining pieces of rain forest but still - you could influence government to stop that. How are you going to prevent powerful interests at all if they can produce the law themselves?)
You might not care for the rain forest but in general: how are you going to stop the private sector from forming cartels and becoming omnipotent?
Personally I am for a form of radical democracy, for a powerful government but tightly controlled by democracy. Cryptography and the blockchain could be the basis for a voting mechanism that puts democracy back in the hand of the people. Powerful interests need to be crosschecked and curtailed if against the will of the people. 
Peace.

It would be pretty cool if it became true but right now you have told me nothing more but a wish backed only by your fantasies and no data. 
If it really was that inevitable, it would already reflect in the price. There are a lot of technical (e. g. block size, transaction time) and social hurdles to overcome and the outcome really is most open. Even bulls like Barry Silbert call it a 'high-risk, high-reward asset'. And that's as bullish as you can get without sounding unrealistic and silly.
That's also why a similar post of yours was kicked out off r/bitcoinmarkets, but hey, it's great enough for r/bitcoin I will have to assume.

Don't you think bitcoins are way more traceable than cash? If you are a nerd, you can make it pretty save via dark wallet, tor, etc. However, once things get really messy, govt will go after bitcoin like they did go after gold in the thirties. Most bitcoin will not be save, especially if bought on an exchange, having used a smartphone - in short not having undergone a meticulously obscure buying process.
Next is the question of how to spend them without anyone noticing. Cash or - if the currency blew up completely - small silver coins should be way easier and safer to trade.

It's beyond me how an exact number like 7 % can be calculated with international financial corporations like UBS. As a European, I realized that the US pushed for obtaining data from Switzerland and other European countries - while at the same time protecting their own tax havens. This happened in 2010, when data was leaked from UBS and other big banks. The discovered wealth hidden by UBS alone amounted to 2,9 billion €. That is not an awful lot compared to overall GDP (471 billion €), but it's pretty clear that this is only the tip of the iceberg. Once you walk across the boarder of official statistics, it all ends up in a number game. However, as a neighbour of theirs, I can tell you that the Swiss have a particular reputation of keeping your money 'save' and they are pretty proud of it too. Keeping peoples money save *might* benefit their real economy *a little* after all as well. They indeed have a very special business model.

I think that seeing Bitcoin too closely through the lense of Napster misses the real point. As we know, Bitcoin development is pretty much underfunded - see: how few core developers there actually are or the dragging development of dark wallet. There is also inertia due to how mining works and the questions remains how fast fundamental software changes can be implemented at this stage. Volatility was also mentioned. 
Having 'Bitcoin is superior automatically' as a mantra used to paint over doubts makes the project vulnerable.

 Bitcoin as an 'in-game currency' or currency other in-game currencies will be traded against. The monetization of gaming is a drastically underestimated factor in my opinion. The gaming industry and the willingness of people to put effort into gaming are a force to be reckoned with. This will catch on like a wildfire.

Digital Gold is next and Bitcoin is a major candidate.

Yeah, I agree - it's easier for China to be brutal. Still, what China does is keeping it small, not trying to completely stop it. I also see that bitcoin cannot be completely killed off, but if governments around the world would really start to act against it, the value of bitcoin would be decimated down to almost nothing. At least for the time being. It much likely will get harder and harder to stomp on in the years to come.

I don't think that many are not buying Bitcoin because of this. 
1) Even 6,5 Billion US-$/per year pouring in is not much for a currency. Just for the sake of comparsion: 4 Billion US-$ are created per day. 
2) Your argument is only valid for hodlers, as a depressed price may attract new buyers. 
3) To a certain degree, inflation even is as important a feature of a currency as scarcity. Otherwise, why not have one rock from Mars and make it our currency because it's so super rare? Also, you don't need the price to skyrocket for Bitcoin to be useful. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:21:37

If you are the author of both studies than you're being pretty straight up honest. Respect. I just figure that reality is too complex for predictions.

The great thing Satoshi did, was to give away the power to *control* bitcoin. Apple on the other hand, even if they come up with their own crypto, is - in one way or the other - going to keep the power (i. e. a proprietary approach).

Anyway, I assume that, when with their backs against the wall, Apple is going to use Bitcoin. How can they make money? Simple: charge the same, or slightly less, for music titles on iTunes, but don't share the revenue with CC companies. Voilà, I call that an incentive.
More interesting probably: Bitcoin 2.0 (blockchain apps - especially smart property). I just can't see how they would work around that. They will probably do something really sleek and special-looking and make it expensive but they will (have to) put it to use. I might be wrong though and we see them introduce some sort of iCoin ... pretty unlikely though. I'd be really surprised at this point if Bitcoin doesn't become the standard.

There is a huge difference between the user and the designer of the system the user relies on.

It isn't clear to me how bitcoin would do in such a crisis. Bitcoin is still very young and doesn't share the trust that PM have in society. Also a severe crises would drive up the electrical bills through inflation - so what would that mean for mining and hence network security? That's actually a real disadvantage compared to PM. I just hope the crises waits a little longer so the Winklefoss ETF and Second Market's exchange are in place and known.

Gox wouldn't have been such a big problem had there been a viable alternative though. Also, 'exchange' does not meet my criteria for a small startup. Exchanges should be regulated.

I would have to disagree. The difference is huge if you take into account that the US-$ is also the base of € issuance. That makes the € way more dependent on the $ than the other way round. In addition are commodities still vastly priced in US-$.
On the other hand this is really technical now. If the € really tanks then the $ is in serious trouble.

The way I see it, is US's fault for having made themselves vulnerable by relying on that model and shooing themselves in the foot by massively davaluing the Dollar - especially since 2008/2009. Why would you want to hold that crappy currency long term? China and Russia have bought massive amounts of gold in recent years. Some think they will return to a gold backed currency.

Yeah, that's true. I don't fully understand money and neither do I completely understand people. Economics and psychology are still being researched at an academic level and probably will be until our sweet civilisation fades into oblivion. All we currently have is a somewhat working system and some data about economic history (that is being dabated permanently). However, this is not to be confused with *understanding*. Libraries have been filled on these subjects but there is no definitive guide on understanding.
Let me just pick out one tiny aspect. Some say Bitcoin's inelastic monetary supply is a problem, some say it's the greatest thing. We know towards where the libertarian crowd here leans, but there is no closure on that particular question and neither is there on so many other aspects. Bitcoin is just one more hypothesis concerning money and no one knows how it will turn out.

Good will and noble intention by themselves don't get you anywhere. As for economic insight ... I can't see that in what he says.

Think of the manipulated Libor rates, the gold market, etc. 
There has to be enforcement (and maybe even guns) to stop such practices. Unfortunately we now have a government that has blended with corporate interests (and that's the very definition of fascism by none other than Mussolini himself).

I agree. Still, I recall people calling prices all the way down from 1000 "a steal". Even Antonopoulos said around January that those were probably the last weeks one could get a bitcoin below 1000. We were all pretty surprised by the contrary outcome, weren't we? Sentiments don't impress me much anymore. Aggregate emotion is really not much better than the weather forecast ... by non-meteorologists.

These questions are somewhat redundant, so let me reply to your main objections:






According to the core developers the code has been rewritten entirely. I think we are pretty save when it comes to that.


What are the odds? It was highly unlikely this thing was ever to take off the way it did.


There is no technological basis to discuss that argument. Sounds quite generic to me. You do not seem to like the government. That doesn't mean they got their hands in each and everything. Even if we knew who it was we couldn't be sure if the government/NSA doesn't have their hands in it - see: RSA and Boing.


I personally do not care if it was created by a 12-year-old racist or a 92-year-old communist as long as the protocol is save (see above). And that's the whole beauty about it. 
I can relate to the objection that 10 % are held by this mysterious entity could be a problem though. It would be nice to see 50 % of that money support bitcoin in some way (finance startups, etc.)

No, Austrian economics has much more relevance in US-libertarian circles. I am from Austria, educated above average, but have only heard about most proponents by listening to the likes of Schiff and Ron Paul. Hayek being the biggest name gained relevance in Chicago. Most people don't even know he later taught economics in Salzburg (an Austrian province).
Austria is still way more tuned to post-war Keynesianism, although it has been pushed back by neo-liberalism introduced quite successfully by the conservative party and EU-guidelines (laws).

What I actually meant - but didn't say - was "not right now". In the long run, I too think it's plausible. I also agree with your replacement-prediction - however, I think it will happen on more than one level if it does, since bitcoin links to equity, could become a reserve currency (hence backing fiat), or - like we agreed on above - take a bite of the market for ressources. Still I wonder if states are going to sit by the whole thing forever. Especially the $ has entrenched interests that stop at nothing.

To make my point clear: terrorism is used to spread FUD, clip away individual rights and kill innocent people all the time. I am more interested in the specific implications for VC.

I think that seeing Bitcoin too closely through the lense of Napster misses the real point. As we know Bitcoin development is pretty much underfunded - see: how few core developers there actually are or the dragging development of dark wallet. There is also inertia due to how mining works insofar as the questions remains how fast fundamental software changes can be implemented at this stage. Volatility was also mentioned.
The relevant idea is: 
1) something superior might come along
2) Bitcoin might spark innovation in the existing industry and they benefit, instead of the revolutionary idea itself (something like the iTunes store of crypto)
Having 'Bitcoin is superior automatically' as a mantra and used to paint over doubts makes the project vulnerable.

They do what every company does - marketing - something that bitcoin has been dearly missing for a long time (also due to its decentralized nature) and that circle is apparently pretty good at. Who isn't sick of those pictures of casacius coins in every half-assed article? Circle is going to make it useable for the common user: pulling people in with a gift, offering a hotline - how are the masses even supposed to figure out bitcoin themselves anyway?

I would have to agree there. However, I think more often than not it is about a watershed moment, after which a lot of people think they are really doing something for the greater good (e. g. strengthening police), while indirectly helping to add to a long-term evil. Very few people try to do bad things intentionally and rarely does it need a conspiracy to bring about this evil. In the end conspiracy theories make people look at the problem from a wrong angle that makes them choose inefficient strategies against the problem.

I am sorry, but I don't think this was an effective pitch: 
1) Main problem: the workings of the blockchain - as the core concept - were not explained. Granted, he said every transaction was stored but all that remained quite vague. How can you convey the concept 'bitcoin' minus the blockchain? I guess he tried to simplify it for the average joe, but really missed out to deliver the essential concept behind the innovative technology.
2) connected to point 1) - the explaination aimed at the applications of transfer of property were most detached. I couldn't make anything out of it, if I hadn't listened to Mike Hearn first.
3) the analogies didn't really add up or help illustrate what bitcoin is (open source technology and a bazar? I would guess that most people associate a bazar with adventurous, exotic, maybe even shady business and the fact that it's open source just doesn't matter so much to the general crowd).
4) He depicted bitcoin as an experiment - don't put all your money in it! To me that really sounded like a warning and came across like: "don't put any money in it" (If this talk was my only source of information, I sure wouldn't). It might be in an experimental phase still, but it's also a running system and business - he could have mentioned that.
Conclusion: Jeff Garzik might be a brilliant programmer, but he is not an effective or efficient presenter. I feel that bitcoin dearly needs individuals, who know how to handle crowds and convey the main points, so that after the talk people begin to share the fascination and harbor the feeling that they have understood enough to explain it to someone else. Somebody like Steve Jobs (yeah, a lot of people here don't like apple at the moment, but his presentations completely rocked).

Depends on regulations. Historically, currencies on a precious metal standard had to be backed by a certain amount of it. The amount was fixed by law. Very difficult to do with bitcoin (what fraction needs to be real btc?), since it transcends national jurisdiction. If private companies can issue fiat bitcoins, the base of the value would principally compare to fiat now. I consider it to be extremely important to put everything on the blockchain (at least at the end of a day/week in a batch). Otherwise there is really no point in using btc.

2) austerity
3) for Greece to leave the Euro
When it was discussed whether Greece was allowed to join the Euro, the German Finance minister then (Eichel) argued that they should, BECAUSE it helped German exports (to Greece). German banks financed those and everything was jolly good for a decade - until ...
Now they let the Greek population (and through inflation the rest of the Euro zone) bleed for the short term profits of German enterprises.

I most certainly agree that there are more pros than cons if seen quantitively. To ome it basically shows that we have governments that do not follow the peoples will or reason in general. That's why dark market turned up and will succeed. However, I wouldn't brush aside the darker implications of such a thing that easily. It can hardly be argued that atrocious deeds are made way more accessible through such a technology. I have read several interviews of the developers and consider their attitude pretty irresponsible: "Libery is a dangerous thing" - oh really? That's all they can come up with? 
Also such a thing will end up serving people who already have most power because they control the resources (i. e. money) and therefore any market

Again, I don't agree. Sure, if you have worked in the financial industry all your whole life you will be sceptical at first. And that's just fine too. However, once you have opened up your mind - which has more to do with personality than with past training - experience is not a disadvantage. It hardly ever is. I think Barry Silbert and Michael Novogratz. On the other hand I think of Antonopoulos who is all tech (although, wait ... recent blockchain.info security ...) but have not the fainest idea of how money works. (I know he is a sweetheart here and I will get downvoted for that but i really don't care.)
BTW: How long someone has been here doesn't impress me at all. Someone can be here from the start and also be a complete dork. Also, the history of Bitcoin is not going to be chiefly written by r/bitcoiners. This notion would just reek of hyrbris.

For me libertarianism has always been this set of platonic ideas from people who somehow have acquired a lot of money, don't want to pay back to the community that supported them on their way up (e. g. through infrastructure), pretend that their success automatically works for everybody; then pack all of this into a believe system and hold it up as noble, when really it is just the smooth ideology for the elite.

This is a convincing theory for 80 % of the comments and the ensuing battles over the correct opinion on i. e. the price related ones. Excellent read. 
Favourite line: "The danger is that we focus so much on a volatile price chart that we confuse hyperbole and rising numbers with the promise of future domination."
Compares with the thing I read yesterday: "Eyes should be on the playing field - not the score board".

Bitcoin can succeed in more than one area: digital gold, financial software and currency. I suspect that in the next months there will be big movements towards corporate crypto (marketed as bitcoin 2.0), which will marginalize bitcoin as a currency. However, if intelligently done, bitcoin will succeed as a store if value and neutral (non-proprietary) software. Why would I put my money in a facebook, apple, amazon currency, which will rise and fall with the entity behind the currency? To me this seems way more insecure than the neutral approach.

I thought ripple was a cool idea and even bought some. However, I wouldn't have if I knew about the concentration of ownership. Distribution of bitcoins is nowhere near that. This actually is a colossal problem, as plummetting prices recently have shown. Ripple is pretty much at the mercy of two guys. Furthermore, their aggressive marketing ("Yes, bitcoin has its problems - but we fixed it") is not only wrong, but disgusting. I am surprised someone hasn't forked ripple by now.
Edit: Ripple is doing pretty much everything top down - the appointment of Guttenberg is a joke imo and less than 1000 readers on reddit says a lot too. I really don't feel that's what the world needs right now. Step aside, Uncle Scrooges.

I am not sure where exactly you're getting at. Bill Gates obviously is not into buying bitcoins anyhow. Others (Draper, Second Market, Pantera, ...) are.
Your hypothesis is in principle most certainly correct. You couldn't buy up ALL the Bitcoins with all the money in the world though. Some people just wouldn't sell (if only for the expectation of the price further increasing). Add the recently published fact that about 70 % of bitcoins have been lying dormant for half a year. If $ 100 Million poured in overnight, who knows what it might trigger. The bear whale who sold 26,000 coins made some splash with only a tenth of the amount of money. Not gonna happen though as such bulks of money are more likely to find the OTC markets.

@_date: 2014-09-12 17:44:30
Well, that didn't stop the price from hitting 1000 $ around the New Year. The circumstances really haven't changed all that much. Of course there are many factors that in the end make up the price and the parameters you have named are all valid. However, some guys over at r/bitcoinmarkets are pretty sharp, and the observations are keenly made and shouldn't be brushed aside in my opinion. Market manipulation is hardly a fringe phenomenon, and the bitcoin markets are especially vulnerable due to there being practically no oversight, little market depth, etc. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:28:15

US-$ is the world reserve currency. Hence the US can print until the system collapses and that is what they will do. Bernanke made that clear in 2008. Anyway, collapse might be very far away.

Eventually € will collapse first since no reserve currency status and thus WAY weaker than the US-$.

Thanks for the reply. Sounds very interesting and convincing too. I personally see two very adversarial forces facing each other: 
a) the extremely powerful technological realities and immediate need for something like bitcoin
b) the vested money interests that have historically proven to stop at nothing
So I figure that the four possible scenarios are:
1) bitcoin is will be killed off in the cradle, which can supposedly be done without extraordinary expenditures (youtube: 'the nightmare of a 51 % attack)
2) a total brute force war between the banks (which will probably act through the power of the state) against bitcoin that could set bitcoin way back
3) bitcoin being bought up through the vested interests (very hard to do)
4) vested interests miss the train and we are all going to be very very happy

Bitcoin is unique, but you got to compare it to something when it comes to history.
Peter Thiel is well-versed when it comes to payment systems and it's obvious he does know enough about Bitcoin. Now I'd rather let my opinion be influenced by guys like him than by a bunch of reddit nobodies (a label that includes my humble person).
From your link: "Fallacious examples of using the appeal include any appeal to authority used in the context of logical reasoning, and appealing to the position of an authority to the position of an authority or authorities to dismiss evidence"
Our talk is far from logical reasoning as we are talking about policy decisions, which are hardly ever based on logic. Furthermore didn't I dismiss evidence as you haven't presented any.

You can take for granted that Russia has the commodities, while China has become the production powerhouse of the world.

I am not an expert on how mining works. However, from what I do (assume) to understand, I see several problems in your argumentation: 


Block reward is not *permitted* by a government. It just happens inside the blockchain.


How do you keep miners from adding to certain blocks? The longest chain is recognized as the authentic one from what I understand. Thanks to the decentralization there is no way for a government to select their favourite chain. What government anyway? It's a global decentralized system. If one government should choose to act against a pool inside it's jurisdiction, it's quite likely that the pool would just move into a different one - just like now torrent sites are moved around.


I am not certain how a pool works in detail, but all you need is one (stealth?) pool, who draws defiant miners to scrap censorship (see point 2). The Bitcoin community has a very libertarian drift, so I assume there would be a lot of people interested and engaged in a workaround.

My point is: they were considered to be properly regulated then, while the proposed framework for btc seems to lack consideration before it even is in place. Systemic crises should be contained by regulation, but individuals will get burned either way. Regulation isn't a cure-it-all and can be destructive unless done well.

Interesting. But wouldn't you agree that those who design the code are the ones governing in the background. For example: The question of inflation/deflation and who receives the money (banks, future mining cartels, etc.) of a given currency is actually a highly political one. The way I see it it's really quite different compared to the 'organically grown' sort of law he talks about.

Sure, the amount of cryptos has exploded since Bitcoin's rocket-like ascend. On one hand that's because it's so easy to make one up, while on the other hand a lot of speculators have moved to alts, because Bitcoin volatility doesn't seem to be enough for them. Fine with me, but still: there is little to no use for alts besides speculation. That - for me - includes Dogecoin and leads me to 


I claim that the vast majority of people is not very conscious about the money they use and won't be soon either. If a crpyto holds advantages over fiat, people will use it - if not then they wont. Right now even the advantages of Bitcoin are (still) somewhat debatable but for alts I really see no future. You said that you hang out r/dogecoin a lot. I personally do on r/bitcoin with the full realization that it blurs my vision from time to time. That's why I force myself to read more conventional financial blogs to remind myself of how vast and much more important things like commodities or bonds are. Crypto communities are comparatively miniscule and are certainly not going to amount to a critical mass to shift the paradigm of why we use a certain money. 


Interesting example. We all know that both parties are 'owned' by the same corporations. Their points actually differ only marginally (the evolution I would like to see is pretty much absent) and I personally would go as far as to claim that they are two sock puppets on either hand of the same beast. 
Be that as it may. Bitcoiners are certainly going to kill me for saying so, but Ripple is definitely a thing to watch. If there are two cryptos that are built on totally different philosophical grounds than it's Bitcoin and Ripple. I say that - with maybe a few exceptions like bitshares - it's not likely that the rest of the list of coinmarketcap will ever go beyond the speculative phase.

Can they choose not to build on a block? Just like that?
Edit: What if there is a complying pool (A) and two non-complying ones (B and C). Let's say B and C add a block with tainted transactions. A would just ignore the last two blocks, and build its own chain. Their chain is shorter though and wouldn't be accepted by other miners, right?

'Always' meaning since Satoshi has coded it, while explicitly marking the blocksize limit a temporary measure. On the other hand will core devs also be those at fault if their decisions turn out to marginalize the network over time. Why would the status quo be more viable then the current decisions, which let it survive and thrive in the future? (I am not saying that I myself know the best way to go about the issue, that's why I am open to everything)


Fair enough. Do you agree that 'ideals' are concepts that exist in a platonic realm and not so much in the actual reality, which for some reason always turns out messy? Anyway, 'the wrong chain' seems to lean on a religion notion. Was *facebook* once the wrong network compared to *myspace*?

You can already buy stuff with Bitcoin, so what's your point?
You are basically saying: users here expect Bitcoin to take over the world. Well, probably not *anytime soon*. More likely we will have a boom and bust, then recovery hangover for a considerate amount of time, because that's how bubbles work and yes, Bitcoin at this point is a highly speculative investment that grows in bubbles - that's why we are excited about it right now, that's why we will have a headache later on. 
Might want to make use some of the cream (Aspirin) on top before it vanishes in the next downtrend. If you are not taking it, I can assure you people like me, and worse, are going to take yours (I recommend reading up on the "Trailing Stop" order).

That makes sense as an 'escape route'. However, do you feel that's fair when members of the federation have all the liquidity and engineers behind them. To me that just shows that Bitcoin is about to become politicized, an establishing of vested interests.

It is obvious that gold derives its value vastly from speculation. Price rising from roughly $ 400 in '05 to $ 2000 in '11 to then see it's value halved over the next four years obviously has little to do with "stuff".

It doesn't mean everything, but then it also doesn't mean nothing. In combination with volume it certainly means quite something.

And by integrating hardware with software and selling it to the crowd, they fuse content creators with the Bitcoin infrastructure and make it grow on a grass-roots level - which is a pretty cool vision for where Bitcoin should be heading IMO. Yes, there is centralization involved, but that's impossible to avoid at the moment.
Your example of Dell was interesting too. Let me add something there: Ten years ago I went Mac and never went back. Apple has become one of the most highly valued tech companies in the world, which means a great number of people did just as I. Folks give Apple shit for not really innovating and "charging too much for what their products are worth". On a technical level they are right too. In reality however there is an enourmous value proposition in building integrated devices.

I don't think 21 will put a mining chip into each and every electronic device - that would probably kill the battery too fast, which I consider to be a much bigger problem than not generating bitcoins economically enough. Instead it could be in a thumb drive, which generates bitcoins and communicates with other devices in need of money. You change the "thumb drive mining device" (what an unwieldy expression) every couple of years (just like you are used to changing your thumb drives anyway) - voila, problem solved.

This ^ is the most useful comment here, so better print it out, go over it with a highlighter and structure your piece accordingly.
Also remember that a thesis has to be **falsifiable** (-&gt; final binary outcome: "yes" or "no" or "more research has to be done to gain certainty").
Thus, "Bitcoin can greatly contribute to ending global poverty" is a narrow enough and actually awesome thesis for what you have to accomplish, while "Bitcoin is better than antiquated systems" hardly is, since too wobbly - i. e. inviting too many counter arguments. 
Avoid emotional language in your essay: no "I think", "I feel" ... best to save "I" for introduction and conclusion.

Every cryptocurrency has it's own blockchain. So create a crypto that overtakes Bitcoin and you have divorced the blockchain of actual bitcoins. Main question: Can outgrowing Bitcoin be incentivized? Reasonable answer: possibly.
The field of crypto is still so fresh that 'likelihoods' are only to be answered irrationally. Ask r/bitcoin and you will get an answer, ask engineers at IBM/UBS and you get a very different one. However, users here better not forget that above mentioned corporations have a staggering amount of money at their disposaal to throw at such a project and that Bitcoin isn't perfect - see e. g. the issue of scalability, volatility, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:09:30

Bitcoin computer might link the digital content created to the blockchain automatically. I think they meant that when using the 'monetizing storage' metaphor. When you sell the particular satoshi(s) connected to the product, you transfer ownership. That a wallet can't do.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:14:24
I don't think it's just semantics. DAH acquired a Bitcoin, but also a non-currency blockchain start-up and obviously intends to blend various blockchains. Chain.com is also talking about blockchain**s** (plural). The truth is that Bitcoin right now has its limitations - e. g. 7 tps - and those are migitated by a broader approach. Also is the fintech industry only now slowly waking up and coming to terms with their needs in respect to blockchains. Time will show how much Bitcoin will be in the Blockchains. I personally hope a lot of it and of course we all know the strong points of the Bitcoin blockchain.

When people like Blythe Masters are telling their "friends" to take blockchain tech as serious as they should have taken the internet in the early 90ies, that absolutely makes sense.
I think it all boils down to the distinction between permissioned ledgers and permissionless Bitcoin - or a hybrid approach (I feel that's maybe the most likely scenario). If the scaling issue is resolved in a positive way, I am cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term success myself.

The article strongly criticizes Bitcoin's built in deflation. This would only have its merits if Bitcoin was put in place as an intermediary currency - so a government can't endlessly devalue - until a more flexible currency was installed again. 
To be congruent with the corpus of the text, the headline should have been: "Bitcoins as (an intermediary) parallel currency for Greece".
Still, if Greece were to actually do that: Holy shit. That would put Bitcoin in the world's spotlight and boost confidence beyond the moon.

That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

@_date: 2015-03-02 18:53:02
Yes, and the first shares were issued when a bitcoin was worth $ 100, so it is safe to assume that some primary investors will cash out and send their shares into the OTC market. Still, the whole construct is a bit messy and unpredictable. 
Edit: Why am I being downvoted? It is messy. It's even messier with new shares that again have to dwell in the primary market for a year before becoming available on the OTC market. Tell me that's not somewhat complicated.

You seem to have used 'market' as a synonym for what I termed 'price'. The resulting blur is probably responsible for our little conceptual confusion. 
We obviously connect different connotations to the terms we employed. Contemplating the word 'market', I cannot withhold form thinking about actors. So do you actually, when you say 


i. e. who is looking? 
'Price' to me is a much more passive thing, a mere indicator that measures impact of e. g. a specific event (momentarily discounting all kinds of theoretical causes of price distortions for the sake of a clear-cut definition).


Now here is what our conceptual difference boiled down to: to me it is irrelevant how far the ahead in time the market can integrate this specific information, because I don't think the launch of Gemini is *relevant enough* (at least not short term) to move the price.

totally agree


I experienced a change of currency first-hand (Austrian Schilling -&gt; Euro). It really freaked people out then. It also took quite some time (in the range of months) to develop a feeling for the new currency, even though we were using it day by day. The only way people are going to put up with this is when Bitcoin is the stable alternative to a messy - e. g. hyperinflating - local currency. Otherwise I rather suspect that Bitcoin will be integrated in a way so that people won't realize they are using it.

All you will have to do is sell stuff for BTC on 'open bazaar'. In case of political repression - like capital controls, devaluation of currency - strong local markets might develop.

It's funny how some people split the world into a black and white perspective. Why is it 'the government' VS 'atlas shrugged'? I personally don't have sympathy for either one. 
Actually I try to be in line with the theory of evolution ... which is not cold and immoral. Darwin stressed the virtue of cooperation between species way more than cold rivalry and taking advantage of the other. 'Social Darwinism' is something the elites of the constructed in their sick heads to justify fleecing people. And yes, those people do have their fingers on the strings that move the government. Of course I do not know exactly where you are coming from, but to me it sounds Robespierreian-esque.

There is a difference between a country that produces olives and feta vs a high-tech industrial powerhouse and this has always been reflected in the currency.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:28:56
Yes, that's a huge problem. The currency has to match a country's economic power and business model. The Euro is too strong for Greece. A recent case illustrating problems that arise from this is Switzerland: Since they undid the Euro peg, the currency appreciated and now their tourism industry suffers, because foreign money isn't worth that much anymore. Germany on the other hand gets a free ride, since in their case the Euro is undervalued, which makes their exports cheaper (too hard to compete with in the case of France), but also leads to German work force suffering, since imports are more expensive than they were when they used the ultra-strong but appropriate D-Mark. 
With Bitcoin, no country could adapt their money to their economic circumstances. So while it might make sense to hold Bitcoin as a reserve - just like gold - using Bitcoin as legal tender would indeed be a bullet to the head. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:43:17


Totally agree. It's industrial heavyweight Germany VS olives and feta producing Greece. That's of course simplified to the point where it hurts a little, but the problem at a very basic level.
Germany has cut production costs and has been outcompeting every other EU country for years. It's neither willing to give up it's competitive advantage - which it thinks is a virtue that it really isn't in a monetary union - nor to build up Greece or any other debtor country with some sort of Marshall plan (see shrinking economy thanks to austerity).
Eichel, the finance minister then, who was responsible for getting Greece into the Eurozone called for integrating them *so Germany can export more*. He literally said that. And export Germany did. Cashing in the money that German banks were lending to Greece. Now Germany bails out not Greece, but exactly those German banks.

Right now Bitcoin is still in it's experimental phase. The general consensus (not the one of r/bitcoin) seems to slowly shift towards "Bitcoin (probably) not going away (soon)". That's better than half a year ago, but not enough for serious capital to try that option for sure. Bitcoin has to do relatively well/better in a severe global financial crisis compared to fiat and thus pass the acid test. Once that happens investors will consider using it for serious hedging. 
It's really only a matter of time until we shall see how that turns out.

It's not Bitcoin VS gold. Bitcoin is a break-through in finance outside a central system, but - at least for the next few thousand years - it simply can't compete with the historicity of gold. That being the (valid) argument of gold bugs: it has kept value for thousands of years.

That's kind of a weird thing to say. QE only doesn't spur inflation, because banks and rentiers hoard the money created  If a CB did a QE for the people ("Here, have 1000 $/€ everybody"), deflation would be extremely non-problematic.

I reckon that Bitcoin could use a little more time to see its foundation secured, i. e. exist outside the traditional system.

From a legal pespective it will be very hard to argue that miners are employees. According to that logic you might as well argue that software engineers are employees. However neither are "salaried" by Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-19 14:57:13
Personally I blame the software engineers for blocking the compromise we could have had **years** ago. I also think that miners are entitled to have a say in how things should progress. Treating them as "employees", when they are the ones who have most at stake, is pretty fucked up imo. Software engineers can go work somewhere else, holders can divest. What are you going to do with a mining farm though? If anyone is not an employee here, it's actually the miners.
