Ok, I'm interested

I'm finding that everything that works in my country requires exhaustive proof of ID.  After submitting a bank statement, proof of address and photo ID I was hit with this and can't believe it's a requirement: 
 CoinSpot Verification Photo
You're almost there. All you need to do now is upload a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with the hand written statement below (see example).
To ensure that we can verify that the photo is you please ensure the photo meets the below requirements:
    Photo must include the secret code shown below
    Photo must include your signature
    Ensure that all of your face and head are completely visible and not on an angle
    Ensure you are not wearing a hat or any clothing that is obstructing any part of your face
    Ensure that the below hand written message is correct and legible

I, [Your Full Name], submit this photo to apply for a CoinSpot account to trade digital currency and my secret code is xxxxx. [Your Signature]

Coinspot, an Australian provider

About 1% I think.

12+ hours to transfer to an open source wallet, too...

What payment method(s) do they usually take?

How do I sent my BTC to the open source wallet if I'm stuck with the minimum send?
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:18:38
What I want to buy is less than $10

Deposit.  Want to pay someone for something, but would prefer not to buy bitcoin, wait for it to go in my open source wallet, then send it to them.
@_date: 2018-10-01 06:08:15
But I need to create an account to buy and transfer them to the wallet.

Is it possible that this network may require confirmation despite not mentioning it?
