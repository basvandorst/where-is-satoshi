Don't want to be that guy, but I'm not sure if this quick increase is healthy... I guess only time will tell

yes, but recompressing a png yields the same result because it's a lossless compression. If you JPEG many times you decrease quality, if you png many times you don't decrease quality.

search for "hidden" and it will be displayed
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:37:00
PNG is already compressed - lossless. If it were a JPEG I'd agree, but not with a PNG

The order of the words is important. The last word is a checksum for the previous ones. Electrum can verify that.

ok, could be. I was just thinking it could mean sth. But yeah, more likely it doesn't mean anything.

Lucky, I "only" added a few hundred USD, but I definitely learned my lesson here: 
never store currency on an exchange and never send money in without testing withdrawal with a small amount first.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:59:05
Buy a hardware wallet, I have to say it makes it super easy. I'm using ledger nano s :)
Easy to use, good security and your funds are safe and can be recovered (as long as you safely keep the recovery phrase)
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:31:18
Then BTC is actually not the best currency. BTC has a strong centralization in China due to the hashing algorithm and ASICS. There are other coins out there which are more decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:06:22
You are kidding, right? Verification does not work at all and the support is non-responsive for over 1 month (at least what I can confirm)
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:08:18
Yes, I'm pretty sure they are done and try to do damage control and lure as many ppl in as possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:56:32
I'm having problems with verification as well. Process failed and now it was "escalated", still haven't heard from them in 2-3 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:59:22
I'm sorry to hear that... I dunno what is wrong here. What country are you from?
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:32:54
BTC also has a strong centralization in China due to the hashing algorithm and ASICS. There are other coins out there which are more decentralized.

Haven't heard anything bad about it, but Software wallets are not as secure as paper or hardware wallets. And with sums like OPs, they shouldn't use a software wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:04:58
Been waiting for 1 month to get verified now and am not allowed to withdraw anything. Verification does not work and support is not responding at all (3 tickets). These are a lot of red flags. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:00:01
Got a source? I couldnt find the video matching this
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:11:08
Just wait, I received that mail too ;)
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:15:00
UPDATE: I finally got verified a few hours after I sent bill an E-Mail. Just explain your situation in a friendly way and attach all the necessary details (e.g. Passport scan).
Hope this helps! :)

This is great of course, but what we see here is an attack being hindered that people thought of. It's the ones that devs didn't think of that are a problem.

Do you have problems reading emotions? It is quite obvious...

Let's not exaggerate what he does for humanity here. Other billionaires do amazing stuff, too. Bill gates and Manoj Bhargava come to mind.

Trump is not long enough in office to have significant impact on the economy. Policies and change take longer than you believe. The initial stock market rise is the only thing that can be attributed to him, as he stated his America first sentiment. But the enthusiasm is already declining.
On a side note, it's kind of funny to see how you people feel the need for personal attacks and instead of thoughtful discussion on the same level. Devaluing your conversation partner does not make your point more valid. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:51:55
That doesn't make it better at all
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:32:37
you forgot to blur the time in the upper right. With the time and the USD cost, this transaction could be found semi-easily I presume. The time is the most interesting factor.

Sorry, I'm a bit out of the loop. What do you mean by that?
