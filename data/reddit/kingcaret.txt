I'll give it a shot 
Edit: this game is pretty tough... I've only gotten to 64 so far.

I play in vertical view (and I've tried both) because I can't touch two colors on the same side quickly enough with my thumbs if it is horizontal. Touching two colors on top of each other in vertical is a pain but doable. 
1-10: I give the game a 10. It's smooth and I've seen no issues. 
I like the Extreme mode. It requires me to put my brain in a different mode and recognize the colors faster. Less thinking, more doing type of mode. 
Music is nice. As for VS mode, I'm not sure if that would work as this game requires a lot of focus and adding another element might make it complicated. Maybe adding a small symbol in the travel bar to the right for a friend's best score
Also thanks for the tip and for the game, it's pretty fun. You just gotta get in the zone to climb to the top. I wonder if I could handle three ships

Actually the mall borders the two cities and lies half in both cities.

I'm playing on Normal mode. I tried Extreme mode but I tripped me up... I think I got to like 35. 
Are the button positions supposed to change at all in normal mode ? Because after returning to Normal mode after extreme, the colors were in different places

Best I could do for now

You can tip outside crypto subreddits? Can you tip in any subreddit?

I think randomizing the colors once after returning to Normal  from Extreme is okay. I got used to it after a while but any more than that, then I think it would be too annoying for players
