For the same reason companies are not accepting bitcoin - it is expensive, risky and painful to change business systems. Right now bitcoin doesnt deliver the benefits, and other solutions are here or coming soon.  
    
Imagine yourself running a business. You need to change your accounting and maybe get legal advice. You have to modify your online shopping and in-store PoS systems. Now ask what you get for that expense and risk. Will you get more customers? Will they spend more? How much more? Will your own costs go down? You still have to support VISA/MC/Debit anyway. Are you going to make the extra effort to figure out how much CC fees you are saving and pass savings along to the customer?  
    
And why Bitcoin - wouldnt DASH be better for retail commerce? Litecoin? Or maybe wait and see how Bcash plays out. Meanwhile these other guys are telling you that Ethereum will change the world of business completely. So why jump in on SegWit now?  
    
I'm a fan of the tech, but see Bitcoin/SegWit is in the unfortunate position of asking for acceptance. Tell me as a business owner why I NEED to go with BTC/SegWit, why I need to do it NOW, what will happen to my business if I do nothing.

* have set up an SPVBlockStore
* called PeerGroup setFastCatchupTimeSecs() passing a very recent time
* called PeerGroup downloadBlockchain()
  
that was yesterday, still hasnt returned. I thought it would download the headers prior to the catchup time and blocks since. Thought that would be quick.  
    
Also thought the SPVBlockStore would grow. Its still sitting at 626k and not growing - should that be expected?

Banning bitcoin is a wrong move for any government. People will take their capital elsewhere, feed the grey/black market, or simply hodl and wait for the world to change. The Economy(tm) suffers because otherwise-productive value that could have been put to useful work is sitting there doing nothing. And other governments that allow/embrace do better and better.  
    
Agree with OP - this is the first and maybe only time in human history when people have some way to take control of their own money, establish free markets and implement a system that stands as an alternative, fair competition to the System(tm) monopoly.  
    
Challenging government (properly, nonviolently) on important issues is a patriotic duty.

Agree completely. I'm there to drink beer, not to trade tokens for fiat for plane tickets :)
Back to the OP's question - why is there a biertoken: it's just the way the house gets paid.
Real crypto analogy take a look at [arcade.city]( They made their own token ARC in Ethereum. It's the only thing they accept as payment for their rideshare service. One could ask why not just pay for your ride with Ether? After all its inconvenient to buy ETH, then trade ETH for ARC, then pay the service with ARC.
The devs and initial backers were paid in ARC. Now they wait until some future time when ARC has good value and sell. They take risks and maybe get rewards later.

thanks - seems like 'nearly there' - months not years. Schnorr closer to the top of the reading list now :)
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:12:10
Many create their own coin in order to get paid.
Consider wooden tokens at a biergarten. The taps must agree to exchange one beer per token and settle up with the organizers at the end of the day. The organizers take a cut to pay for the venue, portapotties and such. They might also take a cut to donate to the hosting organization.
If the taps accepted cash then the organizers would lose their cut.
Sure, it makes the beer slightly more expensive, but generally we accept it because otherwise there wouldnt be a biergarten.

Great article, very exciting stuff.
1. Would adoption of Schnorr signatures require a hard fork? (am thinking yes)
2. Is Schnorr ready to be made a real standard?
*"Unfortunately, unlike ECDSA, the Schnorr algorithm has not been standardized since its invention, likely because of the original patent enforced on it (which has since expired)."*
3. Is the 'delinearization' step currently defined and demonstrated with a reference implementation?
4. What is a realistic timeframe? 2 - 5 yrs?
5. If the timeframe is long enough and bitcoin might hard-fork anyway, will there be an opportunity/temptation to include other pending features and make one "super Bitcoin" to rule them all? ;-)

IANAL but it seems Coinbase put up weak resistance against an unconstitutional search of their customer data. Yes they went to court and lost the challenge, but then failed to push the matter higher.
Their profitability and industry prominence should have enabled them to pursue the matter further. Iit is arguably in their best interest. to keep fighting. Yet they simply gave up and turned over the data. This capitulation possibly discouraged many from getting into crypto, impeded technological advancement and put the USA behind in an emerging industry. Plus it only encourages regulatory creep.
To trust them with identity AND money seems unwise to me.

One thing Bitcoin cannot do is make an instant unsecured loan to facilitate a transaction between unrelated parties who might not be connected to any network.
VISA/MC/etc make money by playing the role of lender and charging interest/fees to honest, willing participants, charging enough interest to cover the losses from misbehavior.
The ĐASH masternode system already provides speed and privacy, albeit for a fee. If they figure out how to handle the insta-loan business case then they could become the crypto for retail and take some business away from the credit cards.
Maybe a Bitcoin higher-layer solution will come along someday and try something similar, and displace ĐASH (etc) for this case. Or maybe ĐASH will become the silver to Bitcoin's gold.

The instant-loan at point of sale when the customer doesnt have the money to pay for something. Customer has to pay it back later with interest. Bitcoin et al need to solve this use-case before we can kick the VISA habit.

IANAL, but I think the people retain the right to barter; the ninth amendment ought to preclude Uncle Sam from usurping control of something they did not create and do not lawfully own.
Making compliance "easy" by offering an automatic report may be convenient for the IRS and Coinbase, but is against the interests of every casual user who buys bitcoin with after-tax earnings and wants to simply use it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:06:38
1. IRS's move creates a serious accounting burden for regular users who just want to pay for goods and services.
2. Digital currency (DC) does not meet the definition of any other thing described in the law. "Close enough" is not good enough, and regulating now could lead to a future of wasteful legal wrangling.
3. DC is not real and does not reside within the boundaries of the nation. If I control some DC and cross a border, did I take it across the border?
4. Gov did not create DC, does not own it and does not control its supply. It is not the official currency nor is it legal tender.
5. Govt does not automatically own/control everything - the people do. (Ninth amendment)
6. Privacy. If someone earns income and has paid their income tax, what concern is it of anyone what they do with their money?
7. Concern of spending precious public funds to create more wasteful government infrastructure
8. Yet another societal control system that is more of a protection racket than a useful safety measure.

As for coinbase they have a physical and corporate presence, both of which can be assaulted. They are part of the system and have no choice but to comply with the wishes of those who run the system and hate the possibility of freedom that crypto brings.
Hence the interest in decentralized exchanges and fiat gateways. Virtual money will eventually just go around coinbase and any other barriers that humans can temporarily put up.

I dont understand why BCH (pronounced like "bitch") has any value whatsoever.  
    
Bitcoin has value because coins were produced by real work (electricity, hardware, bandwidth, sysadmin effort, risk-taking etc).  
    
Bitcoin Cash didnt do the work to create the BCH blockchain - it took a copy of Bitcoin's work and pretended it has value. That's outright fraud.  
    
If it's possible now for anyone to steal value from Bitcoin this way, then Bitcoin is not a great store of value. And if Bitcoin users arent spending Bitcoin for real goods and services, then we have no way to set a fair value for it. And until there's integrated privacy then Bitcoin isn't truly fungible.  
    
Am HODLing, but kinda pissed. The BCH move is a big FU to the BTC crowd.

Volatility is a poor excuse - merchants could always protect themselves with a coinbase merchant account to cash out instantly, or at least nightly. I agree about the administrative cost.
I've been trying to encourage merchants about crypto adoption and here are the usual reactions I get.
\ FEAR. Merchants are afraid of anything that could change their legal, accounting and compliance setup. They are afraid of explosive IT costs and disruption. Many don't even know how to manage their own website, never mind set up their ecommerce differently. Then fear of the cost of training staff, and retraining due to turnover.
Then is the chicken-and-egg problem. Nobody is spending it because nobody accepts it. Yes a few brave retailers are leading the way, but the overall population is still massively ignorant about crypto.
Then some success from the FUD machine. Merchants want to avoid association with any and all scams. Merchants are not all stupid - most see through it, but at the same time their customer base, professional help (accountants, lawyers) are all generally hesitant.
Next is the confusion in the crypto industry right now: too many options and too much going on. People who barely understand bitcoin are not willing to consider segwit, BCH, BCH ABC vs BCH SV, Ethereum, DASH and sidechains until they better understand bitcoin, and that is still a few years off I figure.
Merchants don't give a darn about freedom and economic theory, and they don't yet see the big opportunity to make more money. They are already setup to accept and handle cash, debit, credit and have built the fees into their business model already. They want fiat and the assurance of a bank balance.

Just a few:
1. The Coinbase fee is still less than credit card fees, so there is more profit for the merchant as more people use crypto
2. No risk of charge-backs
3. No risk of blocked payments, especially on international orders
4. Trustless verification - a bad customer can't claim payment was accepted but not credited. A bad merchant can't
5. Differentiation, free publicity: "Hey look, ACME is accepting bitcoin now!"
6. Getting ahead of the competition in technology, easy entry into Ethereum and the possibility of automating many business activities
7. Risk-taking, market exploration
