In a similar manner I could say the imposition of a currency (fiat money, for example) and the ability to control people's lives through a federal reserve that responds to the interest of corporations and lobbies is the real authoritarianism. 
If bitcoin doesn't solve the problem certainly it won't make it much worse either.

Actually it keeps reminding me of Foundation (Asimov)

Exactly! And Jihan would be The Mule hahaha lol. 
Seriously the way I've always seen it goes in a slightly different scale and is that the world has been in serious danger since the 2008 crisis. This crisis could only end in total war and the end of civilization, however there were some who knew this would happen (Satoshi). They opened the chamber and went to speak to the hologram and Seldon gave them the Bitcoin whitepaper.
He knew the banking/financial system would destroy the world and the only way to force a redistribution of the wealth  without a war, which would be fatal at this point in history ("IV World War will be fought with sticks and stones"), is a technology with all the features Bitcoin has. 
I love Asimov.

Traceable money: If tax payers knew exactly what their money ends up financing government would have to get it from their cold dead hands.

Sit back and relax.
Just less than two months to get over with the miner's FUD and we're on TV.
Be ready and get your grandma a wallet before the bank steals all her money.
