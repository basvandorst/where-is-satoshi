I sent the funds from bitcoin.info to my wallet in ARMORY. I allowed that person from DAZZLEPOD and suddenly armory crashed by the way,just figured I should say that.

yes that is what I meant,I type to fast for my own mind sometimes.

I just downloaded armory today so fyi if this is a keylogger or something fishy is going on maybe Armory isn't as secure as they say it is.

It says 16 confirmations next to that .62 I sent what does that mean?

Eight that is real awesome of you but at the same time kind of crazy cause this isn't working. I see nothing and I am willing to give you a screen shot as well...  Still says 0. Check in blockchain.info for your own security. I don't know what is going on...

I came here to get help and hopefully put my head together with some other folks to figure this task out. You are right it could be my computer because I have sent funds through my phone and didn't have a problem. But that is pretty obvious and I thank you for that but perhaps you can answer my question?
at 17 confirmations I am assuming I must reach a certain amount until the funds are actually sent to my armory,am I correct or no?

Going to go with that thanks alot,do you have any idea why my 62 cents didn't show up? I imagine it was taken up by a miners fee of some sort but I am not sure.
