Why is it unlikely to sink below 3k?
Not trying to argue, I’m just not sure there is much evidence to support this that wasn’t also true about 6k in 2018.

Your very first premise is incorrect. You don’t hold bitcoin because you believe it will grow exponentially (it’d still be nice), you hold bitcoin because you know it won’t deteriorate in value the way fiat does.

Shut up and sit down

Haha there’s even less evidence that it’s going to zero

1 year- between 10k and 30k
5 years - between 80k and 250k
10 years - between 200k and 1M

So our only fear of bitcoin going to zero should be something that doesn’t exist yet? Seems pretty useless

A quantum computer that can break BTC exists right now?

But this “when” could be ten seconds or ten centuries from now which is why I choose not to worry about it

Yes there are lots of estimates of how many have been lost but all we know for sure is there will never be more than 21M

When you lay a concrete foundation for your home should you be concerned about people who tell you that in _________ amount of time (no one knows for sure how long) this concrete foundation *may* *possibly* *be* unusable due to factors that don’t exist currently?

Skepticism shouldn’t be hard to understand when half the people are saying “you can use it right now” and the other half are saying “this won’t be useful for at least 10-20 years”

I think your underestimating the true value of digital scarcity. Bitcoin is like a sponge, it’s like a Chimera, it has several valuable attributes that people become very attached to even now at 5 digits. It’s over 10k with still such a small % of the global population owning any at all.
There’s also a chance it leads to complete upheaval of legacy financial systems which may leave bitcoin as the new world currency.

Bitcoin only breaks the record Feb 2nd if it hits a new low on or after that date. Right now, this is not the longest bear market in history

I thought with deepfakes you’re not altering a video of the actual person, you’re altering video of another person by painting the target’s face on their head?
