Yes...will be forced to settle in cash and not stand for delivery of actual BTC.  Just like the metals.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced a plan to launch Bitcoin futures by the end of the year. The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record in response to the announcement.  It was reminiscent of the dot.com era, when a dot.com stock would jump 10% if Maria Bartiromo merely whispered the name of the company on CNBC.
Ironically, the cheers for this new contract from the Bitcoin faithful could turn out to be analogous to chickens in the barnyard cheering at the appearance of Colonel Sanders.
GATA released an article about the new Bitcoin futures contract titled “So Long Cryptos.” I’m sure that editorial stance puzzled most Bitcoin price-momentum chasers.  Crpto aficionados, for now, overlook the fact that CME futures are used aggressively to push around the dollar-based Comex gold and silver futures contracts.
As GATA points out, the ability to manipulate precious metals futures contracts by the official entities motivated to suppress the price of gold is reinforced by the volume trading discounts given from the CME to Governments and Central Banks who trade on the CME.
If there any reason to assume that the same volume discounts will not be extended to the Bitcoin contract?  Another curious feature of the Bitcoin contract is that it will be settled in cash.  I would point out the original intent behind futures contracts was to enable producers and users to agree ahead of time on a price that would be paid for the delivery of the underlying commodity associated with the futures contract.  Futures were a financing tool intended to facilitate the production and distribution of the underlying commodity product.
The Bitcoin futures contract is settled only in cash – U.S. dollars.  To wit, does this not theoretically sabotage the intended purpose of Bitcoin, which is to provide an alternative to fiat currencies?  Why would you want to receive fiat dollars rather than delivery of the underlying?

The announcement says it is cash settled.

Yes, that is right.  This is not good for BTC.

BTC is more valuable if it fills the role of digital gold than digital currency.

Yes.  The way to manage (aka manipulate) prices for any good is to create a futures market.  As someone already said, it is an old and thus refined technique.
