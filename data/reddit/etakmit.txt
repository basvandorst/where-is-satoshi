That fee is not a standard fee.  Like requested show us a tx ID.   
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:58:59
I've done the same and they fixed it no problem

One of the better software wallets out there. You can also tie it to your trezor so that you don't have to use the web browser to transact with it.  
It is not the only software wallet that allows that

or you can just set buy orders on one of the many exchanges out there at your target price points.

If you're in long term then yes because you will ROI without power costs.

the bad english is the first giveway, the [bit.ly]( address is another.  and lastly - just assume its always someone trying to take your coins!

I'm pretty sure he just means that entering your total amount is a pain.  You can't just click "all".  Even though they cover the fees - you still have to figure out how to enter eight decimal points worth of numbers.

yeah I've had nothing but good CS from them.  update us when you get sorted out
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:01:06
Unless you're buying literally your own mine solo will not be worth it
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:30:36
Yep just obnoxious really

It could hit 10k before Jan 1.  The real question is will it?

It also may continue the losing streak.  50/50 chance of either happening.

Their limit increases are also an algorithm on their backend at circle.
You put your request in and then you wait.  It'll hit eventually.  There is no magic number to get one.  So just keep on using it and you should be at 3000 eventually.

wait a comparison of two totally disparate timeframes?  hrmm let me draw some knee jerk comparisons
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:29:24
if you have even the slightest concern, return it
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:21:52
There are multiple sides with various opinions and ideas about how to tackle this.  So yes debate.  
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:09:38
You wait.  Either it eventually goes through or eventually it basically goes away and you can re-send
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:55:48
That decision has been appealed so now the appeals process is in place.  This is what you'll see talked about in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:41:33
Same as sending between any two wallets
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:32:45
Buckle up. It'll likely take very long even with higher fees!   Huge backlog right now.   Read up and be informed about the blocksize debate and make your own conclusions. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:38:46
Physical storage is a must.  Love the trezor
@_date: 2016-07-30 00:52:35
It'll be there when you're synced. No worries
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:44:53
time to set up a node it seems!  all of the tutorials look easy.  off I go!   i'll have a channel open soon!
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:23:04
That's been the case for a very long time
