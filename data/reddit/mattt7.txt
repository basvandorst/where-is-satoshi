It was very common a few months ago. Just some spam. 
Also, to [quote]( &gt;This happens occasionally. Dust that is sent between wallets can be used to identify users. If you get some negligible amount of bitcoin, and use it as an input for a transaction along with bitcoin from another address you own, the two addresses are known to be owned by the same person.

It's all "speculation" being that I have no hard sources. 
By tipping people based on "quality content" they're increasing tweets about the bowl, which will increase views on the bowl, which will increase views on the ads, etc, etc, etc. All while also building awareness of bitcoin.

[BlockChain Address](
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:06:02
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong (or validate that I'm correct)...
If you import your private key, you now have imported the private key and public address your wallet. Problem is, the private key is the same! Anyone who sees an image of the private key can *sweep* the private key and public address's balance into one of their wallet's addresses and the balance will no longer be yours. 
If you sweep the private key in to your wallet, it **sends** the balance on that private key and address to one of your addresses, and no one has your address's private key!
So yes, someone could still have access to the scavenger hunt's address with the private key, but that address no longer has any value on it since the balance was sent (swept) to one of your addresses.

Give James D'Angelo's videos a look. It'll take longer to watch them all than it would to read the whitepaper, but he'll break it down in a way that you can understand. 
It includes some technical points and some non-technical. Think of it as khan academy, but for bitcoin (also, Khan Academy has some videos on bitcoin too).

Bowl games are given to any college football team with a winning record that accepts the invite. It will be the last game of the season for both teams. 
The game is being sponsored by BitPay, a major bitcoin processor. 
To show thanks for sponsoring the bowl, a few larger accounts plan to be tipping others in bitcoin. This was likely terms agreed to upon BitPay agreeing to sponsor the bowl. "We'll give you x million to fund the bowl if x accounts tip others at least x times during the bowl". 
Ex. ESPN will agree to tip bitcoin from their corporate twitter if they can be the only channel to broadcast the bowl. Warner Bros. will tip others if they can advertise their newest movie during the bowl. etc, etc, etc. 
Marketing :)
Being that the game will be on ESPN (one of the only sports-only channels) during primetime (starting at 8PM), expect at least a few million views. Many from sports fans, many from college football fans, fans from the two teams playing (UCF and NC State), and a very few viewers watching because of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:46:26

It does not take a whole lot to move the price of Bitcoin. It's a lot to common folk like you and I, but to others it is nothing. 
If you navigate to bitcoinwisdom.com and move your cursor to the right of the graph, in the top left of the graph it will tell you the amount of bitcoin needed to sell (or buy) to reach that price. 
Currently for Bitfinex, if you would sell 100BTC the price would drop from 318.9 to 316.9 (or about .6%). 
If $30k drops the price $2, you can imagine what more money could do, especially once the price really starts going down, causing others to "panic sell" in a snowball-like effect.

Pertaining to moving, it really depends on the jobs there more than anything. (to me at least)

James D'Angelo does some really nice work explaining bitcoin. He has a specific video of why bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme here: 
It's a little long (23 min) but thorough. 
TLDR; It's not a Ponzi Scheme because the profit does not go to a central operator. Although if you want to *stretch* it, bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme where **everyone** benefits, not just one group.

All it takes is to plant a seed in peoples' minds. If your seed is good enough that they believe it themselves, they'll spread the word, causing FUD.

Here's my understanding of them, much of this is dumbed down for ELI5 (someone more knowledgeable feel free to agree or disagree): 
Think of them to be used with someone that you transact with a lot (i.e. a roommate). You buy the two of you a pizza and he will pay you back. Instead of paying you instantly, you say "don't worry about it, you can buy the next one" (technical details: he signs a transaction to you but neither of you publish it to the blockchain). Later that night, at a bar, he buys you both a drink. This doesn't cover the whole cost of the pizza so he pays you the remaining amount later (technical details: you sign a transaction to him paying him back for the drink. These "two transactions" are published to the blockchain, but in one transaction, him paying you [pizza cost - drink cost]). 
In reality you're using multi-sig and it's a trust-less environment. There's no way for one participant to run off with the money or not to pay at least the desired amount. 
The end goal is to have these little agreements (people owing others) with multiple and many people so that if you wanted to pay someone, you wouldn't have to open up a payment channel directly with him, it could bounce from person to person (like the internet bounces through routers when pinging from NY to CA) eventually hitting the desired recipient.

Give codecademy.com a look. Nice for beginners. Multiple languages.
I started with Visual Basic. It let me interact with viewable things (buttons, text boxes, check boxes, etc.). It was much more satisfying than, say, a command line prompt and output would be. 
Problem is, if you don't have access to Visual Studio it can be a pain obtaining/buying. 
I transferred from there (in high school) to C++ (in college) fairly easy.

Because of the recent updates in Dread Pirate Robert's trial today. The possibility of Mark Karpeles also being behind The Silk Road has come up.

$0. 
A 17 year old college dropout finds a way to reconstruct private addresses from public addresses by using the transaction ID. He slowly liquidates many, many bitcoins into many different currencies. He's been doing it since 2013. The owner of an address that he's currently liquidating notices the pattern and publishes his findings, quickly tanking the price of bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto comes forth, apologizing for his mistake and verifying his identity by signing a message from one of the addresses containing one of bitcoin's first block rewards. 
Happy New Year all :)

Just in case: 


Dear Bitstamp customers,


WHAT HAPPENED?
On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC. This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We can assure customers that any bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th at 9am UTC are completely safe and will be fully honored. 




We took the decision to rebuild our systems from the ground up from a secure backup for a few reasons. By redeploying our system from a secure backup onto entirely new hardware, we were able to preserve the evidence for a full forensic investigation of the crime. We have also taken this time to implement a number of new security measures and protocols so that customers can resume using Bitstamp with full confidence and trust. While this decision means we have not been able to provide you with services for a number of days, we feel this extra measure of precaution was in the best interest of our customers. 


Our team has been working day and night to rebuild and restore security to the Bitstamp site so customers can resume transacting with us quickly, safely, and confidently. Bitstamp is now fully operational with a number of key improvements:

Check my post, some of it was on random number generators: 
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:40:32
**TLDR**: 
They did a brute force on private keys starting at 0x00...00 and increasing and found some BTC. 
They did a brute force on some brain wallets using common words as a private key generator and found some BTC. 
They did a brute force on some "random" brain wallets that they were using JavaScript's Math.random(). Because JS generates a random number with a seed based on what time it is, they were able to generate past and future private keys and found some more BTC. 
They did an attack that relies on some wallets using same nonce when generating transaction hashes. They scanned through the blockchain and found some addresses that made multiple transactions with the same nonce and found some more BTC (even made two addresses as an example hoping someone else would crack them: [one]( and [two]( They also expanded on this ECDSA vulnerability explaining that once they found one bad address, they could use what they found there to expose other bad addresses. 
I thought it was an interesting talk, even though all of these "vulnerabilities" have been known for a while and are all because of bad client side code, aka in wallets.
