I agree, it's nothing mystical. Also, the bad or good 'karma' doesn't necessarily come directly from the person you interacted with. The guy you fel with will reflect his experience onto anybody else he interacts with, any future situation. This could result in a decision that is affected by his angry/happy state of mind, which could indirectly affect you but, perhaps less selfishly, could affect many strangers. Personally, I want to live in a world where there are more happy people than angry people...selfish again maybe but still better for everybody.
tl;dr; Karma isn't magic but it is real.

unless something else comes in and takes the mindshare, yes.

Funny post. But take creative to make care.

the problem is that alternative ideas attract lots of weirdos with ailly ideas, even legitimate alternative views (like cyrpto or railing against SJWs, just two examples). I don't know if the intention is to put everyone who doesn't tow the party line into the same camp as 'the weirdos' or not but it works out that way sadly. I believe in free speech but platforms that host just one type of view are bound to fail.

This conversation l, and the down voting does nothing for the bitcojlin cause. My point in a nutshell actually. Bitcoin is a great and anti-establishment idea, of course it will attract folk from other anti-establishment groups. We can ony hope there is a decent amount from all the 'parties' that understand and believe in it.

i like yt now, where i subscribe to both 'sides' so get to hear what everyone is talking about.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:09:02
won't that just go alt-right or downright, just right? Like that reddit knock off voat did. I like the idea of voat but it was (is?) a cesspit.

What I mean is that theae alternative platforms tebd to attract one crowd of people and they tend be more on the right. Not saying who is 'correct'. I believe all opinions should be heard but we don't want platforms to be one side, whatever side it is.
