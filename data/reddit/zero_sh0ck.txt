Is this available on android? I don't see it in the app store.

Try google or the reddit search bar. 
There are loads of pages that answer those questions and chances are you will find the answer faster than someone answering it all for you.

How much in fees is $5 million of bitcoin?

Tax attorney's are different from CPA and book keepers. Tax attorney's would understand this area more because they study tax law and liability.

Oh apologies. I thought you were the OP. My mistake. Your comment is on the bottom, not the above. My filter is sort where best post is top not newest post is top. So your post is on the bottom.
While I appreciate the input, your comments are to be taken with a grain of salt. You have a history of spamming about freedom, freedom from taxes, and your website. Your comments are as relevant as my spam inbox.

Then honestly, your not ready to dive straight into bitcoin. You seem like the person that wants to jump onto bitcoin just because it seems like you can get rich fast. But it isn't that simple.
So I'll put it in simple terms. It's not worth it to mine. You will spend more on electricity than gaining any profits. The more people that mine, the harder it gets to mine a bitcoin. There are warehouses that mine bitcoin and they have hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment.

I have read your comment and if they were good enough, you wouldn't be here asking these questions.
You have your opinion on tax attorney's, I have mine. In the end, it's up to you and your family on what risks they want to take with the IRS.

It depends what you plan to do with it. Do you plan on holding it long term? Then put it on a hardware wallet. However, if you plan on holding it short term or possibly do some day trading? Keep it on the exchange.

Because this has been asked many times and there has yet to be a definitive answer. At the same time, you don't state what country your friend is. That country itself may have laws regarding bitcoin and gains.
So a tax attorney or account is your best bet to answering this question. Then if you get the answer, you can always post it on reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:20:36
Consult with a tax attorney. Only they can accurately answer this question.
I say this because laws regarding crytocurrency varies from country to country.

Oh, you won't have to worry about that. It's simply an app that lets you check prices on various coins. You just have to add it in and you don't need to log in whatsoever. You can even add in your "holdings" and it'll tell you how much you profit/loss. Again, no account is needed.

Why not create a chatroom in discord? It's a pretty popular chat app and lots of people use it.

No one can say when the next dip will be. Can happen today, tomorrow, next week, it's unpredictable. You have a better chance to buy now and save money before it increases than waiting for a dip and buy then.

Not really anonymously when you need an address to ship the item to.

Ahhh decisions decisions.

Sometimes transactions does go through right away. Just wait.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:24:24
What is your form of payment?
And are you a verified user?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:47:16
Ha. That won't stop the people from accepting it as forms of payment.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:50:35
Dude nice engraving. If I send my hydroflask to you, will you do the same? (I will definitely pay for shipping to and from as well as some extra for your time)
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:37:22
How would this bet be honored. Are you guys going to follow each other 24/7? 
A bet like this isn't feasible unless you are under 24/7 surveillance. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:01:06
I'm glad you like it. I'm a little paranoid too but that app is by far the best (IMO) crypto watch app out there.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:47
It's internet money that can be exchanged for real money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:09:46
This is at least half of us every single day. Waiting for the dip to buy some more.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:55:01
Ok. How long has it been? It would help tremendously if you stated how long ago this transaction was made.
Sometimes, transactions can take seconds to hours.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:02:54
Everyone is too paranoid. Anyone can easily manipulate the earnings they put in blockfolio. They can put any amount they want and only they would know its real or not.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:36:21
Oh he's little alright. ��
But nice purchase!
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:37:07
Charts are working fine for me. Why don't you download Blockfolio? You can not only track the three major coins but other coins as well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:57:44
A quick google search gave me this.

I hope he paid taxes on the gains when he decided to cash out.
