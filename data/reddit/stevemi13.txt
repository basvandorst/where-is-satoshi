Throughout history, currencies have always failed. Current trends indicate that we are moving towards another failure. It is then that people seek an alternative. "Hyperinflation is a macro-economic event that occurs as a result of a steep devaluation of a country's currency that causes its citizens to lose confidence in it. When the currency is perceived as having little or no value, people begin to hoard commodities and goods that have value."

Those currencies have been devalued by overprinting and will be the cause of the economic crisis. AND, people are losing trust in banks and financial institutions due to corruption. As the current system moves forward, the likelihood that your bank is going to take some of your money to remain solvent, which is legal now, increases. If that does happen, who won't be looking for alternatives?

Should you spend BTC on things you want? YES If people would use it, somewhat, now, that usage/adoption would stimulate more interest and a higher price. Unfortunately, the $10,000 pizza story and dreams of riches are keeping people from helping their own cause.

I agree, no way 8% of Americans own crypto, but it was 8% of those surveyed. There were 1000 people surveyed in America, small sample, questionable results, but an indicator nonetheless.

Why do you use the term 'lazy' when 'long term' would be more appropriate for many?

Tell us the scenario when their currency is hyperinflating.  Is not the real question: when will the fiat bubble collapse? That is why BTC is an investment worth holding.

GEEZ  So much negativity recently.  This will pass. How do I KNOW?     By now, you should all be aware of institutional investment expanding the crypto market. If not, watch this short video:     
 But what are people on the street doing?  Here's a high level look at that:     "Despite bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently hovering near their lows for the year, interest in the nascent technology is expected to more than double in the future in the United States and Europe. This is according to a study conducted by ING Bank N.V. in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Australia.
"Per the survey, which was carried by market research firm Ipsos between March 26 and April 6, 2018, only 9% of Europeans owned a cryptocurrency at the time of polling. However, in the future 25% of those surveyed indicated that they expect to own a cryptocurrency. In the United States, 8% at the time owned cryptocurrencies while 21% said they expected to own some in the future."
    
   All indicators point to a still growing cryptocurrency market.  Enjoy the ride! It's like a roller coaster, not a rocket straight to the moon.

"All it takes is one good business model or company to use this technology" - By 'technology' I'll assume that you mean blockchain. By 'business model' I'll assume you're talking about actual usage by businesses and enterprises to cut costs, improve efficiency and increase profits. Yes, this is what will drive the crypto market in the future. Although it's not unimaginable, there is a use case ideal for business adoption. On June 30, the leader in this field will be launching their public blockchain as they switch current customers over from their private blockchain that has been running for two years. I believe that this project is exactly what you are talking about.

For now, maybe. - "But the same features that make Zelle so useful for customers, its speed and ubiquity, have made it irresistible to thieves. Hackers and con artists have used the system to steal from victims — some of whom had never used Zelle or even heard of it until someone used it to clean out their bank accounts." -

But it's been going up AND down for 7 months.  In May were 9K chasing 10K. This could just as easily go up as down. Things have progressed, too, like index funds, ETFs coming, China exchanges seem to be coming back, investments from big players like GS Circle getting in with Poloniex, etc. It's a fickle market, for sure, but it HAS grown behind the scenes, although the price hasn't shown it YET.

Do you have a reason for speculating on the downside?

If you have a crypto that you paid $1 for and the price goes up to $2, the price of your coins at $2 affects the total market cap, but you didn't put in any new money. Crypto caps are based on the last selling price X supply. I can't confirm this, but I read recently that new money means a 20X to market cap. Does anyone have data on this?

Now you did it. You didn't follow the rules!                                               
Rules  
Here are 13 rules to remember when eating fortune cookies:                                                                      
1.) Do not grab the cookie closest to you, but the one furthest away when served by the host or hostess.
6.) After reading the fortune, you must not tell anyone your fortune, and then eat your fortune cookie and put paper on fire for it to come true.

Or, the exchanges are buying a lot of crypto so they don't get screwed on Jan 3 when all of the people participating in Trace Mayer's project will get their coins off of the exchanges.
