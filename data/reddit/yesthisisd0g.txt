8 more hours until Mt. Gox floodgates open.

What did Mt Gox have to say? I'm curious because I'm also waiting for Bitinstant to tranfer my money to my Mt. Gox account.

$160 per coin*

Anyone having trouble withdrawing bitcoins from Coinbase? I have a pending transactions for almost 2 hours already. On the site it says it should be cleared after 1 hour of waiting.

There is still a .4% fee for trading. But if you do a limit orer it becomes .3% instead.

You are not the only one. See [here]( and [here]( for threads created in the last hour.
I am also waiting for my money that I deposited this morning, so I'm a keeping a close eye on whole fiasco.

I just made an account on bitfloor.com.

Happening to me to. I deposited $300 today using moneygram and have yet to see the money in my Mt. Gox account.
However, the $200 I deposited on 3/19 went to my Mt. Gox account instantly after the Moneygram payment went through. I don't know why they're so slow today. I really don't know what make of it.

The scary thing is that the price recovered in 3 hours, not 3 days. Wow.

I also received the "Serious error occurred" but after 24 hours, it seems the problem was solved.

Update to anyone that is reading this today, my order through Bitinstant has gone through.

What exchange would you recommend then?

Same issue also. To check on the status order of your account go to bitinstant.com and look in the top right for check status, it's really small. 
I checked my order and it also showed the same error. Emailed both support and billing. No response yet.

I just got 3.18 coins for $160. Used Bitinstant moneygram; took about 30 mins total to get my Bitcoins. Here's to hoping the price goes back to $270.
