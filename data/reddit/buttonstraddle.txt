high fees in general aren't a good or a bad thing. its a free market. supply and demand. people choose what fees they are willing to pay. 
but heres one reason why someone might consider high fees a good thing: with low/no fees, then it costs nothing to use/abuse the blockchain. then you'd have people using the blockchain as distributed backup storage. might as well upload all those torrentz to the blockchain since its free, amirite?
here's another: when the block reward is over, the miners need a reason to, you know, MINE. if they don't get paid enough, they don't mine, and the whole system fails.
no one likes high fees, but there are legitimate reasons for it. there are smart people on both sides of the debate. you're not one of them. to completely dismiss one side out of ignorance just shows complete disrespect and arrogance

@_date: 2019-07-08 16:35:11
I guess its not as simple as it first seems. 
Buying BTC on the BTC/ALT market just means less BTC supply in the BTC/ALT market. Which depresses the ALT price relative to BTC. Which is what the alt market has been doing this whole year.
But people would move out of alts into btc because alts typically don't trade against USD. So they are wanting the BTC to eventually sell for USD on the BTC/USD market.
Does that make sense? Am I mistaken?

1. Freedom from censorship. Simple example, most credit card processors will not provide you service if you try to start an adult business, or gambling business, or even a CBD oil business. This is censorship. One of bitcoin's features is that no one anywhere can stop you from transacting. The most famous example of this was the Silk Road marketplace years ago where people would buy drugs with bitcoin. Another is freedom from inflation. If your savings are in dollars, then the purchasing power of your dollars decrease over time. This is a hidden tax, some might even say theft, by central banks and governments. See point 
2. You can't. That's the nature of a fixed supply of deflationary currency. It is smarter to hold (save) than to spend. That's why a lot of economists don't think a deflationary currency can work as the main economic currency. On the other hand, an inflationary currency encourages spending rather than saving, because the dollars will be worth less in the future. Saving is the BAD play with inflationary fiat currencies like most countries have. Spending and going into debt is smart. Going into debt is basically going short the dollar. Saving would be going long.
3. The nature of BTC is that transactions are immutable, unchangable, irreversible. These are features, not downsides. That means if a vendor scams you, and keeps your coins and doesn't give you the product in return, you are out of luck. Its also why most people won't sell people BTC in return for paypal USD. Because once the BTC is sent, the buyer can complain to paypal and get the paypal txn reversed, and get their USD back too, and keep the BTC.
As you can see, the use cases for crypto aren't exactly set up to be the next "world currency". But there are other use cases that bitcoin excels at, like answer

With great power comes great responsibility. You want to be your own bank? Then you have more responsibliity.
If you want to be able to reverse transactions when you fuck up, then you don't want bitcoin, so choose something with a third party intermediary that can reverse your txn if necessary.

Consider from the sellers perspective: When using fiat based services, txns can be reversed easily. I'm not sure about Zelle, but what happens if he sends you the BTC, then you contact your bank/Zelle and have the fiat txn reversed? Then he is scammed. 
People don't realize just how different bitcoin is, because in bitcoin, things are irreversible and final. That's what makes it "like cash". You hand over your cash, the txn is over. Its final. There is no one to call to get it reversed. 
This is the same problem if people were to sell you BTC through paypal, or credit card, or whatever other fiat system you use.  BTC is incompatible with these. That's why things are difficult.

@_date: 2019-07-28 13:24:50


Uh what? Please elaborate. Blockchain is what enables the decentralized nature of bitcoin, which is the answer to your question as to why its still relevant.


Bitcoin is not trying to be the payments system of the future. It is trying to eliminate having to trust third parties in order to make payments.
Bitcoin has 3 practical value propositions, all accomplished through decentralization.
1. Freedom from censorship. No third party can stop you from transacting. This is useful for people like Wikileaks, who are censored by governments. It is useful for drug/adult/gambling/cbd businesses who can't get credit card processing. It is useful for people with strict governments who try to limit their citizens from transacting through normal means.
2. Irreversible transactions. This is cash like, in the sense that once you hand over your cash to another person, the transaction is final, you cannot complain to some third party company to get your money back. If you need the safety net of being able to reverse txns, then you wouldn't use bitcoin, you'd use something else.
3. Freedom from inflation. Governments and central banks around the world routinely use their power of printing money to inflate the total supply of money in circulation. This in turn devalues each individual dollar. Under inflation, saving is penalized, and going into debt is rewarded. If your mother has saved $500k for retirement, but by the time it comes for her to retire, that money has been devalued through inflation, and that $500k only has the purchasing power of suppose $200k today, then she is out of luck. Bitcoin has a hard cap on the max total supply, which means no inflation, and it will never be changed unless each participant in the network agrees to change it (which they probably never will). This deflationary property makes bitcoin an excellent store of value. This is my personal use case. And its the use-case of everyone else who says to "HODL" whether they realize it or not.
If you don't care about those use-cases, then you really have no reason to use bitcoin, and should probably look for other solutions to make your transactions. Decentralization comes at a cost, but it also allows us to accomplish things such as the above.
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:41:50
As he said, its not up to devs. If "it will be clear", its because there is a clear direction of the consensus of all network participants, which is extremely hard to judge.

@_date: 2019-07-29 14:40:27

@_date: 2019-07-19 03:27:05
You will have to pay a fee for the exchange rate from cash to bitcoin. That fee amount depends on the exchange or person you buy the bitcoin from. Now you have bitcoin.
Then, to send bitcoin from one person to another, you will have to pay a bitcoin network fee to the miners for them to include your txn into the chain. You choose this fee amount. If you want the txn to happen faster, you might want to try paying a higher fee. However, even low fees sometimes get processed fast. It depends on how much demand there is at the time you want to transact (how many other people are desperate to get their txns confirmed fast).
@_date: 2019-07-22 02:13:44
Samourai has been doing shady stuff for a while now
@_date: 2019-07-01 05:02:45
You don't run a node to "help the network". You run a node to help YOURSELF. If you just spin up a node and let it sit there, it does almost nothing to help the network. But if you actually USE your node to verify your incoming and outgoing txns, then you are helping yourself because you are actually making sure your txns obey the rules that you choose (based on the node software you choose to run). By doing so, you indirectly help the network because the network becomes stronger by +1 person who is educated and decentralized and conscious (you). The "network" is PEOPLE, not machines. You no longer trust any third party such as blockexplorer websites to verify if your txn is in the blockchain. Instead you only trust the software on your machine.

There are two definitions of inflation, one being the rise of prices; in the US the TV stations often use the CPI index to measure inflation. And the other definition being the increase in the total supply of money, which is the definition used by most austrian economists.
Bitcoin has heavy influences from libertarian and austrian principles, and so when people talk about inflation here, we are talking about the increase in the supply of money. Given fractional reserve bank lending practices, negative interest rates do cause inflation by definition. More money is being printed into the economy.
With more total money floating around, prices tend to necessarily rise as a byproduct. Whether you see that in the stock markets, or the real estate markets, doesn't really matter. Prices SOMEWHERE have gone up. In your example, it just means real estate prices have risen due to the extra money printing rather than stock prices.
Inflation, the printing of money, is a bad thing for savers, because the value of their savings goes down. With current fiat money systems of endless rate cuts and QE and whatever other trick, the smart play is to go into debt rather than save, because you can repay the debt with dollars that are worth less in the future.

If its not worthwhile, then miners will drop out and the chain will slow. But the protocol adjusts the difficulty of mining every two weeks, so if miners drop out, the difficulty adjusts downward, making it easier to mine, and hopefully making it worthwhile for miners to come back online.
That, coupled with users choosing to pay higher fees to incentivize miners, is how it should work in theory.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:20:41
Almost no futures traders have any idea how they work. Most are just gambling daytraders.
A futures contract means you enter an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specific price in the future. Example, "I agree to buy 1 btc for $10,000 at Janurary 31st, 2018". You are now bound by this contract. Today the spot price at bitstamp is $11,700. So obviously your contract is a good deal right now, but you can't accept delivery of your bitcoin until the end of January. So you may want to close out your position and take your profits now. So you would sell your contract at whatever the market decides is a fair price, pricing in the potential gains. Most futures contracts never get delivered. Traders simply close out their positions and accept the cash profits/loss from other futures traders.
See the books by John Hull for a thorough examination.

I didn't say it was a bad thing, but its certainly not a good thing. LN is good for users who want low fees and micro transactions. That's obvious, and it needs to be part of our ecosystem asap. But it will remove transactions from the main chain, which will mean more free blockspace onchain, which will lead to lower fees onchain as well.
Regardless of what I think, the person asking the question specifically asked what happens when all new coins are mined and the inflation subsidy is gone. At that time, miners will rely on getting enough fees to pay their bills, if they don't, they won't mine, and the security of the chain goes down. This was one of the arguments against BCH, because their large blocks will encourage endless low fees, which may not be enough to pay the miners to secure the network

regardless if its true or false, its an oversight which is a significant flaw in the protocol which encourages centralization. using a graph structure (ala IOTA) for the blocks, instead of a chain, makes pooling irrelevant. satoshi is not an all seeing god. he could not predict everything. no one can. thats why all modern software is developed with the agile model, of releasing early, releasing often, and iterating as you learn in the real world. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:30:58


As a vote against the system, sure.


That is just poor investing advice. Going into debt is essentially going short the dollar. Saving your fiat is going long the dollar. In this case, savers are making the mistake, not debtors. If you believe rapid money supply inflation will continue (as it has for years whether through normal M3 growth or quantitative easing or whatever else they cook up), then going into debt is the smart move, as long as your investment with the principal can outpace inflation. You are repaying the debt with lower valued dollars in the future.

here are some scenarios
1 "decentalized"? unfortunately the flaw in the bitcoin protocol encourages centralization of the miners into pools, just as it exists today. governments can (and probably will, if they haven't already) attack the miners. without miners, no transactions, or only selected transactions, get processed. 
2 the government declares it illegal and criminalizes it. then people stop using it out of fear. sure bitcoin won't die fully, but that will put a huge weight to overcome

@_date: 2019-11-13 19:27:01
No, I said *you* have no reason to use bitcoin, which is self evident since you still haven't answered why you would use it. Its because you don't have any reasons to.
I, and many others, have good reasons to use bitcoin. We are solving problems today with it. Its working.
You seem to want to break it on us, so that it won't work for what we're using it for, all in the sake of onboarding billions of people who currently don't give a crap about crypto (like yourself)
But here you are making yet another post continuing your arguing..

Your question:


My answer:
There is a point in achieving more decentralization so that at least SOME PEOPLE can use it to attain the benefits that bitcoin provides. Bitcoin is working today, as is, and providing people with benefits and solutions that they wouldn't otherwise have. Trying to achieve more scale before its ready, jeopardizes all of those benefits that we've attained so far, for the existing people who are using it.
Or you'd rather we increase onchain transactions with no limits so that 7 billion people can use it, and then NO ONE can achieve the benefits that bitcoin provides. Because then if we allow so much capacity, then we cannot even trust the 1st layer, because everything will become just as centralized as these layer2s that you are so afraid of.


I'm asking, because this shows that you don't know what those "benefits" are that I mentioned in my previous two paragraphs in this post. So since you don't use crypto yet, a better question to you would be: Why do you want to use crypto? Why would you care to use crypto? Do you just want a fancy app to use when paying for your lunch? Are you just talking about something new for the sake of being new? Or do you have a legitimate reason for why you'd personally choose to use cryptocurrency?

You missed the whole point. It doesn't matter if governments attack the coin, it doesn't matter if miners 51% the coin, none of it matters. The users decide what they want. The users decide where the profit is at, because is the user's DEMAND which creates the profit. The users demand security for a coin, and the miners provide the supply. The miners are free to create supply for a coin that no one wants and that there is no demand for, and those miners will lose money and go out of business.
The ideals of bitcoin have taken hold. No government is going to change people's minds with a propaganda campaign. If miners 51% attack the network, the people will just dump that coin, and change the PoW to a different mathematical function, and render all of those miner machines useless. The people are in power. We will dump the coins and the miners will lose all their investment. And we'll just move onto our next fork. Yes the transition will be difficult and the market price will surely plummet. But the scenario you are describing is pretty much a war on bitcoin, which no one should expect to happen smoothly.

By running your own node, and actually using it to participate in the bitcoin network, is what gives you financial sovereignty. You literally are your own bank. You are saying, "I only accept and trade with money that passes MY rules that I choose, and the rules that I choose are the rules enforced by the software I choose to run" (in this case being Bitcoin Core). So...


If you want to be your own bank, you now have the responsibility that a bank has, which is non-trivial. You have to know these answers yourself. What is important to you? What do you want to pay attention to? Each time an update is announced, it is now up to you to decide if you agree with the update, if the changes are acceptable to you, and if you want to continue to participate with the proposed changes. You certainly have choice here, and you can vote for the old ways by simply staying on older software. As said in the other post, there is no poll, so the vote isn't counted by anyone, but you vote for your preference by telling the world, or your customers, or your trading partners, "Hey I only accept BTC and only accept it if it validates against my node software v0.19"
Now, Bitcoin Core has historically been very conservative, so any new upgrades are very very very likely to be backwards compatible, so upgrading shouldn't be a big deal. Still, at any point in time, a hard forking rules change can be proposed. If you follow bitcoin news then you will likely be aware of this. If you do not, then you might mistakenly upgrade blindly and all of a sudden be validating a new forked chain that has rules that you don't personally agree with.

In theory, mining should continue in order to capture all of the txn fees that users offer to pay for each of their txns.
Whether this will work or not in practice remains to be seen. Obviously it would either require 1. that users pay very large fees, or 2. more txns can fit into each block so that the average fee becomes lower, or 3. the hashrate drops, meaning that the security against rewriting the chain is decreased, requiring less money/fees in order for the miners to operate profitably.
This is a legitimate concern.
Some people like developer Peter Todd have suggested that perhaps adding a tail inflation is better, so that there will always be more coins to be mined. I don't even know the merits of that, but I highly doubt the network would ever approve (reach consensus on) such a change.
More likely is that the blocksize eventually gets raised to allow more txns, which will allow lower avg fees. But that change (blocksize increase) will only likely be approved if governments have given up and legalized bitcoin because they realize they cannot stop it, because full node and mining decentralization has increased sufficiently. Its a long ways out.

If it had such large support, than those 80% of miners and users would be using BCH or BSV right now. Options currently EXIST, right now. People are free to choose if they want big blocks or not, RIGHT NOW.
98% of the miners are signalling support for 1mb blocks right now by mining 1mb blocks. Of course, miners do whatever the users want, since the users are the ones paying their electricity bills. And users are signalling support for BTC over BCH at the rate of 97% on all public marketplaces across the world.
@_date: 2019-11-11 20:37:20


Satoshi answered this in the whitepaper: the chain with the most proof of work, since that's the chain that the USERS prefer. The users vote on this chain by extending it with more PoW.
If users wanted a big block chain, they would be buying that coin, and the market price of that coin would rise, causing miners to move over and mine it, creating more PoW on that fork. Users (the market) currently do not give a fuck about big blocks. Luckily (IMO) the market is smart enough to prefer greater decentralization at the moment.
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:18:01
Once a miner finds a successful hash, that means he can publish the next block to the blockchain. He then CHOOSES from all pending transactions, which transactions to include into his block, and he gets the fees from those txns. He can withhold all transactions if he wants, and publish a block with no transactions if he so chooses. He would be dumb to do that, because he leaves all the txn fees on the table for the next miner who solves the next hash.
If ALL miners were in collusion, they could say to each other: "hey, lets never include any txns from address 1abcdefgh in any blocks. But if that address decides to send a txn and offers a really high fee, any miner at any time could break their spoken agreement just to collect the high fee
If your miners are just connected to a mining pool, and the mining pool pays you out for your work, then when one of the pool members finds the successful hash, it gets sent to the pool operator, and then the pool itself constructs the block and chooses which transactions to include. That's why these large mining pools have a lot of power, and work is being done to change that so that the individual miners themselves can construct the blocks/headers

Right, so some of us DO have problems, and bitcoin IS the 'better' thing that's come along to solve those problems.
I don't disagree with your 4 deterrents, but they are easily countered. If your 'something better' comes along and solves  then bitcoin will surely adopt the same UX solution as well.
\ sounds like bitterness because you missed out (we're all bitter about that), but you'll run into the same thing when your 'something better' is introduced. The early adopters take the most risk that the new thing will catch hold. And with the highest risk comes the highest reward. You have skepticism now even after 10 years of bitcoin, imagine how much skepticism will exist when something new comes out thats only 10 DAYS old.
\ is easily solved by simply rebasing the unit of measurement. People have suggested that in the future, everyone will simply quote prices in [satoshis]( (0.00000001 BTC). You see examples of this in sci-fi movies. In Guardians of the Galaxy guys are doing jobs for "50,000 units". Using today's prices, a $10 item would cost 120,000 satoshis. Other people think that's too small, and prefer [millibit]( (mBTC)
\ you think something brand new that claims to be better won't also have the same perception of being a 'scam'?
So really you are just spreading FUD, maybe unintentionally, because you have no real criticisms other than poor user experience. And you just make the blind claim that bitcoin is no good because "something better will come along". I can literally make that same claim about anything in the world. Google sucks because something better will come along. Ferrari cars suck because something better will come along. Etc etc. In the mean time you just keep waiting and sitting on your thumb. That's ok for you, because you don't have any immediate problems that need solving. Lots of us do, and we're solving them successfully as we speak.

I'm unclear on your word choice of "divergence". Because the narrow halving window is still within the upper and lower bounds of the S/F model, so how is it divergent? Or are you saying that by the 5th halving, the price will have to be divergent because the boundaries temporarily cross on the halving date?
And so if the price next May is not within your next NHW (\~10k-50k?), would you conclude that the S/F model is not applicable to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-16 18:52:04


It may not be your goal, but it is what you're doing. But its because you don't really have any reason to be here in the first place. You are just a skeptic. Nothing wrong with that. Most people in the crypto space would be wise to be more skeptical in general.


So your venmo and bank account isn't secure from thieves and hostile authoritarian entities?
I'm not asking this question as a trivial matter. I'm asking practically. What problems do you need solving?

Its not solely about the technical capabilities of storage and bandwith. Its also about the decentralization of nodes and miners. Do you run a node? Why not? Cue all the excuses about convenience etc. And that's with 1mb blocks. Don't even bother how few people would run nodes with 2/4/8/16/32mb blocks. Its not about needing bigger drives. Its about convincing people to decentralize and actually participate and become a peer in the network, and actually be their own bank and enforce their own rules. Aka, its a social problem, not a technical one. So in the future, when there is more decentralization, THEN we can talk about it.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:23:40


Gotcha that makes sense. And so in Fig 4, you expect the price to keep approaching the NHW at each halving, which is nearer and nearer to the upper boundary, which is moving and trending divergently away from the 1.0 S/F ratio

Nothing's preventing something new from coming along and solving more problems ore solving them better. That's the nature of open markets. As said, there are likely altcoins that could make those claims already. Guess what? The marketplace couldn't care less about those altcoins with better tech.
However, whether that something actually surpasses Bitcoin is another story altogether. Bitcoin is successful because of its community, because of its decentralization, because of its developers, because of its network of users, because of its infrastructure. For your 'new thing' to surpass Bitcoin, in my eyes at least, it would have to tick all of those boxes. Those are social issues. Its so unlikely to happen that its not worth considering. At this point I can only see it happening if something catastrophic were to happen to Bitcoin, and its whole community then migrated to something new out of desperation.
Why would I put some of my net worth into a brand new coin that only has 20 nodes and 10 miners and 6 developers? I don't care what technological marvels it has. That thing can be trivially compromised. You are posing hypotheticals without specifics. What I do care about is my asset not being seized, not being jeopardized by some government or other third party trying to take over the network. I don't care about faster tech or newer tech. I care about security of my asset. That security doesn't come from newer tech. It comes from the mass of people participating in the network.

You are right that BTC is better for a store of value, than for a currency. That's because its deflationary. Why would people spend it like currency when they can ~~hodl~~ save. Its smarter to save deflationary assets. You want to spend away inflationary stuff like dollars.

I suppose you also expect your local pub to rent out 10x the space, and pay 10x the rent, even if the space will be unused for the majority of the year, simply because New Years Eve gets too busy and causes a bottleneck.
Or in the analogy of bitcoin, the extra 10x space will be used for homeless people trying to freeload (aka spam). I don't want people backing up their movie torrentz on the blockchain, which every single node has to bear the burden of storing, simply because now we have more cheap capacity.

I've already acknowledged that 'better' probably ALREADY EXISTS. Someone's already come up with something better. And I don't care. And the marketplace doesn't care so far either. Because 'better' tech is not the problem. In many ways, bitcoin is WORSE, at least when its compared to existing payment solutions (as we've discussed earlier).
Bitcoin has not succeeded so far due to better technology. Distributed peer to peer blockchains, are inherently worse technology than a centralized database hosted in one location by a single entity. Bitcoin, and all cryptocurrencies, are a technological downgrade from visa/paypal/venmo. Its an append only database, that has to be replicated by every single user in the network. Every single node must bear the same burden of hosting the entire database. So why do we use it then?
We use it because it allows us to accomplish the goal of decentralization, with no on in charge, no one to ask permission, no one to unilaterally change the rules. Please give an example of something 'better' that needs to be done. The problems that I need solving do not require better tech. They require more decentralization, which is a social problem. In my eyes, "better" means a better grassroots effort, a better educational effort, a better risk tolerance for users, a better motivational campaign to encourage people to take a stand. Aka, social stuff, not technical. "Better" to me does not mean new programming techniques, faster txns, fancy mining algorithms, etc. That stuff is nice, and would be welcome, but that's not solving the problems I'm trying to solve.

It means nothing what the majority of miners consent to. Sure they too can change the 21 cap and start a new minerChain. So what?
All that matters is what chain the USERS want to follow and what THEIR consensus is. No user will want to use myBtcChain. And probably very few users will follow the new minerChain. Those miners are free to keep mining the new chain that nobody uses. And because the users will still demand security for the original chain, then other miners will fill in to provide that service.

You're using the term "money" without defining it. If you want to define it as "a means of exchange", then you need to state that assumption.


Right, that's what I was talking about.


Who said HODLers care whether bitcoin is a good form of money or means of exchange? I certainly don't care. That's not a problem I have, nor does most anyone have. I prefer to use VISA. As you said, I would rather spend away my money which is decreasing in value, which is fiat dollars. I dont need ANOTHER inflating asset. I already have one. Numerous ones exist. I also want to spend money that offers me protections, where the transactions are reversible if I am defrauded. 
What I DO need is a non-inflating long term store of value to protect my life savings from being eroded away due to central bank inflation. 


No, it does not remain to be seen. Its already been proven over the past 10 years to be the best store of value on the planet. Whether it will *continue* to be that, is what remains to be seen. And you'll place your bet on that hypothesis by either HODLing or not.


Tech is irrelevant in bitcoin. Many other cryptocurrencies can already claim to have better tech. The problems that Bitcoin solves are not technical, they are social. They require people to act. They require people to burden themselves with risk. They require network effect.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, however, yes it is censorship-free, meaning anyone can use it for whatever purpose they want.

You think there are many points of failure, yet you cannot name any, aside from difficult user experience. Venmo is centralized, that's why its so easy to use. It is deadsimple to make something as easy to use as Venmo. But you get no benefits that Bitcoin offers. But Venmo isn't bad, its actually very easy and very good. So use it. We already agreed bitcoin is not great for payments. Are you saying that Venmo has come along and its 'better' in the user experience department, and so Venmo will unseat Bitcoin? What actually are you saying? Because its very vague. Sounds like you just have a inherent disdain but cannot articulate it other than, "something better will come along".
Might as well start from scratch: Why do you want to use cryptocurrency in the first place? What are your goals? What problems do you need solving. You like venmo, then use it. Are you having any problems? Doesn't sound like any. So you have no reason to seek anything different.

I'm not sure that the vote is abstract. Its legitimate. By using your own node to verify your own transactions, you are directly participating in the network, and in effect voting by actually USING the product. Holding USD rather than EUR is a vote for the USD. Using a Bitcoin Core node to ensure that you're using real Bitcoin rules, rather than using Bitcoin ABC or whatever other BCH node there is, is a vote for the Bitcoin network. There is just no poll being taken.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:09:59
Disagree probably. Define what you mean by the word "money". It can be (and is, especially across diff cryptocurrencies) used to mean either a means of exchange used for transactional currency spending, or it could be used to mean a store of value. Bitcoin is better suited for the latter.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:43:00
Yet as the miners pool together more and more, the censorship resistance is compromised. A government can attack these small groups of miners much easier than a true distributed network.

Exactly, bigger blocks make Layer1 just "less decentralized and secure". If you prefer that route, there are plenty of coins now that can accomodate you, so when you're ready to finally use crypto to achieve some goal, you have options that will work for you.
The BTC chain, and the wider market in general, seems to be choosing to prefer to keep Layer1 MORE decentralized and secure, and make Layer2 "less decentralized and secure". Since you seem to be ok with Layer1 being less decentralized and secure on other chains, I'm not sure why you have a problem with Layer2 being that way on BTC. You're happy with billions of people using a less decentralized and secure Layer1, but not happy with billions of people using a less decentralized and secure Layer2. Contradictory.






These are some of the smartest people in the world. Since you are making such claims, dig a little deeper and ask yourself WHY would they want to keep things like that. WHY would they choose to stop the magic of bitcoin from reaching more people. Will you just regurgitate conspiracy theories you've read from others, or can you come up with some real technical answers as to why? And WHY would the market place at large also choose and vote on that direction?


Doesn't make sense TO YOU. And like I said, you don't want to understand it so that it DOES make sense to you. You just wanted to argue against it, which is what you've done with all your subsequent posts, just like I predicted. You had your opinion coming in, you "already knew the answer" and didn't want to try to gain any new understanding, but just rather regurgitate stuff you heard from others.

I didn't say that *BTC's problems* are social. I said the problem with starting a whole new currency is a social problem, not a technical one.


And if something 'better' came along to allow more people to onboard easier, then why wouldn't BTC also adopt that same 'better' technique/strategy? It would, and its existing network effect would make it more likely to stay in front. New social strategies are easy to adopt. Its actually the new technical stuff that's harder to adopt, because that requires every individual participant to in the network to first agree to the change and then upgrade their software to get on the new fork,.

Yes true, but eventually it will repeat, the GPU miners then pool together again because they are incentivized to do so: the cost of mining a rejected and orphaned block is large, so you want as little latency as possible. Satoshi probably overlooked this. After all, his original release had the node and miner as part of the same software, so his intent was correct.

You've given no explanation for "transaction censorship, restriction, and manipulation"
In fact, you contradicted yourself by using the incentive for "high fees". If miners want as much fees as possible, then they would accept as many transactions as possible. They wouldn't censor txns with low fees because the blockspace would otherwise go unused. They might as well collect some fees rather than none

I agree with the above poster. The video started out as a great primer for the masses. Once you started going into the hash function stuff, it got super technical without a proper segway.
You went into the hash topic because you said each node had to check whether the ledger contained valid transactions. But I don't think that was a good transition.
The purpose of the hash function and mining and all of that is to solve the double spend problem. You should mention that as the segway: 
"The problem with attempts at digital currencies in the past was that the ledger is digital. Its just a text file. Anyone can just write whatever they want, duplicate their balances, etc. Like copying a picture of an apple on your computer. Copy the file and now you have two apples. With a centralized authority like a bank, you trust that they will have the correct balances. But bitcoin has no central authority, so how do we trust that no one is sharing falsified balances and crediting themselves with whatever they want?"
"Bitcoin is revolutionary compared to previous attempts at electronic cash in that it has successfully solved this problem with the blockchain. Proof of work, mining, hash functions, etc." 
You probably don't need to go as deep into these technical details.

Cash under the mattress is saving. All those other things you listed are not saving, they are spending/investing.


It doesn't necessarily make the USD bad, you've made decent arguments in favor of inflation.
But the question is, good for what? Bad for what? You can't just generalize good and bad. It makes the USD bad for saving. It makes the USD good for spending and growing the economy. It makes BTC good for saving and storing wealth. It makes BTC bad for spending and transacting. 


Mostly, yes. We're not *hoping* for inflation of the USD. We're *expecting* it and therefore using BTC as a hedge. And regardless, even if USD doesn't inflate (which is nearly impossible), BTC is inherently deflationary since user error will result in some coins becoming unretrievable anyway, which would lead to price rises.

No, in that example, there were only 10 txns, each paying 1 BTC fee. There is no other backlog. Of course if there were other txns, your marginal cost argument applies, and duh miners would include the extra txns.
I was just giving an example where the whole thing works just fine without blocks being full, as long as there are enough fees. 10 BTC in fees is enough for miners to keep mining, whether that 10 BTC in fees comes from 10 txns, 100 txns, or 1000 txns. If you can keep getting 10 txns each paying 1 BTC in fees every 10 minutes, the network keeps working perfectly, and with 99% empty blocks. Of course, to get to that hypothetical of 10 txns paying 1 BTC each, the chain probably would have had to drop popularity immensely, for only 10 users to be around, and also had dropped hashrate immensely, for those users to voluntarily bid up a 1 BTC fee to encourage a miner to solve the next block.
But this was the example I had realized recently about unfull blocks. It will be the same on BCH and BSV. With unlmited blocksize, their blocks will never be full. But if users don't voluntarily bid higher fees, then miners will start dropping off. So their whole premise of 'low fees forever' is a sham, unless they really can get millions and millions of txns in a constant backlog.


I don't really see it as charity. Its that we as users have to pay the miners for their work. If we see hashrate dropping, we'd have to raise our fees collectively in order to purchase more PoW from them. I guess you could say that my fee pays for more security for the prior txns in the chain, since I'm paying for more security on top on their txn. Maybe that does have a charitable component. And sure, if 10 guys are offering 1 BTC fee, and I'm offering 0.0001 BTC, then those other guys are subsidizing me, if we both get included in a block.
Peter Todd is already tossing around the idea of adding in a permanent inflation. The whole reason for all this discussion is to avoid that, and figure out if this is sustainable on fees alone. I would be surprised if the bitcoin network ever came to a consensus to uncap the 21m max coin cap. But in the face of survival vs complete failure, I guess anything could happen.


Right, exactly correct. So when does it become "not worth it anymore" to bid a higher fee? That's what I was getting at with the question of brainstorming what a fee should be, IF we could somehow design for it (which we can't). But knowing in our mind in advance what a bitcoin transaction is worth to us, can possibly help us guide some decisions.


Yep, a lot of moving parts in that calculation. I hadn't even gone that deep to try to formulate it, but you've pretty much captured it.


Right so that was what I was getting at. I agree with all your points about the laws of nature. My conclusion is simply that blocks don't technically need to be full, but we do need constant fee backlog, whether that be from full or non full blocks. Now, I'm pro BTC, and support small blocks. I want to ensure the sovereignty of the network, and the decentralization of validation. So I want the chain to remain small so that we can accomplish that. However, if the network matures enough, basically where our decentralization is wide enough that we can withstand threats, at that point then it might make sense to increase capacity, to allow some of those other unlimited demands for perpetual storage. Because those other non-ecash demands will help us lower our avg txn fees to offer miners. Ultimately bitcoin is deflationary, which discourages spending (usage), and promotes hodling/saving. So there is a natural force in the system against transacting.

@_date: 2019-08-24 16:08:04
Not false. You must not have read my posts carefully enough:
You conclude blocks must be full. That is false. You'll see proof below in  All that is required is txn fees to be high enough for miners to continue to produce work. Period. Whether those txn fees come from small blocks or large blocks is irrelevant. Those fees can come from a large volume of low fees (BCH), or a smaller volume of higher fees (BTC). But both of those don't require a specific blocksize; the opposite scenarios can also occur: (1) you can have small volume of high fees with empty big blocks. And (2) you can have a large volume of low fees with full small blocks too.
(1) Even if blocksize isn't near being full, users can still VOLUNTARILY all pay very high fees, which means miners would have no reason to stop, and hashrate could still continue. You only have to look at the extreme example. 10 whales create a txn each, offering a ridiculous high fee of 1 full BTC for their txn. Now a miner can collect 10 BTC in fees with only 10 txns. That block of 10 txns will be nowhere near full, but you can bet your ass all miners will try to mine to capture that.  In fact, users may HAVE TO do just that, voluntarily raise their fees, even without any competition for blockspace on unlimited size chains like BSV, just in order for miners to mine.
(2) Similarly, you can have full blocks all you want, but if every txn in the mempool is only offering 1 sat/byte, miners still don't need to keep mining full blocks if all of those 1 sat/byte don't add up to enough reward to pay their electricity. If you have 1mil txn backlog, sure blocks will be "full", but if all of those 1mil txns are only offering 1 sat/byte, miners would still not mine, then hashrate drops, etc.
I support small blocks for the decentralization of validating and auditing the network. But I haven't seen a "good" solution yet to the miner reward problem once the inflation subsidy stops. The tradeoff is arbitrary. Do we just have to decide what fee we are shooting for for an on-chain txn and then design the network that way? But since fees are deominated in BTC, then the fee "value" will shift depending on the BTC/USD market price, since electricity isn't being paid in BTC units but rather the local fiat unit. We'd need to calculate the avg price to mine a block at a given hashrate and add in some profit for miners on top.
If we're ok with $100 fees for an onchain txn, then maybe we're fine as is. If we want lower fees, that's why I said maybe we SHOULD allow non-ecash usage of the chain, in order to have more volume of fees available for miners to be incentivized to keep extending the chain. Of course, we'd need to raise capacity to do that, and so that would only be practical imo once we ensured the decentralization of validating nodes.
Full blocks means we need a TRANSACTION backlog. That is false. We need a FEE backlog.

@_date: 2019-08-26 12:47:31
Yes of course you're right about chains not completely stopping, because difficulty can adjust down.
I still don't think that you're understanding my point though. Its something I just realized recently, so perhaps I'm doing a bad job explaining it. I will try to use hard numbers, that might be easier. I appreciate your engagement because it allows me to crystallize my thoughts better.
I'm not saying that a fee market doesn't exist currently, or that its bad, or anything like that. Obviously if you want your txn included faster today, you offer a higher fee, and you'll get priority. And thats a good way to incentivize mining. What I am saying is that today's fee market only exists because right now we can easily count on blocks to keep coming, because the block reward subsidy makes it so. And so we are pretty much guaranteed that our txns will be included eventually, and guaranteed a certain level of mining security.
I'm saying in the future, where we don't have that guarantee because the subsidy has ended, then the "fee market" dynamics might not be "users competing for space and speed with each other", but rather a different market with different market dynamics, that of "the collection of users bidding to find the fair market price for a block reward to a miner".
The hard example I gave earlier in the thread is one extreme hypothetical to illustrate the point. If we had 10 txns each paying 1 BTC fee each, then miners would capture a 10 BTC fee reward for the next block. If this continued to happen every 10 minutes, miners would certainly keep mining these txns and blocks will be 99% empty. So blocks don't need to be full for things to work, as long as fees are high enough. Those 10 BTC in fees should be plenty for a miner to want to mine. Well actually that also depends on the BTCUSD market price. If market price is 50 cents a coin then maybe 10 BTC is not enough :) But its a very simple example where blocks don't need to be full, as long as there are enough fees.
But you don't have to use those extreme numbers either. You can take something like 500 txns \* $100 avg fee each = $50k block reward. If 500 people are willing to pay $100 fee every 10 minutes, miners will keep mining with blocks only \~20% full (assuming BTC block avg 2500 txns). Now, if that reward of 10 BTC or $50k or whatever is unfairly overpaying miners, then those 10 users or 500 users will reduce their fees, until fair market is found that will still incentivize mining to happen. And that market would be existing with nowhere near full blocks.
Those examples start from the case of overpaying fees, and the market pressures causing the users to reduce their fees. More realistically users will first attempt to underpay with lower fees, and have to adjust higher. If we are only getting 10 txns or 500 txns, like in those examples, the chain can still work fine as long as those 10 or 500 keep bidding higher fees until its enough for the miners to pay their bills. The fair market might be reached well before they have to each offer 1 BTC or $100 in fees
Lets take BCH/BSV whoever wants unlimited blocksize, so blocks will never be full. Suppose they are getting 100k txns every 10 minutes. And since they have unlimited space, there is no competition, so every txn just offers $0.01 fee. That means there is only a total of $1,000 in fees for the miners from those 100k txns. If that $1,000 isn't enough to pay their bills, they stop mining. Difficulty drops etc. Eventually the chain will continue when either more fees come in, or the difficulty is so low that $1,000 is sufficient to solve a block. However, as you note, we don't know the required security needed. So we can't afford to let difficulty drop off a cliff. So here's a case where even with unlimited blockspace, aka blocks never full, users would have to voluntarily raise their fees, in order to pay the miners to incentivize them to continue mining and continue providing security. We don't know whether miners require $1,000 or $2,000 or $50,000 in fees to solve a PoW, but they will need a certain amount on average for the level of security we desire. Another case of blocks not being full, but things can work as long as enough people raise their fees until miners are happy with what they're being paid. So BCH/BSV are deluding themselves if they think they can always have micro fees. They can't, unless they really do magically get a boatload of txns. If they don't get a boatload of txns, then they either live with low difficulty/security, or users voluntarily pay higher fees.
If we take the same 100k mempool, but apply it to the BTC chain, now we can only fit 3k of those in a block, and at $0.01 fee each, that's a mere $30 in fees for the miners. Which means miners certainly won't mine. Again users will have to voluntarily raise their fees. Here, the blocks would be full with a big backlog. So the fee market will exist here too, with blocks full, just as in prev examples, with blocks empty.  Also in this case, just like the last, the fee market pressures/forces/dynamics aren't solely coming from a market for speed and competition of users against users, but rather users trying to find a fair price to simply to encourage miners to keep mining at all. And so I agree with all of this:


I think we should start brainstorming what our desired fee level should be, for an avg onchain txn. Because if we work backward from there, then that will influence the variables that we CAN control, like max txns per block (blocksize). We won't be able to come up with an working answer, because the other variables we can't control will be BTCUSD market price, and electricity market price. But, just for kicks, suppose you could design the system with a desired txn fee in mind. What do you think that fee should be on avg?
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:55:03


The unresolved issue as I see it, is that as the block reward subsidy decreases, miners become more reliant on onchain fees. This requires adoption. Blocksize is tangent, because a large blocksize that is empty will still require whatever users it does have to pay the same high fees, otherwise miners don't mine.
So yes, while the "demand for replicated storage is unlimited", perhaps we may have to tolerate some non-ecash use cases simply in order to get enough fees, for when the blockreward diminishes. Thankfully this is a far way out, but its also dependent upon market price

Indeed I do know what the words mean. You haven't explained the incentive that miners have to game the system in those ways.


There is no incentive for them to do this that is inherent in the system. But if a reasonable fee is attached, the txn should be processed as long as other miners exist besides the nefarious one.


Yes some miners have done this in the past, only processing txns with fees above 5 sat/b i believe. So what? Again, as long as there is enough decentralization of miners, this isn't a huge problem yet.


I don't follow this one.
Regardless, there is a huge incentive for miners to NOT act in these ways. And that incentive is so that end users don't get fed up with their antics and fork the coin or change the PoW. Then all of their investment goes to waste. Miners don't run the show. They provide a service.

I don't know if you would even have legal recourse if a txn was included in an orphaned block. I haven't thought about it enough. I guess the txn would still be cryptographically signed by the buyer. But he could claim he made a typo maybe.
I also don't know if there are statistics on how often blocks get orphaned off the chain. If you trust this page, it seems it doesn't happen too frequently:


Well, we trust that the majority of hashpower is honest. That's why decentralization of mining is so important. Consider, if a single government controlled the majority of miners, then at any point they could reorg the chain. The byzantine generals problem isn't TRULY solved with bitcoins proof of work, its only solved "probablistically". That is, we assume that it is sufficiently hard, but not impossible, for the chain to be reorganized and rewritten. Still, we can wait extra time for more blocks/confirmations to be build on top, which brings us increased safety.
However, users aren't without power here. If users got suspicious of this, we could 'vote' to change the hashing function, which would invalidate all existing miners. But to do so, we'd need to change the rules of the network via hardfork, and upgrade all of our nodes. It would be a monumental shift.

There is inflation in bitcoin temporarily to encourage onboarding of users. The money supply is capped and will never exceed 21m coins. At which point the supply will be deflationary due to user error.
If you prefer gold etf to store your value, then you are free to use that.
Perhaps the creator intended that, perhaps not. If so, he's a good engineer and a bad economist. The creator also included a pretty telling message in the genesis block about the bailout of banksters. 
Regardless, people are free to use bitcoin to solve whatever problems they are having. Hardly anyone is having any problems using money normally to buy coffees. The only people having problems are those that are being censored such as those in industries like drugs/gambling/adult websites. I have no problems using visa for payments, in fact, I prefer using it over crypto, because 1. crypto payments are irrevesible, which is bad for spenders, which visa has all types of consumer protections via chargebacks and 2. i'd rather spend away my inflating fiat, than my deflating btc.

Its important to note, full nodes can verify whatever rules they want. Which means, they can accept "different" blocks if they so choose. This is the beauty of p2p. Each individual node has a say in what rules they follow. When enough individual nodes all agree, then you have a network.
So, if miners created bad/bogus/different blocks, and some nodes started accepting those blocks as valid, then the network has forked. Consider if only Coinbase and blockchain.info were the only two nodes and all bitcoin participants used those two websites to see when a transaction cleared. Then, miners only have to collude (buy out) those two nodes, and now everyone would be using a bitcoin with whatever new rules the miners wanted.
This is why it is important to not only run your own node, but actually use it to enforce your transactions. Since you make your own rules, this is what allows you to in fact be your own bank. But, with that power, you also have to take the responsibility to understand what rules your node is following, and why you may want those rules.

Yes, if it ever becomes too expensive to mine, then miners will stop, and the blockchain will stop. At that point, it will be up to the users to pay more fees to convince the miners to turn back on their machines. 
The network also has an automatic difficulty adjustment every approx 2 weeks. So if miners aren't mining, then the difficulty will drop, which will make it easier to mine again, which means some miners might again be profitable and re-start

So all you're arguing in favor of is an inflationary currency. This has been talked about by economists for a long time, you are not saying anything new. Yes, an inflationary currency is better for spending and stimulating the economy, and encouraging investment. Duh, that's because with inflation you expect your value to decrease, so its best to get rid of your currency asap. Inflation penalizes savers, and rewards spenders and debtors.
Deflationary assets are inherently bad for spending, because why the hell would I spend away my currency when I can expect its value to increase in the future. Deflationary assets reward ~~hodling~~ saving.
Which is why Bitcoin will naturally fall into the store of value use case, as a hedge against inflation of fiat currencies. Bitcoin will likely not replace fiat. Most of the people still thinking that, and hoping for worldwide mass adoption are the BCH big blockers who want to spend their coins on morning coffee.

I figured those were your thoughts based on all your questions about lightning network. But I just wanted to first find out what your personal use case is. Because it matters: likely your use-case is the same as someone else's.
My use case is also the same as yours: to store my funds. I'm not concerned about the banks running away with my money. But I am concerned with central banks using inflation to make my funds have lower purchasing power in the future. So in this case, I'm using bitcoin as a medium for savings, like a sort of digital gold.
So you sort of need to ask, why do I want to use this new crypto currency stuff in the first place? What's wrong with my existing solutions, whether that be banks and gold for storage, or creditcards for payments? What are the exact issues you are facing that is causing you to change? Most people aren't having many issues, which is why its hard to convince most people to try cryptocurrency.
As I see it there are only a few good use cases to use cryptocurrency and decentralization: 1. irreversible transactions, 2. freedom from censorship, and 3. freedom from inflation.  is what I talked about above, which is the store of value / gold use case.  is bad for payments because customers want to be able to get their money back if they were scammed.  is a good use-case for gray market stuff like drugs, gambling, government leaks, adult websites.

2777 txns with total fees of $2,600, means avg fee of $0.94. That's unsustainable long term.
That only works currently because of the inflation subsidy. Fees will need to be much higher as time goes on, or capacity will need to increase. If not, the PoW security will drop, making us at higher risk of 51% attack, which in turn will make us more reliant on waiting for extra block confirmations before we can feel safe with our txn.
This is still the experimental stage

Now, I take a much more practical approach. Exactly what am I using it for? What are others using it for, specifically? Why would they want to use it over something else like creditcards or paypal? Most of the Bcashers see worldwide payments and so that defines their whole perspective. My view has shifted, and I'm more about the store of value/ digital gold use case. And since then I understand some of the technicalities surrounding it more too.

We're not the business though. And he's not the customer. 
Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank. Imagine opening up a bank down the street with absolutely no knowledge of anything. How do you think that would go for him? With great power comes great responsibility. You want to be your own bank, you have A LOT of responsibility.

Yeah and so when I approach it with that mindset, it unties all the knots for me, so to speak. I don't really see BTC as a worldwide payment system. Maybe that can work with lightning network, I don't know, but I don't really care. What I do care about is that my value and funds are stored safely and securely, and that I expect my savings to increase in value (BTC/USD market price should rise). Other people look at that as if its just a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:31:44
Maybe, maybe not. Right now fees are proportional to the size of the txn in terms of diskspace, not size of BTC value.

Duh, of course with inflation, people lose their power. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about using an asset as a form of currency. If the asset is deflationary, people are less reluctant to spend it. Why the hell would I buy my coffee or my VPN service or my new keyboard with bitcoin? I'd be foolish to do so. Because bitcoin is deflationary, and I expect its value to increase over time. So I'd rather ~~hodl~~ save. Deflationary currencies REWARD SAVERS. For those purchases, I'd rather spend away my fiat, because I know its value is inflating away as we speak, so I want to spend it as fast as possible.

No, relying on the majority of miners being honest is not the "trap of absolute security". Rather, its the basis for how the entire PoW consensus works. And without relying on that, we literally have nothing, and the whole protocol fails. That's what I meant when i asked "what do we have?" It's mentioned a few times in the whitepaper that everything works "as long as a majority of nodes are honest"
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:22:32
I was just responding to your quoted portion about "other network impacts".
A fee market will exist regardless of blocksize. Even if blocks are super super large, and not even close to full say 10%, then those txns that only fill 10% of blcoks will still need to voluntarily pay enough fees, otherwise the miners simply won't mine. Miners will look at the mempool, see if they are enough fees to pay their bills, and then decide whether or not to mine. In this case, you won't be bidding higher fees in competition with other users, but rather bidding higher fees in order to incentivize miners to continue mining at all.
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:13:13
I want bitcoin to continue to be exactly what it is today. And if other people see the same value that it is providing today, they are welcome to jump on board.
I do not care if the mass population is buying coffees with bitcoin. If I want to buy things, I'd rather spend away my fiat, which will decrease in value, rather than spend my crypto, which will increase in value. And any smart person would come to the same conclusion. But if you don't come to that conclusion, then I'll happily accept bitcoin in my business, like I did yesterday, and just stack sats myself

And you should if you think its a risk. For years, the suggestion was to wait for 6 confirmations. You could go by the metric of how much % of hashpool each mining pool has. Something like this:

But some mining pools are really run by the same people, so they could have the combined hashpower of multiple pools. 
You could also monitor whether blocks are getting orphaned regularly.

What the hell are you talking about. I think you've misread yet again. I'm not changing anything. I didn't design the system. We're talking in the case when in block reward ends and there is no more inflation subsidy to reward miners. There are infinite scenarios that can take place depending on the types txns and fees in the mempool. I just gave 2 examples.


Nice rebuttal.


Because Roger Ver is a fucking clown idiot. Why are you asking me about his shitcoin design decisions. I'm saying that those bcash idiots will have to voluntarily raise their fees just as you describe below, even if they are nowhere near filling their blocks:


This is similar to what I said. If users DON'T start raising their fees as you described, then the chain stops because miners don't mine. So here's a case where blocks could easily be filled with a huge 1m txn backlog, but they won't because fees aren't sufficient, and therefore your dropping hashrate problem with arise.
And that same 'healthy pressure' to raise their fee bids will exist even if blocks aren't full. You aren't getting my point, so just relax and reread. If blocks are only 10% full, people will THINK they have no pressure and only offer low fees. But soon they might see that their blocks aren't being mined, because there is not enough fees to pay the miners. So even those 10% of people will need to start bidding higher fees just the same! To encourage miners to turn on their machines






You are right, and I was wrong when I oversimplified it and said we only need a fee backlog. We can use the same example with 1m txns each offering the absolute minimum fee. In this case, we have both a transaction backlog and a fee backlog, but its still not good enough for miners. Because they can only fit a small subset of that txn backlog into one block, and therefore they won't have enough fees.

And it will be irrelevant because if its not as decentralized as bitcoin, then it can be shut down easier. The whole point of crypto currencies is that it allows decentralization, which is what provides us the freedoms that we achieve. Better technology does not provide us those freedoms. People acting and decentralizing do. 
You could say better coins already exist. So what? The market rightly doesn't care. And the same if a better coin is created. All that matters is how much decentralization there is. Which means how many people are sharing the risk across the network. A new coin would have to outpace bitcoin's community. Decentralization is a social problem, not a technical one.

No one has to raise any alarm. The whole point of a 51% attack is that you can't know whether its an attack or whether its genuine, because all blocks are still valid on both forks.
The suggestion to wait longer for more confirmations keeps you safe. Because then you end up on the longest chain with the most PoW.

Deflationary assets are not good forms for transactional currency. Its simple logic. People would rather save/hoard/hodl than spend, because they can expect the value of their asset to increase over time.
Inflationary assets are better forms for transactional currency, because they encourage spending. People would rather get rid of their currency asap, because they expect it to devalue over time.
Economists have known this for a long time. So narratives are irrelevant. Bitcoin is not ideal for payments. Its better as a store of value. That doesn't mean it can't be used as a payments currency, and I accept it in my business today and will continue to do so.
I believe in bitcoin long term as a hedge against fiat currencies and the inflation tax that governments and central banks levy on their citizens. And bitcoin is a safe haven from that. We finally have something that we can protect the value of our life savings from being inflated away.

What you're describing is called trading. Its the same if you were trading stocks. You sign up for an account that lets you access an exchange. Coinbase is one bitcoin exchange. Just like using etrade or tdameritrade would let you access the NYSE or NASDAQ stock exchanges. Then you put money into your account. Then buy your stocks or bitcoin, and they are transferred to your account. Then you sell when you want to, and get money back into your account.
None of this is specific to bitcoin. This is typical exchange trading in all markets.
With bitcoin however, there is very little regulation, and so there is history of bitcoin exchanges getting "hacked" and the company claiming there is nothing they can do, and then you lose all of your bitcoin that is stored on the exchange. If you care about this risk, then you will have to learn some about bitcoin, rather than just learning about trading. Seasoned bitcoiners will buy their coins on an exchange, and withdraw the coins into their own personal wallet that they control, and they will protect their encryption keys at all costs. And then if they want to sell, then they will deposit their bitcoins back onto the exchange by sending it out from their own personal wallet.

Hash rate follows price. As price rises, it becomes more profitable to mine, and so new miners come on board. Each reward halving disrupts this, and it remains to be seen what will happen when rewards are low and miners depend upon fees.

The part in first link that is relevant to our discussion says:


This does put the power back in the users hands, but since its a hardfork, it would be very difficult to coordinate. It wouldn't be a simple "avoid the blocks of the colluders". You'd have to get the entire ecosystem to fork off. It would be a momumental shift in the network.
The core option you quote from your second link is actually true. I guess you could run that option and then you'd be right, you'd just "avoid the blocks of the colluders". But you would only do that IF you somehow knew that you were being colluded against. As you mention, this breaks nakamoto consensus, and if you did think, you'd pretty much be conceding that Bitcoin's PoW does not solve the problem's it claims to, that is, solving the problem of distributed consensus. The whole reason bitcoin works is because we safely assume that the majority of hashpower is honest, and therefore we trust that the longest chain is good. If all of a sudden we start thinking that the longest chain isn't good, then what do we have?

The capacity in terms of transactions per second on Bitcoin isn't large enough to accomodate all of the entire world's daily spending. This isn't fear unfounded, its just a fact of the current capacity of the network. Altcoiners think this will be bad for BTC market price. They think that, because they think the goal of crypto currency is replacing credit cards for every day purchases. If that's your goal, if that's what you envision, then of course you will come to the conclusion that BTC is no good.
Its impossible to know whether those fears are unfounded in terms of  BTC market price. You'd have to guess what the broader market thinks about that opinion.
So far, the market doesn't seem to care. IMO that's appropriate. IMO, Bitcoin isn't trying to replace credit cards for daily micro purchases. Bitcoin has very specific use-cases. Buying coffee isn't one of them. That's why when you try to explain Bitcoin to your grandmother and tell her to use bitcoin to buy her coffee, you get a blank stare. She has no reason to do that.

It doesn't even matter if something better comes along. Some altcoins could already claim that they are 'better'. What they don't realize is that, in cryptocurrency, 'better' is not based on what super technology is used, but based on 1. the amount of hash power, which protects against 51% reorg and double spend attacks, and 2. the amount of decentralization, which protects against attackers taking over and changing the rules of the network

I don't know what point youre trying to make. If you obtained $1000 worth of bitcoin, why would you ever then spend it? Bitcoin is deflationary, so it rewards you for saving instead of spending, since its value will tend to rise. If you obtained $1000 of USD, you do better by spending it immediately, because as the chart in this OP shows, its value will tend to decline.

Are the vast majority of people currently having problems buying coffees right now? I'll answer that for you: No. Therefore there is no problem that needs to be solved in that area. 
The problems that are being solved currently, and that will continue to be solved, is that of people's life savings being eroded and their purchasing power dwindling over time due to central bank monetary inflation. And so decentralization is hugely important if we want to protect ourselves from being shut down by governments and centralbanks.

Ok then. Now we have something concrete to discuss. That's what I was asking. And how I would respond is, Bitcoin's day to day utility has nothing to do with its market prices on an exchange. So, you think of "organic" in terms of "organic growth". Market prices are not reflective of organic "growth". When I'm talking about "organic", I'm talking about organic trading activity.
If you want to measure bitcoin's organic growth, you shouldn't be looking at the prices on exchanges. You should use whatever method of "growth" youre concerned with. If that's bitcoin being a payment method, then go look around and collect data about how many businesses are accepting bitcoin, and how many customers are paying with it, and check those stats daily. I think that a payment method isn't bitcoin's primary value proposition, so I personally don't care about those things. I do accept bitcoin in my business and will continue to do so. But even if the number of businesses DOUBLED tomorrow which accept bitcoin, that doesn't mean that bitcoin's market price should double. Market prices are completely different. You seem to correlate market price as meaning that bitcoin's growth among the population is rising or falling. IMO, you might want to change that perspective. The stock price of Apple or Facebook doesn't go up or down simply because more people are using their products.
But trading activity IS utility in another sense, that is, bitcoin taking hold as a store of value. Markets exist to facilitate trade, for the purpose of price discovery. Speculation is people determining how much they value bitcoin for the use-case of storing their wealth. That IS some type of utility. But if you think Bitcoin should be used as a payment method, then yes, you would disagree that market speculation is worthwhile.


I think you misunderstood what he meant. Well, of course I can't claim to know for sure what he meant. My interpretation is that he wanted to "tame" bitcoin in the sense that, he thought the futures market would make it LESS LIKELY to have the huge swings up and down. Because by adding more liquidity to the markets, by opening bitcoin up to more market participants, then you would have more money involved, making such drastic up and down swings a little less likely. So the swings would be more 'tame'. That was my interpretation.

Sure, your example is good. I don't disagree with it. But I don't see how its in disagreement with what I said either.
You just gave a reason why bitcoin is better than gold. Because bitcoin can ALSO be used as a payment method. So bitcoin has advantages when it comes to a store of value over gold/real estate/etc.
Read the OP post again. I responded about REPLACING FIAT. Just because you can sell some bitcoin to pay some bills at some point, does not make bitcoin a fiat replacement and world currency.
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:30:43
I agree. But its more simple than that: you either have inflation of the supply of the asset, or you have deflation.
Bitcoin is deflationary. The supply is capped, and due to technical error, people lose coins and they are forever removed from circulation. This would tend to make it more valuable over time, so you wouldn't want to spend it as a currency. You'd prefer to save it if possible. Deflation DISCOURAGES usage.
Fiat dollars are inflationary. The central bank prints more money at will, in order to stimulate the economy. Inflation ENCOURAGES spending, since you expect the value of the dollars to decrease over time, so you'd rather get rid of it as soon as possible, when its purchasing power is the highest. Inflation discourages saving.
If Satoshi wanted to create a currency for a means of exchange, he contradicted himself by capping the supply of coins leading to a deflationary supply. Thankfully, the majority of spending is better suited for things like Visa anyway, which have consumer protections. Crypto txns are irreversible, which is bad for consumers. I'd much rather use Visa which can protect me against fraud from merchants who try to scam me. I'd also much rather spend away my fiat dollars which are devaluing daily. Satoshi also has lots of writings about central bank inflation, as well as his note in the genesis block, so clearly store of value was a priority for him as well. Regardless, I'll use bitcoin for what its good at, which is store of value.

I want to point out:


There are two ways to use the words inflation/deflation. 1. The rising or falling of prices, and 2. the way Austrian economics use it, which is the expanding or contracting of the money supply. Most business TV shows and government stats use the first. Typically most people in crypto space use the second definition.
In which case, the line I quoted from you wouldn't exactly be correct. Deflation isn't the *result* of a contracting money supply. Deflation *is* the contracting of the money supply. And the *result* is usually lower prices since the value of the currency goes up.
I'm guessing you're using the first definition. But when I re-read your post, I'm still missing your point. The house that went from 22k to 250k was due to inflation. The expansion of the money supply. Extra dollars in circulation chasing the same houses, causing everyone to be able to bid up the prices of houses even higher. If your parents had instead saved that 22k, which back then could've bought a house, today it can only buy 1/10th a house. I don't know why you label that as "artificial".
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:12:14
The protocol already handles that risk:  the mining difficulty can automatically adjust downward, and then mining can become profitable again. 
What is a real risk is whether or not fees alone can sustain mining activity in the future years when the block reward halves so low to be negligible.
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:25:39
We shouldn't use something that merely has "better technology", unless it aligns with our goals. Bitcoin's goal isn't to run the entire world's economy, so any "better tech" for scaling to that purpose is irrelevant. Bitcoin's goal is freedom, and so we need to adopt things that allow us to decentralize better. If worldwide economy scaling comes, so be it, but that's not the intention.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:33:52
No, it doesn't mean your txns get confirmed quicker. That depends on the congestion of the network and the fee you offer.
What it does mean is that you only have to trust your own software, your own node, that your txns have processed and that you've truly sent and received the bitcoins. You don't have to trust that some website block explorer is telling you the truth.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:01:28
True. But that's the nature of a deflationary asset. It inherently discourages spending (usage), and encourages saving (hodling). Because you expect the money supply to decrease, and therefore you expect your money to increase in value.
Inflation results in the opposite. That's why central banks print more money: to stimulate the economy (stimulate spending). You would rather spend your fiat dollars becuase you expect them to drop in value.
Many economists argue that a deflationary currency can not really work in the real world. They may be right. Bitcoin doesn't necessarily need to be a currency. It works fine as a Store of Value, like a digital gold. And that is a real problem that people are solving with it today as we speak. The problem is our life savings being eroded by fiat inflation. Bitcoin solves that by allowing us to store the value of our savings. Hardly anyone has any problems buying coffees, so that's not really a problem that needs to be solved.

I understand, and that's great that you want to help the network. But consider, if the node doesn't actually get used, then it doesn't help all that much. Yes, you will help relay things to other nodes, and use up bandwith resources. But the gain to the network is negligible. Of course, if you are also mining with your node, then you will be contributing more.
The network really becomes stronger when you actually USE your node whenever you need to check a txn. That means you no longer use some block explorer website. Etc. When someone says "hey look at this whale txn he just moved 10k btc". If you care about that txn for some reason, you'll look at your node to confirm whether that txn really happened. You don't just blindly trust some block explorer website. That means that you only trust your own software for everything. Now, you, as a participant IN the network, have made the network stronger by +1 person.

Well over time, the mining reward halves every 4 years, and so even if the market price of the coin rises, the reward will go down, eventually to zero, at that which point miners will be relying solely on txn fees to pay electricity bills. 
It is a real concern whether or not users will voluntarily offer to pay high fees in order to keep hashrate security high. If not, then txn fees will be low, and miners will drop off, and difficulty will drop, and security will drop, and electricity usage will drop.

1. I think this is inevitable, and we will have to hard fork to a different PoW scheme or whatever else gets broken. This is a ways out, but it should be planned for.
2. Governments declaring bitcoin illegal is also inevitable. When that happens, bitcoin will likely still survive, because all the other countries where bitcoin is not illegal will still use it. And bitcoin will only become more anti-fragile as a result. In other words, bitcoin will become stronger for it. But it will take time.
3. Apathy is not the most scary, its the LEAST scary of the 3. It does not matter if the masses accept bitcoin or not. For you to understand why that is, it comes down to what are your goals with bitcoin? My goal is freedom from inflation of the fiat money supply by central banks and governments. Bitcoin allows me that freedom. I don't need the masses to adopt bitcoin in order for me to see benefit. I'm ALREADY seeing benefit as early as we are. Its already working for me. Of course, if the masses adopted it, that would be great, but I don't need that, and I'm happy if only a fraction of people adopt it.

This is backwards. Monetary inflation naturally causes circulation, because you would rather get rid of your fiat becuase you expect it to lose value. This is exactly the reason why central banks print more money: to stimulate the economy (to stimulate spending). A deflationary asset you would expect to increase in value as the supply decreases, and therefore that discourages circulation.

I think you don't understand what a 51% attack means. A few of your points that you made are talking about when rules are changed, and therefore blocks would become invalid. In such a case, yes, you would have to coerce or hack nodes to upgrade in order to accept the new rules.
A 51% attack is when a fork happens in which BOTH SIDES ARE VALID. We have two chains which both follow all of the rules. These forks can happen naturally as a result of simply slow propagation of network effects around the world. Two miners could be solving blocks at the same time. These can also happen if people try a 51% attack in order to double spend, or rewrite history, or censor people from not transacting. So how do we determine which chain is "true"?  And so Satoshi said, well, whichever chain is the longest and has the most cumulative PoW will be the winner, because what the majority of hashpower says, and that should be the deciding factor. Well, guess what 51% is? The majority.
And so here's an example: I sell my house, and receive 100 BTC from the buyer. I wait for 1 confirmation on the blockchain. I see the txn in the latest mined block, and so I sign away the deed to the house and complete the transaction. But what I didn't know is that the buyer is part of a mining group who controls 51% of the hashpower. And since I only waited 1 confirmation, its not too difficult for them to rewrite the history of the chain. They instead point their miners to work on a different fork, meaning, instead of building new blocks on top of the last block that included my house txn, they instead start building on top of the previous block. Eventually this new chain becomes longer, and so the whole network orphans the original block that included my house txn, and instead the network follows the longest chain. And so I've already sold away my house, and also my 100 btc txn is no longer part of the chain that the network agrees upon, so I don't have my btc either. Now, this example just excludes my txn from the new fork. But the attacker could just as easily double spend those 100 btc, by having a txn sending those 100 btc to a different house seller in the new fork, and now he got 2 houses for the price of 1. And I'm out of luck because my txn was on the original chain that is now orphaned, because it is shorter and has less PoW so the network doesn't follow it.
And so the 'solution' is to wait for more confirmations, aka more blocks to be build on top. Because then instead of just re-mining 1 block, the 51% attackers would need to re-mine 6,10,20 blocks in order to complete the successful fork that everyone will follow. Which will take much more time, and the existing chain would keep continuing in the meantime. It would be a race.

The whole industry of finance follows the FED rate hikes. When interest rates drop, all commodity prices immediately spike. You can simply arbitrage by taking out loans at cheaper interest and then spending that money you just borrowed in investments that outperform the interest rate.


And why do you think they want to print more money? Because the whole scam collapses if they don't. They can't have bank runs like they had in Greece and Cyprus a few years ago. They will do everything to prevent that. And lets face it. Most people probably including you, don't want that either. So who cares what the FED is "feeding you". They are looking out for themselves and everyone else too. Very very few people would be happy with a real deflationary contraction.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:07:55
Very few people *really* care if it can be used as money. The only people who have problems with using current money for transaction are people that are in gray markets like drugs/gambling/adult websites. Most normal merchants have no issues with accepting payments. If you wanted bitcoin to be used as money, then the creator should have introduced some inflation, which would encourage people to spend/use it more.
What *lots* of people have issues with is their life savings being eroded by central bank monetary inflation. Almost everyone in the world has this problem. Bitcoin will always have a place in the market for all the people who care about this, and want to store their value without their purchasing power dwindling. This is the reason why most of us use bitcoin.

You don't need to run a node 24/7. You only need to run it when you are receiving a txn. You check your node that you control to make sure that your txn was received and was valid. That way you don't have to trust any other wallet, or web block explorer, etc. You only trust your own node. Your node verifies the blockchain. Not what some website says.

Your 'first' is false. You don't need to gain a majority of validating nodes at all. You don't need to control any validating nodes. A typical 51% attack plans on producing completely valid blocks that all nodes will accept.
Your 'second' is false, he doesn't need to gain control or hack other miners. He might be friend with other miners and they coordinate the attack together.
Your 'third' is partially true, but attackers can succeed if they do it fast enough. You just have to see the discussion from the binance reorg attempt a few months back, where a BTC dev said that if they wanted to even try such a thing, they have a very limited window (mere hours) before it would become impossible.
Your 'fourth' and 'fifth' are false, as mentioned in my 1st paragraph. A 51% attack sends completely valid and true blocks, so no miners will be rejected or blacklisted.

And then the altcoin fanboys see BTC running and trade into the one true coin, etc etc.
And then the market is clearly overextended and all those newb traders who chased the market on the way up eventually dwindle out, and of course their emotional nature causes them to sell at the first drop, which causes the fallback.

Sure electrum is good to start. But remember, if you don't keep your coins on the exchange, and instead keep them in your own wallet, that means you are personally responsible for the security of your coins. That means you need to be careful about all software that you run on your machine, and all people that have access to your machine. You will probably encrypt your wallet file, which means you will need a password to access electrum. And it will ask you to create a 12-24 word seed phrase, which can generate your whole wallet. If anyone ever gets access to those 12-24 words, they will have access to all of your money. So there are pros and cons. Do you trust the exchange not to get hacked? Or do you trust yourself not to get hacked?

You don't run a node to "support the network". You run a node to support yourself. There is great benefit in knowing that the bitcoins that you have are actually yours, and follow the rules you choose for the network. Otherwise, you are just relying on someone else (some web block explorer, or some light wallet) to tell you the truth that you have bitcoins.
It has nothing to do with relaying blocks across the internet to other members of the network.  It has to do with USING the node to validate and audit the network. You do that by looking at your node as the source of truth when you send/receive a transaction. NOT looking at some website or light wallet.

Lol anyone can write anything they want on their website. A website is self promotion after all. That's why I ask, are you *sure* that NANO is decentralized? How are you measuring that? Do you think its easier for a government to shut down NANO or BTC? That's the goal of decentralization after all, right? To achieve freedoms that aren't otherwise available?
Decentralization is a scale. Running everything on one server is obviously centralized. Is running it on 2,3,4,5 decentralized? What about 100 copies? At what point are you satisfied that there is "enough" decentralization? In my opinion, if our goal is to defeat governments and central banks, we want as much decentralization as possible. Then, you also need to consider the decentralization needed for both miners AND full nodes.
The scaling debate has gone on for years. The tradeoff is, the more scaling and throughput you allow, naturally the less decentralization you can achieve. Consider a blockchain that only allows 1 transaction per day. Obviously this allows very little throughput. However, since we only need to store 1 txn per day, the resources required are tiny maybe 250 kb per day, and so everyone in the world could probably run a full node on their mobile phones. As bitcoin stands currently, we are probably adding 200 mb per day to the chain. People are complaining about bitcoin's scalability currently, but people today STILL aren't running nodes to participate in its decentralization. Are you running a node? If you aren't, then you aren't really part of the bitcoin p2p network. And if not, why not? What are you reasons why not? Likely the same as most: convenience, resources, etc.
And so, consider if we increase things to be more scalable, and process 100x the txns we can currently. So we slide further down the scale to allow more throughput, but naturally that will lead to less decentralization. Even fewer people will participate in the network. Its a trade off. You want more decentralization, then you will probably achieve that with smaller throughput. If you want more throughput, you will sacrifice some decentralization. You could think of it like a see-saw. If you want more decentralization, that means you want more and more participants to be running nodes. All of those people have hard physical costs in the real world. So its not practical to assume things to be fee-less. Unless you expect those people to do things for you for free? Naturally keeping 1000 copies is going to be more expensive than 1 copy at a centralized server. Are you willing to pay that price?
If you're happy with NANO, then use it! All cryptos have their own pros and cons. But it comes down to real world use. I personally don't care about fast and fee-less payments. If I want to make a payment, I want to spend away my fiat, which I believe will devalue through inflation over time. And I also want consumer protections incase I get defrauded by the seller. Visa and paypal are super fast and convenient and easy to use. I have no problems with them. Do you have problems with payments currently? I reckon almost no one does, unless you are in censorship industries like drugs/gambling/adult websites. So decentralized payments is a solution that is searching for a problem. This is why its so hard to explain crypto to grandma. She rightly says, so what? She has no problems with payments that need to be solved. But, explain it to a CBD oil business that can't get credit card processing, and they understand immediately.
However, there is another use-case that solves real problems. That is the store-of-value use case. This is the problem i'm concerned about, and many others: My life savings being devalued via fiat central bank monetary inflation. And so I don't care so much about fast and free payments. I care about security and decentralization in order to protect from central banks and governments.
But if you have a problem with payments, feel free to use NANO all you want.

If onboarding hundreds of millions of people will cause me to lose the solutions to problems I'm currently solving, then I'm against hundreds of millions of people onboarding. I welcome the people who are trying to solve the same problems as me.
But if you want low fees and to onboard hundreds of millions of people, then you have options too: Visa, Paypal, Venmo, LTC, BCH, BSV, NANO, etc etc etc etc. Stop wasting your time here and go solve your problems.

Lol you don't have to downvote every post because someone contests your previous post. This is just an open discussion.
You said it "can only be a store of value if it is used as a currency first". That's clearly incorrect. There are plenty of things that are stores of value that aren't used as currencies first. Stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, rare art work, jewelry. All of those are used as stores of value, and aren't used as currencies first. I don't see people transacting in real estate deeds first, before real estate can become a store of value. Picasso paintings have value with no one using it as a means of exchange. So where does the value of Picasso paintings come from then? Those examples all fall under store of value first, before being currencies. Now, we COULD transact in real estate deeds or Picasso paintings, if it were convenient. But its not convenient, so we probably will never do that. Bitcoin is convenient, so it works.
Where does the value come from? Value is perception. People "value" Gucci handbags at 100x the prices of Walmart handbags because of nothing but brand name and advertising. Value in that sense is subjective. But you'll probably not be satisfied with that answer, and thankfully Bitcoin does have some other value propositions to offer, such as fixed currency supply (no inflation), immutability (no transactions can ever be reversed by third party), and freedom from censorship (no third party can stop you from transacting).
So your statement was incorrect. Perhaps that's all I should have said, that your statement was incorrect, and we could have talked about that, because that was my main point. Instead I said it was backwards and proposed to reverse it. And we can talk about that too but my argument isn't as strong. Bitcoin works as a currency if it is a store of value first. Because, if its not a store of value first, then it really doesn't have much advantages of existing fiat currencies. Why would people choose to transact in bitcoin instead of USD/paypal/visa? Those services work well already and are much easier for the user.

Yet, bitpay put out a blog post specifically misleading users to make them think that segwit2x was the way forward and instructing them to upgrade to the non-consensus software. So its not baffling at all that they haven't adopted segwit. They only want to follow consensus when it suits them. They are upset that their preference for 2x didn't reach consensus, and out of spite, they will cripple their support for Bitcoin, and overcharge their users on fees on both sides of the txn, in order to push people onto a BCH minority fork that certainly is not the consensus chain.
Of course, it is their right to do that. They are a centralized processor after all, and so they are trying to protect their business. I call it anti-bitcoin because the whole point of bitcoin is to not rely on 3rd parties, which is exactly what they are. And, its what they want to stay, in order to keep merchants reliant upon them. Luckily, alternatives such as BTCPayServer will make it easier for merchants to transition away

Bitcoin is function in real world society right now, today, and IMO is one of the most successful open source projects in history. Adoption has grown over its 10 year existence. Its easily usable right now. Sometimes its not affordable. But if you want affordable why not use paypal or visa? Do you even know why you're using crypto?

Sure you can 'call' yourself a user. Who cares that's not the point.  The point is you don't KNOW what's going on for sure, unless you do it yourself. And yes, like you say, you CAN download and verify if you want to. But if you choose not to, then you are placing your trust somewhere else, such as a web block explorer. If everyone thinks like you, "oh someone else can download and verify", and no one actually does it, then is there really any decentralization? Its not really peer to peer unless everyone is individually using it. Then it would be largePeer to largePeer. Which then makes it easier for governments to attack since there's only a few peers in the network (ETH, BCH, etc).
If you have to place trust elsewhere, why not just use visa/paypal/venmo? That's the point you want to continue to side step. That's because you don't know why you're using crypto, other than because its the hot new thing. If your grandmother asks you why should she use bitcoin, what's your answer? If your answer is "transparency and decentralization", what benefits do those qualities provide for the end user?

Now you're going in the right direction. How do you KNOW you are "using" the blockchain if you haven't downloaded it and cyrptographically verified that you are sending/receiving coins under the rules you want? You can never know, for certain, unless you do it yourself. Which is the whole point of bitcoin: not having to trust ANYONE. No central authority, no 3rd party website, no one but yourself. I guess you will have to trust the source code you've downloaded, but of course you can simply read through it.
Why else would you even use a blockchain to begin with? You know that paypal/venmo is pretty cheap and fast and easy to use, right?

Everyone understands the value of network effect and adoption. Please tell me whats the point of having millions of users of bitcoin if it isn't decentralized and peer to peer? Are you even a peer in the network right now? Or do you just validate your transactions based on when [blockchain.info]( says its confirmed?
If you're not a peer, why not? Let me guess: too much computer resources required (disk space, CPU, bandwith, etc). Yet you're proposing something that will increase all of those things, and will make it even less likely for people to join the network, including yourself. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?!?!!

They patch it and publish and release the code. Its then up to individual users to upgrade their software on their machines. Yes, this mean some people continue to run old and outdated code that still has bugs. And yes, this is inefficient, but that's what you get with decentralization. If you want the benefits of peer to peer decentralization then you have to put up with the drawbacks. If you don't care about the benefits of decentralization (many don't even know what these are), then you might as well just use paypal/venmo/visa which already tick all the boxes that everyone is complaining about in this thread: fast, low fees, wide adoption.
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:37:32

Actually yes it is our job. We get to choose individually what we want to discriminate against, and if enough of us are in agreement, we have a network in consensus.
Should we discriminate against people who want to backup their torrent moviez to the largest and most distributed database in the world, the bitcoin blockchain, probably more redundant than google and amazon? Then they can be sure their moviez will never be deleted, will always be available. Lets not discriminate against these people. In fact lets make it easier and cheaper for them to store their moviez on each of our machines!!!!!

The answer to "when" is when we are decentralized enough, and only then if we need it.

@_date: 2019-04-12 17:44:29


Sure, but all of those payments are not any that you really have to fear a government of other 3rd party intervening with. The security of a blockchain might be overkill. Maybe you'd want the security it provides for paying rent. That might be one.


Yes you are exactly correct. You can use lightning or an alt or fiat just the same for less secure payments. But that's the whole point. Before we can even think about fees and things like that, it is ESSENTIAL that we preserve the security and decentralization aspect, otherwise we have NOTHING, we are no different than any alt, no different than paypal.
Nothing makes bitcoin more special, other than the fact that it is the most decentralized coin, and thats because of its USERBASE. Its community. Its network of people and believers. Throughout bitcoins history we've shown that our rules are immutable, unchanging. Miners or developers cannot and will not dictate our terms. Once we are widespread enough, or when technology allows, then we can focus on fees, but its pointless right now, and never should be the priority. Bitcoin might be the most decentralized currently, but what happens when one random country government bans bitcoin? Can the userbase handle that? The market price certainly won't handle it, at least not in the short term.


What I think, is that the majority of people who want low fees and full adoption, are the people who care only about bitcoin as a speculative investment, and they hold that greed you speak of.
The reason why I'm so engaged in this discussion, its because I used to be the same as all the complainers in this thread. I used to say the same thing when I was first exposed to this debate. "Why would you ever cripple bitcoin and have ridiculous fees? Its not practical. We should be trying to expand our reach as much as possible." I was coming from the perspective of someone who just wanted my investment to grow. So of course I wanted as many people as possible to get on board. High fees and slow transactions aren't a sexy headline to recruit new investors. It looks like we're clueless and incompetent.
But as I've spent more time trying to understand the other side, the side I now agree with, I realize that bitcoin is nothing without the security and decentralization and freedom that you spoke about. That's why we're here. Peer to peer is truly a grassroots movement. And we're going up against the biggest adversaries on the planet, where wars have been started over. And we've only just begun. To do that, requires deep understanding from every participant and peer in the network. Someone trying to buy a coffee with a cheap fee isn't going to shoulder the risk necessary to become a peer in the network to try to resist governments and central banks. So growth WILL be slow, because we're not trying to simply onboard users to fund a couple hundred dollars into their BTC wallet; instead we're needing people to understand what our goals are, what we're trying to achieve, how we plan to achieve it. The education process is always slow.
LukeJR wants even smaller blocks at 300kb, which means even less transactions and higher fees. That's because he wants to increase decentralization as fast as possible. He wants as many people around the world running their own full nodes. That might work, but it won't hold. Because a person who just spins up a node without the understanding behind WHY he's doing it, will also be the same person to fold under pressure and give in and shut his node down and give up on bitcoin as the first sign of trouble.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:42:07


Block size was raised already with the introduction of Segwit. Further increases can be phased in IF necessary. When? Perhaps when the network is decentralized enough where it can no longer be stopped, such as by governments.

Very good. I agree with everything you just said. Now, do you know HOW, technically, bitcoin achieves all of those things you just listed?
What would you prefer, all of those well articulated benefits you just listed? Or low fees? Everything you just wrote are the reasons why we are in this crypto game. We are not here because we want lower fees. If you want lower fees, there are other solutions that already exist.
If you want all those lofty goals you just mentioned, then  you use bitcoin. And bitcoin should NEVER compromise the very goals it is trying to achieve, in order to accommodate other goals such as speed and fees. That's why I used the airplane example. Complaining about low fees in bitcoin is like complaining that its inconvenient to use an airplane to go to the grocery store. The purpose of an airplane isn't to make it easier for you to travel to the grocery store. Modifying an airplane to accomplish that goal would be retarded. The purpose of bitcoin isn't to make it cheaper to buy a coffee. Its purpose is everything you just laid out.

The protection against inflation, as well as the freedom and censorship resistance, are the ONLY things that bitcoin offers over traditional banking.
If you don't care about those things, then don't use bitcoin, and go ahead and use visa, or use your interbanking transfers. When I lived in Australia they had the same thing. Just input some bank account numbers and instantly transfer funds. Who cares. Speed is irrelevant. Fees are irrelevant. Bitcoin will not, and can not ever win in those areas. Why? We are sending every transaction ever, to every single user in the network. That's extremely inefficient, by nature. We don't care. That's not why we/you use bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:53:58


That was never a goal that bitcoin tried to solve. You must not know why you're using crypto. Nor should that be the goal; We literally need to replicate the database of every single transaction in history, to every single individual user in the network.

@_date: 2019-04-10 05:01:23
Glad you asked and are open to at least considering an alternative. Can't say that about many of the complainers in here.
The true use-case of bitcoin is the removal of any third parties from interfering with money and transactions. Its about freedom.
Typical third parties such as commercial banks and visa and paypal interfere via censorship. They tell you how you can spend your money or not. Paypal routinely shuts down business accounts for any reason under the sun. Other businesses such as porn/gambling have difficulty setting up merchant accounts to accept card payments because they are deemed "high risk". All of this is censorship. An example of this use-case was The Silk Road, the first and largest bitcoin marketplace, where all "illegal" type transactions took place that would normally be censored. But its not just about trying to break the law. Some banks don't even let you wire your own money wherever you want (such as crypto exchanges to invest in crypto). This isn't freedom. Is it your own money or not? If so, you should be able to do what you want with it, without asking permission.
Other third parties such as central banks and governments interfere by controlling the money supply via inflation. This means that you are penalized by saving. Your savings lose value every year as central banks print more money out of thin air. In this current scenario, all you've been taught is incorrect: saving isn't necessarily the best idea; and it is actually smart to go into debt with a decent investment strategy. Saving dollars in your bank is holding a long position in USD. Going into debt means going short the dollar. In an inflationary environment like we have, the value of the dollar goes down over time, and you can pay back your debt with less valuable dollars. Inflation of the money supply is a hidden tax on savers; you have to keep working every year just to \*break even\*.  An example of this use-case is the increased activity of bitcoin use in Venezuela where the country is currently in shambles in a hyperinflation scenario
Anyway all of that might be too much detail. But those are two examples of what bitcoin offers. That's why you use bitcoin. If you don't care about those things, why waste your time in bitcoin?
Now how does bitcoin try to accomplish those goals? It is truly peer to peer, and requires all peers in the network to share the risk (aka decentralization). Bitcoin literally sends a copy of every single transaction ever, to every single participant in the network. Right now the blockchain is 200+gb large. That file has to be replicated everywhere across the network. Bitcoin cannot and will not ever be able to compete with the speed and affordability of a centralized third party such as Paypal that only has to keep ONE copy of everything in their warehouse. We have to send everything, to everyone. That's slow. And that's not cheap. But hopefully with more technical advances we can improve the speed and the fees.
If you want fast and cheap and easy, what's wrong with Paypal or Venmo or Visa? There is nothing wrong with those. Everyone in this thread is complaining about fast and cheap. Those services give you fast and cheap. Your solution already exists! Go use it! Bitcoin is solving a different problem.

@_date: 2019-04-29 14:38:24
Now you're starting to ask the right questions.
Do you know how bitcoin works? The network literally sends every single transaction to every single participant. Do you realize how inefficient that is? Why do you think we do that?
What is Bitcoin meant to do? Its meant to allow everyone to transact freely, without interference. Its about freedom. Adult porn businesses, or gambling businesses, or CBD businesses, etc, cannot accept credit card payments because the CC processors consider them high risk. Online sellers using paypal get their accounts shut down and money confiscated for the smallest of things. Paypal ALWAYS sides with the buyer. Its so easy to get screwed with them. Commercial banks have refused to allow people to wire money out of their account for certain reasons (ironically when someone wanted to deposit to a crypto exchange, the bank wouldn't let them lol). All of this is censorship. People telling you what you can or can't do with your money. Bitcoin beats censorship.
What else is it meant to do? Create a fixed supply of currency, so that people are rewarded by saving instead of being rewarded by going into debt. Fiat currency is inflationary, meaning that the supply of money keeps inflating or increasing. That means that $10 today might be worth $9 tomorrow, but the supply has increased. That means you have to continue to work just to BREAK EVEN. You are not working to gain. You have to work tomorrow to recoup that extra $1 you lost via inflation. In this scenario, you are rewarded by going into debt, because you repay the debt with dollars that are worth less than what you took the loan out for. You are penalized for saving. You are rewarded for going into debt. Your school and parents lied to you (or really just didn't understand). Taking a loan is going short the dollar. Saving is going long. Bitcoin's supply is fixed, it will never increase (unless everyone in the network agrees, but why would they ever do that), which should mean that the value of a coin increases over time, instead of decreasing like a fiat dollar.
Bitcoin is NOT meant to enable you to send money across borders fast and cheaply. Visa, paypal, western union all can do that. They can all do that better, and they can all do that faster. They keep ONE record of all transactions. Pretty easy to be fast when you only have to go through one source. Every transaction in bitcoin needs to be broadcast to everyone on the network. Not easy to be fast when you have to do that. But that's not what bitcoin is meant to do. Of course, with technological improvements those things might be possible, but that's not the reason you use bitcoin. Why would you? Those other platforms are all superior than bitcoin in those areas. Why would you use an inferior method? In which case, you're in the wrong spot, and here for the wrong reasons, and you will likely be misled by people claiming that bitcoin is slow and can't scale yada yada yada. Bitcon is targeting loftier goals, and as such has bigger adversaries, such as governments and central banks. If all you care about is sending fiat across borders, you won't be willing to stick through the fight against those big entities.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:22:14
Initially you seemed like you were a troll in disguise, but perhaps you really are trying to understand.
So I will give you the benefit of the doubt:
The reason why you think the BCH side makes sense is because you are looking at it from an ease-of-use point of view. You want fast and easy and cheap transactions. Who wouldn't want that? Why should we have to pay high fees and wait a long time for transactions to clear?
So BCH sweeps in, and tries to fulfill that need, and on the surface it looks good.
But if all you care about is fast and cheap and easy, what's wrong with visa/paypal/venmo? Why are we reinventing the wheel? Go use them. The user experience is way better and way easy.
If you are truly here for the libertarian aspect, then you are here for the freedom, you are here to resist censorship from governments and payment processors, you are here to fight inflation and have a currency that doesn't devalue. That is the solution that bitcoin provides. Do not forget this. This is why we're doing it. Otherwise there's no point. We will never beat paypal in user experiece. Paypal is one central server which keeps track of everything. In crypto, every single user in the network has to keep track of everything.
BCH tries to play the middle role: they want good fast cheap user experience, but they will never beat paypal because of the reason listed above. And they are completely centralized, so they will never beat governments. They will do nothing and go nowhere.
BTC is trying to beat governments. You think governments are going to go down without a fight? It is only a matter of time before some government completely bans bitcoin. At that point, we shall see if bitcoin can succeed or not. BTC is preparing for that inevitability. BTC is not trying to make it cheaper for Mr-Joe-Six-Pack to buy a coffee. BTC wins by user education, NOT by user adoption. It wins by people like you understanding why we're in it, and what we're willing to do about it. It wins by people so fed up with the current system that they are  WILLING to pay high fees and endure slow transactions, so that they CAN be their own bank. Of course, we're not trying for slow txns and high fees, and hopefully as technology improves we will improve too. But you don't put the cart before the horse.

@_date: 2019-04-10 04:44:29
I didn't answer because I am trying to lead you to understanding both sides of the debate equally..
You talk about freedom and free speech and true ownership. Do you know how bitcoin achieves these things?
You are putting the cart before the horse by looking for adoption first. What good is mass adoption, if we sacrifice all those ideals you mentioned? Then we'll have wasted everything and ended up like Paypal. Paypal, by the way, started out as "Coinfinity" with similar goals as bitcoin today, couldn't achieve them, and ended up as they are now. Do you want mass adoption of bitcoin if it means that all that freedom stuff is jeopardized?
Adoption should grow only when more common folk start caring about the freedom you talk about. So if you want wider adoption, spend time spreading the word about the freedom stuff. Because that's the only incentive bitcoin offers to the common man that Paypal doesn't.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:34:05
If more people transact bitcoin, but dont run their own nodes to validate, I wouldn't necessarily say that bitcoin becomes MORE centralized, but it definitely doesn't become more DEcentralized.
If coinbase adds a million more users for their exchange, the bitcoin network kinda remains the same in regards to centralization. The number of fully validating nodes haven't contracted. But there are less of them in relation to the overall numbers of people who think they are using 'bitcoin'.

Do we need complete 100% decentralization of validating nodes, where SPV isn't even possible, and everyone must validate for themselves? I don't think we need that. Is 90% of users running nodes sufficient? Is 10% of users running nodes sufficient? 1% Its impossible to say. So yes, I would agree that there is definitely a place on the scale where we reach diminishing returns. 
But, since bitcoin's only value proposition (compared to traditional systems such as paypal or visa) is its ability to resist control and censorship from the banks and governments, then I would like to see more decentralization rather than less. That is the only way that its value proposition can be preserved.

Not much. All you're doing is helping relay blocks to other nodes, which is of marginal benefit.

Your previous comment makes it seem like whoever 'they' is would rather pay the minimum and keep the rest for themselves. That's not going to happen. The trustee is in control of the coins. If he pays the creditors back what the law says, then the leftovers go directly back to the MtGox owners, not back to him. That would mean $billions in excess that the creditors get screwed out of, that go directly into the hands of the people responsible for the fuck up. And that would be the decision of the trustee and the japanese court. How do you think that would reflect on their court system in the public eye? You think the trustee wants that on his professional reputation?
Further, you completely ignore that there is another law to exit bankruptcy which we are in the process of trying to convince the court. The trustee knows how unjust the law is. There is more than a 'slight' chance. That's why hedge funds are trying to buy claims from creditors. Feel free to downvote yourself.

I agree that *currently* you can probably trust that things will be as you expect, and the tradeoff vs the hassle of running a node might not be worth it. That is the case *in the present*.
Here's the problem. You encourage people to not run full nodes, because presently there is no risk. Most users don't understand the implications of fully validating for themselves, so of course they will prefer lightweight wallets. What happens in the future when everyone was pushed onto thin wallets, and we have maybe 5 major wallet providers supporting most of the network (as an example)? At that point, all of a sudden the trust equation has shifted dramatically. That's why it could eventually be dangerous to suggest to people to perform their own validation. That's why you do help the network when you use your own node, because you make that extreme example above harder to come to fruition. 
Decentralization IS important and should remain so. I'm of the opinion that that should be at the forefront of all of our decisions about the network. Because the only reason we are in all of this is because we want freedom from banks and governments interfering with our money. And bitcoin allows us to achieve that. If we care about fast and cheap txns, just use paypal. We are here for liberty. We are here to resist censorship. We can accomplish that by education and decentralization.
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:25:15
You don't care where you get it from. Just like when you're using bitcoin core, you have no idea where you're getting blocks from. Nodes just relay them. They could be bad blocks from malicious miners, and that's why your software verifies them. Getting preloaded chain, or downloading a chain from complete stranger nodes is the same thing. Your client has to verify the blocks regardless.

you don't run a node to 'help' the network
you run a node to validate for yourself that your transactions are following the correct rules of the system YOU choose, and that you haven't been scammed by a third party (web wallet, etc) who may violate those rules. your node software guarantees that it won't process txns that don't follow the rules. you have no idea what the web wallet software is running.

We may be there already, with so few % of users validating, and that may be why lukejr makes suggestions for 300kb block sizes lol.
The 5 major wallet providers might not want to destroy their business. But maybe they get bought out for a price that it worth much more than their business. Or maybe they get coerced by government. The fact is, your wallet provider controls the rules in use, since they are the ones who determine what rules are valid.
But as you rightly note, its a tradeoff: How much decentralization do you want? If you think only a little is enough to keep everyone honest, then you are more willing to compromise on issues such as blocksize. I'm not sure where the appropriate balance is. But I'm of the opinion that the more decentralization, the better. The whole purpose of bitcoin is to take control back and resist governments. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:10:04


You just contradicted yourself. 
Enforcing is not the same as creating. Of course we know the miners do the creating. Enforcing means, does the node operator accept what miners create?
If miners create a block that pays themselves 1m coins, my node would reject it.
If a BCH node receives a block with a 1mb block limit, their node will reject it. 
Both nodes are enforcing the rules that they choose.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:45:57
Which circles us back as to what the whole purpose of bitcoin is. Is it to faciliate a payment system with no backlog, with fast throughput and low fees? If that's the purpose, why not use paypal or visa? Those systems achieve those goals.
If the purpose is to resist governments, to take back control from banks, and to not be censored, then such backlogs are not a problem, because then those purposes are still preserved.
Horses for different courses.

Well the entire economy also the same has strong incentive to continue to use USD over BTC. The reason they don't "presumably" is the benefits that BTC offers: which is control of your money and resistance against governments and banks. If a chain can be forked without your control, "presumably" no one would value nor use that new chain. This depends on people knowing WHY they are in this in the first place, and how they plan on achieving it.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:32:39
Right. And the "economic" way to 'enforce' that you mention is EXACTLY what everyone is talking about when they say 'enforce'. No one is talking about nodes that are unused, that you just spin up and let sit idle and do nothing but relay blocks. No one. Not [core devs]( (scroll to "Ability to use a full node"). And not the video in the post that we are replying to, which also says those nodes are next to worthless.
We are talking about USING the node to verify and validate that your transactions are using the rules that you expect. If you do not use a node to validate for yourself, and enforce the rules you want, you are not your own bank. Instead you allow someone else to enforce what rules they want, and you abide by those rules, and you give up some trust in the process.
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:25:49
And the corollary to this is, going into debt is actually a good thing.
As you say, savings in a bank account is an investment in fiat. Aka, you have a long position on the dollar. If you believe that monetary inflation will devalue the currency, then why would you ever want to be long? You wouldn't.
Debt is akin to going short the USD. What happens when you short a stock? You borrow the stock, with the intent of giving it back in the future, hopefully at a lower price. With debt, you borrow dollars, and pay those dollars back in the future when they are worth less.
Of course, you never want to get in over your head with debt, where the interest payments outweigh any investment gains. But the point is, the age old advice of "savings good, debt bad" might not necessarily be the best strategy.

Centralization is a scaling issue. Scaling inherently requires more computing resources (not just storage), which makes it more difficult for people to run nodes, and also makes it more demanding for existing nodes to remain in operation.
The network is more robust with the more decentralization we have. The only benefit bitcoin offers over other payment systems and currencies is that it gives its users the power and control, without interference from governments and banks. That is the only benefit. Blockchains are an extremely inefficient technology, and so they will never match the speed or usability of a completely centralized system such as paypal or visa. But that's ok, because that's not bitcoins use-case. And so, to achieve bitcoin's only advantage over these systems (resistance against government), we should want as much decentralization as possible
Luke's view is that we are already too centralized

Its about helping *yourself*. You worry about yourself first, and then the network takes care of itself.
If you don't run a full node, you give up trust. You have to trust that your SPV or your web block explorer is not lying to you/has been corrupted/has been bought out. If you run your own node, you don't trust anyone but your own software.
And since when running and using a node, you ARE part of the network, then yes the network becomes stronger in that way. But as the video says, just running a node and not using it for anything does very little.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:36:55

@_date: 2018-02-26 15:36:48


And what I'm saying is, your claim is not "widely spread". Please cite all these sources which are claiming that unused nodes helps the network. I myself [informed]( another user in this very thread that he isn't helping much. No one is making these claims. If they are, then they don't understand things. 
You use a full node for yourself. Its the only way you can truly trust that your coins and your txns are real. Maybe as a byproduct the network *may* be stronger for it, because now the network has one extra real user as part of its decentralization. But that's not the purpose. The purpose is to be your own bank. If you don't validate and verify the rules yourself, you are not your own bank.
But even if so, unused full nodes don't do too much damange. Far more damaging is people suggesting that no one need to run full nodes and therefore not validate their transactions. That inherently centralizes the existence of full nodes, having less in existence, and making the entire network more at risk.


If you don't run your own node, you don't KNOW what rules are being run. So, yes I suppose by connecting to another node, you are supporting the rules that he runs. But you don't know what rules those are. You may think you're supporting BCH rules. But if the node operator is running a BTC node, you're in fact transacting with BTC coins. I suppose your vote does still count, but youre voting for sometihng you didn't want to vote for.

The mempool is just the group of all transactions that are waiting to be confirmed and added into the blockchain. When you send a transaction, it goes into the mempool, and you wait for a miner to include your txn into a block. 
If the mempool is large, then miners have way too many txns to choose from, more txns than can fit in a block. So they have to be selective. Of course, they will choose the txns that pay the highest fee.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:45:47


Paypal has been a fine digital currency for years. 


Flat out lie. Many people can use BTC today, and they could use it a few months ago too, it just required a larger fee.


People HODL because the fixed supply means its inherently deflationary. Block size/fees has nothing to do with it.


To undermine the state, we need as much decentralization as possible, and as much unity as possible. Splintering the community and throwing a hissy fit when you don't get your way certainly doesn't aid in that goal.

Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area" cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.
And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.
And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure fuck it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected president.

The analogy would be that if you put the exact same strawberries into the blender, then the blender would always output the exact same smoothie.


No, it doesn't take a lot of computational power to calculate the hash. The exact opposite really. Its computationally inexpensive to calculate a hash, which is why its easy for nodes to validate a hash. A hash is just a function. Like "sum" is a function. `sum("2+2") = 4`. If I give you abc, then calculating `hash("abc") = ???` is very easy to calculate
Its computationally hard to find an input that will hash out to a certain value. That requires pure guessing. If I give you xyz, then calculating `hash("???") = xyz` is very hard. You just have to spend a lot of time guesssing at inputs until you get xyz as an output.


The inputs of the hash are the transactions in the block, as well as the previous block hash to link back, as well as the arbitrary nonce number. The output of the hash needs to be a specific number of leading zeros, such as 000000000asndfasfdbasdfasfd. The more zeroes the more difficult it is. You keep guessing at the nonce until you can get a hash with those leading zeros. So a miner needs to solve:
`hash(txns + prev_hash + nonce) = 00000000000asdf.....`

In a 51% attack in the normal sense, there are no bad blocks to weed out. As long as the protocol rules are followed, then the longest chain wins. A double spend would potentially be possible if enough computing power were obtained to outpace the rest of the network.
If the government miners decided to fork with new rules, then yes all full nodes would simply reject the blocks that don't follow the rules.

And with every investment, there is risk that your investment will fail. US Treasuries are pretty much one of the safest investments on the planet, since they are backed by the government from the best economy in the world. That is why the interest rates are usually so low. With negative interest rates, pretty much you are willing to invest your money and accept a small loss, knowing that the rest of your principal should be safe. If you invest 100% and can guarantee 99% back, you might be willing to accept that, rather than keep your money elsewhere at higher risk (but likely also higher reward).

Sure, it might not do much for the network technically. But they do plenty for the user who runs the node: they check that transactions are valid. When more individuals run a node for this purpose, the social, community aspect of the network gets stronger. And thats important.

Your question doesn't really make sense. Let me pose a different question to you, in order to start the discussion:

Ok so for this hypothetical scenario:
You are still thinking about "number of nodes" as if that matters at all. It doesn't. That's why you keep talking about "contributing" and "helping" the network. Your whole basis for how this works is mistaken.
If some/most users are on board with a 2mb block increase, and you personally aren't (you continue to run the old node with 1mb cap), then obviously we have a fork in the network. It would be no different than you continuing to run BTC Core node, and everyone else starting to run BCH node. So you personally want 1mb blocks while everyone else wants 2mb blocks. Blocksize is a rule just like any other rule, such as double spending or 21m total coins. By running a 1mb node, you are personally taking a stand that the 1mb rule is a rule that you personally will not violate. And you will validate that blocks follow that rule, and you will never see any txns that don't follow that rule.
So when someone sends you coins on the 2mb chain, you won't see it, because those blocks will be invalidated by your node. Of course, the rest of the network/community has moved on to 2mb, so all block explorer websites will show that txn. But luckily for you, you can validate your own txns, and so according to you, you haven't received any coins. So you would be on the smaller forked chain. Good for you for sticking to your principles.
You may say, well what good are my coins if no one else is using them. That's a fair point. That's the network effect. However if enough of you stuck to your principles, then you'd have your own chain, and miners would be financially incentivized to support your chain. Just like BCH has currently with their minority chain.
That's why its hard to quantify what "consensus" is. You cannot just use the # of nodes as a judge for "support" for consensus rules. That's idiotic. Of course anyone can spin up extra nodes on different IPs.
So how do miners judge what users want? How do miners know whether or not users want 1mb or 2mb, or any other rule in the network? That's a hard question to answer. You can't use # of nodes because anyone can spin up new IPs. You'd have to guess the sentiment of the community. That's the whole problem with hard forks. Once you introduce a hard forking change, you can't know who is going to follow or accept the new chain or not.
When a large number of people are so organized that they start a UASF campaign, you can be sure that at least SOME users will not go to the new chain. The fact that there is all this debate at all, is proof that you clearly don't have anything close to consensus, and forking the chain would have heavy FINANCIAL consequences for the miners. See, the miners only have to think in their own best interest. They don't want to waste electricity (money) mining blocks that half the network will reject. Now, if there were no debate at all, and everyone you talked to agreed that we should move to 2mb, then you might think there is no risk, right? You can look at node count signaling their support. You can look at reddit and twitter. Everyone is in agreement. So no risk, right? But you'd still be wrong. Because how many end users are running nodes and not even reading reddit or social media etc, and don't even know there is a hard fork proposed? Or what about people who don't speak up, but will silently stick with the old chain? So you can really never be sure. That's why the preference is to keep the status quo and don't risk a hard fork. Maybe you could say that it wasn't 1mb blocks that succeeded over 2mb blocks, but rather "not forking" succeeded. It was "not changing the rules" that succeeded.

No. Bitcoin was used on silk road for the other reason I listed in the post above: censorship resistance. Normal banking/paypal/visa do not let you do what you want with your money. They censor you. They will stop you from sending your money to criminals. They will prevent businesses from accepting payments in drugs/gambling/porn. Etc Etc. The fact that bitcoin has no third party telling you what to do, and that no one can reverse your txn, is the exact reason bitcoin exists. That is the only thing bitcoin is good for: freedom. Freedom from censorship. And freedom from inflation. Those are bitcoin's "value propositions". When someone asks "Why bitcoin? What makes it different?" That is the answer.

The problem is that the issues don't arise until its too late. I heard a good point on a youtube vid earlier: Back in the early days of the internet, no one feared any censorship, it didn't even cross anyone's minds. Now you have countries like China and Turkey who are able censor people's internet access through controlling the DNS servers. Whoops. Perhaps a bit more prudence earlier on may have prevented that possibility. That's what we're up against. Wars have been fought over control of money. Decentralization and freedom should always be the priority and censorship should always be a fear in the back of everyone's mind.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:06:05
An economic node is any node that is actually USED when receiving a txn. To USE the node, it means that when I tell you I'm sending you some coin, you go and LOOK at YOUR node to see if the txn was included in the blockchain. You don't look at some block explorer website (third party). You don't look at some SPV wallet (third party). You only look at your own software, which you know is enforcing the rules you want. You only trust your own software, where you can look at the code.
That's why people are telling you that 1 node or 1000 nodes is no different if its still only 1 person (you) who uses/looks at them.

No not initially you aren't. And you've received NUMEROUS answers from open people giving you the benefit of the doubt. Do you understand where they are coming from yet? Until you can honestly argue for both sides, you don't understand the debate.
Most people in r/btc have no clue how any of this works. A few do, and their position is simply that their will be ENOUGH regular non-mining nodes that we don't have to worry about centralization concerns.  And their position is that in the future, the sheer volume of tranasctions will provide enough fees for the miners to secure the network.
See there, I just argued for the big block side. I understand their side. Neither side is wrong, its all a sliding scale. Its a tradeoff in both directions. But most of the users over there don't even understand the benefits of non-mining nodes (you too, thats why you're asking, and why we're all answering to help you). When you don't understand, its easy to fall prey to someone who sounds confident and convincing. I TOO STARTED THERE.


The white paper only speaks of honest miners and PoW consensus in terms of a 51% attack where miners potentially reorganize the chain. All that has to do with is transaction ordering and history. IE, preventing double spend attacks. Another user already explained to you that there is another different 51% attack where miners could potentially change the rules of the money. You gave a flippant response like "noted". I forget. Obviously it wasn't noted because you still don't get it. That's what everyone in here is talking to you about.
Keep in mind Satoshi originally envisioned that all nodes would be mining nodes. That's how he coded the software that he published. All individuals were also miners. He even speaks of "one CPU one vote".


This is not opinion, its simply helping you understand how the protocol works. When you misunderstand how things work, then you end up making illogical conclusions.


I've literally read multiple users explain it to you already in this very thread. And now you ask it again. Don't you remember their answers? At some point, can you blame us for thinking you might be trolling?
I will give you the scenario once more. Just because SPV guarantees that your txn is included in the longest/strongest chain, doesn't guarantee you that the txn follows your rules. There is trust required: you are trusting that the longest/strongest chain follows the rules you want. You can never know, because you are never checking against those rules. The only way to check against those rules, is to validate the blocks against said rules. If a majority of miners consipred and created a chain with 22 mil max coins (why? oh i dont know, to give themselves and extra free 1m coins), then the longest/strongest chain would be the 22mil coin chain, and that's what your SPV would blindly follow, and you'd never know. Well maybe you'd find out through the news. But now you have to remember to follow the news or social media to keep tabs on your money. More trust.

Running a node does not "Contribute to the network". That's what you're not getting. It has nothing to do with relaying anything to other people
It only "contributes" in the sense that now you are +1 extra person in the network who is fully verifying that their txns follow the rules. So the network is stronger by +1 person.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:52:22


What if a *majority* of miners start mining invalid rules?
Answer: Then the strongest chain would be the chain with invalid rules. Then SPV is worthless and out the window.
End users (the ones running nodes and validating their txns) are the ones with the power in the network. Miners **serve** the users and get paid for their service. Users create the demand, and miners provide the supply. If this weren't true, then UASF would have been no threat, and we'd have 2x blocksize right now.

@_date: 2019-05-16 01:17:51
Whether you're trolling or not, I will answer, in case someone else finds this.
Bitcoin's use-case is freedom. Freedom from any third party telling you what you can and can't do with your money, aka censorship. When you use visa, you can't receive payments if you are in the porn, gambling, or even the outskirts of a drug business (such as CBD oil). When you use paypal, they shut you down for whatever reason they want. When you use a bank, they stop you from sending wire transfers to crypto exchanges. In bitcoin, no one can tell you that you cannot transact. And when you do transact, no one can reverse that transaction. All of those entites above can reverse anything they want. With bitcoin, your transaction is set in stone, it cannot be changed. It is immutable. 
These are the properties of bitcoin. To accomplish that use-case, we send every transaction to every person in the network. If you do not care about those properties, which you shouldn't/wouldn't for most daily transactions, then there is no need to use bitcoin. And why would you? Why would you need or want to send a copy of your weekly milk purchase to every person in the network? Is such a transaction at risk of being censored? Are you worried that such a transaction might get reversed? When you have to send a copy of everything to everyone, it is inefficient BY DESIGN. Bitcoin will never compete with paypal or visa when it comes to speed and fees. Those services only keep one copy of everything. And therefore they are in total control, they have all the power, they can tell you what you can or can't do.
So when you come from the perspective of thinking that Bitcoin is supposed to be a payment network ala Paypal, then of course you come to the conclusion that scaling is important, and of course you are outraged by high fees and slow confirmations. But if that's all you care about, just use paypal/visa. They've already solved the problem of low fees and fast speed. They are better than bitcoin in those areas and always will be.
When you come from the perspective that Bitcoin is supposed to be about freedom from censorship and freedom from inflation, that those are the only value propositions and advantages that Bitcoin offers over other systems, then you realize that we hold onto those properties first above all else. That's the problem Bitcoin is solving. Speed and fees are secondary concerns.
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:00:43

Because you didn't make any point. All you claimed was "its not a good property" without giving any justification for that nonsensical statement.

And of course liquidity providers should be rewarded (fees) for providing that service.

The point I was making is that, for all of your transactions that do not need freedom, or that do not need trustlessness, then just use normal methods, like paypal, visa, or fiat cash. If you are buying a bottle of milk, you are at no risk of censorship, no one cares whether or not you do it, no government or third party is going to stop you, you are at very low risk of having that transaction reversed, and even if it is reversed its no big deal, so go ahead and use cash or creditcard.
If you want censorship resistance, if you want freedom of your money, then you pay the required fee to have those features. Right now, EVERYONE wants that, thats why demand is high and fees are high. When less people are requesting those use-cases, then fees will be lower, and you can use it too.
If real adoption happens, then at that point hopefully more technical solutions will have been added, such as lightning network on a 2nd layer on top of bitcoin, which will offer you very low fees and very fast txn times. Then you'll be able to do all of your low cost txns and still get the benefits of freedom and censorship resistance.

Ok. Now do you really need to make sure your transaction for $100 is non-reversible? Of course its preferable, but during times of high demand (which in turn create high fees), I'm sure another medium would suffice in the mean time. The point is, most smaller transactions do not need the security and redundancy and immutability and censorship resistance that the bitcoin network provides.
In fact, usually for such small transactions you DO want the transaction to be reversible. That's why credit card chargebacks exist. If a business mis-represents their product and scams you, your credit card company can reimburse you

No, the goal was to replace systems of trust involving third parties.
But, this is the core of the debate, and what I was leading you towards with my question as to what benefits you think bitcoin provides. Apparently you think the benefit that bitcoin provides is being a better payment infrastructure compared to paypal or visa. I think that's absurd. If that was the goal, why would you ever think you can accomplish that goal by sending a copy of every transaction ever in the history of the coin, to every participant in the network. That's about as inefficient as can be. Storing the history of all transactions, across every single participant in the network, is surely to be slower and incur higher costs, than if you were simply store all transactions in one place.
And I hope you're not serious with your escrow comment. Using an escrow on top of bitcoin will incur the very same extra fees that you're currently complaining about.

Of course onchain fees will be high. They need to be, otherwise why would miner's ever mine in the first place? Miners need to be paid. We pay them with fees. Right now miners are rewarded with a handout of coins per block to encourage the network to grow out of its infancy state, so right now they don't need the fees.
As far as your link
I don't have time to fully read it, BUT lets just pretend for the sake of argument that the point of the article is completely accurate and correct and there is no solution to that problem. Then what? The conclusion is that LN won't be good for smaller txns below the onchain fee threshold. I guess that just ends up meaning that bitcoin as a small payment solution doesn't work in practice. So what? Use paypal,venmo,visa for small payments then. What's the problem?

Yes your question was badly worded, probably because it wasn't a question. Seems like your mind is already made up. I think you're looking to be proven wrong and argue, instead of asking a question and learning. You've framed it as though you are inquisitive but this reeks of trolling. You have so many people responding and helping you understand. Are you getting what they're saying yet? Or have you just reinforced your previous position?
If we just stick to the question in the title, "are non mining nodes important", then the answer is obviously yes, because otherwise how can you ever know that your coins and txns follow the rules you want? Some people want their coins to not be doubly spent, and do not want inflation in the money supply. If you don't run a node to validate these things yourself, then you are giving up trust. Bitcoin was meant to be trustless.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:50:45


That assumption is correct when talking about the 51% attack of re-ordering transactions. This is the normal 51% attack that most people refer to, because it defines the double spend problem. How do two people on opposite sides of the planet resolve the issue of which transaction came first? We use PoW consensus.  As long as the majority of hashpower is not trying to re-order txns then we are ok.
Majority hash is NOT enough when it comes to changing the rules. Because what if governments have taken over the miners? What if governments are trying to change the rules of the chain in their favor? Then what? In your opinion, we're all doomed.
In the first case of a majority hash reorg, the two forks would be two valid chains. That is, both chainforks would pass full node validation. Both forks can literally be accepted as "bitcoin" as we know it. That's why the 51% reorg attack is dangerous. In the second case of a majority hash rulechange, we don't have two valid chains, but rather we have one valid chain, and one invalid chain (invalid according to the old ruleset). This attack has nothing to do with txn ordering, but rather with changing the [rules of the coin]( Suppose the majority of miners starting mining BCH. Now BCH would have the longest and strongest chain. Their chain follows different rules. But you don't know that you're on the new BCH chain because you haven't validated anything for yourself.
Luckily, in reality, we aren't doomed, because we can run our own nodes and verify our own txns.


Miners are incentivized to be honest by the very fact that users are able to validate and verify their own transactions. That's why UASF worked. Not because of a certain # of node count. But rather because users have the power to check the miner's work, and make sure that the miners are honest, and that the miner's are providing the service that we are paying them for.
With this dynamic at play, then the great breakthrough you talk about exists: every participant, miners and users, only have to act in their own best financial interest, and the game theory enables the network to be balanced. It truly is ingenius how it works.

You still keep repeating the stuff about "helping" the network. The beauty of bitcoin is that each individual participant, both miners and users, only have to think about themselves, they only have to think in their own best interest, and everything just works. In fact, the network is stronger when they all do that. When you help yourself, you help the network. Because you are PART of the network.

Fair enough, but then this gets to the root of the issue. No point in talking about mining or non-mining nodes if the real issue you are arguing for is ease of use.
I don't "heavily" disagree with your position. But I will just say this: bitcoin wasn't created to be a better paypal, to be a better payment system. That's pretty much what you are arguing for when you say you want ease of use (probably in terms of speed and fees).
Consider: in bitcoin, we send every single transaction in the history of the network, to every single user/node in the network. How impractical and inefficient do you think that is? Extremely. How costly is that? Much more costly than just keeping everything in one place.
Why do we do those things? What is bitcoin's use-case? What is its value proposition? What is wrong with paypal?
Bitcoin's ONLY value proposition is censorship resistance and trustlessness from third parties. That's the goal. The goal is not to enable cheap txns. It is not to enable fast txns. Paypal and Visa already do those, and they will always do it better. Bitcoin cannot compete with those two in those areas. They have an inherent advantage: they don't have to send everything to everyone. They only keep one copy of txns. They are in control of that copy. Where bitcoin does compete, where bitcoin does have an advantage, is decentralization, where we don't have to trust anyone, where txns cannot be reversed, where no one can tell us what to do with our money, where our currency isn't inflated to nothing. Decentralization IS the means to that end. Decentralization is the TOOL that allows us to accomplish those goals.
Without those properties, bitcoin is nothing more than a worse version of paypal. Now, that doesn't mean we can't try to built faster and cheaper layers ON TOP of bitcoin (such as lightning). And with technological advances it looks like we can. But if the base layer is insecure, then there's no point in worrying about those conveniences.


See there's the thing. You take "fighting back" for granted. As if its a given. The reason we can fight back is because we can verify that the txns follow our rules. In your scenario, with everyone on SPV, how will anyone know to fight back? No one is doing any validating. Now, "no one" is probably hyperbole, because obviously some exchanges and wallet providers would have to run a node. But what if governments coerced those entities as well? Regardless, you are talking about "trustlessness", but if you are waiting for someone else to tell you when to fight back (such as a webwallet, SPV wallet, exchange, social media), that means you are trusting them to tell you the truth. You are trusting them to verify the rules of the network. And you are trusting them to be fast enough to also spread the news to you fast enough that you become aware of it before you make a potential life altering txn. What if you are mid-txn when this hypothetical takeover happens? You are screwed because you are trusting what your SPV or webwallet says. If you simply check your own node, you are never in danger.


Maybe my example is farfetched when talking about inflated currency supply in terms of miners, but not so if governments decide to take over the miners. Then increasing the max currency supply is no longer out of the question.
But you can also take the max block size rule instead. Do you want trustlessness or not? Do you want to put your trust in miners or not? Consider this: suppose you and your community wanted to increase the blocksize to raise capacity of the network. So you jump on an SPV wallet that claims to follow these new 2mb block rules, and that SPV wallet trusts the longest chain. Guess what, the longest chain only has 1mb blocks. Those damn untrustworthy miners didn't increase to 2mb. So your SPV wallet is following the 1mb chain. SPV headers do not check blocksize. They do not check for max 21m coins. So you put your trust in the SPV wallet, thinking your rules of 2mb blocks are being followed, when in actuality, the longest chain is 1mb blocks. The only reason this isn't happening in BCH SPV wallets right now, is because they had to specifically change the POW difficulty so that the headers would be different. The whole SPV argument goes out the window. Its ignorance by them, at best. Malicious scammy dishonesty at worst.


Well that's one of the benefits of bitcoin. Its immutability. It pretty much never changes. So users don't need to keep up with the news. You never have to upgrade unless there is a hard forking rulechange. That's also why hard forks are so dangerous and should be avoided. People can still use old non-segwit txns just fine and the network still accepts them. Thats why you do soft forks. It makes the upgrades optional, not required.

You would assume wrong


So you're pretty much saying that we're doomed if 51%+ of miners are dishonest. That would suck. Luckily I don't think that's the case. I think its something that we can overcome. But perhaps because you can't see that eventuality and the potential solutions, is the reason why you are misunderstanding.
What would happen if 51% of miners decide to change the rules, whether increasing from 21million coins to 22million, or increasing from 1mb blocks to 2mb blocks? And suppose most validating end user nodes don't want that change and stand on their principles for 21mil max coins (or 1mb blocks). What would happen?
Here's what would happen. The miners would keep mining the 22mil coin chain. That chain would become the longest and stronges because it has the most hash power. No users who run their nodes would accept those blocks. So the miners would likely be mining empty blocks. Well, we can imagine that there are plenty of users who don't run nodes and therefore don't validate or verify anything, and just blindly follow what a block explorer website says. If that block explorer website decides that they will follow the 22mil miner chain, then all users of that website would still accept those txns as real. So probably the new blocks won't be empty.
But the majority of users who are standing on the principles for the 21mil cap, they have no hashpower on their chain. So their chain is stagnant. All miners are on the new 22mil chainfork. So the old chain is at a standstill. We need to start generating blocks. So users maybe start mining on their own home PCs. Or users maybe go out and buy mining equipment and start mining their own chain. The difficulty will adjust down after 2 weeks and then we can get things rolling again. Or users can get together and agree on a POW algorithm change. There are options. They aren't good in the short term. But do we stand for 21mil max coins or not? In this scenario, we'd have two chains. The majority of users would be use the smaller chain because that chain has the rules we want. Guess what? Miners would then move over to the smaller chain, because users would value their service and pay them heavily for it. The difficulty will be low so it will be easy to solve blocks. Miners serve the users because they are financially motivated to do so.
That's grassroots in action. That's why at a certain education level (way far out), this thing might be unstoppable. But right now, no one has a clue how any of this works, and no one even cares about what rules they follow. That's why they're happy not to run a node, not to validate, and rather just give up their trust and believe whatever a block explorer website says. 
With great power comes great responsibility, and being your own bank has lots of responsibility. Consider how much knowledge you'd need to start your own physical bank on the corner. You'd need to be well educated in a very many things. Bitcoin doesn't require that much knowledge, but it does require some, and it requires people taking responsibility and shouldering risk. Most people don't want to do that. When they are willing to do those things in order to reap the benefits it provides, then you have a revolution.

Rewrite the history of the blockchain. Basically convince (influence, pay, etc) the miners to discard the newer blocks with the hacked txns, and go back in time \~50 blocks or so and start mining on top of that. There would be a chain split, but the "longest chain wins", so you'd be at a huge disadvantage trying to catch up. F
Further, even IF you did catch up and create a longer chain, end-users could still decide to accept the shorter chain as the truth, deciding to vote against such reorgs

Do not think of inflation/deflation in terms of prices.  
Think of it in terms of money supply. Inflation is the increase of the money supply. That means, over time, more USD (and ETH) gets dumped into the market by the central bank. Obviously if more houses kept getting dumped into the market, the value/price of your house would decrease. And so it is with USD/fiat/ETH, unlimited inflation causes the value of each individual USD to go down, meaning it requires more USDs to pay for a particular item (inflation of prices).  
Theoretically, when a money supply is fixed, ala BTC, then the value of each individual BTC would rise, requiring less BTC to pay for a particular item: deflation of prices
Fixed money supply encourages and rewards savers. Inflating money supply rewards borrowers. That is why the biggest lie is to tell people to "get out of debt". That makes no sense. When working with an inflating money supply, you are actually REWARDED for going into debt. You should take on as much debt as possible, so long as you can honestly repay it, and you use the debt to make smart investments. Debt to buy TVs and cars is retarded. Debt to invest relative to the dollar is smart.. Because you will be repaying the debt in the future with less valuable dollars. Going into debt is the same as shorting the dollar. Getting out of debt is going long on the dollar.

The beauty of bitcoin is that you only have to act in your own best interest, and everything works.
The benefit for the community is negligible. If you want to "give back" there are much better ways. You aren't "giving back to community" very much at all by simply RUNNING the node. The only real way that this helps the community is if you actually USE your node as your wallet, and when you make transactions, you look at your node for confirmation that the transaction is processed, and you don't look at some website block explorer. You help the community in this way only because you are helping yourself: now you are an actual participant, and actual peer in the network. You now have a say in what type of transactions you will accept. You have power over the rules of the money you will accept. The network has grown stronger by adding one single person who is thinking for themselves and consciously choosing to enforce the rules of money they want. You haven't "given" anything to the community. You've strengthened the community by +1 person
The benefit for yourself is that you can now verify and be sure that all of the transactions you receive adhere to the rules of the software you've chosen. Such rules are fairly important: no double spends, no inflation, etc. Now you don't have to trust anyone. When you use a webwallet or thin wallet, you are trusting whatever the blockchain explorer website says, or you are trusting what Electrum wallet says, etc etc. They have the power over you. You've GIVEN them the power by using their service as your "truth". When you run your node, you only have to trust your own software, and since its open source, you can read the source and know what you're running, and what rules youre accepting. When you make a trade and someone pays you, now you tell them, "Send me XXX btc to YYY address, and I will wait for Z confirmations". And then you USE your node by looking at YOUR node to verify when the coins arrive and confirm. You don't look at some website. If you look at the website for confirmation, now you've placed your trust in the website. If you look at your node, now you don't trust anyone but your own software.
This is not just a trivial point. This philosophy underpins bitcoin. And if you aren't crystal clear about all of this, keep asking more questions and learning, so that you understand what we're trying to accomplish

The metric you're looking for is "enough decentralization". Can you quantify that? No one can. You want to raise the blocksize, then get to work educating as many people as you can about bitcoin, get them bought into philosophically to the network, to the point where they're willing to risk their time and money to fight for a cause.

When you receive a txn, you might just want to make sure that the coins you received follow the rules of the network. The only way to do that is to have your node run the checks necessary to make sure everything is correct (aka verify or validate).
Otherwise, you are trusting a third party, either a website block explorer, or some thin light wallet, to do the verifying for you.

I see you ignored the question as to why bitcoin exists and what the goal is. Of course you did, because that is the root of your entire misunderstanding.


I just told you the metric, and you respond as if you didn't even read it. Fee size isn't the metric to determine whether a doubling of the blocksize would work for me.
What level would a doubling of blocksize work for me personally? I have no idea. Maybe 500k independent operators, using their fully validating nodes to verify their transactions. And maybe no mining pool controlling no more than 10% hash power. Those numbers are completely arbitrary off the top of my head and I have no idea if they are realistic. Just giving you an example of using the metric I was talking about. I already said that I can't quantify it in my last post.
And none of this even touches on the fact that fees are necessary to pay miners for their service once the inflation of the currency ends. Do you even know what service miners provide?
