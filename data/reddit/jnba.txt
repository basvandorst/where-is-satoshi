People give too much attention to trolls. Meaning you give them what they want. Please stop, just ignore.
There are other problems to address that I would like to see discussed and from where we can all learn and evolve. 
Everyone already knows that fees are high and blocks are small. And we also know that trolls will say that bigger blocks are the best and that bitcoin is doomed. I'm a bit tired of this dick measuring contest. We can discuss other matters than programming. Scaling brigs new problems, discuss them is nothing but healthy IMO.

Get your point, but I think I was misunderstood. If you are investing you want return, I agree. But people who see bitcoin as forex are missing the whole point. Bitcoin is the most incredible socio/economic experiment I had the privilege to watch and is our proof of concept to use blockchain to change the financial system. I don't know if in the future we will see bitcoin as our safebox and move to other alts to run our lives, but right now I think we need to prove this can work to start building a truly new system.

But if they panic sell all together, we all feel it. And I think that will be a problem, these new accounts are people o want to make money, not people who believe in the technology. They will panic sell more easily I guess.

If you are a startup right now, and you are going to venture capital, they will try to understand your product/service and its relevance, they will evaluate your team and try to understand if you are able to succeed, and then they will speculate about how much should they pay you for some equity.
I see bitcoin a little like that. I understood and saw its relevance, I believe in some devs behind it and their competencies, and in my opinion, what I'm paying for some "equity" is still undervalued for the good that can bring to the world. What do you think? I can be completely wrong..

I have to say, it's so nice to see everyone working to solve a real problem for scaling bitcoin. Gald to see this!
It's important to understand that marketing is on our side.

I'm worried about this propaganda. We know because we care, but most people don't.. The scam website they created is really good, they never mention bitcoin cash anywhere. And how the hell that website can be put down? When you search on google for "bitcoin", the scam site is the first! I think this is serious marketing..
