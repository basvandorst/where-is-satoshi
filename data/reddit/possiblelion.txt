Tere, ma ka üks bitcoiniga tegelv eestlane, võin aidata.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:36:35
the point is, that its going to be made a bitcoin center
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:17:20
stop being so fucking paranoid, shits being downvoted because 99% of the posts concerning mt.gox are baseless speculation
stop talking about shit you have no idea about
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:29:22
well not really, as the volume didn't drop almost at all when Silk Road was raided and shocked everybody by closing
at that time there weren't any reliable new markets to scoop people up who want to buy drugs over the internet
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:15:52
haha, gratz on the gold, but maybe we could try tipping more bitcoin too!

@_date: 2014-03-07 19:39:19
It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:56:36
wait, how do you know this is Mt.Gox wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:27:13
holy shit that would be so cool in real life

In a new interview with the Wall Street Journal, 
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès says that what was once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange should probably have hired more security, revealing that there were physical break-ins at the firm's Tokyo office. 
Those would be in addition to the online hack that drained the company of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin.
"If anyone wants to start a Bitcoin exchange, I would say, 'Be sure to have 24-hour security guards,'" Karpelès says.

Can you just generally describe the place? How did you get there? 
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:36:16
LHV is very well respected bank here in Estonia, they recently hired a full-time cryptocurrency expert:
 "This is the first known example of a traditional bank looking into providing Bitcoin banking services, but it is hardly the first Bitcoin bank." [Source](
It seems that that that new employee paid off quite quickly as Coinbase chose the bank for their bitcoin and tech friendliness.
 
I will translate a quote by Dan Romero, who works at Coinbases in Business Development, that was printed in a large circulation Estonian newspaper:
"LHV had a cryptocurrency expert sitting behind their desk. I have never encountered such a thing at a bank before although my whole job is talking with banks".

too bad its got Mark's smug mug plaster all over it

to be correct, people are clamoring for regulation for bitcoin, but for companies that are actively committing fraud  **using** bitcoin. It doesn't matter if they're using the dollar, bitcoin or the Nigerian naira, fraud is fraud.
What the community **doesn't** want however is the government regulating bitcoin as a technology itself.
Other than that, quite accurate and funny comments.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:00:46
bitcoin is just teaching what people have knows for thousands of years - don't trust anybody and that everybody has some kind of private interest for which they are willing to fuck you over
happened in 2008 with the fin. system and its gonna keep happening
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:02:56
first one to publicly announced it, that's for sure
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:25:56
um the rise in price wasn't because of this, it was mainly because of the UK lifting the 20% tax on bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:26:39
this guy can't affect anything in europe or the rest of the world so lol nope
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:11:00
very nice responses and everything about bitcoin, too bad the Keiser Report and RT in general is full of bullshit
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:06:07
wow those comments are terrible
@_date: 2014-03-15 13:24:53
because it's convenient, even though there might be red flags not many people care 
take mt.gox for example, people knew the dangers but they kept on using it
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:54:03
yup, i saw it too
the api is still working
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:08:15
i think Mark should do an IAmA, that would be the best way
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:05:21
this article is complete bullshit, nothing was laundered through the Estonian Central Bank, it was *one bank owned by Danes, called Danske Bank (Danish Bank)* that laundered money through their Estonian subsidiary. 
Nothing to do with the ECB.
@_date: 2013-06-09 10:42:10
yep, bought some coins too 
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:18:28
probrably because most people haven't really heard of Estonia/assume it's some irrelevant eastern european country
