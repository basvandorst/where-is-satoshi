You are right and the other guy is right as well. It was somewhat of a "perfect storm" of bad things going on.

@_date: 2015-06-04 12:22:21

Centralized = under the control of a few.
Decentralized = not under control of a few.
Centralized mining would be "under the control of a few".
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:39:10
All aspects. Apparently this topic has not had enough discussion to have the meaning of general terms.
I can give another definition : 
Decentralized = having no set point of centralization.
But if there is no set definition of terms, the Bitcoin community should start some.

*Corporations are often linked to governments. Bitcoin and blockchain technology may cause them to die as they won’t be able to compete with blockchain-using companies. If bitcoin may free financial sector and market altogether from government regulation, we most probably won’t hear from present corporations ever again. The competition around limited resources will destroy everything that prevents people from living long and prospering,” says Alexey Sherstnev, a decentralization expert.*

Your accountant would probably have a better answer than this, but here goes:
Keep your own list of daily prices from:
It would be pretty apparent to use the exchange with the highest volume. Take an average based on the pay period you use.
If you want to be even more exact, before taking an average based on your pay period, get a daily average  from the top exchanges by volume. Then apply that to your pay period.

• Having a trustworthy money source that will not be inflated is like having "money in the bank", so to speak. 
• The inflation (of USD) for those who have had US dollars in the bank means they have less purchasing power now than they did when they put those dollars in the bank.
• Plus, if people start to take Bitcoin payments now, they will probably have MORE money (Bitcoin), since the purchasing power of Bitcoin is going up.

It usually takes a breaking point for things; "to, well, break...".
It is possible banks would make fiat less self-destructive because of things like ßitcoin.

• But it is perhaps the presence of an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that represents the most significant departure from past devices.
• "Regulation, application, security and education could be considered to be the main things holding back mass adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain in general," David Thomas, CEO of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency exchange GlobalBlock, told The Independent.

Basically, the world does not follow or support **what** leaders do, they follow **why** they do it. When it comes to new innovation, like the airplane, the rich fail because they fail to have a **why**.
The tipping point when new innovation really takes off is when about 15% adopt the new technology. At that point, the technology surges.

The "Golden Ratio" was (probably) used to construct the Great Pyramid of Giza. 
• One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the π-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47') are also quite close. 
• Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation. Several other Egyptian pyramids are very close to the rational 3:4:5 shape.

But this law was given for the USA only. Could it happen to all the countries ?
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:14:40
Sorry, this country has what is called; "Checks and balances". It is what makes this political ideology superior to having a small group of unelected Communist "cronies" in charge.
Having a small group of unelected people in charge is MUCH more dangerous than the capitalist system. 
I can explain it as basic as it gets. There are basically two forms of government:
• Think and act for ourselves.
  or
• Have others think and act for us.
  &gt;
A great US president once said that we are born "Free and independent.".
That would be the first group. While there are variations on the two basic groups, Communism and Socialism rub humanity the wrong way, because we humans are created to be...."creative".
As such, dictators and communist systems seek to oppress the "free thinkers" (creative ones).
While in the end, it is the creativity that brings the innovation which propels humanity forward.
References to the "freedom" that we all should enjoy must be abolished under the Communist way of thinking.

I hope I could get those who like Bitcoin to think more about the future. Bitcoin will have to get stronger and adapt or it will not be viable. 
There may be a time when the "Star Trek" idea of "[the replicator]( will be here. I do not think it will be in any of our lifetimes. 
The winner in this money scenario will be easy to spot, because the majority will be using it. The technical people behind the scenes of Bitcoin will be the heroes. 
With all the "yays" and "nays" of whether or not Quantum computers will destroy the security of Bitcoin, I am thinking they will not. Someone will come up with a new idea to negate the Quantum "menace".

@_date: 2019-01-18 15:09:17
There is not a thing on the planet that is all the way perfect. Not people, not animals, not anything. Even if there were, we could not measure the perfection because the tools we use are imperfect as well. Absolute perfection is in the mind, and we judge something perfect, just because we think it is. If we ever actually saw perfection, we probably would not identify it correctly.
To balance this problem (if it is a "problem") out, if things just work they way they are supposed to, they serve us well. Bitcoin is this way. It is a system designed to serve us well. It depends on us, not on a small group of people. Is Bitcoin perfect? NO. Is it awesome? YES!
Does it work? YES!

It is called the:
"Law of Diffusion of Innovation".

For the lazy:
* Fundstrat's Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to issue formal price targets on bitcoin, said two weeks ago that $9,000 is a "major low" for bitcoin and "the biggest buying opportunity in 2018."
* The $9,000 to $10,000 price range has been a difficult one for bitcoin to break below since first topping $10,000 in late November.

India tried that and got "busted" recently. They turned back to regular cash from what I can see.

Vertcoin is also a spinoff of Bitcoin. That does not make a Vertcoin a Bitcoin. 
The makers of Vertcoin are preventing it from being centralized by the use of ASIC technology.

It is better to have more choices than less. Nevertheless, how many people are fully aware of what a "Segwit" and a "Segwit 2x" is? 
I am just partially up on  what Segwit is even for, and now there are **two** of them? The world is used to NOT knowing how their money works. Now we are, if we use Bitcoin. 
The herd mentality will take over and the best coin will win for the masses based on how much they know. Even more basically, what they want and believe will control what is about to happen. 
Bitcoin is like the first year model of a car. The first year model has lots of bugs in it. The bugs get taken out with successive model years. But the first year is the model that is worth more to later investors.

Price volatility is expected to be low,  but cryptocurrencies won’t probably fall or increase by several thousand percentage points.

One of the best assets you have is your brain. Its great to ask questions, but it is best to follow your own desires. 
So you have a desire to make money with cryptocurrencies. Mining would be a good place to start. Learn to code, as others have said, but only do all of this if these things are something you would consider doing for a hobby, not as a "job".
If doing these things looks like a "job" to you, first find out where your strengths are and dig into those areas first.

If there is an API online for these types of things/pages, you may be able to pull from that API on your own secure site.
Give them password access.
Can be stored in a database using javascript, PHP and MySql. The biggest problem will be security.

What a lot do not remember is that after all the 21 million Bitcoins have been mined, the miners are still going to make money on transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:12:46
Bitcoin is a valuta:
(rare) the value of one currency in terms of its exchange rate with another
....For the masses, but there are some that live exclusively on it as their first currency.
Any technology follows a law called the "Law of Diffusion of Innovation"
Bitcoin has the jump on everyone on that one. That does not mean there will not be new challengers. Generic blockchain technology is a fascinating subject. Banks are already catching on to it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:53:32
Namecoin is one of those and was the first fork of the Bitcoin software. No one seems to talk much about Namecoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:12:23
Was there a premine with this coin? It is called "Navajocoin" as well?
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:50:05
Good luck.
Hope she says; "yes".
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:12:15
ßitcoin could be the thing that is keeping the recession at bay. The bankers could be seeing that people may abandon the traditional fiat in favor of something outside their control.

When people say that Bitcoin is just used for the "darknet" and for "bad things", they are probably paid trolls. 
It has always been that Bitcoin not truly anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:09:41
That they are totally anonymous forms of payment.

Hopefully the hosting company for the email account will be around in 12 years. Plus they will need to pay for 12 years of hosting.

You posted this right on time. Predictions are worthless if someone has never predicted correctly before. It takes experience and people need to see that past experience before they just go out and believe someone because it; "sounds good".
I saw a guy use a graph the other month and make a prediction... he turned out to be **completely right**. I am sure he is tons smarter than I am.

This is the question most everyone wants answered. Where is that "reminder bot"?
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:39:23
This is the best news I have heard all week!
@_date: 2017-07-07 03:52:46
You are welcome.
Some people are more human than bottish on reddit. ☺
Learn to make computers do what you want them to do - by learning their language. That is what it means to "learn to code". If this is not something you already have an interest/desire/gift for, please dont try it.
Please note I strung that "interest/desire/gift" thing together. If you end up doing something you hate for the rest of your life, remember I warned you. Usually the things people like doing, they also have a natural gift (or tendency) towards those things. 
What will you do with your coding experience? **Hopefully make the next big thing.** Let your creative abilities flow.

Your transaction probably also activated the KYC - Know Your Customer - protocol. It was over $10,000 USD. 
I wish you luck. I would go with the "lawyering up" option.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:42:32
Smart advice.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:52:10
And they are **designed** to do so.

I saw this in the sidebar:

When people start to use the dollar do they understand how it works? No, they just started using it because everyone else did.
The euro, the franc, the deutschmark; when people started to use them, did they understand how it all worked? No.
You do not need anyone's permission to use Bitcoin. If you and your local group decide to use it, you do not have to understand how it works to use it do you? You just use it.
It is possible that an outsider could come in with "tons" of BTC. But that could happen with dollars, euros, francs as well.
The new day we live in has people asking basic questions like; "What is money?". 
It is backed by the faith of the people that already use it. All an individual has to do is start using it.

If you can get Bitcoin to replace MPesa (Africa) this would be an automatic adoption.

Of course it will. The fact that it exists means it will succeed.

Something physical with the passphrase in it / on it and keep it as a trust for that length of time. I just had a spark of an idea. You could create a legal document that will be stored in the local county clerk's office. It could contain the passphrase unaware's to the clerk.

What is going to happen in 2019?

Why not just call them a sale?
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:44:58
This exact reason is why people use other altcoins. I like Bitcoin and hope it has success. The centralisation that has happened, as you have said, is the direct opposite that should have happened with this coin.
Since this is the Bitcoin subreddit, I will not mention names, but there is already a coin out there that is "asic resistant". It is, and will not be possible for "Mr Money Bags" to come along and wipe out all the other miners with custom-made mining hardware.
Long live Bitcoin. Centralising something that was created to be decentralised is a cancer.

Probably more than once a day.

Being critical is good. Being both critical and optimistic is better. Nothing is impossible. How many times has it been said that, "Bitcoin is dead"?

"It just went down $500!"
"It just went up $300...!"
"It just went...".. and on and on it goes for newbies. The price is important, but not the most important thing for a digital currency.
Let markets be markets and focus on the revolution, not just the price.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:06:14
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:40:04
This is exactly right, because the world knows the dollar as the "world currency". China has been trying to get theirs classified as the "world currency". Bitcoin is just a natural.

Go with a Credit Union. You will become "part owner" of the system with a voice in what goes on.

Vertcoin did not have a premine.

At the beginning of this year it was at $928. At the beginning of 2016 it was $361. Most would go for a 300% return on investment in less than a New York second.

As long as Bitcoin remains decentralized it will stay the King of coins. If not, the others will remain interesting.

Silver is not as controlled as gold and silver may also be going up in value soon. It could be a double-win situation to keep your value in silver.

Forward-thinking individuals like yourself are right because everything (especially markets) goes in cycles.
