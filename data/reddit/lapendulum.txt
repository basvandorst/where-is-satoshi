It's not a program, you are not even reading what I write to anyone else but yourself?
I say it requires the cooperation of some parties and there is a guarantee user base of 20+ million people that would instantly be into Bitcoin.

The user base that the people would be targeting are bigger than any crypto currency user base so far. I don't think bitcoin is 100% the one or even 50% the one. I respect the members of Bitcoin Community more though.

It's sort of evil because it abuses one of the positives of bitcoin, so you could easily trick people into just making the jump. Which is a good thing but also kind of I don't know. Also the number I posted, 20+ million is a fact and that would be a big clue if someone realizes what it is.

I think if I were to tell anyone it.
The people I tell would have to be coinbase and other parties that would fund it because it requires cooperation from some parties but the payoff in the end of the huge audience jumping in and thus the worth.
I don't know what to do?
Getting people to use it so good can be done in this world is good. But I'm very much against manipulation of people to get them into doing something.

I understand that but if you believe people would actually get up and use their energy to do it. Wouldn't you be wary of it.

There is a 20+ million audience and it's basically how the best way is to target them. Using the cooperation from some parties, that is a huge hint of why I'm wary of suggesting it.

I just don't like the idea of manipulation being used to get people to use it.

People prefer to jump the gun on anything in this world. Without ever considering the philosophical aspect of is it right.

I also own Bitcoin because I see it eventually or some crypto currency becoming popular.
I own it because I endorse the concept of it.

Yes, I've always battled with seeing it in the world and I don't want to really be a part of it. I can also see why it exists and the good/bad that comes from it. I program for my career right now and think bitcoin is huge for people in parts of the world that can't obtain funds to do anything. I'm not sure what to do...

I am a developer and program frequently. If that makes any difference to telling you, that you jump the gun on people and don't consider things anymore in your life.
