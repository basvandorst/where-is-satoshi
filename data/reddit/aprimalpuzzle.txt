The problem with consumption in inflationary scenarios is it encourages irrational consuming of goods and services instead of well reasoned spending. Doesn't mean goods a services won't still be consumed.
In inflationary economies actors in markets will always be forced to invest  their capital and ignore negative market signals leading to crashes.

With a trezor you write down a 12-24 word seed that gives you access to all the funds from all generated addresses on the device even it is lost, stolen, or broken. You'll only need that seed to restore to another trezor or compliant wallet software like mycelium. The downside is you have to keep that seed physically secure because anyone that has access to it can steal your coins. Also, you setup a pin# so that if someone gains access to the trezor they can't take your coins.
All things considered, I think it's a good solution for safely storing your coins.

It's hard to say. Sometimes it does one well to step back from a day to day view and try and apply the ramifications of bitcoin/block chain in a historical sense. In the the next few decades I have no doubt that systems of immutable distributed trust will revolutionize not just finance but profoundly change how we fundamentally convey value to one another. How that will come about, I just don't know but I get a sense that it will be of the scale of the industrial revolution and the Internet. When you take that perspective everything in the short term is just noise.

I ordered an Xboxone from them and the same thing happened to me. Now I'm out the 40$ gift card promised, presumably, and stuck with 300 in gift cards to newegg. I used bitcoin because of the 50$ discount they offered for paying in bitcoin. So if I wanted to reorder the Xbox from them it would cost me 90$ more than I expected to pay if I take in account the gift card. I was too busy to resolve this today, but needless to say I would be weary of using bitcoin to buy anything from Newegg. 
Edit: I see you made the exact same order as me OP. Something is not right about this. I suspect they unintentionally had the bitcoin discount left up and they had no intentions of fulfilling the order.

I suppose saving is all about protecting unspent labor. Individuals will have to make their own value determination about how best to do that.

Ask yourself why bitcoin is still around 6 years after its introduction. Is it by chance or is a resilient, dynamic system that provides utility to its users? If you think cryptocurrency will be around in the future, what are the chances it will be bitcoin/Bitcoin token and blockchain? Does it make sense for a nation state to release a cryptocurrency?
What would it actually take for bitcoin to fail catastrophically to the point that it couldn't be patched? IMO if global shared consensus is still around in a decade or so it will secured by bitcoin token. And I don't think it's a stretch that it might be more valuable at that point...
