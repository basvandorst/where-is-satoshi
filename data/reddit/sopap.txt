they bought ClarkMoody, which was deeply integrated with MtGox. Can this be a sign? But again I am mostly dreaming since Karpeles confiscated few of my coins.

I would have agreed with you couple months ago, but given many recent events, I don't think Africa is ready at all. Have you ever been to Africa? People still use windows 95 and pentium II in a lot of places, and are completely oblivious as to what anti-viruses are. Africa should stay away from bitcoin. The bitcoin community is full of greedy hackers.

@_date: 2014-03-23 14:45:33
I think that's a minor problem that can be fixed. I am sure I can convert bitcoin into any currency, even if I have to use an intermediary currency in the process

Right place, right time. Overstock is about to be unstoppable. Watch out Amazon
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:58:56
This is flawed. I suspect this is how the survey was designed 
Do you know bitcoin?
if yes, would you choose it over gold?
Knowing bitcoin is not understanding its fundamental logic. I bet most of those who chose gold still believe that BTC is only linked to the dark alley of drugs, guns and money launderers. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:29:09
Well, we get taxed on USD because of the interest rate payment the country has to make on his debts. With bitcoin, government will sell bonds for bitcoin and the interest would be paid in bitcoin, as well. But that time is so far far away... IRS can suck a nut for the time being.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:09:35

This might explain why they moved all the coins... just in case someone tried to seize their servers. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:42:20
There you go, Karpeles. You fucked up on so many levels. FUD or not
@_date: 2014-04-29 19:18:19
I see your point... 
I guess my problem is that Paym doesn't pose any challenge at all for bitcoin, as it is built on top of the old banking paradigm. If anything Paym is just a reactive measure to what other banks like bank of america are doing. 
Most people don't choose to use bitcoin over fiat because it is easier to use; they want lower fees, decentralization, among many other things. Bitcoin mainly challenges the current banking system, and is great for merchants - especially those in the digital goods business - because there is no chargebacks. 
Paym is just another Paypal. Even Bank of America lets users transfer money to a phone number. Nothing very revolutionary, as the fees and the connection to a central authority remain unchanged
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:33:19
Will bitcoin feed those children who will be out of work?
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:36:57

I mean that is expected from the trollbox. I don't see anything unusual here.

So it is safe to say that you all want to kill the son of a bitch. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:32:37
These people can barely understand Excel. They make so much money that they don't mind paying ivy league grads insane salaries just to watch those sheets. The technology in the banking industry (Many hedge funds included) is old and inefficient. I think asking bankers to evaluate bitcoin is like asking a 3rd grade school teacher to evaluate a college level curriculum. Cough* Anyone remembers Knight Capital?
I was one of them. The bitcoin community should not fear these fuckers.  
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:12:18
Oh... I don't like the way this Circle guy is tackling things. Bitcoin was created to fight the current system, not to become its bitch.

How are the money transmitter laws?
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:14:49

Did you try purse.io?
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:20:37
Thai Baht has one line
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:56:05
Well, only Amazon knows your credit card information as a buyer. The spender and purse don't have that information. It is anonymous in that sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:20:16
Maybe buying them from people who were actually selling real bitcoin. A lot of people, including myself used MtGox as a safe, given their 'cold store' bs and the yubi key security
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:19:09
As a buyer, none of your info is retained besides whatever you provide during the signup process (email, password, 'name'), but as a spender you must provide your information to Amazon. Purse.IO doesn't require any personal information from either side.
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:40:44
please feel free to pm me if interested. Or you can vote is down if you think it is a dumb idea.
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:49:03
Thanks for the heads up, but I am already doing a lot better trading bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:56:23
You guys clearly forget (or choose to forget) that today is April 1st
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:41:13
yeah, I think the decision is yours to make. No one has to convince anyone to hold or buy. Bitcoin is belief in something revolutionary. If you need someone to convince you, it simply means that you were never a true believer and were only in for the money. So even selling them now would means that you've lost/failed. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:18:51
now 1 to 250
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:27:53
but such a large amount would have been noticed, don't you think?
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:20:06
What about no?
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:43:12
Fair point, but the system is not ready for 150m users yet. I think many people are still ignoring this simple fact. The problem is not about growth. I have no doubt bitcoin will grow, but the technology has to grow with it or else we have greater chance of having a great reason for banning it - if $50 bn for example gets lost overnight like in MtGox case. eBay and Paypal are not quite the tech innovators I look for when I think of bitcoin growth. Google, Apple and FB are the few with great dev team I would like to see make announcements. eBay is just a facilitator, looking to save whatever they have left while scalping few bucks
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:22:50
No as in "No I don't want to", or "No I didn't lose anything"?
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:31:44

It would be nice to get my magic beans back :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:20:26
well the same thing can be said about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:24:55
What part of "Decentralized" and "Currency" don't you get? If anything goolgle can add bitcoin to their wallet and compete with Paypal and Coinbase
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:09:59
I call bullshit
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:56:40
I think most NGO don't buy a lot of supply locally. In my case for example, I buy water pumps in USD or EUR. and I will use the local currency for few other expenses like paying for the manual labor and few other things. Bitcoin being in its infancy should not be a road blocker. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:37:12
You think they might implement some new features to prevent fraud? A while ago even before Google 2FA, when I used to use Paypal for everything, I figured out a way of preventing chargebacks. Out of over 100 sales of virtual goods, I only had one Paypal chargeback that I fought and won because I had a text history with the scammer. 
My point is, by just adding a 2FA like everyone else, Paypal can easily weed out most of the fraud on their platform.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:26:30
this is not about Gox, this is about the number of single individuals with considerable amount of bitcoin

Why don't you call the feds and ask for a bailout package while you're at it. I lost a lot of coins in MtGox, and there is no way I would think -- even in my wildest dream -- that this community owns me anything. I take my bill to Monsieur Karpeles, the fat ugly kid 
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:51:34
I will be emailing you guys tonight with few samples of pages we  want to redesign. Send me your best proposal, and we will go from there.

To be honest, the majority of them doesn't have any money. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:00:28
Also, maybe I should point out that the main problem right now is that we have more buyers than spenders. So this is really good if you use amazon and have bitcoin. I personally never buy directly from Amazon anymore, but we need more Amazon spenders. I think we have a lot of buyers already
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:43:55
And it only took about 30 sec on google to find this
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:44:42
I remember when I lost money (big time) in bitcoin for the first time, a year ago. Bitcoin was up around $265 and went back down to $50 in a matter of 16 hours. I got depressed for couple days, but decided to suck it up and buy some more... I was rewarded for it last November. And of course I've lost a handful in Gox and still am losing in this current downtrend. What I am trying to say here is that if you buy more, you might be laughing couple months down the road. But again, don't sell your house or your retirement fund for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:16:52

You create a wishlist on Amazon, paste the link on purse.io and choose your discount. It usually fills in less than a day if you put 5-25%, but I have had orders fill at 45% before.

1. You can always contact us/me/[contact us] if you need information about the owners. 
2. This is not a subsidiary company. You can verify information with New York State.
3. I am sure you can find information on the whois

Don't take it seriously if you actually try it out and hate the service.  Check it out, it is not as bad as it might look
