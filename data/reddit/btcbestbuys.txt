it's not fake - I swear to Satoshi.  I can see the boat out the window from where I'm sitting actually.
if anyone is considering bidding but has questions, pm me and I will get answers.  I can answer all btc questions - any boat questions I would probably have to run by the owner, who is my good friend.  I and/or the owner would be happy to talk to serious potential bidders on the phone to alleviate any concerns and make the process as smooth as possible.
If someone does buy the boat, I imagine they would either come here to take possession of the boat and send/release the coins themselves or send a boat inspector/transporter to make sure everything was legit.  the boat is solid, the price is good and I am honest  :-)
edit: had another idea to get as close to proving the listing is legit as possible I think. You could go to the ebay listing of the boat (link in the bitmit listing) and contact the seller (who has 100% positive feedback on ~200 transactions) he will verify that I had permission to put the bitmit listing up. 
if people start bidding on the bitmit listing, the ebay listing will come down(and vice versa) - this is the third time the boat has been listed on ebay which is why I got the chance to list it on bitmit start the bidding at 15% less than ebay.  
come on bitcoin millionaires - if the boat isn't a good enough reason for you to part with your coins - bid on this listing to keep the money away from paypal and help show everyone that bitcoin is viable for conducting all manner of transactions - big or small, digital or physical, obligatory or optional, legal or illegal...etc
