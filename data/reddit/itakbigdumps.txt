Ummm wouldn't Warren Buffets position be that YOU don't understand bitcoin?
There's a lot of assumptions being tossed around here in what warren buffet knows and doesn't know. 
Doesn't it atleast concern people a little that businesses typically convert bitcoin back to dollars immediately? What really is the purpose of buying $10 in bitcoin just to spend it and then have someone convert it back? He says it has no intrinsic value and bitcoin sploogers often say the same thing about USD but they forget that we have to pay taxes in USD and our dollar is backed by one of the most powerful governments in the world. Can no one admit that this is a pretty important difference when measuring 'intrinsic value'?
Also why can't bitcoin be hacked? I've always thought that was a pretty silly statement and certain event seem to be proving that right. Don't you think eventually someone is going to find a way to magically create 50 zillion bitcoins?
I'm so glad that you fully understand bitcoin so my questions can finally be answered!

There's something wrong with your paper.

Something like 40% of Americans don't have $1000 in cash and we're pretty much the most well off country in the world. I really doubt there will ever be 2 billion people in the world that need access to $2000 of anything.

You're supposed to feed it into the paper shredder if you want to see what actually happens.
