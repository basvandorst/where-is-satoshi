Look into setting up Cloudflare or some other caching, to alleviate the hug of death you're experiencing.

I live on the other side of the world, and would rather see USA fix some of their problems than get fucked. So fuck you instead.

Thanks! Very good response. According to the article I linked, although a little vague on the subject, claims that gold can't easily be replaced.


And later on:


Thoughts on that? Do you have any sources on the decline you are talking about?

Everyone to Omegle! Have to educate these guys!

Important price is changed from previous average, only when calculation is applied on new trades.

Just for the record, I couldn't tell from your first post whether you wanted or opposed guns. It was an ambiguous sentence.

Well, it wouldn't need to be the whole thing, and of course without specifics. But I guess you are right, they should thread carefully anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:40:46
Well it sort of sucks to buy something for double the price it was 3 hours earlier, especially when that something will be down to the expected price (maybe) just as fast.
Sure the price didn't technically change, but that's how it's perceived by a bitcoin spender.
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:24:32
I guess that is sort of my point. Yes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:53:49
Anything you can confirm this with? Say, with a screenshot of the actual support system?
Not trying to be difficult, but anything to restore some faith in bitcoin and the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:02:42
I guess my point is just that it doesn't have to be preachy. After all I'm just talking about my interest, just as some sports jock would discuss the last night's game.
OP's suggestion is about making people aware/curious/interested in bitcoin, and mentioning it to everyone you meet is a good way to do that. Too much is bad of course.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:51:37
Huh? Are we out of stealth yet?
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:55:20
Bitcoin isn't like any other currency, why should it not get special treatment?
I agree the sentiment of the article was silly though.

I can confirm this. Netflix has it, although they don't they coins yet.

I think he meant that if they had invested the same $1500 in BTC 10 months ago that money would have already become more than the ASIC will be able to give them back now. Had they gotten the miner 10 months ago though, they would of course have had much more than that...
@_date: 2013-04-30 08:31:37
Yes it does. It is in a lot electronic devices, for instance. Not to mention jewelry.

I'm sorry, didn't mean to offend. Your sentence was shit. Live with it.
@_date: 2013-04-28 10:54:45
I don't see anything shady with that, as long as you include that information on the bill - "has to be redeemed before 01/2014".
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:59:07
Because the hashrate is &gt;2 billion GH/s. Don't think you'll get that out of a few ASICs...

True, but as Satoshi understands, and Kurt don't, is that it won't matter in the long run.

It's a mille of a bitcoin. In other words 1 BTC / 1000.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:53:10
Basically yes. The computational power is wasted, and nothing besides securing the network is achieved. (Although that is a pretty big one.)
There are a few problems with linking the mining process to real problems. First off it would lower the efficiency of the actual hashing. (The computer would have to do other things as well.) And as the hashes are the only thing needed by the bitcoin network it would be bad for miners. Secondly, it is really complicated to do something like this fully distributed and keep it democratized. Who issues the work? How do we know what we are solving? When do I get a turn for my problems?
PPCoin is an altcoin that tries to solve the energy problem, by using Proof-of-Stake to secure transactions. It means you put up an amount of coins as a stake for future transaction. Because of this, much less mining is required. Read more at and [the whitepaper]( if you're into that.

No, not at all.
You can think of it analogously as receiving free on-the-door delivery, while everyone else is pays a percentage of their order.
So lets say we are trading in eggs. For each regular order, there are thousands of orders from you, each at one or two eggs. Suddenly the streets are filled with delivery trucks, and no one gets their eggs in time for breakfast.
See how you are clogging the system?
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:29:31
Yes. Move on.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:14:02


Well, then maybe it's about time to try a new system. What about Bitcoin?

1) No global reserve currency has ever been printed at the frequency of the USD either. Just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it wont. A total crash of the USD would probably result in a massive global crisis, but you say nothing about *why* this crash won't happen. Care to elaborate?
2) Yeah, I don't think anyone expected BTC to be the global standard overnight. But couldn't certain events trigger massive changes? If other nations stop using the USD as an intermediary currency, wouldn't this just increase the chances of hyperinflation?
3) We don't need them to - we just need them out of the way, so we can make room for smarter bank operations. Adapt or die.
I'm no expert, and realize change will take time, but to my untrained eye does it seem you have far too much trust in the longevity of the USD. Could you help me understand your perspective? Some sources would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:22:31
It's not about "forcing bitcoin onto everyone", but rather to "inform about bitcoin to everyone". There is a huge difference.
When I'm with my usual circles I'm "that bitcoin guy", but I rarely start a huge discussion about bitcoins myself - someone else does. So it's more in the lines of:
*"Is Jack coming out tonight? I hope he can help me understand this bitcoin thing a little better."*
When I meet new people I usually try at least to *mention* bitcoin, but always consider my audience. I would say somewhere around 75% of them usually don't let go of the topic before they have gotten a rather detailed introduction.
I believe I'm helping the cause, not hurting it.
