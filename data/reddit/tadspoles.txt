They've already created a rival product they just didn't do it directly.  It's called Ripple.

I don't think you've done your homework.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:22:57
Give it time.

Hell, the EXACT number of total coins ever will be 123,423,900.  So bitcoin has over 1/2 of coins mined and GoldCoin doesn't even have 1/4 mined. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:48:24
What are you babbling on about.  GoldCoin has a total 100 million units that will ever be mined you goober. Of course more were created originally.  
Think about this dumbass.  Bitcoin currently has over 12 million coins mined in a few short years with a cap of 21 million.  This is over HALF already.  GoldCoin still has less than 30 million with a cap of 100+ million.
You tell me which is the bigger premine scam dumbass.  Do the math!  
Besides, so many GoldCoins have changed hands now any early amounts don't even matter.  
If you want to look at a premine/instamine scam, look at DogeCoin, billions mined in a few days!!

Excuse me, I'm sorry.  It appears you are right.  Well now we know what the site owners are invested in huh?
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:37:55
Once again...read above.  I can point to many articles claiming bitcoin is a premined scam there guy.  This site was setup by someone that was very jealous of GoldCoin.
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:17:50
By the way, cryptolife.net has called EVERY coin other than bitcoin a scam.  It is NOT credible.
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:40:54
By the way, that site is heavily moderated and only allows posts they agree with.  I'd say that belongs in @_date: 2014-01-22 01:06:14
No it's not you idiot.  Even if it were, the 51% protection is still VALID.
GoldCoin doesn't even have 1/4 of the coins mined yet compared to over 1/2 for bitcoin.  You're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:20:11
Bitcoin should just adopt the GoldCoin 51% protection.  
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:27:37
None with a unique 51% defense and a client being built from scratch.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:36:47
NXT is awesome.  Agreed.  This GoldCoin is a scam site is run by a very jealous person and in no way reflects GoldCoin.  Heck...perhaps it's YOU.
If you want to see an even larger fake list of scamcoins just go to This jealous guy put almost EVERY coin on there.  The only coin he doesn't have on there is DogeCoin, why?  Because he has invested in it!
As far as a 51% attack not being important, maybe you should try selling that scam idea to the rest of because EVERYONE was worried about one particular pool getting too many miners the other day.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:45:28
My point is ANYONE can post bullshit.
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:51:48
He posted characterization.  He's just angry he wasn't an early miner.  Sorry he missed the boat...many, many times now.  The sad thing is, it's not even close to being too late as GoldCoin STILL has more than 2/3 of the total coins UNMINED.  Compare that to bitcoin that has already mined more than half!!!!
EDIT:  My math was off.  GoldCoin still has more than 3/4 UNMINED.
