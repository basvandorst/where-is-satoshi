I want to get involved with startups- Not to be a dick, but I have money and want to invest.
Any pointers?

Am I too late?

Your name wouldn't happen to rhyme with Medward Blowden, would it?

Can we get a TL;DR of what the 47 hours have? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 05:08:39
That's a great list, thanks! I meant more-so for tech start-ups overall, not just bitcoin ones :)

I feel incredibly late to the party, but any spare change? Spare change anyone? 
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:41:10
Exactly. After you confirm it's in your account you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:22:08
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:06:03
You're even more crazy!

Great looking site. The pricing page shows the virtual CPU's but not the cores.

Hi John,
[Here's a summary]( of the issue. I'll ping you on the Community, thanks for your help.
@_date: 2015-08-31 15:36:35
My account uses an email address that's no longer valid, so I'm not getting the "please confirm this new device" email or whatever.
They said to create a new account, verify it, and then they'd move the bitcoins over. But that was a week ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:15:37
Done deal, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:18:23
They had an 'instant verification' method if you give them your bank credentials. (I have issues with patience- blame the industry I work in)
Let them login (I have a seperate bank account I created a while ago for BS purchases. If I purchase something online it goes through that bank account, not my main one. For ex: if I purchase something for $100 on Amazon, I transfer $100 to that bank account and 1 minute later it's empty again. Not much there to steal ;-)
Then when they said 'verified!' I changed the passcode on the bank account and confirmed the email addresses on the account.

"Your BTC will arrive on Monday Dec 2, 2013 around 12:11PM PST"
..I would've paid more to get it overthere quicker. Who knows how much the value will increase or decrease in the next 7 days lol
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:36:35
I paid 14 cents to transfer $41 worth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:11:50
I bought .40 bitcoin on Coinbase, took maybe 10 minutes.
