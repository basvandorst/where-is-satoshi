I have no clue.
I don't have many transactions at all.  They include initially transferring about 15btc in from mtgox, then randomly buying about 10 more from coinbase and always sending them to this wallet from coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:26:17
Not really
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:11:24
Strong enough, capital, numbers, special
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:20:48
This is my complete TX history:  
The only tx I didn't make was the -25btc.
The rest of the txs out are to my VPN.
I have no idea what change addresses are
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:39:48
Running a full one now...will update after complete
EDIT:  Malwarebytes found this, the only suspicious thing 
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:26:00
No to the 3.5 payment.
1Hd is me, not 14qq
@_date: 2015-05-09 20:40:52
No, just my wife and I.  Don't have many friends.  And the ones we do are tech savvy at all.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:12:54
Sounds likely
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:27:58
Thanks, trying the Reset...I hope this is it!
@_date: 2015-05-09 20:20:02
Thanks for the advice...luckily I have nothing else of value on this system.  
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:45:44
No that is the only PC I own with a wallet on it
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:47:27
Never backed up to cloud service.
Never imported private key.  The coins were transferred to this PC from MTGox a long time ago.
@_date: 2015-05-09 20:51:35
Youre right
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:53:25
Did the reset, thieving transaction still shows.  Still seen by 1 peer
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:32:16
You are right, unfortunately.  I thought I was safe enough on my local computer...I wasn't
@_date: 2015-05-09 20:38:27
It is...
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:23:18
1) Definitely off.  Security log shows no activity.  I have no maid or anything like that
2)  I use an external HD to backup my files, no server, or anything like that.  I guess the VPN co could have an employee that knows that I pay with BTC and they would know my IP.
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:42:45
Im guessing there was something wrong
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:26:26
Yes, no luck..
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:22:00
Looks like that transaction has only been seen by one peer, even though its from March 30.  Seems odd to me.  The rest of my transactions have been seen by 4 at least.
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:56:08
I wish there was a place I could go for some sort of help...Law enforcement, some sort of btc group, something.   But there is really nothing I can do other than be salty.
@_date: 2015-05-09 09:39:26
I doubt there to be a next time now....
Not getting back into BTC after this.
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:54:43
The last transaction before that I entered my pw for was march 5, then I lost the coins on march 30.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:30:36
Well had it been fiat, the banks would get it bank.  Nothing like that exists with BTC
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:58:09
MB found one potential Trojan 
Thanks for your time and effort.   Its a bad day for me, but I still appreciate your help.
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:38:32
Microsoft Security Essentials, should I use Malwarebytes
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:01:39
Well I don't really know how it works.  I guess he could have gotten the key he needed before then.  By I turned it off on March 12, and it was off until late April.  March 30 obviously falls in that window.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:26:09
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:41:21
Agreed, I don't know if that is the culprit.
I don't download things that look suspicious, I work in IT(not security though), so I think I am OK about that kind of thing.
I would really like to know what happened at least.  The time line is so weird.  I leave on March 12 computer off, BTC stolen March 30.
Why the long gap?  How did he get in?  How did he target me?
