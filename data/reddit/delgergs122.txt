You mean how he preached being in cash all of 2018? (which was the right decision) He always talked about money management, risk control, and positon sizing consistently. Just because he was wrong about his 1000 dollar BTC prediction doesnt mean he did not have good advice or wisdom in being conservative and preserving capital.

Honestly, I dont see the point of spending my BTC at the moment. I would much rather hodl and accumulate as much as I can. Why spend something that will most likely gain significant value within the next couple of years? I look at bitcoin like its digital gold which will gain purchasing power over time. I dont want to spend it, I want to hoard it.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:15:27
Yea I don't have a problem with custodial accounts if it's for the lightning network when I would only have small amounts of BTC in it for spending.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:59:10
This is why im buying as much as I can get my greedy hands on. The fact that most people do not realize it makes me even more excited.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:09:24
For sure but still, in 2-3 years from now that could become something more significant.

If your going to buy BTC (and you are not trading) you have to been in it for the long term. Most likely we are going lower, but we are in the beginning of a new uptrend and gnarly pull backs are to be expected. In a couple of years from now this will look most likely look like a  30-40% pullback on a massive long term bull market chart.  It happened 6 times last bull market, expect to happen in this next one as well.
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:54:39
I agree with you. I think alot if people have the wrong assumption of what trading actually is.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:49:22
If you are in it for the long term, it will not matter. You could possibly miss your chance if you wait sub 8k. Cost average is the way to go.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:26:20
Yes from a macro perspective, this is bullish long term. However, I am leaning slightly bearish in the short term. The 4hr 50ema and 200 ema completed a death crossa week ago which usually signifies short term bearish price action.

I had a similar experience. The farther down the crypto rabbit hole I went, the more I realized that everything is just noise and its bitcoin i should be focusing on. I have a bunch of alts that may hold some promise, but the majority of my portfolio is now BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:55:20
BTC went up 360% in less than 5 months, its time to take a breather which is good because I now will get a 2nd chance to add more to my long term position. I'm hoping we see 8.5-7.5k prices.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:42:02
You want to be patient and sell in a couple of years when bitcoin has the potential to 20x or more.

Nothing is 100% immutable, however it is very unlikely and extremely difficult to perform a 51% attack on BTC because of its hash power and security.

TA can be a useful tool to help traders time their entry and exit points, identify trends, and to use certain indicators to help them develop an edge in the market. There is no certainty in TA, there is only probability. Losses are inevitable but with solid risk management and using TA as a tool to develop an edge, you can become very profitable over time. Mythology? I disagree.

@_date: 2019-07-06 19:03:38
That is just one application it could potential be used for. Whether it solves its scaling issues to become an efficient medium of exchange remains to be seen. What bitcoin is suppose to be is a  open, decentralized, secure, and scarce digital money that provides sovereignty and the ability for people to have value that is not controlled by any central authority, government, or bank.

Not the network itself, when I say infrastructure I mean the ease of accessibility to the masses. Right now it's difficult to buy  bitcoin or crypto for the average person. It's like we have this awesome new Ferrari, but the roads are still dirt and used by horses. We have to build the roads (infrastructure) to make it easier to use and we are the beginning stages of this.

@_date: 2018-08-27 05:51:26
You can't promise that bitcoin is going lower. No one knows what will happen in the short term. If you are so sure of it though, maybe you should short it. I think the majority of people think the same as you and that definitely could be a possibility. However, we have tested the 6,000 level numerous times. Bitcoin is down 75% from ATH, with some of these alts around 80 to 90. IMO bitcoin already capitulated and the alts followed shortly after.  Check out cnbc or other news sources regarding crypto, there is extreme FUD at the moment. There is a lot of fear in the market right now and with the majority of people believing its going lower. That's a buy signal for me. When I see a majority of opinion swaying towards lower or higher prices, usually the opposite comes true. I hope we found our bottom, however its always possibility it could go lower. Whatever happens I'm buying and will continue to do so if it drops because I am extremely bullish long term.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:56:11

@_date: 2019-03-30 16:47:57
I agree, this past year I have gone down the bitcoin rabbit hole and I'm truly starting to understand its value proposition. We will most likely look back at these prices in the next 5 to 7 years wishing we bought more. I do not want to have this regret so I'm buying as much as I can afford to at the moment. Its all about keeping a low time preference and being patient:-)

 If the Chinese government wanted to manipulate and crash the price of bitcoin they first would have to purchase significant amounts of it causing another parabolic bull run. The best way to hinder the progress of people using this technology would to heavily regulate it or make it illegal, which IMO would still not be enough to stop it.

Jesus Christ man." Buying the dip" is only a good idea if the market is trending to the upside. On the higher time frames it appears that bitcoin is downtrending once again with lower highs. You are potentially buying into another downtrending market..
@_date: 2019-03-23 09:51:49

I agree. People have a lot of misconceptions in regards to TA in crypto land.Like you said, its statistical probabilities. If you have solid money management skills, psychology, and TA that gives you an edge in the market, you can be profitable over time. It takes a lot of effort, patience and discipline to develop the right skills. However, it is completely possible to make money trading and be able to do so on a consistent basis.

@_date: 2019-11-02 18:41:24
Both are great in my opinion and both should be in every ones portfolio. Gold will be much less risky and volatile and I look at it as more of a hedge towards inflation and preserving my purchasing power, while BTC is used for growth. Personally, I do not like the idea of holding my own gold so things like a gold ETF are more appealing to me because its more liquid and easier to buy and sell. Regardless, 20% of every paycheck is going into gold, silver, and bitcoin (considering some gold mining stocks as well) with a longer term mindset of 5-10 years.
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:40:43
I think you underestimate the pressure it will have on miners who now get half as much bitcoin for producing just as much electricity. Expenses will need to be paid, bitcoin will need to be sold as well.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:44:27
"While having nothing to loose but everything to gain".  Nothing is certain and as an investor its imperative to understand that truth. Gold is a 8 trillion dollar market cap and bitcoin has a long road ahead if it wants to compete against it. While I do agree that one day it may reach those levels, its to premature to assume anything at this moment. Don't get me wrong I love bitcoin and I believe it has a bright future ahead of it, but this dichotomy of bitcoin vs gold is ridiculous. Both assets should be in every ones portfolio and both assets will most likely perform very well in the next 5-10 years.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:10:45
Very true,  Roubini made several claims about bitcoin and blockchain that were incorrect! Peter did an amazing job.

Good job man,Its very difficult not too fomo in. You listened to your logic rather then emotion.Personally, I have not been the best at this so my strategy is to slowly buy bitcoin and hodl for 3 to 5 years.

 I Need to check out kraken. The one thing I like about coinbase is that they are FDIC insured, but the .5 % fees under 10k is ridiculous. I assume kraken has limit/ stop limit orders similar to coinbase features?
@_date: 2019-10-28 05:25:38
Interesting. I've been looking to get into gold and silver as well, however I do not have as much capital as OP unfortunately. For instance,  I have 20k willing to invest, with 5k already in BTC (15k left). I feel  like the remainder might be insufficient in gold or silver. Best case scenario gold/ silver go into a bull market and gold increases 500%, while silver goes 800% in the next 10 years. Concentration in BTC however I have the ability to make much more signficant gains yet there is more risk involved. How would you go about it?
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:14:57
Contrary to you're opinion of bitcoin dying a agonizing death, go on to [blockchain.info]( and you can see that the network is only growing stronger and becoming bigger as time passes. However, I do agree that past performance is not indicative of future results. While I do believe BTC eventually goes to 100k, I am not sure it will happen as everyone expects it to or on the time frame of a 4 year cycle. This recent downturn as led me to be cautious of a possible mini downtrend bearish cycle for the short to intermediate term. If we can close above 9100, I would change my opinion on that.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:45:18
Ah yea I see what you're saying.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:26:54
If the government tried to ban crypto it would only necessitate the need for it. It would be in their best interest to be open to this new disruptive technology rather then fight it because in the end they will ultimately lose. One thing for sure, they will never get their hands on my bitcoin.

Peter is shilling his gold as usual.
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:45:43
I understand you're point of view, but it doesn't matter because value is subjective regardless of its intrinsic qualities . Currently 1 bitcoin = 8k and with the design of economic incentives, digital scarcity, and the halvenings built into the protocol, bitcoin will most likely gain exponential purchasing power over the next 5-10 years, while dollars or other fiat currencies will not.
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:45:08
Yea you are correct. Intrinsic value relates to its instrumental value which Bitcoin does not have at the moment. However, you assume if the price drops drastically( or to zero like you stated, which is unlikely in my opinion) it wouldn't be useful for anything. My arugment is that the utility of the network would still be useful to exchange value even if it did drop in price and it wouldn't be rendered useless.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:37:09
Bitcoins intrinsic value is not something that is tangible even if price drops drastically the network would still be utilized to exhange value, in fact it would be cheaper and more efficient to do so. It's value relies on the fact that it is open, public, censorship resistant, borderless, and neutral.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:29:53
That depends. When it dropped down to 7200 it looked like BTC was downtrending and potentially going into a bear market. That recent upsurge now puts me on the fence if we are going to continue the previous trend. Sometimes I would rather wait and buy on strength when there is more confirmation then buy lower when I am not sure which direction the market will take.
@_date: 2019-10-14 02:32:19

While i do agree that is the case for the majority of alt coins, there will be a few big winners among them ,im just not sure which ones it will be and I dont feel like risking any more capital to find out. What most people in this space fail to realize is that this is more about economics rather than technology. Bitcoin is sound money. Period. No other alt can compete agaisnt it in this regard.
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:08:42
OP do not listen to this guy. Be wary of posts like these. Never trust anyone that gives you a link to store your bitcoin or says they will give you a higher return. You alone store you're bitcoin via ledger nano or trezor. I just reported this comment, other people should do the same.

Leaving your wealth in BTC is only a good idea if we are in an uptrending market. By the looks of it, we are at the begginning of that trend.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:33:08
What I do is I keep my long term hodl position, and I have some funds for trading.  I wait for the 30-40% retracements to buy the pullbacks.  I look at things like the weekly 21 EMA, RSI, and stochs to time my buys and sells. Historically speaking, the last bull run had 5 or 6 pullbacks that were all 30-40% and every single one (besides the final push) retraced back to or close by the 21 ema and were bought up for the next leg higher. Look at these things and you can find some pretty solid entry points that have amazing risk/reward ratios. These intermediate moves can go up anywhere from 100% to 400% over a few month period! Always keep your stop loss in place so you dont lose your money, but also keep it far enough down to let the trend ride itself up.  A 5-10% stop loss in this particular case will do. If the trend rides above your entry point after some time then move your stop to break even or above it. As price rises, keep a trailing stop loss. Ride the trend and scale out of profits. Rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:43:47
I don't think BTC needs to be used for purchasing goods/ services in order for it be successful. Gold has a 7 trillion dollar market cap and no one uses to purchase goods/ services. Like gold, I believe BTC could fill the role of store of value/ hedge to traditional markets as the asset matures over time.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:56:37
"Almost nobody needs trustless transactions". Tell that to people who are trying to send money across borders through multiple banks which is time consuming and costly and not 100% borderless. You say this because you are privledged. Billions of people on this planet lack basic banking services and if they do have access, many cannot trust their banks or governments to keep their money safe especially if its depreciated its value through hyper inflation. Yes it is a shitty way to store wealth currently, but we are still incredibly early with this market/technology. Also, the blockchain cannot be hacked and my funds are more secure on a decentralized network then it is in my bank account. With bitcoin/ crypto you take responsibility with your money and making sure you have a hardware wallet and keeping funds of exchanges/ custodial wallets where they are vulnerable to such hacks.
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:06:48
I believe so. You have to do your research and look into it.

Take your time you are young. If you are looking for a long term hold (3 to 7 years) I think now is a good time to slowly start buying. If you want to start trading, then you need to dedicate a lot of time into learning how to do that. You tube is a good place to find information and read as much as you possibly can in regards to trading/ investing. Do not start trading now, educate yourself first and gain experience because you will most likely lose money when you first start off.

@_date: 2019-02-26 16:19:41
These things take time, honestly even if it was launched sooner I don't think it would have a huge impact on the short term as most people expect (especially in a bear market). These things take time and it could take years before we see significant contribution of funds from bigger investors.

I just watched the conference in increments for the past couple of days....honestly this conference was probably one of the best pieces of information/knowlege I have seen in a very long time in crypto. It is a must watch. Not really a fan of Tony vays, but he killed it. Im starting to realize that all the noise we get here on reddit and can be confusing with a lot of uneducated opinions floating around. I will still stick to the conferences to get my information from here on out. Watch the whole video!

As someone that is starting to get into trader myself,i would highly reccomend caution and patience. Now is not the time to lose your money because if you are new to this and have no knowledge or experience it is only a matter or time before this happens to you. Books to read before getting started that will benefit you enormously..."trading in the zone" by mark douglas, "market wizards volume one and two by Jack d schwager", "technical analysis of the financial markets" by John j Murphy, "a traders money management system" by bennet a McDowell, and of course "the bitcoin standard" by safedeam ammous for anyone who is interested in bitcoin regardless of trading, building, or investing in should read. Best of luck youngster, welcome to the world of trading where many fail, and only a few succeed..
@_date: 2019-02-03 18:50:02
This is highly unlikely. Quantum computing? Perhaps in the future but we are no where near this type of technology. I am sure as bitcoin develops there will be implementations to safe guard against such things. Also, gold can be confiscated, if you hold your own keys bitcoin cannot.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:35:39
No he wasn't talking about it, you Brought it up and went on a rant about it. Haha wishing people to get wiped out?! That is low man, lol. I think you live in an echo chamber of confirmation bias, while you make valid points at times you fail to see other points of views. That is detrimental if you want to succeed in life and grow and learn. You have this mindset of how the world works and that is what you build your foundation on, but I promise you, you do not know everything. The financial world is a very complex system and predicting future economic disasters where only bitcoin is the answer puts you in a box . If we see a economic disaster of the magnitude that you seem to preach all the time, all asset classes will be in trouble. No one is going to put there money into a highly speculative asset like bitcoin/ crypto at this moment in time if a disaster hits. This market is still to early and not mature enough to foster that kind of confidence. You better hope that shit doesn't happen anytime soon and thinking that bitcoin will save you from that is ignorant.

Its extremely risky. If you are going to margin trade, you really need to take your time and know what your doing. It's not easy and if you think it is you will be taught some hard lessons. Not saying it cant be done or leveraging is a bad idea, but you really need to do your research and know how to trade. Also, 100x leverage is insane and risky, I wouldn't fuck around with that.

Ok so he should invest more money into bitcoin? Bitcoin is still an experiment and is still high risk. I believe it in long term and plan on buying more if it drops further but the guy has a sound investment strategy given his age. While I agree that negative interest rates are something to be concerned about, no one knows there future implications and throwing all your money into a risky asset like bitcoin is not the answer. I would listen to what he is saying because the man is older and has some wisdom. Like he said, diversification is the key.
@_date: 2019-12-19 07:14:45
It's difficult to explain, especially with people who are unaware of what money actually is. If people are really I interested I tell them to search Andreas or to buy the bitcoin standard. Those are good places to start. To truly understand bitcoin, one needs to take the journey down the rabbit hole and most people will not take the time to open the door.

On the higher time frames RSI helps me identify trends in the market. Also, the overbought and undersold aspect also helps in my timing of when I should be getting ready to enter or exit a trade. Its not exact, but it is a useful tool in certain regards.

You bought BTC at 5,000? That is a very good long term position. We are at the beginning of a new bull market and were talking potentially 20- 40x gains and you want to sell after 2x gains?! If you haven't had success in the past maybe reevaluate and hodl.

The guy is not talking about negative interest rates and neither am I! All he said was that he has 5 % of his portfolio in bitcoin and how he is diversifying for his retirement and you went on a whole tangent about negative interest rates and how he doesn't know what he is talking about. All I am saying is that diversification is the key to investing. Bitcoin is still speculative, just because you consider it money now doesn't mean the rest of the world does. I believe that will change in the future, but nothing is certain and this is still a high risk asset. You act like its a for sure thing and its going to 100k, we don't know that. Putting your faith in that and not diversifying your assets is a risky endeavor. When it comes to investing, I would listen to his advice and diversify. Its ok to have a significant portion of your assets in bitcoin if you are young and understand the risk associated with it, but he is not so putting 5% is a sound strategy. You sound like a bitcoin evangelist and you deal in absolutes, "negative interest rates, the banking system is corrupt, bitcoin is the only thing that is going to save the world, you are foolish to diversify!" While I agree with you that we live in unprecedented times and we have huge problems like negative interest rates, inflation, fiat currency not being backed by anything but the promise of the government, the US dollar losing 95% value in the past 100 years, quantitive easing, fractional reserve banking, and the central banking system created a banking cartel, bitcoin is not the answer to all of these issues. I think bitcoin/ crypto could help and create a new financial system via the internet, but we are still early and no one knows what the fuck is going to happen. Stop acting like bitcoin is a for sure thing and don't ridicule people for not having a larger % of their portfolio in it.

Bitcoin is the best performing asset in the past 10 years. It has the highest sharp ratio /risk vs reward, all you have to do is look at all the yearly lows to see a significant increase in price in the past decade. This is the 3rd bubble bursting, in my opinion there will be more. Buying bitcoin around the 3,000 to 5,000 dollar range after a 80 -85 % correction is a great time to scale in if you plan on holding for the next 5 years. Within 5 to 10 years this market will be in the trillions. Less than 200 billion market cap currently, I would say we are still early.

To be honest, time will tell if bitcoin over comes these hurdles (which I believe it can), in the mean time the market says otherwise and bitcoin is at the end of its 4 year cycle and I believe we could be at the start of another cycle very soon. I don't feel like waiting around to see if that happens, the time to buy is now.
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:30:13
I don't think one can compare fidget spinners to bitcoins value proposition, especially with so much growth and innovation happening at the moment. The growth of the network is clearly visible and is growing by the year. Yes, its a possibility that we may never reach ATH, but there is a higher probability that we will. I'm not saying to invest your entire life's savings into it, but I believe its good idea to have some skin in the game and hold 1 or 2 bitcoins.

Hey if you want to follow your emotions just because the price is down, that is on you. I don't think you have any idea how markets/ bubbles function. Your comments clearly show this. Its not like all the sudden institutional money comes in all at once and it starts this mega bull. Like I said before, these people are patient and waiting for people like you to sell their weak hands and trick them into thinking BTC is dead based solely on price action. They will slowly be accumulating and it could be months or years before we see reversal, but if your not buying if it reaches 3k then your the sheep that deserves to get slaughtered. Buy high,sell low is exactly what most inexperienced investors and traders are doing at the moment. This market has some of the most innovative and disruptive technology that human civilization has ever seen and it will change the world in the years to come. Believe me there will be buyers, unfortunately the average person won't be buying at these levels, they will be buying again when the hype comes back (whenever that may be) just like last year.

The game is not already won. Believe me I want bitcoin to succeed as much as the majority in this sub, but it will be a long uphill battle if it wants to compete against gold and become a reserve currency / store of value. I believe its possible, but I also understand that it is not a sure thing. Just because you and I or many others in this sub understand the economic benefits of this new system/network, does not mean the world does. More people need to become aware because the majority are clueless..

I'm buying as much bitcoin as I can if it drops below 3k. In 5 years from now, I believe bitcoin will be valued significantly higher then it is today. Then again, there is the chance it will not succeed and I may be wrong, I find that unlikely tho.
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:43:38
No new round of buyers? Are you fucking kidding me? When do you think smart money/ institutional money want to start buying bitcoin? Not when its 10k -20k with high public interest. The sentiment is low, people have been burned, and the public knows dick about bitcoin.Huge players have been waiting on the sidelines patiently for this, believe me they will be accumulating especially if bitcoin drops below 3k. Whether that's OTC or on the market, one way or another it will affect the market sooner or later. Furthermore, we have bakkt and fidelity launching soon which will give this market more fiat gateways for big money to flow in.

How much money one should  invest in bitcoin or crypto should be correlated with how much knowledge one has about about the technology and a understanding of the volatility of this new asset class. To the average Joe, it would seem extremely risky to invest and yes that is true when looking at from a short term perspective. However, IMO its not as risky as most believe, especially if you have a long term mindset and you do not plan on selling for the next 5years.

Something I am looking into myself.  Not sure if I plan on day trading, but doing more long term trades that could be weeks or months. Also, I would like to learn how to short as well. I think that may come in handy at the end of the next bull cycle which hopefully will be in the next couple of years. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn (it could be years). Its all about risk vs reward, am I willing to risk 1 % to gain 3 to 4 % profit?  Start small and focus more on how to protect your capital first. You can be wrong 10 times, however if you manage your risk affectively  you may lose little money in the process. If you are right those few times, capitalize on it. Start with very small amounts of money, read, and learn learn learn learn learn. You need to understand TA. Check out Krown Krypto on you tube, he is legit and knows what he is talking about.

Yea i agree. I think that can be a valid strategy with a long term perspectice (3+ years). However, I disagree with OP post trying to shame people for selling. A lot of people are still very bullish and "buying the dip" which is concerning because the charts are painting a different story at the moment. To early to tell tho and i have to see how the prices play out this next month to get a better idea, but I am looking at lower prices to get in again.

 These posts are kind of ridiculous. I kept stop losses on my profit and scaled out under 10k to protect my capital. Hodl works in a bull market but with this recent downturn, bitcoin has potentially changed behavior/ trend. I am no longer convinced we are in a bull market and being cautious waiting on the sidelines to see how it plays out. If we are in a new downtrend, Hodl will get you wrecked. I will take my profits, be patient, and wait for the next entry/ long position. What happens if we break below 6800 suport levels and go to 4500? Not saying this will happen but its still a possibility to be aware of. Good luck hodling if that happens.

Hypothetically, if the US banned bitcoin it wouldn't be difficult for people to use a secure VPN and still participate on the network while keeping their identity safe.

If you are in it for the long term like 3 years + ,stop looking at price or charts and put your btc on a ledger. It doesnt matter if it goes down 10-30%, if btc takes off we could be looking at 10-20x . Just make sure you get on the rocket ship before that happens.

@_date: 2019-05-12 15:26:49
Its based on price action. Traders saw a bullish short term trend and slowly over time it built into upwards momentum with peoole fomoing in. In a bull market news can have very little implications if the price still wants to go higher. What this signifies is that we are most likely at the start of the next bull cycle. There is support levels at the 6000 area, 4800 and from there at the 4200 area. We could possibly go back to all three again in the near future after a potential sell off at the 7k range who knows or maybe we continue this rally a little higher. High probability that the bottom is obviously in and were at the beginning of the next bull market.

 I am down on my portfolio and I was depressed for some time, but I realize that I'm looking at this from a long term perspective 5 years + and this helps me get through the bear market and I am now looking at this as an opportunity to buy more and DCA. Also, I'm using this time to educate myself and learn more about crypto, investing, and markets. The more knowledgeable I become in these matters the more I realize how  bitcoin/crypto have a huge future. I don't think we have hit bottom just yet, but I have my buy orders set if bitcoin gets in the  2k levels or lower, and I will continue to put 500 $ a month into bitcoin as long as it remains under 5k.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:52:17
2k is 90 % from ATH. It has happened before with bitcoin, it is not unreasonable to assume it will  happen again. This would be an ideal time to buy or DCA.

 The community does not choose the most secure bitcoin. What makes bitcoin secure is the hash rate or computing power (New **bitcoins** are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called "mining". This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. **Bitcoin** miners are processing transactions and **securing** the network using specialized hardware and are collecting new **bitcoins** in exchange.) The hash rate in the past year in a half as grown exponentially. Bitcoin is by far the most secure and decentralized network in crypto thus far and will most likely remain so into the foreseeable future. 
 "Bitcoin is whatever we want it to be, which seems unstable"
I highly suggest you read up on how the network functions because bitcoin is not whatever you want it to be. Bitcoin is fucking bitcoin. The only thing unstable about bitcoin is the price, the network is doing just fine and its growing and becoming stronger. Bitcoin is sound money and anything that forks or tries to compete with it is garbage.

Also, check out the USDC stable coin, it only takes me 6 days and im able to transfer it out to buy bitcoin or alts and its less fees to do so.

The fact that its not easy to make changes is what will make it salable across time. It doesnt need to have the best tech, all it needs to do is verify transactions on a decentralized network. Yes there are other alt coins that may be faster or cheaper, but do they have the liquidity, trading volume, or network effect that bitcoin has gained in the past 10 years?  What about the built in economic incentives, digital scarcity, and the halvings? Bitcoin is currently the most secure/ decentralized and used crypto. I wouldnt say its worthless tho, 100 billion dollar marketcap says otherwise..

 Bitcoin/ crypto is a very new asset class and with any new asset class there will be a lot of volatility due to low liquidity and speculation. Its still in its Infancy and we are still far away from mass adoption. Three times before bitcoin has gone up exponentially and corrected itself 70 to 90%, this is the 4th time its happened. We are currently down around 80 to 85%. With all the hype that happened last year( which was insane) it is only normal that we would see this correction now. Start educated yourself about bitcoin and the market  because its time to start buying and getting good entry points for the next bull cycle. I would recommend slowly buying and holding for 3 to 5 years. Welcome to the wild west, good luck:-)
