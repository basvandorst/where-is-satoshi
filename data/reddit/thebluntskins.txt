Shame they are giving updates on their Q2/Q3 product but not giving any new information about the Q1/Q2.

Good, let them cash out! It's bad in the short term, but good in the long term. A lot has changed since they opened their exchanges and we shot up and we should be thankful of the attention we gained from China and the bubble over the past few months, but personally, long term I'll be glad to see the back of them. Lets get some stability into BTC, we are being taken seriously now, being discussed by governments across the world, we don't need a commie state treading on innovation.

Glad to hear that the "Murder for hire" bullshit has been dropped. Really feel sorry for his Mother, It can't be easy at all reading that sort of thing in the news.

They moved pretty quick to dispel the "rumours" from last week.

From: 
"A court-appointed administrator is due to report by Friday on a month-long examination into Mt. Gox and determine whether the exchange can be rehabilitated or should be liquidated"
Friday could be an interesting day.
