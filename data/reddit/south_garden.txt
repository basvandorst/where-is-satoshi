errr. so you think merchants are gonna deduct 3% on every item if you use bitcoin?  So far I am still paying the same  price if not more for watercooling parts on performancePC and ek using bitcoin.
As a churner, i am fine with taking advantage of receiving premium rewards from credit cards

100$ with 2~5% rewards depending on cards plus consumer protection policy like charge back
real world example... bought a 1080ti waterblock with backplate on performancePC using Amazon checkout, got 5% back; what practical advantage does using crypto has? Not to mention serious churner can get potent more rewards if they are in initial bonus spending stage. We are not even touching the buyer protection policies a lot of premium cards provide like 15 day no-questions-asked charge back on cards like Sapphire Preferred.
The irony is, the holding meme that keeps floating around here is also a bad sign for broad market adaptation.
I take that difference any day

what does that have to do with their statement and the merit of their statement?

dude have you even read the article without putting your tinfoil hat on? Only retards will believe everything the media puts out there; what imf is saying in that particular article is nothing special, anybody who has some fundamental understanding of macro economic will get the sense that debt is outgrowing GDP and hence creating an unsustainable financial environment that's prone to a big correction.  I see plenty of merits in the said article to warn off eager investors jumping in blindly to make a quick buck.
 wise people will always formulate their own opinion; what you are contributing on the other hand is absolutely garbage though

lmao dude, if you think what the IMF is putting out there is some out of ordinary information, you dont need critical thinking skill, you need an economy book. My critical thinking skill and fundamental got me agreeing with IMF, has your critical thinking skill failed to comprehend that possibility?
