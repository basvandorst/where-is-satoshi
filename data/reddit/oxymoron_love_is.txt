There are many ways to learn about the technology, first you should pick that, later think of investing. Sources from where you can study is - 
1.   -  this website is an aggregated list of sources to read about bitcoin. 
2. Download mastering bitcoin and pick first 3 chapters from there.
3. Watch Andreas antonopolus videos on youtube bitcoin. 
After you are done with the above 3, move on to understand ethereum. Why there is a need of Ethereum, and why there is a need of smart contracts. 
I am saying with my wisdom that you do not need 99.9% of the coins. They all will die sooner or later. You should then invest in currencies which can't be replaces by bitcoin or ethereum, you will find almost all of them have no use case. They exists for name sake. 
Now see these two imp links - 
1. What happens when you invest distributing your funds - 
2. What happens when you do SIP in bitcoins - 
You should buy and HODL and do not trade with emotions. Keep your private keys with yourself, if HODL then put coins in non custodial wallets only. If trading then prefer Binance, they have trust of the community.
You can also buy [bitcoin with credit card]( on various exchanges.

Currently, depending on your geo location you can find exchanges that allow crypto to fiat P2P transaction and are not slow. 
Also, MyEtherWallet which is one of the most popular Ethereum and ERC20 dedicated wallets available in the crypto market will allow fiat withdrawals in its next update. That too with No KYC.

I seriously do not understand why are we using ATM's to buy BTC or any crypto currency. When you can sit at home and do all of that. What is that extra thing in ATM that we do not anywhere else? 
I so not know please give your inputs

I would suggest you to store your funds in a wallet not on any exchange. If your funds are on exchange then they are not safe. As the private key is not on your hand.

Fundamental is not just knowing about the coin(BTC) it is being updated with the news.

Can use instance exchange and can place fixed rate orders if we are that price specific. 
You may be right from some other angle, if so please explain.

Privacy as in? If your addressing to anonymity then there are exchanges that allow to to trade anonymously.

I do not think that all investors invest blindly. There are few who can actually read the market and are also updated with the fundamentals.

Exactly the right answer. Avoid using Custodial exchanges your private is not with you. Best combination to manage funds is hardware wallet with non- custodial exchange.  
Also, try and avoid KYC.
There are exchanges which provide all these features at one place for example: CoinSwitch, Changelly
