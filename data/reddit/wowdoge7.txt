Just putting it in the S&amp;p 500 index fund has put me at 20% this year. If you're not getting 10%+ this past year, you really need to reconsider your portfolio. Just drop it into Vanguard VTSAX or VTI (etf) and call it a day. Since this is a bitcoin subreddit, maybe...I don't know...drop it into bitcoin?

It's actually kind of funny when some of wsb go "OMG I've gotten 65% gains YTD from my expert day trading skills." Crypto folks: cute.

Yeah, just listen to Warren Buffet. Set it into an index fund and just forget it. The low expense ratio makes it incredibly hard to beat by any actively managed funds over long periods of time. Some do beat it but they are very few and far inbetween. He's made bets with hedge funds about index funds winning over active management over the period of many years and has won. Set it into an index fund and just forget it. Focus all your energies into crypto since this is still the genesis of cryptocurrencies. The price is exploding but will eventually stabilize. Now is the time to be bullish.

Utterly insane. Some of my coworkers were invested into international equities. It went up like 30% this year. No way that shit is sustainable. (A tad ironic considering bitcoin's done like 2000% this year)

It's fine. The vast majority of Americans have credit so shit and financial knowledge so shallow that I'm never worried churning is ever going to become a mainstream thing.

Don't forget to max your Traditional IRA before you start putting money in your brokerage account. The investing options are the same for tIRA. The difference is that tIRA is tax advantaged while brokerages are not. Gotta avoid those taxes legally as much as you can. Also, if you can manage your tax withholdings each pay period online (my company uses ADP so I get to play around with my tax withholdings), try to micromanage it so you owe or are owed &lt;$100 to the IRS. Efficiency is beauty. I max 401k and Traditional IRA and then go all YOLO on crypto. I'm usually within +/- 100 within how much taxes I actually owe to Uncle Sam. Cover your bases legally and be a degenerate. It's fun.

The problem is you can only transfer $500 per day and $15000 per month with ACH. It's available instantly though. You can also wire in money so if you're looking to move huge amounts of money, that's the way to do it quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:13:58
50%? Fuck that. 10% will recover all of the money I invested. At that point, I'd be "playing with the house's money."

It's 0.25%. Not free but very close and way lower than coinbase.

I'd save my breath. There's too many of these "taxation is theft" and "duress of violence" libertarian minded people on these subs.  They conveniently leave out that taxes have built the societies and infrastructure that have allowed them (and bitcoin) to exist in the first place and prosper. Is it all used efficiently? Of course not but it has achieved some level of usefulness for the public good. They're 100% right in that nobody would pay taxes if it was not mandatory because let's face it, we're all selfish bastards. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:20:11
Yes, let's banish government and let all criminals walk free without consequences after hurting the interests of others. That'll surely make society better!
If it's so self evident that the libertarian model of "no government" is superior, why are there no models of modern civilization that rely on this model? Inb4 you bring up Belgium that went 1.5 years without a government. The infrastructure was already built and societal norms were already in place. They're also pretty well educated to just instantly devolve into chaos.  
There's always been sort of "government" whether it be tribe leaders, priests, witch doctors, matriarchs, prime ministers, presidents, congressmen, etc. When I say society, I mean modern society. Sure, there are tribes and African countries still without much government in the world. If you'd like to go live in those places without government to fulfill your libertarian fantasies, then be my guest.

You have to realize some of the people here are utterly fanatical. I have friends that keep 70%+ (one of them even had 100%) of their net worth in bitcoin (or tiny amounts in other crypto). It has worked out hugely in their favor the past year or so but holy shit, I can't help but think putting so much of your eggs in one basket is in general a bad investing idea. The only situation when putting all your eggs in one basket would be a more prudent move than diversifying is if you're captaining the ship of your investment i.e. being CEO, or c-suite in that company. None of the people yoloing all of their money on bitcoin is the captain of the bitcoin ship. No one is (well, maybe the Chinese).

They're actually usually very smart people (at least my friends) but even smart people aren't immune to bias. Actually they're more prone to it according to some science research papers.

"Private companies will build cross continental roads, be the only company to do so because of high cost of entry, have monopolies,  extort..I mean charge everyone to that uses them (what are you going to do? use the *other* roads?*rips flaps and start rubbing nipples*), and everything will be libertarian heaven." There are some very corrupt and incompentent governments in the world. Misusing public funds for personal gain is an abrogation of duty. There are also government that work fairly well and mostly acts in the best interests of its citizens. Please don't bring up all the bad ones while conveniently forgetting bring up the good ones. It's like the idea of good governance is an impossibility in some people's minds.

Don't forget your standard deduction and exemption for single filer. $37950 + $6350 + $4050 = $48350. If you have $48350 in long term capital gains in 2017, that would equal $37950 AGI after the deduction and exemption and should incur no federal taxes at all.

Holy shit. That's probably more rare than the 100 trillion note. Ironically, it's probably worth more than the 100 trillion note nowadays due to its rarity.
