I've just been lurking here for some time, but now I have to ask:  why are you bitcoin fanatics so ridiculously hyperbolic?  No security?  None.  Just like putting all your money on a table at Denny's and walking away.
See, you're not helping with stupid, reductionist language like that.  People are only going to think, "Well, that doesn't make sense," and move on.

This is good for bitcoin.

So far, I just can't see.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:54:57
Don't those things come with instructions?  They should warn people about things like that up front.  The installation docs for Trezor are pretty thorough and easy to read.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:57:42
Cashier's checks aren't currency?  Are you dense or just stubborn?  Bitcoin is like a savings account, and LN is like cash in our pockets.  Two different utilities.  Separation of responsibilities is the bread and butter of software design.
@_date: 2016-04-23 04:58:08
That is as stupid as it is pretentious.

I don't like to think I'm smarter than "the rest of the country", and I do think people should be free to make foolish choices.  I'm just saying the smart choice isn't really that smart.  Even dummies can understand it.
I think people must get hooked on credit cards for cultural reasons.  It's like a norm that tends to get reinforced within the community.
What gets lost here, though, is that we can have that instant consumer gratification *without* debt, if we just learn to build up a little reserve.  To me the question is not whether to save for the HDTV or buy the sale on credit.  The question is why don't people already have enough saved to buy an HDTV when they want one.
Not all, but *most* Americans have no excuse for not having at least a few thousand dollars in the bank.  And if you give them 10K to get started, in six months they'll be back in debt.  They just refuse to save any money.

So, gold and silver?

Google it.  You'll see a number like 15 million.  Coinbase has been adding new accounts by the tens of thousands.  You are off the map.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:52:16


Or, you save up until there's a sales price you can actually afford.  It's not complicated.  After those 6 months, chances are you'll find an even better sale.

Again, it certainly ain't 5000, bright eyes.  I refer you again to Google.  Obviously no one here is going to change your tiny mind.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:14:40
Just owning bitcoin makes you a user.  That's 15 million.  And now you're saying 370K transactions per day, but a little while ago you were trying to say 5000 users total, so we already know you're an idiot.  Give it up.

It's weird to me that we still talk about war as though its political, when it's just a huge industry.  Bloody violent industry, but nothing more than that.  Why we're always at war should be a foregone conclusion.
And it's not like the war industry is unique in costing lives; it just happens to be paid for directly by tax dollars.

Saving still beats credit card interest.  Live below your means.  Buy cheap used cars.  Focus on simple pleasures and eschew materialism.  Work on your career and only spend money when you have it.  Do this, and you'll find your savings will tend to grow.

I've been writing software since the advent of home computers, and I daresay you don't know what you're talking about.  There are many forms of currency, but you'd be foolish to say they all serve the same purposes.

Weird guess.  Corrections don't just end.  They correct when the price gets ahead of itself.  And LN adoption will take a bit longer than one month, sport.

This boils down to a rather general and inconclusive statement of feeling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:13
So, no way to know what's going to happen; but better sell now, because you think it's going to fail?  Is that what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:43:46
This sentence is gory.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:13
Right, can we please stop now with all the "where's the dip?" comments?  This is it, we're down about 2K from the last ATH, and it probably won't go much lower.  So buy now, shut up and hodl!

@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:37
This is true.  Don't forget the first-mover advantage, though.  Once LN has been rolled out, small businesses will be quick to support it, trying to gain that edge.  That will light a fire under bigger companies to get on board or start losing costumers to what's new and sexy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:28:36
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:23:27
Now I know.  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:39:22
I don't know.  With the price being now below 13K, it seems like they'd want to buy back right away.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:43
I think that says more about the reddit demographic than about crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:17:20
Well done!  You may now proceed to middle school.

I doubt people who only put in $100 are likely to panic.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:42:04
That's correct.  There are many ways to procure bitcoin.  You could even purchase it directly from someone you trust.  An exchange is just a convenient service for buying, selling and storing coins.
But the paradigm is to be your own bank, which means moving your coins into your own possession, your own wallet, at which point you can transfer them to other users directly, without using an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:22:50
Wink!  *ting!*
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:08:20
Ah, you're just a hater.  You obviously don't understand bitcoin's tech or its potential.  FYI, bitpay is a BTC-to-cash middleman.  LN will allow direct bitcoin purchasing down to the microtransaction level.
Come back here when you know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:50
I read the word "tomorrow" in the article.  ;)
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:26:44
I think he's mistakenly not including the lost coins among the 16 million in existence.

You may consider exchanges as third parties, but they are not needed to exchange bitcoin.  If you have your own coins, as in a wallet, you can send them to any address directly through the network.  No exchanges need to be involved.

Um, Lightening Network is not meant for buying bitcoin.  You still need some kind of exchange to do that.  But if you put money into your coinbase account, you can buy bitcoins using GDAX for far less.

You are absolutely right.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:10:53
What businesses want is profit.  It doesn't matter what form it takes, as long as the result is black and not red.  If they can increase revenue by accepting bitcoin, they will.  That's as simple as I can put it to you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:39:18
Not a great example.  To Gates, that's pretty much a dirty penny on the sidewalk.

@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:27

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:41
How bitcoin works, how LN and bitpay work, pretty much everything you've been ignorantly blathering about.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:35:51
You're right in a way.  It's not as cheap or as convenient, yet, so I wouldn't expect people to favor it in the mainstream.  But that will change if bitcoin is fully realized.
It has to do with scaling.  Take the LN, which enables microtransactions, which are cost-prohibitive to credit card companies and banks.  (Costs too much to process very small amounts.)  So that opens up whole new models for online businesses.  You might figure once people have incentive to buy coins for these new use cases, they'll be encouraged to use them for existing transactions too, which also become cheap and convenient.
But if you're only thinking about what bitcoin is today, then yeah, I'd just call it a bubble too.  I mean, it's also a lot of other things, but those things on their own aren't going to get the general public onboard.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:06:15
Fortunately they won't all sell at the same mark.  Most orders won't be at exactly 20K, so we'll just get a handful of sells at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:37:26
What if you don't know?

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:23:10
Right, so when we're talking about thousands of end users signing up, that doesn't really apply, does it?  Not much an end user can do to make companies support coins.

Technically, they legally cannot.  The feds are entitled to crack down, but they haven't yet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:31:29
You're being rather dull.  Some things die, and others survive.  Usenet news is out, but Reddit lives on.  MySpace lost, but Facebook won.  If I could have invested in the WWW back in the nineties, I would have, and there would have been plenty of doomsayers trying to convince me it was just a fad.
Bottom line is, if you don't believe in bitcoin, don't invest.  If people are nervous about it, it's only because Chicken Littles like you won't stop proclaiming the end is nigh.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:42:36
If you say so, but I've been in long for a few years now, with no intention of selling any time soon; and I love watching the markets.  Why get on Mr. Road's Wild Ride if you're just going to shut your eyes and plug your ears?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:34:37
Seems to me that small, on-chain purchases aren't really much of a thing heretofore.  LN will be adding this new class of purchases rather than replacing current types of transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:18:19
FUD and folderol.  LN isn't ready yet, but it won't take "years" for software interfaces to emerge, once it is.  That will be a race to market, and it will happen fast.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:55:40

How do you define "adoption", redditor for 4 days?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:12:30
Not a lot that people normally buy is available via bitcoin.  I'm not quite ready to pick up that Lamborghini, personally.  I used to buy games on Steam, but even they dropped support.
But that doesn't mean people aren't ready to "adopt" it.  I think they'll start consuming with it as soon as it's ready as a currency.

@_date: 2017-12-04 22:44:00
How will that work?
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:54:36
It's called modularity, and it's the basis for pretty much every large-scale software project.  One layer focuses on the security and stability required for value storage and large transfers, while another component builds on that to provide for smaller, day-to-day transactions.  Separation of responsibilities is good design.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:14:47
You have no clue.  Once LN rolls out, bitpay becomes obsolete.  Bro, do you even bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:37:20
Considering bitcoin as a new form of Pop Tart really does make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:28:58

And how did you know when LN will be ready?

I don't think you understand bitcoin.  You CAN send coin directly.  It just goes through the network, and the fees are just what keeps the network running.  But the network is no more a "third party" than the Internet is.  It's simply a decentralized, global cooperation of nodes.

Latter.  I think it's just a good long-term investment.  As it stabilizes, its value will increase.  Looks that way now, anyway.  This dip is far less severe than 2013, which means confidence is building.

Really clear so far, but what motivates the lender of an asset?
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:21:48
Because they're the most popular exchange.  The most popular anything gets a bad reputation sooner or later.

I'll just say it, since you're comfortable calling reasonable people morons.  You're completely paranoid.  Using an exchange is essentially like using a bank, something most of the smartest people in the world do.
Yes, you're more secure if you control your keys!  But it doesn't make people morons to take a measured risk with an established exchange.  Calm down.

Seems like it would destroy most of the value, though, most people would sell their coins.
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:51:05
Which might happen, as a lot of bad things might, such as a BTC crash.  But it's just dickish to call people morons for being willing to take a calculated risk.  There's no sense in saying it absolutely will or will not happen.  From my experience, I'd say the probability is reasonably low, unless you could can show me that it's high.

@_date: 2016-11-18 22:32:02
Not really.  Calling people morons for taking a small risk with a small amount isn't just wrongly insulting.  It also indicates an absolutist mindset, with no capacity to measure degrees.  Such a mind is either very dull, selling propaganda, or indeed paranoid.

I don't see a real difference there.  Money is money, no matter who you are.  What's moronic isn't using an exchange; it's investing more in bitcoin than you can afford to lose.

10K will be a major milestone.  My guess is it jumps a little higher initially from the hype, and then dips significantly, like up to 2K.  It may take the rest of January just to get close to 10K again.  Remember, though, the faster it climbs, the more it looks like a bubble.

Good arguments.  My smaller point was just that M$ got into the user market faster than Apple and basically won the race in spite of their crappy OS.  By the time Linux was ready to go mainstream, it was far too late, largely because the popular software was Windows.
Pretty much the same thing could happen with bitcoin.  It may not matter whether other coins are superior.
Also, Linux was always free.  But that's probably not analogous in the cryptocurrency space.

It's been climbing too fast, so there's a high chance it will dip lower in the near future.  I would wait for now and start buying after the drop.  Even if we get to $7K, there will be some profit taking.

Pessimism.  Even if BTC reaches 1 million, which isn't at all unlikely, there is already a problem with business plans based on fractions of pennies.  You have to keep an eye on the future.

@_date: 2019-06-29 01:49:55
I think it's already time to think about splitting the sat.  If a sat equals a penny, or five cents, then microtransactions are less interesting, since many applications will depend on fractions of pennies.

Maybe.  I remember a big push for Linux a few years back when a lot of non-technical people were considering switching over.

Even OpenOffice was a daunting learning curve.  I still use Windows to play games.

That may depend ultimately on whether BTC transactions offer real convenience to consumers.  People know how to manage multiple accounts, so there's no reason they wouldn't keep a small BTC account just for everyday use, without having to risk any real money.

@_date: 2017-09-24 19:54:07
Your technical knowledge lags behind your financial savvy.  A new "browser" doesn't make any sense.  The killer app many are banking on is convenient, browser-based microtransactions.  The W3C is working on an API to support that, which if it pans out will eventually be supported by the major browsers.  But people aren't going to adopt a whole new browser just because it can handle bitcoin.

I think it'll probably drop to $5,150 by mid-March, and then we'll see a short surge to about $12,345 during the next three weeks, followed by a plunge down to $1,984 in April.  After that it'll creep downward over the summer until it hits $666, at which point it will jump immediately to $90,210, and then early in November I expect it to start bouncing for a while between $3.14 and one MILLION dollars, stabilizing finally at the square root of negative seventy-two.  Maybe seventy-three.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:14:32

There are a number of promotional discounts, but there's also the lower transaction fees for BTC, so there is at least some incentive to support it.

@_date: 2017-10-23 22:22:29
I get that it's appealing, but I doubt it's really *compelling* to the average Joe.  Banks and debit cards are still a lot more convenient than bitcoin for most purposes, and few people are really worried about their bank accounts being seized, at least in the US.

@_date: 2019-09-26 14:00:46
It's taxes, so it's complicated.  Basically you're supposed to report all purchases made with crypto (any transfer to/from fiat), and then the basis is something like first-in-first-out, where they apply the basis of your first so-many coins against each purchase you make, then the next so-many coins, etc.
How they balance the mined coins with the capital gains, I can't say, since I haven't mined.  It's a bitch, anyway.  My GF had to outsource that part of my taxes, which took too long and cost me extra money.

That makes sense.  So you're saying even though dollars aren't real things either, except for the coins and bills representing a fraction of them, anyone over five will still tend to think of the dollar as a physical entity.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:06:51
Precisely.  Can't believe people here still don't recognize that as sarcasm.
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:24:36
Well, it is the world standard currency, backed by several generations of consensus.  I'm not pretending the dollar has any intrinsic value, but it's still a good point of reference.

That's not really a reason to disallow apps.  If you have to break support, then you of course have to be explicit about it.  But if a developer can get something to work on an older system, more power to them.
If the old system is a security issue, then that's a system-level problem.  There's no reason to ban specific apps and not others.

Plenty of us are in it for the tech, friend.

Interesting point about the five and under people.  To really understand bitcoin, you have to understand data structures and distributed systems, plus the nuances of crypto security, which I don't think a five-year-old typically would.  So my question is, what aspect of bitcoin do you think kids are better able to grok?

I'll bite.  What are trying to say?
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:38:47
Er, how compelling is that, do you find?  I don't think I've ever heard of someone's bank account being accidentally zeroed.
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:18:10
That's not a troll, but a valid opinion.  If you want bitcoin to look attractive, then treat the skeptics with some respect.  I own some, so it's disappointing to me when this sub looks like an echo chamber.

Oh, I remember.  I was doing Web development back then and cursing about IE to anyone who would listen.

No, I go back that far as well.  PNG should have completely replaced GIF years ago, since it does all the same things plus the alpha channel.  But old habits die hard, and GIF is pretty much synonymous with animation.
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:28:15
That's pretty cool.

I like how it's a gif.

GF is a tax consultant.  IRS has a way of working that out, such that they don't have to track where every coin is going.  Whether you're investing or just mining, it's still revenue.

dollardestruction.com?  What kind of source is that?

Ah, the language of hype!

I have no expertise whatsoever, but it seems to me that bitcoin will either fail catastrophically (maybe an exchange like coinbase gets hacked, maybe the US government legislates against it somehow), or it will continue to grow exponentially in the coming years.
But I don't think I'd buy just now, because I don't see it getting much higher before the next dip.  I'm looking for up to a 1/3 loss coming up, after which it will eventually come back and reach new heights.  That's just me sniffing the wind.
Buying now isn't a bad idea, if you're going long, though.  As long as nothing comes along and breaks (or subverts) it, you'll make a nice profit in time.

Why *wouldn't* online stores accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:08:50
Still a taxable event, unfortunately.  IRS don't play.

Guessing they're still required to pay tax on gains for any purchases they make, as in the U.S.

This.  I tried day-trading BTC, lost money.  I tried to catch the falling knife last year, lost money.  Just buy it and keep it.

What's the deal with that Web site?  It never shows the story at first, just a big page full of links and ads.  I have to click again to get to the content.

Here's a bit more advice.  Don't take to heart everything "fistingtrannygranny" says.

Probably, probably not.
