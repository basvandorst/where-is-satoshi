While I think Blockchain is the most important tech of this millennium so far, I just can't see how Bitcoin itself is useful right now. $20 transaction amounts, hour waits. Dubious exchanges. For big purchases sure. But doesn't the value rest on me buying coffee with it? Someone help please.

This is so important. Blockchain is the most important invention of the past 20 years. Bitcoin is just a speculative asset. It's not money, and it won't ever be a currency. It can be traded/bartered but never will be adopted widescale. Blockchain on the other hand will uproot all sectors.

This might be the most important thing to come out of this entire dip. Extremely true. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:34
Yeah I'm not defending BTC as a currency. BTC will never be a currency. It's not really rocket science.

To me the fear wasn't that futures would magically make markets volatile, but that large whales could be holding hundreds of thousands of BTC/LTC/ETH, and could manipulate the market to increase their short positions. I still think that's a valid concern.

Thanks.

Found the newbie! Kidding but bitcoins were hard to sell and not worth much for quite a while. Some of us bought some, sold/bought with most of it, and then left some in wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:22:49
how far away is that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:32:00
Excellent answer and completely agree.

Quick question, are you a communist?

Well then you're either foolish or naive. *Pays $17 in fees to buy bagel for .00000145 BTC, which will be worth $700 tomorrow*

This sub is such a circle jerk of ignorance. Pretty much every single crypto improves on Bitcoin. Faster, easier, less susceptible to 51% attack, lower or no fees etc.

I don't think it's bad advice, even though the meme is stupid. BTC and alts have finally gotten big enough where not just a few people, but TONS of people have become millionaires/extremely wealthy from them. And there is finally a ton of mainstream recognition. If BTC ever falls to 5k for example, I guarantee that price would be irresistible to everyone who now had millions in fiat due to crypto.

Hi could you elaborate on this please? I just found .5 BTC in an old wallet from 2011/2012.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:47:00
Extremely interested to see the results.

What does Bitcoin do? A store of value or a medium of exchange? If it's a medium of exchange being able to buy a coffee is the *only* important thing. 
I've been into BTC since 2011/12. Owned it since then. Transaction fees are too high, it's not scalable as a medium of exchange imho.

You realize that r/news, r/politics, and all the big normie subs all do the same thing right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:15:06
You're the voice of sublime reason, OP is the voice of circle jerking. This is pretty obvious for anyone outside the brainwashing camp. 
"Muh adoption. Muh Las Vegas bitcoin ATM."
It's not a currency, it's not gold. It's a wildly speculative asset bubble built on top of a paradigm shifting transformative technology. Anything less or more is a lie. And I love it, its made me money!

Yeah after reading 2 seconds of Szabos bio, I realized it was probably him. Most likely option.

Well let's see. The early adopters gained between 1000% to 200,000,000 percent. I would think that they have enough cash to keep buying up. Most early adopters are not hodling 100% of their investments.

Hey it me buddy. Please to send your Bitecoins to me.

I promise you without a doubt that the IRS cannot audit tens of millions of additional people. It is not possible currently.

Incredible. So you create a fork, I buy tokens for $1,000,000 per coin, and now everyone owes 1MM in taxable income. LOL
