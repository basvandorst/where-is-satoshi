 There is no proof of that,  it was dropped for lack of evidence and the many of the investigators are now I  jail or worse for corruption,  which makes me question all of the other evidence as well,  this was a witch hunt,  the government got butt hurt that he may have made money without paying taxes and made and example of him by fabrication of evidence.

 Yeah those agents were corrupt,  and likely planted evidence,  as well as multiple people had access to the DPR  account(s), so yeah there was too much fuckery with this case, if I were on the jury,  it would've been hung, to me the prosecution did not provide enough proof to beat the shadow of a reasonable doubt.

 What about the corruption of the investigators who used entrapment techniques against Ross, to me that calls into question all of the supposed "evidence", was it all fabricated and he made a fall guy for the corruption of another person holding serious power,  maybe even government?

 That they will,  they will even fabricate bull shit to make an example of people or have them killed,  ruby ridge for example. Can't trust a damn thing from the government.

 Personally I think he was guilty off something, most likely,  but because of the corrupt investigators,  it calls into question,  the whole investigation,   I have a shadow of a reasonable doubt over the charges he was convicted on,  on top of the sentencing was deliberately cruel and unusual for non violent crimes and in my opinion definitely unconstitutional.

 Allegedly, the agents who took him down got into trouble for corruption,  for me that casts doubt that he even committed any crime other than starting the site,  when the agents were caught planting evidence in other cases it brings into question if any of their "evidence" in this case was legit.  
The government made an example of him because they didn't get paid.

 Allegedly, there wasn't any 100% definitive proof so they dropped those charges,  also it was likely entrapment, as the "hitman" and "victim" were corrupt agents and were prosecuted themselves,  so yeah,  certainly makes me question the validity of the whole case considering the DPR account likely had multiple people accessing it.  Ross was likely an unlucky fall guy.

 Sounds like entrapment...
