Ding ding ding!
Someone is trying to not so subtly, and oh so clumsily, influence the "market".
Bitcoin isn't an investment.  It's gambling.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:29:32
You could show them recent market trends.  Given that bitcoin has been on a slow downward slide over the last six months, it's a great time to inform merchants that if they accept .1BTC today to cover $43 of goods, it will be worth $40 next week!
Unstable currencies with no advantage over the US Dollar other than making nerds cream their pants are great for businesses struggling to survive!  What small business doesn't want to risk a 7.5% hit to their revenue in a months time just due to instability?

Actually, I bet he has been embezzling those coins over the long run.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:35:19
Spend them on what?  Nobody accepts bitcoins.

Justifying 25% losses are profit.  Keep up the good work @_date: 2013-11-21 12:57:29
Funny how none of the essentials are on your map, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:06:03
Currency under hyper deflation or hyperinflation ceases to be currency.
And btc was never currency in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:24:27
Yes clearly.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:19:11


Projection much?
I don't like PK, but your prejudice is showing a bit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:26:41
So bitcoin can't buy essentials, which means it fails as currency.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:47:13
Who said anything about forcing?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:04:21
It was built for that reason, but failed.  It isn't currency because it cannot be freely exchanged for goods and services.  It's an investment in black market and money laundering futures which can very occasionally be bartered, but it is not a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:57:23
You just don't get it.  Your post was guilty of EXACTLY the same behavior you criticized in Paul Krugman.
Don't get me wrong, I really don't like that dude's opinions, but you are kind of a flaming hypocrite.

It also let's them store it in bank accounts and sit on it, as many CEOs do.


Most rich folks didn't get there legally.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:03:24


When it isn't theirs?  You fucking believe it.


As someone who has been asked by the FBI to wear a wire to work, I know it is true.  Shit goes down, most rich people have their hands dirty with funny money.

This is why I bank with a community run credit union.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:02:59
Not ever.  They hyperinflation and hyperdeflation of btc makes it a failed currency.  It's a high risk, but potentially rewarding investment in black market and money laundering futures, but it isn't a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:27:15
That makes zero sense.  Bitcoin is enabling people to launder money, thus increasing socio-economic inequality.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:07:07
The IRS doesn't recognize btc as currency.  It's a digital good and it's sale for USD is profit,
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:39:44
Bitcoin isn't legal tender, that would mean it could be used for any debts.  Germany recognized it as a monetary instrument for tax purposes in August.
You cannot live on bitcoin in Berlin.  I know people who live there, people in the city have never heard of it.

I filled out an online form in less than a minute, hit send, and was next day air mailed my card.


What is this?  1994?  My bank auto pays my credit card every month, and my records are stored automatically in PDF form.  I haven't received a paper bill in a decade. I haven't touched a physical check since 2006.


Maybe?  How many times have you declared bankruptcy?  I have three accounts, I got all of them in 5 minutes.  They approve anyone with a pulse.


No, my auto deposit happens instantaneously.  It arrives every month on the final day of the month and clears instantly.


I haven't been to a physical bank branch in two years, and the last time was because I wanted some $2 bills.


@_date: 2013-11-14 07:46:47
I've tried to buy bitcoins... Do you realize how many hoops I have to jump through to get cash into bitcoins, and then get the cash back out?
Then it takes up to an hour to confirm a transaction?
I'm sorry, but credit cards and online banking are much more hassle free, and it's a stumbling block for your movement.  I'd love to participate in the bitcoin economy, but it's very difficult to even move some money in to bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:23:39
But you are failing.  I tried to buy some bitcoins a few months ago, I couldn't get my hands on any by going through reputable sources or trustworthy procedures.
That is your current issue, bitcoins are not liquid.  You cannot easily convert to and from cash.  Bitcoins are like pricey Magic Cards.  In theory your Mox Pearl is worth a lot, but you can't pay rent with it, or use it to buy groceries.  Also the only way to get one is a back room cash deal with someone who smells like feet, and that's the only way to convert it back to cash too.
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:07:48
Wow, sounds like but coin is mature and viable as currency!  Us skeptics sure had it wrong!
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:09:03
How the fuck am I supposed to spend it?  I can't pay my rent in btc.  I can't pay my insurance in btc.  I can't buy my food in btc.  I can't pay my utilities in btc.
Btc can be used to buy drugs, guns, slaves, and mouse pads from geeky websites. It's great for laundering money, but not for use as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:32:15
This doesn't happen with real currency.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:43:56
The equivalent for credit cards is not days.  Merchants do not have payments denied days after accepting them.
And the comparison is not diagonal.  Aside from drugs, human trafficking, and weapons, there are very few things one can buy with bitcoins.  Reputable employers don't pay out in bitcoins, and the volatility of bitcoins makes them largely unsuitable as a currency.
When the price is rising quickly, it is encouraging hoarding and use as an investment, when the price is plummeting, it is encouraging merchants to cash out, lest they lose their revenue.
In the end, until bitcoins become easier to convert, and something more than a speculative investment in black market resources, they will never become mainstream.  They will be profitable, because some asshole is always looking to hide money in a tax haven, buy drugs, sex slaves, or weapons, and wants to do so in a less traceable manner.  But they will never replace current currencies in their current form.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:37:06
There is no government regulation.  When I tried to buy bitcoin it was in 2011 and 2012.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:58:26
Bitcoin!  Where socio-economic inequality is paramount!
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:27:15




Holy fuck you are down right chugging the kool aide.  Most people know nothing about bitcoin.  Those that do think it's purely for illegal transactions (and they aren't far from wrong).
You can't even buy a tomato with bitcoins at the store.
And selling a car for bitcoins at the current rate of volatility is STUPID.  Volatile assets make terrible currency, because in a day the buyer or seller can lose 10-20% easily.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:13:18
And like most start up ventures, you will fail.
The point remains, bitcoins aren't currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:01:37


If I have to spend time and effort to convince people btc is valuable, it isn't currency.  Nor is it worth my time. I make $100/hr, that's a waste of my time.
That that you, a btc booster, aren't even sure how to charge rent in btc given it's hyperdeflation and hyperinflation trends, is telling.  And what tenant is going to pay fixed btc rent when btc is skyrocketing?  It's just stupid.  And will you really  accept fixed btc for rent when the value plummets?  That would be stupid.
The truth is btc fails as currency.  You know it too, you just don't want to admit it.


I thought btc was currency not an investment?  If I can't pay my rent in btc it is not currency.

Oh please, other digital commodities have existed and been  accepted by the same order of merchants and bitcoin.  The only unprecedented thing about bitcoin is it's involvement in illegal transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:12:36


Not with bitcoin it isn't.  Given the non-liquidity of bitcoin it's difficult to say what that $20k will be once they manage to get it out of bitcoins and into real currency.  Bitcoin suffers from the same issues barter economies do.  The price fluctuates too much and the demand is not stable.  Since December 10th, bitcoin has lost 15% of its value.  That $20,000 is now $17,000.  $3,000 lost due to volatility sucks!  What sane person would accept those kind of risks for real physical property?
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:53:48
Who says success is beneficial here?  It's still a bad currency due to volatility.
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:50:00
That would be 2013.  No local grocers accept bitcoin.  No major airlines.  No gas stations.  No pharmacies.  Amazon does not.  iTunes does not.  Google play does not.  McDonalds does not, nor do good restaurants.  My local wine store does not.m trader Joes does not, nor does Whole Foods, or my farmer's market.  Target does not...
In short, it is not currency.  It's a speculative investment in black market derivatives.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:34:31
Please.  I still can't use it anywhere in the physical world in most major cities.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:47:54
The companies you listed don't distribute basic necessities, hence the "you're a fucking moron".
Hard as it may be to believe, your fridge doesn't magically fill up with food.  Your mom buys it with money while you're playing WoW in the basement.
Until she can do that with bit coin! it's not viable.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:06:14
The other link is blocked by China's national firewall.
It's besides the point anyway, if I have to hunt and quest to spend an asset it is not a liquid asset, and therefor not a currency.  It's a good that can be occasionally bartered.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:20:41
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:05:44
Oh yes, I can buy hundreds and thousands of worthless trinkets from a disreputable online merchant, but can't stock my fridge.
You're a fucking moron.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:37:40


Actually my bank pays me to do that.
And you can't transact for free with bitcoin.  You can't get money into bitcoins, or out of it without huge fees and hassle.
Bitcoins aren't money yet, they can't be used to buy most goods and pay for most services.


Not within the civilized world, no.


Don't be an idiot and bank with Bank of America or Wachovia,  bank with a credit union with reasonable policies, or an international bank with global presence.  Me?  I do both, I get my direct deposit in my credit union, and shift money into my international account for free.
I'm flying to Beijing tomorrow, I got my RMB at market rate with no mark up, because good banks exist which aren't predatory.  I also stuck $2k into my sister's account in Osaka for when I visit her, transfer will go through tomorrow, and there is no fee.
Of course if I was using bitcoin, I could send her some bitcoins, and we could sit around and talk about all the shit we can't buy because no one reputable accepts bitcoins.
