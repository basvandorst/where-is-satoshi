NO. It is very contentious. We mustn't risk the split.

Not that anyone in those countries can actually afford the Bitcoin fees...

Let's say we only have first two key parts. To get the 3A (which is really only thing you need), you just need to make A1 XOR B2.
So 3A = ea667a7f907fc61df23cb4
Now just concatenate in the key order:
1A + 2A + 3A = d517d45790db4f03467982 + d1619916f611634c898009 + ea667a7f907fc61df23cb4
And delete last two characters, because they are "extra" and not needed.
Thus, private key is: d517d45790db4f03467982d1619916f611634c898009ea667a7f907fc61df23c

Generating new key is even cheaper than disk space....
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:18:48
Alright, then, generating new seed is cheaper than disk space :P
(although I meant new random key, not based on the same seed)

I found it... You just concatenate 3x first 88 bits and truncate last 8 bits.
Private key is: d517d45790db4f03467982d1619916f611634c898009ea667a7f907fc61df23c

If you can collect fees by mining the sidechain that is pegged and convertible to Bitcoin, wouldn't that expand the theoretical maximum supply of 21MM BTC?

Another thing he fails to recognize is about changing the bitcoin protocol rules. Centralized (monopolized) mining pool couldn't change the rules of bitcoin, because changing them would require that every full node accepts the blocks that the specified mining pool mines.
Of course, the pool could censor some/all transactions, but I don't consider that changing the underlying rules.

Step 3 (Girl A gets the 1BTC and then walks away from the transaction) is wrong! 
Collateral and the transaction are tied together, and only B can release both, when he confirms that he has the money.

If you XOR all three parts of the Private key, you get:
This means that each piece is split in two parts. Each part is of equal length of 22 HEX digits.
If you make a XOR operation of the any two second pieces, you get the third.
exapmle: 3B07E369666EA5517BBCBD XOR 3F71AE2800A4891EB44536 = 04764D4166CA2C4FCFF98B

10 bits?

Having a second backup copy is quite important. I encrypt my private keys with a strong passphrase and upload them to my dropbox account. This allows me to potentially access my funds when I'm not close to my paper backup.

Didn't he commit suicide?

The thing is really simple. When the dollar colapses, prices will explode. So the price of Bitcoin will also explode. Even if your Big Mac is quoted $999.99, the price of Bitcoin will also be way higher so that Big Mac in Bitcoins is reasonably priced.

They could. But they probably won't.
This is the reason why other cryptocurrencies implement different algorithms for difficulty adjustment.

Bitcoin is a winner. Barely. And not for long.

It was about time to make that fork. It was always something that was obvious that had to be done.
Other than that, I fully support Gavin's proposal for 8MB (and doubling every two years) blocks, as it is the only reasonable way to go. I don't really care for XT, it's just a name of a project, and it really doesn't even matter how it's called. I see it as temporary, as Core will include the changes when the time comes. I'll gladly switch back to Core once the changes are included.
I've reviewed other changes in XT, and have determined that they are insignificant.

According to Nielsen's law, we're talking about 2Mbit/s in 2005, which gives 250kB/s. It would take 4s to transmit 1MB block. I don't think it would be a big problem to verify it.
Seems reasonable to me.

I for one would like to see that screenshot.

This is crap. He's using 2Mbit/s link in his simulation which is substandard for now nearly a decade.
Also, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. There are many novel solutions to that problem. Block size increase is relatively urgent and delayed for way too long. We shouldn't avoid block increase because there might once be another problem in the long run.

I don't think it is binary (at least not directly).
Flames come in four combinations of colors, as I can see it:
    (inside color) - (outside color)
    blue - yellow
    blue - red
    green - yellow
    green - red
    
Also, they come in two lengths - short and long. That makes 3 bits per flame. It can be mapped to binary on 8! = 40320 ways.
One example mapping is:
    bys 000
    brs 001
    gys 010
    grs 011
    byl 100
    brl 101
    gyl 110
    grl 111
    (where bys = blue-yellow-short, grl = green-red-long, etc..)
40320 combinations does not seem too hard to brute force, but how to check if output is correct? ASCII?

LibreOffice is the real OpenOffice. MariaDB is the real MySQL. Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Name really does not matter. It's open source, people will follow what they like best, even if you force bcash name like you did with BCH ticker. Deal with it.
