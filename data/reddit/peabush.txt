A fomo clock. I'm in! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:35:46
Maybe. I just don't use the exchange anymore. They told me it's good on their end. The bank can't see the transfer. Either kraken is lying or the bank hates Cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:46
I will also announce when the failure fails in 2 weeks time. Standby.. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:43:17
Nearing the 2 BTC value in my portfolio. Mainly alts. Only a matter of time before i do the switcharoo all back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:46:03
Ah a welcomed reversal in progress. I like it! Noooooiiiiiicce
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:28:26
Alright guys. Pack your bags and leave. The test phase of cryptocurrencies was a failure. Adoption and mainstream objectives failed. We will try again in 2020. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:11:00
You are better off buying different coins.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:55:12
Kraken failed me as well. Sent 30 euros as a test transfer 3 months ago. No show
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:28
Im sorry for all the worried people. I have taken out my investments so many times since august and reinvested in other coins. The price has to drop well below 1k.  I'll buy more if it drops to 7 or 8k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:50:47
Don't know about gdax. But easy to see on Bitfinex. sort by hour and zoom a little. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:29:32
It was 1 Euro when I started with CB
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:59:54
It is tied to cb. So yes you can
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:33
Ah see it. I have €1000 if I use cc
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:51:56
Spoke too soon :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:27:28
Had an order ready. Bought in at 15200
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:11
Remind me 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:20
All coins are on sale. This is a great Christmas present! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:32:43
Gravy.. I like that term. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:25
"Expect btc to be $20.000 by christmas"
"Expect a sub $10.000 by christmas"
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:14
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:54:33
It told me the same thing. But my buy went through. Bought 3 times today with no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:48:48
Hahaha! Thank you man. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:43:28
Well said
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:28
Weird for me it says €15.000
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:09:58
Bch is a bubble..... ��
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:09:34
You sort of sound like an angry ass hole.  I'm conflicted with the tone of tour comment and the message you are trying to spread..
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:27:42
What happens if I have btc in a wallet that does not support it yet?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:59:59
Thanks! Good call!
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:51:20
Ill admit it. I sold a coin today and I do not feel bad at all. Ill hold on to the rest.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:03:22
Why is it that "forking" exists? ELI10
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:47:18
Realistically when will we stop winning?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:37
Ok. So far so good. How do I sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:52:33
I hope so. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:18:12
Give me an address where I can send some btc to. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:42
It is soon Christmas. The sale doubled my monthly income after taxes. Concidering i invested when the price was 1700 then i am pretty pleased.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:15:52
How can you set up to help mine on slush?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:21:32
Why not. 1 btc may be worth 500k in the future so even a little may be a lot.
Go ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:34:46
Wish that old bot was active still. I would have tipped you. Welcome!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:48:06
Where did you sell? And I'm so happy for you@
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:50:41
I hate that it is dragging everything else down with it. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:53:43
Thanks !
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:25:19
FUCK VISA! 
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:49:22
How do you place a buy order?
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:50:44
+10 iota
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:12:32
Ok i know i could look this up on Google. But I like your way of explaining. 
I have some coins in exhoudus so I guess I own my private keys.  How do I get the new coin once the fork happens? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:17:39
Bought in the dip of 3000. Satisfied 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:00:29
Makes sense.  Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:58:16
I bought for 25 dollars at the 3200 drop. It is 34ish now.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:46:13
I'm relatively new. I have bitcoin.    How and where will the new coin be stored? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:51:37
It did not ;) still in the 0.60s 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:43:11
Tried. And succeeded! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:44:53
+10 iota
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:28:07
Will this devalue Bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:29:41
Why though? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:54:51
Those small amounts of btc that sits in the exchanges. Too small to send and too small to spend. /s
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:38:34
