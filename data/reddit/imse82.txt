Going up 10% in aday is more than usual for BTC, now that's 10% is close to $1400 that's why we are moving fast... The good before you know it 5k drops will be the norm ����

Serious question... When you have most of the top 30 coins in your portfolio, how the heck you supposed to mange not keeping it on the exchange?? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:44:25
What taxes lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:47:49
It all depends on what price you paid for BTC... If you bought at $19K+ your portfolio is down and probably panicking but if you bought couple months ago your portfolio still in the green ��

That's how I feel too but don't know if the possibility of another fork will push the price lower...
