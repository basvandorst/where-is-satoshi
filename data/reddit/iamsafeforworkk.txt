Yeah and when they don't we get hard forks. Development is probably the most centralized thing about Bitcoin, it always has been. 
To me nodes being centralized isn't really an issue when all of the other major parts of Bitcoin are centralized anyway. Having lower fees and faster transaction times would be worth it to me.

Absolutely true which is why you see zero posts supporting it. 
Hey guys, I've been around a long time and calling increasing the block size to 2MB an "attack on Bitcoin" is insane and is only an argument in an echo chamber. If you actually had to defend it, the only NO2X people would be Blockstream employees.
I'm ready for my ban now.

Oh boy, nodes being centralized would be just HORRIBLE. Good thing the dev team and the miners aren't centralized. That would probably be even worse!

I'll take your worthless 2x coins if you don't want them. 
Also what are you going to call your chain? I recommend Bitcoin Gold since it holds value but is slow and expensive to transfer.

OK at 2MB, how many years until the average user can’t run a node vs. 1MB blocks?

Is this a serious post?

If 4 years ago someone posted in this sub that going from 1MB blocks to 2MB blocks was an attack on Bitcoin and Bitcoin is doomed they would get downvoted and laughed out of the sub. 
Now it is gospel. You have all lost your minds.

It is. If Core wasn’t a group of children they would have supported 2x and they would still be in control of Bitcoin. But since they threw a temper tantrum over 1MB now they are going to lose control. Blockstream is about to learn how much power the miners have and why you shouldn’t fuck with them over one fucking megabyte.

It's only an "attack" because Core refuses to go along with it. If they supported 2x, none of this would be happening. But they decided that 1 MB increase might make it so the average person can't run a node in 10+ years so now we can only use L2 scaling which will maybe materialize one day.
All Core had to do to stay in charge was a 1 MB block size increase. But they got arrogant and decided that they were the rulers of Bitcoin so here we are.

Oh no, not a hard fork! Good thing they avoided that and now we have this clusterfuck which is so much better.
