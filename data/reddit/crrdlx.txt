Yes, this is the answer. Why are we even fooling around with other denominations like bits and ubits and whatever bits. Were on a freight train to dealing in Satoshis. The sooner we start using them, the sooner we get there. Look at my post about Satoshi Day.

Coinbase has lately been having issues with their paper wallet functionality. The addresses  and  no longer work, they redirect to  They say they're working on fixing the paper wallet system. So, hold off on using that...use another paper wallet source instead.

The standard snswer would be: the price rose way too fast, some people sold to collect profits.
But the correct answer is: there is no known reason for these things. As soon as you think you've got this game figured out, you're about to get rekt.

Why bother going to all that effort to generate a huge money supply? The government could just print everyone a $1 billion dollar bill, hand it out, then we're all billionaires, right? Scarcity. There's the intrinsic value of bitcoin.

Your post was in July, 2011, I kind of remember those days. If remember correctly, the price had just run up from single digits to about $30. This was either the first or the second big run. Then it dig pull back, which is likely what prompted your post. I just remember that because that's almost exactly when I first heard about bitcoin, from this NPR episode:  The article might be worth reading or the episode worth listening to if you want an interesting look-back, and to put into perspective how far things have come.

Hi Dorian,
It's neat that you joined in here. A couple of things...
* You're very likable because you embody characteristics that I see bitcoiners often having--you're passionate and opinionated, smart, funny, kinda goofy and kinda wacky (I mean that in the best possible way).
* Question: Is there any question you'd like to ask Ms. Goodman? 
* Calling out Ms. Goodman, because she must be monitoring this, do you still believe this fellow is the real Satoshi? (In other words, it'd be a great part 2 and it'd be okay to say, "Maybe not.")
Also Dorian, if you go to Chicago for a train thingee, let folks know. My grandfather used to run HO scale trains there at the Museum of Science and Industry. He had the engines' extra spaces lined with lead so they could pull more weight. He talked the head guy at MOSI to let him hook up every car in the place behind his engine and pull them around, it was cool!
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:41:28
I gotcha. And, hey, no matter what happens, we'll still have FUD dogs. So, there's always that.

In my view, holding your own Bitcoin, that is, holding your own private keys is best. For the convenience of, sorta, getting into Bitcoin via traditional markets, GBTC is easy. Another option at a much lower price is BITCF at 8 cents/share. However, an ETF would be beneficial for the grandma and grandma who want to "get into Bitcoin" through their nice young financial advisor guy at the the local office. It'll come. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, DYOR.

Dec. 31, 2014...either $1200 or $3100, take your pick, or take the average of the two and call it $2150. [Graphs here](

I like your ideas, they seem well thought out and thus make sense. Especially your notion of overstock.com and the safe haven. I can imagine that's if one major retailer went bitcoin, others would see the potential/profits then it would be a free for all for others to catch up. Regarding the safe haven, yep, some sort of collapse or tragedy or war might result in that. Also, I imagine Chinese folks will "go underground" if the government cracks down further. Though the government may try, I'm not sure the tide can be held back. Freedom, once you've gotten a taste of it, (in this case economic freedom), is a something you don't let go. My price prediction Dec. 31, 2014--$2150.

Thanks for the comment. I liked those two analogies. You're so right when you say "For very-lay explanations you need a good analogy." And you're also spot-on saying the analogies could be more accurate but that's not the point. I'm a teacher (history) and much of the time I need a one or two sentence answer (preferably one) regardless of how complex the question is. After giving the short answer, I go from there.
