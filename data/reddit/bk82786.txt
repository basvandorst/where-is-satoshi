I'm only going to buy enough BTC to cover what I'm spending. I don't want BTC just sitting in the account for a period of time. I've looked over that site and it gave me some insight. I just am confused still a bit. If the site says my balance is zero do I need to buy the coin then just transfer it straight to there? Or first to a wallet, then from the wallet to the site? I appreciate the help guys. I'm a tech person and this is confusing me

I'm wanting to purchase one bitcoin to use on another site. I don't want to use any bank info if at all possible. Would rather just buy from the ATM. But the site has a link to my account so I'm confused. Would I send the coin to my wallet and then from my wallet to the site? It isn't being stored there as I'm only transferring what I'm spending. Then once I have it on my account on the site I transfer it to the merchant? Every app I've looked at always asks for either bank info or credit/debit card so I'm just trying to figure things out now for when I buy the coin next week. Also, what's the difference between a public and private key?

I am wanting to buy BTC to buy goods but things are a bit confusing to me. First off, would I be better off buying from someone or a website, or use an atm? Once I purchase the BTC what is the best place to store it? I don't want to link bank accounts and all that which is why I think using an atm would be best. If I do use the atm here locally do they just give me a QR code and if so what's the best mobile app to use to get my coins where I can spend them? I've read the FAQs around I'm just still a bit confused. All help is greatly appreciated
