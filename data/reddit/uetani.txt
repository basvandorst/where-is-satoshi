You’ve been downvoted, but hopefully that was just because of the way you presented the argument. Everything you said is correct except that OP has admitted to tax evasion - he’s just admitted to thinking about it.
A Bitcoin or Ethereum account is no different than an old-school numbered Swiss bank account. Yes, it provides a certain level of pseudonymity, but where the banks were paid money to act professionally and protect your identity, most cryptocurrency holders are shockingly sloppy in how they treat their own.
If you ever transferred any crypto from a KYC’d source to any account you have, you’ve been tagged as owning that account.
Even if you use Bankor or some other non-KYC’d exchange to move those funds to Monero, one of the 4% of Z(Y)cash accounts that are shielded, or some other privacy coin, the government can point to your ownership up until that point. You then can choose to pay taxes on the transfer and tell them you still have the coins, or you can pay taxes on the sale, because the tax authorities in many places consider that a taxable event, and lie (a crime) that you got something (pizza?) in return.
To be truly anonymous you need to have only held a strong privacy coin, been careful in how and where you held it, and entered and/or exited through non traditional financial transactions that don’t involve the traditional banking system. In other words, small sums only.

There’s a great video of a mid level IRS guy giving a talk and he gets asked about Bitcoin and people hiding money with it. His answer is spot on. He says that the IRS takes vast amounts of data and sifts it to find connections between people, accounts, payments, and income, and that they’re better at it than anyone else on the planet. Bitcoin just gives them a readybuilt database with an unassailable chain of custody record.
In other words, if they can ever tie an IP address, a bank account, an Amazon purchase, an email address, an account alias, or any other bit of metadata to you and to a Bitcoin address, they are going to own you.

You’re better off transferring cash to Coinbase, then going to Coinbase Pro ( moving your Coinbase funds there (Deposit—&gt;From Coinbase), and buying using limit orders. Yes, you’ll have to wait for your funds to clear (Typically 5-7 days for me.), so if you’re buying the dip and are sensitive to time, you’ll need to decide which is better for you.

I think you just answered your own question, but don’t realize it.
First, the internet is not a network protocol, nor is it a platform. The internet is what we get when many different platforms can communicate together.
TCP/IP is the protocol suite for much of what happens on the internet today, but not not everything, and it certainly wasn’t always that way. First there was NCP, then TCP, and then TCP/IP.
Bitcoin is certainly part of the internet right now, and is a strong platform, but it’s only one of many. Adobe Flash was a low-level cross-platform tool that lost relevance as HTML, another platform, became more capable more gracefully. Many computer languages, all useful and some dominant (Borland Turbo Pascal!) for a time, were surpassed and are no longer important. Some absolutely dominant websites and software applications (MySpace and iTunes come to mind.), are dead or dying because while they were revolutionary for their time, over more time they suffered from architectural or other design flaws that newer solutions overcame.
So Bitcoin is the 5000lb gorilla now, no doubt about it, but nobody knows now whether Bitcoin style POW survives the end of emissions, whether POS is better or worse, whether DAGs can function as theorized, or whether governments will insist upon and eventually create DPOS/BFT systems with limited but significant independence and the speed needed to run an economy.
Maybe Bitcoin is just MySpace or NeoPets or, even, the internal combustion engine. What we do know is that time and technology always march on.

To be honest, putting your USD into USDC on Coinbase (It’s free and a straight 1:1 conversion.), then taking it and the rest of your crypto there and putting them into Coinbase’s vault system is probably safer than you handling the coins on your own. I know that purists will say “Not your keys, not your coins,” but for a lot of people it’s just better to stick with Coinbase. Just be aware that anything in a vault takes three days to be released, including USDC.
And use a password that you’ve never used anywhere else, as well as Authenticator. LastPass has a great free app that will create and manage passwords for you as well as an Authenticator app that backs up to your main LastPass account. Highly recommended.

I’ve used Coinbase for years. The only reason it would take three days on coins purchased a year ago is if they were in a vault. And if you were able to send BTC from one address to another in five minutes, you must be a time traveler - Bitcoin only writes a new block about every ten minutes.

Hey. Let’s answer your question. :)
You are incorrect in thinking that the government cannot track you with Bitcoin. I assume that since you are accepting BTC as payment, that the address(es?) you use are either on a website or sent via email. If that’s the case, the address(es) are already kinked to you and not declaring that income would be foolish. You’ll get busted at some point.
Now about how to pay. The moment you receive the BTC is the moment the IRS counts it as income. But in order for taxes to be calculated, you need to have a value in US dollars. There are lots of companies (I like  that will look at that BTC transaction and calculate the amount for you.
But it gets more complicated. I assume that you have exchanged your BTC for cash at some point. If you did, that’s another transaction that can affect your taxes. (If not, and you have just kept all your BTC, then the above “income” calculation is all you need.)
For example, let’s say that early in 2019 you got paid 1 BTC for something. If the price of BTC was $4000 at the time, you’d need to book $4000 of income and pay those taxes come tax time.
But let’s say that you decided to take a vacation Hawaii at Christmas, so you sold that BTC to get cash for the trip. When you sold the BTC, the price was $9000. That’s fantastic, because you just made another $5000, but you now need to record this income, which is called “capital gains”, and pay the IRS taxes on that as well. Tokentax and others can figure this out for you as well.
In the end, you can make your Bitcoin taxes easier by practicing good tax hygiene. This means that income addresses are only ever used for income — You don’t sell BTC from them or pay anyone in BTC from them. That makes it easy for the tax guys (Tokentax or wherever), to track that income.
Likewise, if you sell BTC, you probably do it on an exchange. Transfer your BTC from the income exchange to the exchange and sell there. If it’s a major exchange, you will be able to set it up so that the tax service can automagically download your activity and use it to compute your capital gains.
Lastly, you should practice good Bitcoin privacy hygiene as well by never reusing an address. Doing that allows anyone who sees the address to see all your past (Every single one.) transactions and then trace those out to everyone who transacted with you and see all of *their* past transactions, and so on and so on.

That's why you need to look at the \_adjusted\_ volumes rather than the self-reported ones. Cointiger is [ranked  in self-reported numbers]( and [\ in the adjusted numbers]( where CMC attempts to strip off the self-trading or wash sales.
Cointiger is Singapore-based, BTW.
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:11:23
CoinTiger is small, but as a Singapore-based exchange they have potential. They're also not as small as you might think, at least on some pairs. CMC ranks them just below Kraken and above Bittrex, Gemini, BitFlyer, and Poloniex in total adjusted volumes.  
But, this is a shitty response from them to a shitty situation that they are 100% in control of. Banning me on Telegram was just stupid, and not offering any kind of progress or explanation for 17 days is bad business. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:41:49
If you just want to keep your BTC for now, you don’t need to worry about any capital gains tax — That hit occurs when you sell. You do need to pay for the income, and you’ll need that US dollar amount anyway for the capital gains when you sell.
Be smart — the IRS looks at blockchains as the most indisputable evidence chain ever. Unless you can receive and use BTC with absolutely no exposure to any website, email address, mobile phone number, or even IP address, they’ll get you in the end.

CoinTiger is Singaporean with a Hong Kong/China technical team. You might be surprised at the volume. It's certainly no Binance, but volumes are much higher than you presume. CMC ranks them just below Kraken and above Bittrex, Gemini, BitFlyer, and Poloniex in total adjusted volumes.
I'm hoping that this is a one-off problem, but I'm very disappointed that they refuse to communicate what the problem is, what I can do to help resolve it, and when that resolution might come. All I get is a canned copypasta response on DMs, and, as noted, I've been banned from their Telegram channel, which is just stupid.

Heheh. If you only knew. But you don't, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:01:19
I disagree. Let me explain.
CMC pulls a steady stream of data. They have to do this to get the pricing they require.
In the data, we can see bids and asks.
If there is a 0.5% spread and a bid has been sitting for a couple of minutes before it gets hit, we can be very, very confident that this is a real trade. Ditto for asks.
If a bid suddenly appears 1 tick above the existing bid and with milliseconds gets hit with an ask that exactly matches its volume, we can be very certain that this is a wash trade. Ditto if it starts with an ask 1 ticker lower than an existing ask. 
In-between, we can make judgement calls, but because people have been doing and tracking wash trades forever, there are quite good algorithms for picking them out. Combined with other algorithms looking at volume flows, it gets accurate enough for companies like CMC to publish two sets of exchange rankings (As CMC does.) that show both the raw and adjusted numbers.
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:29:51
It’s also pretty easy to filter out when you have a steady stream of market data like CoinMarketCap does. The comparison above was from CMC’s adjusted volumes.
@_date: 2018-10-20 06:58:42
This response always surprises me. They're just below Kraken in *adjusted* volume and above Gemini, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. They're also based in Singapore, which in many ways is more secure than Hong Kong.
@_date: 2018-10-20 07:12:23
As I mentioned above, they're not that small -- Almost exactly the same size as Kraken in daily volume, and bigger than Bittrex, Bitfinex, and Gemini.

Coinbase is fine, but don’t buy with a debit card. Deposit with your debit card or from your bank via ACH. It takes a few days, but it’s free.
Once the money is in Coinbase, go to  and login using your Coinbase username and password.
Once logged in, go to deposit and deposit your funds to Coinbase Pro. You’ll initially get a window to deposit from a bank account, but at the top on the right side you can change it to deposit from a Coinbase account.
Do that and then pull your money to Coinbase Pro. It’s free and instant.
Once your money is on Coinbase Pro you can buy Bitcoin on the exchange. If it’s new to you, don’t worry. Just go to the upper left of the screen and find BTC/USD and select it as the pair you want to trade. Then go down the left side and select MARKET as your order type. Fill in the amount you want to spend ($200) below that and place your order. The cost will be 0.2%, or $0.40. This will be taken from the total when the purchase is done, so put the whole amount ($200) that you want to spend.

Not true.
It takes more time, but at Coinbase you can ACH your money to Coinbase for no charge. Figure 5-6 working days *after* you make the request to get access to you cash. That’s the amount of time it takes your bank to get a Coinbase the money and let any clawback provisions expire.
Once your money is in Coinbase, go to Coinbase Pro (It’s the same account and password, just a different site.) and go to DEPOSIT. One of the options will be “From Coinbase Account”. Move your money from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro there. It is instantaneous and free.
Now purchase your ETH or BTC or whatever on Coinbase Pro. If you buy at market price (The “taker” price.), the fee is 0.25%. If you use a limit order and get hit at your “maker” price, the fee is 0.15%
For reference, if you bought $150 at a market price of $11,359/BTC you’d pay $11,387.39/BTC, netting you 0.013172465332267BTC.

To each their own, but Ethereum now has much more stablecoin activity than Bitcoin, there is more wrapped BTC (BTC on Ethereum) than there is BTC in the whole lightning network, and Metamask Mobile’s new Instapay feature allows instant (2-3 seconds) payments of DAI at zero cost.

There are no laws that say you need $25k to daytrade, and you certainly do not pay any more taxes, whether for stocks or commodities such as crypto. Any $$ requirements are by the exchange you use.
Regarding taxes, read up on how commodity trades are taxed and that’s how crypto is taxed in the US. The TL/DR on it is that even if you use Crypto A to buy Crypto B, the US government calculates the trade as if you sold Crypto A for USD and then used those USD to buy Crypto B. This USD calculation is then used to compute the taxes you owe. The percentage you owe depends on whether you held Crypto A (The crypto you sold.) for more or less than a year. That determination is affected by whether you chose LIFO or FIFO as your accounting basis.
Good luck. Also, don’t daytrade.

Robinhood does not allow withdrawals of Bitcoin. When you buy “BTC” on Robinhood, you’re actually just buying a marker that tracks the BTC price.
Why is this? Robinhood doesn’t charge fees, so they take your cash and invest it to capture the “float”, or interest, on your cash while you hold their marker. Later, when you sell to someone else, they’ll take that person’s money, give them a marker, take your marker back, and give you the money from the sale.

That’s not really the point. The size of the mempool dictates how long it takes to get a transaction confirmed at a fixed price. 
Here’s the source for the original graph:
And here’s the same information from another source.
That site also shows the median block confirmation time, which has recently been 10-12 minutes.
And, finally, it shows the average number of transactions per block, currently between 2000-2500.
Combining these all shows how mempool size can be a problem.
Mempool size is 60,000
Median block confirmation time: 10 minutes
Average number of transactions per block: 2,500.
So at a given transaction cost, it will take 60,000/2,500 = 24 blocks x 10 minutes = 240 minutes = 4 hours to get your transaction confirmed.
Of course, you can pay more for a faster confirmation time. Here’s a breakdown of that as well.

There's a huge difference between permissioned and permissionless setups.
If you're tracking logistics and using a permissioned setup, you're much, much better off with a dPOS or similar protocol because you have external leverage on bad players and don't need POW or a more complicated POS system to validate everything. Ethereum would be overkill, in my opinion, but that said, it's what JP Morgan chose. Perhaps they chose it because for banking they felt that the additional security was worth the additional overhead. Because permissioned setups are going to be more application-specific, I expect that we will see all sorts of solutions in that space.
