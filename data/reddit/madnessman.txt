Thanks for the information. I have a related question. I've heard a few things about Bitcoin and Singapore. Being a Singaporean, should I use a different Singaporean based online wallet?

Of course the COE isn't that high! Don't be ridiculous. It's only around $80k SGD right now. So low! /s

There is some misinformation in your post which I would like to clear up. 


False. Singapore is actually quite green. I've lived in Singapore, New York, Tokyo, and Santa Clara before. I think that Singapore feels the most "green" and "naturey" of all those cities. Tokyo and Santa Clara feel more environmentally conscious in terms of recycling, composting, etc. but Singapore probably has the most greenery. [Here is a satellite image of Singapore]( You can see that there are large portions of the island which are reserved for tropical rain forests. Even [Orchard Road]( Singapore's largest shopping street, has plenty of trees.


I'm not sure about this one. You'll only get caught if you run a red light with a camera installed. Not every junction has a camera but I heard that the gov is trying to install more cameras so there's that. I've never been caught running a red light but I think what happens is that they send a letter to the registered address of the car ordering you to pay a fine. You can probably set up GIRO or something to pay directly from your bank account but I don't think it's completely automatic.
