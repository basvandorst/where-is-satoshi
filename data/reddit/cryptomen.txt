This is great news! 
Do you provide additional discounts on goods using BTC?

I like that a lot of companies have started using Bitcoin. This is indicates that the system is sufficiently developed and it is necessary to extend the scope of use for further growth.  What we're  seeing now.

I'm happy for you! This is a great buying. It is also a great example of using Bitcoin today, which indicates the development of the BTC-payments

Is CIA an altcoin?

These guys are the best!  MIT is supporting their innovative initiative.  Bitcoin system develops thanks to such people.  And today  we are considering the possibility of cryptocurrency on par with the usual currency as a instrument of payment thanks to such people. Keep up the good work!

This ATM accepts  Australian dollars or USD and euros? How much is the commission?

ITA! It is a sensible idea! IMO, Bitcoin will be a cure for the global financial system

How much they pay for 100k and 30k? You know that? It's very intresting.

Thanks for the video from the expo! 
I especially liked the part that told Alan Reiner - "A non-technical introduction to Bitcoin."

What if I post a hundred predictions in small increments?
Is this allowed?
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:41:59
IMO, this is the highest form of globalization

Money laundering is one of the problems of the economy and the modern as a of the world consequence . I don't think that Bitcoin  can help's to cope  this problem somehow because the root cause of this problem is in the humans. IMO  people's worldview needs to change firstly.

Sorry, I read the title wrong. I know where is Austria 
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:07:19
It's cool! It is proves  that "vintage" companies are not afraid to keep up with the times and Bitcoin is gaining the trust from all kind of people
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:06:29
People, stop using gold!!! You should save the people by using Bitcoin, LOL

1990-1992 I would guess to be a pretty good parallel for where we are today with Bitcoin.
"The Internet's takeover of the global communication landscape was almost instant in historical terms: it only communicated 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 1993, already 51% by 2000, and more than 97% of the telecommunicated information by 2007"
If my theory proves to be accurate, Bitcoin will be several orders of magnitude larger by 2020.

Checks name *bitcoinpropaganda". Yep, seems about right.

Good one, and sadly, true.
Had a payment from Moon Bitcoin today, been over an hour and only one confirmation thus far.

I like the  paper OTP login. It is an innovative idea! But I don't understand SMS OPT login. It'll linking login with a phone number or this will happen only once?
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:41:16
This is great news! Bitcoin is on the way to the MOON!

Wikipedia lost status of encyclopedia long time ago because anyone can make edits in posts

I think marketing is necessary for Bitcoins but only to disseminate information and attract new followers.
