America has had consistently about 60-75 percent of the entire world's gold reserves in the last 20 or so years.

Yeah, I mean if Russia went on the gold standard it might make lessen the value of the dollar...but I can't imagine by any meaningful amount. If other countries did at once, maybe it would be more meaningful. Very unlikely, though.
Still, destroying America's economy by one country going on the gold standard is far-fetched.

In what ways would reimplementing the gold standard benefit Russia?

They're right. GDP and market cap is apples and oranges.
Look at 90% of the lower-tier coins on CMC. Many of them are worth millions in market capitalization while only having trading volumes of thousands or sometimes even hundreds of dollars. 
I can create a cryptoasset with a supply of 2 billion. If I sold a few of these for $0.50 on a low-volume exchange, this would add $1 billion to the total market capitalization. There are tons of coins like this, hundreds. These coins are fluff added to the market cap. 
I would say it's not even accurate to compare crypto market cap to market caps of Fortune 500 companies because they're so ridiculously speculative and inflated and up to the discretion of one website to add coins.
It's another thing to compare to GDP, which is concerned with the final value of goods and services. That just makes no sense.

This isn't 100% accurate. The above quote is correct, however, there's more to the story.
The Exchange Act dictates that if unidentifiable people can influence the market, then there needs to be a proven market of significant size related to the fund that can can be surveilled. 
Not saying this is good or bad, but the ETF exchanges tried to propose that futures markets could suffice as a markets of signifiant size. The SEC determined that they could not prove that, as there is little liquidity in futures markets.
So because the spot markets are susceptible to market manipulation *AND* there was no connected market of significant size, the SEC determined that an ETF was not appropriate. 
Not saying I agree or disagree with OP, but the official SEC order is a bit more detailed than what OP is saying.

can't speak to those, but without sources you can't prove your point either.
Lightning is fucking kicking ass, so I would say yes it is getting stronger.
