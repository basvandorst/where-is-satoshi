Congrats either way!!!
@_date: 2019-07-16 05:57:56


haha, but factually you gifted them over 10k each :D (depending on the current price )

"will be around forever" is an overstatement though. Technology doesn't stay in one place. I'd be surprised if it's around in 50-80 years.

I started hearing about it when there was a scandal revolving around the MT.Gox hack. Of course it didn't look very appealing at the time. Later, when it bounced back, it cost around $600, which was a bit much for a student to invest, considering that I didn't have proper understanding about what it actually is and about the future prospects. I didn't even know about reddit at the time :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:58:10
Wow. Is it possible?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:22
are they DONE? no more trust in this company?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:17:25
can you post a screenshot of the conversation you had with the guy? it's an incredible story
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:32
could you elaborate? AFAIK it can be used as a platform to build applications and have other prospective features.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:23:01


that's very cool of you.  


Then I gues it wasn't him. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:05:51
either you are too noble or you are good 'storyteller' :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:44:10
Congratulations! I fucked up by not getting on the train...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:42:35
bet their balls? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:44:42
did he give you any finder's reward? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:30:16


Nope. AFAIK less than 1% of BTC is used in commerce (excluding darknet), and a lot of people still have no idea how to obtain BTC in many mid-level to advanced countries. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:20:32
did you confirm that the wallet actually belonged to this person?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:55:13
Wow, 5057? And I'm sitting here thinking how 100BTC would change my life... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:55:26
I would suggest donating to research. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:56:18
Except wall street is probably manipulating the prices now
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:56:55
Solid points 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:51:40
I think you're onto something. Amazing story. I wonder if he gave some BTC to Dorian.... if Hal was Satoshi, did he leave his BTC to his family or would it have been lost forever? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:19:41
wow. I guess even if he's alive, he can't touch them, unless he goes abroad and tries to sell them in-person, which would be a sensation in the news I presume. Someone is probably watching them 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:07:08
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:17:05
good stuff! but you're gonna have to distinguish between your and you're. Cheers~
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:36:34
Will the economy of scale make it cheaper? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:59:52
Yep. He did 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:30:52
I missed something. What did Coinbase do?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:55:51
I see. I guess more people should know of this scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:09:39


how about his family's security?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:00:46
Eth a shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:22
How about high transaction cost and threatening US dollar? If sovereign countries start to feel threatened, they can inflict massive damage to btc
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:12:22
is he for real or just trolling? if the latter, it's fucking hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:16:56
Interesting. Among alts,  Ripple seems to have been integrated/adopted into some huge banking systems and daily circulation is counted in billions. Even Bill Gates mentioned it. I think Ripple is prospective, but there are like over 300 bln coins, so I'm not sure how fast it can rise in value. It's pretty volatile. However, it doesn't seem like a scam. It offers little/no anonymity, but some think it can substitute the SWIFT system.

Hi, it's actually the countrywide price and there is no cap I know of. I know that mining is done on a big scale in china and that we should mine too so that there will be some balance or something similar was said by a bitcoin expert. By the way, what would you recommend for starters? Antminer t9? or should I start with S7 to gauge the possibilities? How much does a starter pack cost, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:44:10
but it will probably gives them a reason to monitor you more
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:08:58
how do you "run" the node? (I didn't know there were nodes for bitcoin). Do you get some annual interest for running the node?
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:50:29
how so? The lightning network? Are major exchanges using it?
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:28:30
Lannisters send their regards. :)
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:40:52
The higher the price, the higher are the transfer fees. People don't wanna pay high transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:58:54
hahaha fuck you!
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:52:43
Thumbs up pal. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:35:32
You have a way with words
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:23:23
Thanks for the info. I'll check that info for myself.
@_date: 2019-06-10 18:36:50
Was it safe?
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:43:37
The first thing he says "I don't know much about cryptocurrency". So yeah, his opinion on this is very valid. Now let's hear what ballet dancers have to say about about the next financial crisis.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:52:12
But someone is definitely watching his wallet, right? If he transfers them to another wallet, it will be all over the news, and it becomes likely that his identity will be revealed.
