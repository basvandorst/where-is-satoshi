Nice opinion there, mind elaborating with some examples?
I loosely follow the wider community and don't understand why the Bitcoin Foundation gets so much hate on this sub.

 I haven't tried it myself but I imagine you can fund Android/Apple Pay with the virtual cards from this.

This app doesn't appear to do anything more than present a GUI frontend to vanitygen. The important questions would be did you build vanitygen from source and do you trust that source?

[blockparser]( "allBalances" can do this fairly quickly.

Not complaining, this is cool, just wondering if these was any reason around the chosen USD values?

Doesn't the case also act as a necessary heatsink though?

Read about [Getblocktemplate](
Edit: missed the ELI5 tag, sorry. If you're genuinely interested in the technical details of Bitcoin mining pooled or otherwise, it would be wise to take the time to understand the protocol specifics and not rely on an abridged explanation likely to omit important concepts.

I'm hoping OP acquired this for far less than some of the ongoing eBay auctions. Looks like a recent mint so I guess not.

Good spot krillcoin, a great example of how malicious binaries can be distributed with the allure of being built from open/reviewed source.
I still don't understand why anyone would want a GUI for vanity address generation anyway..
