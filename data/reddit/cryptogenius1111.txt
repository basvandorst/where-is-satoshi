If this will result in a hard fork I don't see any reason as to why block size shouldn't be increased to at least 4 mb also, that's not a lot and wont make it more centralized.

Now watch Mark Dice, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson and all those fake libertarians completely agree with Trump because it's Trump.

Ethereum is good also because of smart contracts.

100% wrong. First of all the fiat will fall more, so it's still good to have bitcoin. Secondly what you said could also be said about gold or anything else. There is no difference. Most likely though, the price of bitcoin will go UP, because people will flock to it as we already see in countries with failing currencies. You need to go to fud school.

He literally called the same drop every day, he is only right when it goes down.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:55:09
He does that to suck up to bitcoin devs in order to sell his bs seminars and courses. He doesn't contribute anything to the space. He also said that bcash is definitely not a scam.

Tone said bcash is not a scam while much better projects like ethereum are: [

Not by trading but by conning people. He's not good trader, he was telling people to sell bitcoin all of 2017 EXCEPT when it was 17k.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:41:27
He loves bcash though, believes it is much better than other alts: [

He has famous friends like Max Keiser and some bitcoin core developers with large followings. Max Keiser gives him plenty of shoutouts, so he gains more followers. His track record is not good and was often bearish in 2017. A few months ago he turned off comments on his youtube videos.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:09:05
He was like this last year. Every time I checked what people were saying on twitter he would say bitcoin was going down. Didn't matter if it was 1000 or 10000.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:32:31
Max Keiser was telling everybody to buy bitcoin when it was 15-20k. He made fun of Mike Novagratz who told people to be careful at 14k. Max Keiser is an idiot.

Actually he is a shill for bcash. In a tweet he said bcash is not a scam, while ethereum and other alts are.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:38:01
Tone was not right. He called the top every month in 2017. Had you listened to him you would have never bought. He panicked and told all his following to sell when bitcoin was 5500 and bcash pumped, exactly at the dip. To make it worse he told people to buy at 17k.

Almost all popular crypto youtubers should be on there. Vitalik and Binance CEO shouldn't.

Of course tether should be worth less than one dollar.  There are many exchanges that offer USD pairings these days so there is no good reason to pick tether over these.

You will never make money as an investor with that newbie mindset. You are literally saying the best time to buy is at ath and the worst is at the bottom because you think the price will continue.

The one thing about him is his lack of understanding for economics. He always says it's a terrible idea to invest in bitcoin. He had plenty of opportunities of doing it himself but instead got rich from others donating a bunch of bitcoin to him.
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:31:16
He doesn't understand economics though. This is the guy that always says it's a terrible idea to invest in bitcoin, regardless of price.
