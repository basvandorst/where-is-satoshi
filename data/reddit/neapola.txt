I have the same thought.  I feel like autumn will be good for Bitcoin, but I don't know what to expect through July.

Will do!  I bookmarked him.
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:55:51
I really hope it drops.
I believe in Bitcoin in the long term, in a big way, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.  That's saying a lot since I sure as hell am not rich, which is why I hope Bitcoin drops as much as possible before its next climb.
I want to buy more!

Watching this drop has me feeling conflicted.
I don't want the value of my bitcoin to go down...    
...but I like seeing the price drop so I can buy more.
I wonder where the bottom will be.  Below 9K?  Below 8K?

I'm not familiar.  Thanks for the link!


Absolutely.  Especially that last part.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:14:06
Yeah, I know.
It's not that he over explains.  It's that he spends 20 minutes to say 2 minutes worth of info because he starts to make a point, then stops and says it again, and then stops and says it again, often using almost the exact same words.  I'm not convinced he actually knows anything, because the points he makes are so generic.
In the end, I had to unfollow him.
And speaking of youtubers...  I liked Hyperwave.  Rest in peace, Mr. Jenks.

I think you're probably right.  The question is...  how long will this last and how low will it go?
I stopped dollar cost averaging when prices rose above 11K.  Instead, I saved the money I would have spent, and I'm watching &amp; waiting for the right spot to dump it in.

@_date: 2019-07-09 02:04:28
It's now above 12,700 and rising.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:26:59


Indeed!  When I saw it drop down into the 11,200s, I couldn't resist.  But if it drops even further, I'll be thrilled.
I feel like the next few months (or weeks?) may be the last chance to buy in.  I know people keep saying that institutional money is already pouring in, but what we're seeing so far is only a drop in the bucket - a really tiny drop in a really big bucket.  Once Bitcoin ETFs become common...  whooooo...  that's when the price will skyrocket beyond anything we've seen.  And if the stock market tanks, people could start moving that money over to other assets like Gold &amp; Bitcoin en masse, which could push the price up substantially.  Or, hell, if European banks start going under (eff that dirty Deutsche Bank), that could do it too.
So many things could push Bitcoin skyward, so drops like we're seeing today are a friggin' gift.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:01:35
It's dropped over 10% today, not 5%.  And I'm glad.  I want it to drop like a stone so I can buy!  But I love glancing at my portfolio value every time Bitcoin goes up!
Sigh.  I feel so conflicted...
Why can't it go in both directions at the same time?  /s
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:42:18
You're preaching to the choir, my friend.
I remember when Bitcoin was under $100.  I was helping a friend create a website and he wanted a way to accept tips, which led me to looking into things like Bitcoin and DogeCoin.  I didn't even know what Bitcoin was.  To me, Bitcoin and DogeCoin were just words.  I didn't get it.  I remember thinking "$100?  For a Bitcoin?  That's insane."  Long story short, my friend decided to bail on the project, and like an idiot, I stopped researching Bitcoin...  and that explains why I now think anything even close to $10,000 is a bargain.  For 10K back then, I could have had a hundred Bitcoin!  But I don't regret it, because you can't live your life in the past.
Honestly, I think anybody that owns even 1 Bitcoin is going to do very well if they sit on it for a decade.  Hell, maybe even just 5 years.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:23:12
It would be fascinating to see the stats on Bitcoin, in terms of how many people own how much, especially if we could then break it down by demographics.
I also wonder what percent of all Bitcoin has been lost.

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck Deutsche Bank.
They're so dirty, it makes me wonder if the soap dispensers in their restrooms pump mud.

Uhm...  if our country continues down this path toward white supremacy, we're likely to be on the wrong side of the next big one.  We're becoming Germany in the 1930s.  We're becoming what we fought against instead of what we fought for.
It breaks my heart to say that.

Did Hal Finney often use British slang?  I ask because at least one of the people who communicated as Satoshi Nakamoto did.
I wouldn't be surprised if Hal Finney was one of the people who used the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym, but I suspect multiple people did.  I don't believe there was a Satashi Nakomoto.

Read this quote, from [another post by the OP]( who reposted this meme:


If you're struggling with so much debt that thinking about it keeps you up at night and starts to make your heart race, yet you're posting memes about excitedly spending thousands on a volatile asset even though spending twenty bucks on groceries stresses you out...  maybe your priorities are out of whack.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:15:51
This is nuts.
What is going on in this sub lately?
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:29:10
If it was that simple...  it wouldn't end with a maybe, because maybe means you're still not sure.
I don't think there is a Satoshi Nakamoto.

That's the real point behind creating an origin story for a new 'thing,' regardless of whether that thing is a new product, a new company, a new technology, or whatever else.  It has the potential to become the stuff of legends - assuming the thing itself is a success.  It gives people something extra.  It gives them something to believe in, and let's be honest, most people seem to need something to believe in.
Think of it this way: If the writers of the Bitcoin white paper came forward on day one, it would have been too easy to write them off, or to discredit them regardless of the potential for their idea.  It would have been easy to judge them rather than their idea.  A pseudonym prevents that.
An origin story adds mystery and appeal.
If Bitcoin is still around a hundred years from now, people will still be talking about the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.  That's some fantastic marketing.
The creation of Bitcoin was a work of genius, and like most brilliant innovations, I believe it was the work of multiple people.  But the use of a pseudonym for a person who does not exist was genius too.

The Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  You don't want to be screwed over, even if you make a mistake, so you don't want to screw anybody else over, even if they made a mistake.  That doesn't make you soft.  It makes you decent.
It's sad that people feel like they need to explain why they did the right thing, or that they'd question why you did the right thing...  but that's how so many people are these days.  Evil seems to be on the rise.
Treat people the way you'd want them to treat you.  You can't go wrong.  If other people let you down, that's a reflection on them, not you.
I'm not criticizing your post at all, by the way.  I enjoyed it.  I like stories like this because they serves as a reminder that if Bitcoin is going to become more value (as we believe it will), it'll happen because the community makes it happen.  People buy in.  People share what they know, which encourages more people to buy in, which encourages more people to share what they know...  and the cycle continues.  And that's awesome.

Wanting to give to charity has nothing to do with capitalism.  If I had a billion dollars, I'd be putting people through school - tons of people.  And I'd be funding ways to clean the environment, ways to grow more food...  hell...  who knows what.  And I'd do most of it anonymously, because I'm the sort of guy who is more interested in the deeds than the credit.
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:18:59
You honestly believe one person created Bitcoin, but he doesn't want anyone to know who he is, and you honestly believe that person holds billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin but he isn't interested in being a billionaire?  He doesn't want to fund projects he believes in.  He doesn't want to give to worthy causes he believes in.  He's like a guy who wins Powerball but doesn't cash in the ticket, because who needs the money, eh?
A team of people created Bitcoin, not one person.  I don't believe the white paper was written by one person.  Have you read it?  You should.  I also don't believe that all of the communications that were supposedly from Satoshi Nakamoto were all written by the same person.  All you have to do is read them and you start noticing things that stand out as not all being different speaking styles.
P.S.  Spoiler alert:  Santa isn't real either.
