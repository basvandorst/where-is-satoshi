Millions of dollars in a few minutes? Look at the chart, that smelled fishy to me...

Aaaaaand it's gone...

Mind telling me how much of your monthly income you invested into BTC? Research purposes...

Thanks, but I was only interested in his share...

Sorry for that. Hope you didn't rely on that money.

So I have a few questions about the sudden increase in bitcoin price on Feb 2. (See 
I was watching the chart, media and social media closely that day. Before 1 pm there was a general feel of despair with a lot of people selling in panic or having lost great sums already by gambling. The price was going down constantly. People were hoping for a wall at 8000 but that wall didn't come at all. Panic was ensuing even more.
Then suddenly - boom. Within 10 Minutes the price skyrocketed. In the two ensuing hours around 150.000.000 dollars were pushed into the market (roughly 17.000-18.000 bitcoins).
What did happen there? Classic well coordinated pump and dump (or just pump?) But why did the price staid stable after that? Some really big whales performing a perfectly buy and sell operation. But what for? If you invest such huge amounts of money you don't care about the project bitcoin - you want to make more money somehow and that was a huge gamble at that point if they didn't knew something we don't... Any ideas or explanations?

Absolutely! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:08:22
Yeah - let me guess. They will go in full panic mode once again when Bitcoin goes &lt; 8500. Then full hype mode when it touches 9000 again,... ?

Quick advice: you should learn to say "Sorry that I have disappointed you" in Korean. Might come in handy...

This right here! What he describes is pathologic. People get help! Bitcoin gambling is no better than Online Poker or Roulette. 99 % get screwed, 1 % make Millions. If you think you are in the 1 % you probably are dilusional. If you keep losing your savings - seek professional help! Gambling is an addiction that seriously impacts people's social lives.

With the price per bitcoin approaching the value of mining a bitcoin (and even dipping it depending on where you mine) - what will happen? Bitcoin miners stop mining? What then?
