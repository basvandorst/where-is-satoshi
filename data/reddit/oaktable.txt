Explain what the position of a member of state legislature entails. Explain what your job would be. What is the workload like?

Have a road-building government (non-profit, whatever) separate from the war-machine owning government, and funded with voluntary contributions instead of taxes. They can publish budgets, say how much they need for what, rollover excess funds into next year, make recommendations on how much people should contribute to keep it running rather than people making uneducated guesses as to what would be fair, and have separate funds for special projects that don't fall in line with their regular mission/operations. It can be like Kickstarter where it isn't funded/you don't pay if they don't gain enough support, but they can run their own platform so that some other company isn't taking 4% off of everything they do.

That's why I don't vote anymore and instead bitch on reddit about which products to buy or not buy based on which companies are most closely aligned with what I feel are my and society's interests in general. &lt;/sarcasm&gt; (...Or is it?)

After bearing witness to goatse I stopped complaining about the FCC's ability to restrict nasty content on television. There are some things I just don't want to see. o_O
Still love [The Freaking FCC]( song, though.

Regarding the FCC/Net Neutrality, here's what I need from you:
Verify that this is the actual FCC filing, written by the FCC itself, which, if passed, would be the rules they end up following: 
If so, post a link to it on your website so that anyone can read those six documents for themselves.
At some point, have yourself/your staff read the documents and analyze them. Post your opinion on the proposed rules, both a Tl;Dr version and an in-depth analysis, on your website so that everyone can read your informed opinion on this. Or do a podcast. Or a video. Or all three. Whichever you're more comfortable with. Either way, break it down for us.
Second thing I'm going to need: [legally enforced ISP monopolies]( - true or false? If true, is there one in Austin?
One poster in that comment chain gave a list: "If you're in Massachusetts, they have a huge section of statewide franchise agreements right on their site. If you're in Mass, here's a list:  " Is there such a list for Texas?

"I geek" this and "I geek" that makes me cringe. I'm sure it's thrilling to have bitcoin mentioned, but these posters annoy the hell out of me.

 used to be the official forum for bitcoin, though the project and the forum are separate entities now. There's other forums that people go to to chat about bitcoin as well, but the ex-official one seems to be staying the most popular.
Wouldn't the guy just eventually notice that he never got a confirmation email and contact you on his own? Probably the best thing you could do is put a notice on the site itself saying that if someone doesn't receive their confirmation email to contact you in case of a mistyped email address or other error.

How do you know this person uses reddit? :|
@_date: 2012-11-29 07:24:00
Do you have a better word for it? Anyway, while knowledge of it's coming may not be new, the event itself is.

I have another question: How do you calculate a bitcoin address by hand? Let's say I come up with my own private key, how do I calculate the bitcoin address that goes with it? And what format does the private key need to be in (how long, what characters may be used, is that derived via an algorithm or can I just pick something)?
I need to generate a bitcoin address without using a computer. If it takes a few hours to do, that's fine. I just need to know what the formula is.

Try selling locally, where the customer has to physically hand you the cash before they receive the item, until you have enough money in the bank that you can take a hit like this without losing your business. If a single hit can take you down, don't put yourself in a position where you can take a hit.
Also, do everything you can to get your money or the machine back, up to and including getting a lawyer (probably want one who doesn't get paid unless you win), to represent you.

That's a debate I think should be had with them.
We come out telling them we want them disbanded, and then they try to justify their existence. And then we'll see who's right.
@_date: 2013-01-17 17:14:43
It's worth about as much as the gold in your WoW account. I don't see how it can be taxed. Just pass on the password/etc. and don't worry about it.
@_date: 2013-07-17 21:57:29
Perhaps. But I want them to argue the point. I want them to know that, due to how badly they've screwed up, their existence as an organization is threatened (funding cuts/program closure) and put them on the defensive, as that they should operate at all is not "a given".
Having this debate, with people calling for their disbandment, and them having to justify why they shouldn't be, will lead to the discovery as to whether they should or should not be around, and if so, in what capacity.
"You claim you do more than spy. Well, what programs do you have that are worth keeping, and why? Give us a good reason why we should even have you here."
The call for disbandment doesn't need to be completely serious, but they need to be challenged as though it could become such, if evidence reveals that we, as a people, are better off without than with them. And refusing to respond to the challenge would in itself be evidence against them.
So, whatever comes of it, I want that debate, and framed in the "justify your existence" sense, rather than us having to prove that they shouldn't exist. We pay for this. I have every right to demand to know if this is what I should, or want to, be paying for.

That's not really relevant to OP's situation.
@_date: 2013-06-08 04:40:46
Come on, just because the government is spying on everyone doesn't mean they don't also track the weather. And depending on the complexity/size of their simulations, they very well could need the power of a (or several) supercomputers for that.

If you'd invest in bitcoins you'd know the answer to that.

How will you deal with voice recognition software that keeps track of who's using the phone that way?
