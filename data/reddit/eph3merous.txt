Maybe it's cuz I'm still a teenager mentally (I'm 26), or it's bc I've been on the internet too long now, but my parents advice holds similar weight now to random people on the internet. My uncle got greedy after he did well in day trading, then got shafted by the dotcom bubble, so my dad is SUPER risk averse. My mom knows extremely little about the financial markets. 
Im venting here a bit cuz I like to update them on it, and they constantly reminds me to be careful and they don't really absorb anything I tell then about it in terms of it's utility or valuation.

it's moving in the right direction. There isn't a huge leap from "digits in my bank account representing my $ holdings" and "digits in my btc wallet representing my btc holdings". Right now the laymen are still hung up on "bUt HoW dO yOu BuY sTuFf WiTh SoMeThInG tHaT dOeSn'T eXiSt?"

But that isn't the end goal for those with faith in the technology. They want the currency to be used as a currency. In such a case, you would be required to spend a deflationary currency to survive, and it would enrich the economy to do so.
Also, if I had the choice of holding deflationary vs inflationary currency, u bet your ass I'm holding as much of the former as possible, and then converting to make any purchases I can't otherwise make.  In this scenario, it doesn't matter. I'm still reducing my stock of the former. 
This is the predicament that I am in now, bc I don't need to use a lot of cash regularly. Its easy to keep a majority of my money in btc and then transfer it to usd and spend it.

Many people were ready with 9k memes, some people were even ready with 10k memes. 
Nobody was ready with 11k memes

Nah it's widely used when talking about investment and markets. Bloomberg tv says it about 40 times per day. When something is over/under valued, the market tends to realize and respond.  Also related is the dead-cat bounce, which is kind of an overcorrection.

Oh fantastic! Brb, gonna rip some profits on attempted trades

Oh my God, i just thought of how bloomberg tv covers crypto sometimes, and the possibility of them showing Vegeta ROFL

Hey piggyback question: do I have to fully commit my coinbase account to gdax, or can I be half/half? I like that I have mobile control through coinbase, but I'd like to be able to do some day trades when I get a few hours at home.

Isn't it very very cold in space though? Intuitively, the complete lack of thermal energy would make heat transfer very very easy.

You lost me here. It seems like making a necessary purchase would be rational no matter how fast the currency appreciates... If you don't spend it you die.

By putting the 5$ into btc asap, they get around the insane inflation...? It's a game changer for them to be able to buy food tomorrow with their pay from today

This is literally what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation do. As you may have overlooked though, it costs a lot to find those answers.
