I've been asking myself this same question since I first started using it back in early 2013. Even in that short window of time a lot has happened. Coinbase and Circle are trying to put those nice clothes on bitcoin, but do the users want it? I personally enjoy my bitcoins being safer from government hands than fiat currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 05:21:10
Not as of recently...
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:23:21
Maybe try Coinbase's API or a third-party shopping cart plug-in? Coinbase also has iFrames (you won't leave the web site) which may be useful to you.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:28:21
Start using [Electrum]( and/or a [paper wallet]( If you're a mobile user you can set up a read-only wallet on [Mycelium]( Electrum and/or Mycelium can be your hot wallets while the paper wallet holds your bitcoin in cold storage. Good luck!

Here's my two satoshi's:
In my short time with bitcoin (since early 2013), I've spent countless hours learning and keeping up to date. Now that I have a noticeable amount of BTC, I keep them on a paper wallet. It's secure, offline and costs pennies to make. Being free is a benefit, just because I'm a cheap ass. Trezor has received good reviews from their customers, so my choice comes down to personal preference.

Coinbase has been lower for me when I've compared them side-by-side. Coinbase has their 1% fee plus there is a 15₵ bank fee. Circle does not have any fees, but I've been charged a fee for using a debit card (I believe that fee was not charged by Circle). Until I get a Visa card, I'll be using Circle. I'm sick of waiting a week for my coins at Coinbase :(
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:48:58
I hope you're wrong, for the sake of the bitcoin community. We don't need any more delays in purchasing/sending/trading bitcoin that a 'bank' would tack on.

What about MultiBit? I've used Electrum before but I switch 'em out every once in a while for security purposes.
@_date: 2014-11-09 06:34:50
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't BitPay offer instant confirmation of a transaction with their merchant services? I know you stated you do not use them, but it may be worth reading.

Tell me about it. Over here across the pond the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) will be "handing down" some regulations regarding bitcoin. I love my magic Internet anarchist money just the way it is :( They don't need to know where and how many bitcoins I have. I think it'll have a noticeable effect on the price and adoption.
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:52:03
This reminds me of Purse.io, especially when they mention Amazon Wishlists on their web site. What is the difference between the two?
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:58:34
I see what you're saying, however, as bitcoin reaches mainstream users, less of those mainstream users know how to 'read' code (i.e. I, personally, cannot read code). Mainstream users should follow in the steps of technical users until they are more learned in the topic.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:17:30
No, I haven't. I'll look into it tonight :)

I remember reading this a few days ago on their website. Much excite! My previous phone had NFC, but my current one does not. NFC bitcoin payments may not be common for a while as fiat NFC payments are the minority still. I'm still emailing local businesses to accept bitcoin and I'll add this to the emails ;)
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:46:35
The processing fee is the fee I mentioned at Circle. I'm still in the process of verifying my bank with them :) As you can see I'm still on the fence between the two. I do bike repairs on the side and may introduce Coinbase's merchant tools for payments.

I'm in the opposite situation. When I started out, I uses Electrum (and still do). Now I've downloaded Bitcoin Core to help process transactions and give back to the community. However, it's appearing that it will take 13,000 years to synchronize with the blockchain :/

A hearty thank you for being a good actor! I just sent an email to my favorite local grocer with information about bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:24:22
I was referring to Coinbase having account numbers and routing numbers, like banks, but for bitcoin. So you would receive your paycheck like you normally would but in your Coinbase account.

* Advertise on bitcoin-oriented web sites or in the [bitcoin magazine](
* Post here ;)
* Make sure to put a 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' image on your site, visible to potential customers.
* As one person already said here, offer a discount (5%).
* If you have a blog on your web site and/or social media, share the news about accepting bitcoin through those outlets.
Good luck, Renato!

When I was looking into the Free State Project about two years ago, I found a video interviewing some of the Free Staters. In the video they mentioned several land lords in their geographic area that accepted bitcoin for rent. For rent! A transaction like that would be realistic for me. I don't do a lot of shopping outside of the grocery store, so spending bitcoin on something *everyone* needs, not just alpaca socks, is exciting. Imagine visiting your local farmers market and paying for all of your produce and goods with bitcoin :)

My personal opinion is for established businesses to start accepting bitcoin, rather than new bitcoin businesses starting. Well-known businesses advertising bitcoin should help adoption.
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:43:13
When I email local businesses about bitcoin, I include the [bitcoin website]( and [BitPay]( I then go on to tell them about free bitcoin processing and the benefits of accepting bitcoin (including future business from me).
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:24:51
Up to $500 instant access to your deposit (including bank deposits) is really neat. They're more expensive than Coinbase by a few dollars but the instant really sways my business to them.
I'm trying to find a Visa credit card for someone without credit history (for Coinbase), which would sway me back to Coinbase since they offer *many* more services than Circle. Just my two satoshis.

@_date: 2014-12-02 00:52:03
That's pretty neat! Once I can have my direct deposit sent to my Coinbase account (in USD), I'll consider it. Until then, I'll wait for my state to be supported.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:17:48
However, Coinbase is already deep in the game. They have integrated tipping, wallets, buying/selling, ease of pay (Expedia, for example) and now the exchange. I don't know the difference than an exchange and what they offer now, but that's a different discussion. If they get in bed with Apple and/or Google to allow mobile payments (NFC), I'll probably cream my jeans. Whichever mobile payment system they integrate with (NFC) first will be when I switch.

Okay, I’ll bite. If I want to turn my bitcoin into dollars, is this possible on Bisq? Since it’s decentralized &amp; they don’t have my info, it doesn’t seem possible to “cash out”.

Yep, they came through about 30 minutes later. Sorry Gyft team!
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:43:33
Close, but bitcoin's first start out at the price of gold, then flow through his anus. This reflects it's current price at shit dollars and shit cents.

@_date: 2015-04-16 03:06:51
I agree with you about wealthier individuals investing in bitcoin. However, middle class individuals and families will not move up to upper class or retain middle class status by choosing a currency that's constantly losing value. They're where they are for a reason and it's not by taking risks like that.
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:12:45

@_date: 2015-04-16 03:16:40
And then next year their same bitcoin is worth 60% of the total price they paid. Then they have no extra money. This isn't speculation, this is bitcoin's real history since last year. Constant downward spiral.

No fucking kidding. I've become a fan, to obsessed and now to jaded. I've lost so much money to this crap. I'm not mad at you OP, just needed to vent. This will kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:52:08
What concerns me is being left “holding the bag” too long &amp; not being able to cash out some day. I’m learning how to use Bisq to preserve my crypto gains, but this will take a bit to understand &amp; feel comfortable since it’s not like a Coinbase or Gemini.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:36:32
I see. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:04:28
Curious if it goes from BTC to cash, that would be very useful.
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:43:17
Aren't they complying with finance regulations just like Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:02:12
That was my thought. It  may not be under similar regulations as an ATM because bitcoin, which may not require ID. However, the risk may be higher of being scammed.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:32:14
Interesting, I haven’t heard of Tether before. The idea seems interesting, however, would it make it easier for governments to track our money? It’s somewhat tough keeping bitcoin away from them.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:27:28
One year.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:03:35
You can check Bisq. One way around it is using Square Cash or PayPal to buy BTC from another user. It is very tech-savvy, not good for beginners or those who want to keep it easy.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:48:24
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:49:56
Some people may want to avoid it being tracked for tax purposes. People may use Square Cash because it looks like USD is being sent from a friend (the purpose of the servce) when it's being used as payment for BTC. You don't get taxed for sending USD via Square Cash.
@_date: 2015-03-04 02:16:42
Thank you for bringing some insight to this conversation. I use both bitcoin and Apple Pay on a somewhat regular basis.
My credit card issuer required me to verify my card to add it to my Passbook (where payment and loyalty cards are stored for Apple Pay). To verify via their app required my online banking credentials, including one 'Security Question'. I feel my cards are safer in Apple Pay than in my physical wallet.

@_date: 2015-03-28 12:28:20
I don't entirely agree with the author, but I doubt Bitcoin will ever go mainstream. Why would it? It's not easily traceable, fees are optional, and it cannot be taken away easily. Governments and big business do not like these benefits for obvious reasons. Also, it's still volatile. I've lost $100 in the past two weeks with no sign of going back up. Only once have I *not* lost money in bitcoin, which was during the 2013 bubble. Until we find a way to prevent bitcoin from losing value, this will be what keeps new adopters away despite all the good benefits it has to offer.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:44:33
Most banks hedge against that occurrence. Your identity would have to be targeted or posted to your Facebook wall for information that deep to be released.
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:47:24
You bet. The volume is low, so it will be a different experience than Coinbase or gemini.
@_date: 2015-03-09 02:29:31
Not the bitcoin protocol itself, but not being able to easily use this in real world situations. Upscale boutiques in San Francisco probably accept it but what about the rest of the country? I'd love to use bitcoin at a convenience store or to buy groceries, *real* world applications, not just the young techie that buys niche gifts. This keeps me from buying considerable amounts of bitcoin to spend.
