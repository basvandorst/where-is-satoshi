Creepy. At least yall get to be creeps together though, I guess.

Eh. Depends. No one knows really. What if the Chinese government holds massive amounts of Bitcoin and decides to sell it due to economic failure in other areas? That could drop the price quick.

If theres a 99% chance it goes to zero... Then that would be the expected return : zero. Which would not be positive.
Though I think the chances of Bitcoin crashing are FAR from 99%. Bitcoin sucks technology-wise but is far superior in public image and popularity. I think it's a 50/50 gamble.

Is there no potential for super powerful Gpu's in Quantum conputers that would leave Nvidias current lineup in the dust?

Didnt know that. Thank you

Well, a true quantum supercomputer would probably be able to mine hundreds of Bitcoin per day because it would be able to process the calculations at unthinkable speeds.. So theres that..

No one knows. Invest a couple hundred dollars and then carry on working on your future with the things that are within your control. If it's $1mil in 2 years, thats an easy $100-&gt;$10,000 .. If it hits $10mil in 10 years, thats $100-&gt;$100,000.. Can't really go wrong lol.

This is why flexibility is key^

Buy $10 worth on coinbase if you want practice. However, instead of trying to be a master day trader, you're probably better off just buying your preferred investment amount and then leaving it alone.

You're asking "is $800 invested in something an achievement?".. Its all subjective man.. If it explodes in price to $1million-$2million, you have $100,000.. If it crashes to nothing, you'll have $0. Its a gamble.

Are they calling out XRP?

So youre saying in 10-15 years when Quantum potentially reaches supercomputer level that there will be no way for it to be ported or set up towards rapidly figuring out the hash equations?? No way whatsoever?? Our current "normal" computers are the only ones that can ever run the equations for mining btc?
