Yes you are. And a predictable one. You've got 4 main auto-pilot reactions, and it's just noise. We all know you're just annoyed you don't have any bitcoin. (and dont say I GOT PLENTY U DUMB IDIOT FUCKIN KID), because no, you don't. Your blood boils at the thought of bitcoins continued success.. so you've taken it on yourself to find home here at this subreddit as the house troll. The day you kill yourself, this entire subreddit will join in unison "BITCOIN USER NOT AFFECTED"

He's our resident, furious little troll. Shouting at the top of his lungs, frothing at the mouth at the thought of bitcoin. Rumour has it Satoshi Nakamoto touched him inapropriately as a child and he's harbored this grudge his entire life. Now sitting from his mom's basement, he's become a keyboard cowboy, dedicating 18+ hours a day to find things about bitcoin to scream and snap at. He made a "confession" the other day, which was quite telling. Summed up all of his usual lines.

It's true fellas. We are one in the same. It's true. Forgive us. We don't hate bitcoin. We are just so irritated that we can't grasp the concept and it keeps getting bigger and bigger that the high of being the most hated troll on reddit was too hard to resist. Forgive us. Please forgive us. We will never shout or hurl obscenities towards this subreddit again. :(
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:07:20
Thats the spirit get these kids with 2 coins out of bitcoin fantasy land. Show them the light troll.
@_date: 2013-09-10 09:26:48
Me and my alter ego would like to take full responsibility for providing everyone on this subreddit with nonstop entertainment for months in the form of our incessant trolling. We are so, so very sorry. Bitcoin is everything we wished we could be. Smart, useful, pleasant, and well liked. 
If you only knew that Satoshi molested me as a child, you'd also have the same bizarre obsession-hatred with bitcoins! You would! Oh Troll Gods,condemn me not for outing myself.
BitcoinUserNotAffectedBitcoinUserNotAffectedBitcoinUserNotAffected. THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN POSTED 20 TIMES!!

Apologies, we are having an internal power struggle with the voices of the troll gods in our mind. THIS HAS BEEN POSTED ALREADY!!!!

Coming from the most reviled and insignificant troll in the history of bitcoin. Kudos to you to be able to still have a good laugh, despite your -800 karma. Judging by activity on your Facebook page, you don't seem to be very popular or well liked IRL either, trollmeister. 
Hey, can you troll on queue? Like if I say "ok, trolly, TROLL!" will you start shouting about bitcoin and foaming at the mouth about reposts, bitcoin fantasy land, and "fucking kids with 2 coins!" and "dumb idiots". ?
Pretty please.. cmon, just once..
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:26:34
He's never right about anything, he's a paid troll.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:02:04
Yes fellow troll, report it. That will help our mission in trying to stop Bitcoin because we're frothing at the mouth angry that we don't have even one. FUCKING KIDS WITH 2 COINS TRYING TO GET RICH! THIS HAS BEEN POSTED ALREADY! YOU DUMB IDIOT?! ahhhhhhh 
@_date: 2013-09-16 09:40:33
Guess what, thats all you ever contribute. Heres a thought, die, and stop trolling a subreddit that makes you froth at the mouth. We all hate you, and from what I found out, IRL you're also a loathed creature. An IRL troll. Ever watch Breaking Bad? might wanna smoke a ricin cigarette. I heard if you smoke one, Bitcoin fails. Try it, troll.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:21:31
Hey fellow troll how come you wont respond to my private message? I wouldn't ever really put your picture online for people to have a laugh at.. I promise, little troll. 
Question, has this ALREADY BEEN POSTED!?!? And is the OP a FUCKING KID WITH 2 COINS TRYING TO GET RICH IN BITCOIN FANTASY LAND!!!! 
He MUST BE A KID!!! A DUMB IDIOT KID! BITCOIN SUCKS!!! Are you going to REPORT IT!!!! because BITCOIN USER NOT AFFECTED!! 
Well, fellow troll?
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:51:28
You seem to be angry today and not your usual loveable self. What gives trollmeister? You're usually so happy about Bitcoin related news and very bullish on Bitcoin updates. I'm starting to get the feeling.. you... foam at the mouth with anger at Bitcoin? Silly troll..
