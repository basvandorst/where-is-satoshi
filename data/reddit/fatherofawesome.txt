Yah man. I've been locked out all day long. I would have loved to join the club and get my funds out asap but I've not been afforded that option. I can't even transfer between wallets due to this crap. Just trying to get answers man.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:19:50
Also, 95% of us don't have a Synapse Pay account. Only a BitGo wallet they forced us to create during registration on BFX. The users with locked accounts due to Synapse are in another boat as they received USD back prior to the haircut.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:11:40
Not sure why you are NOT complaining; unless you don't hold any BTC on Finex or hold another asset class there not receiving losses.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:11:20
I would be happy to give them a chance if they allowed me to access my funds or responded to my support requests. Nothing but 4 days of silence on the issue.
They are holding US verified customers funds hostage. They don't deserve any respect or trust until that has been rectified and all customers have gained access to what is left of their assets.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:08:54
I'm going to stay positive in hopes could clarify things for us here. I had a rather large amount of coin moved so until I hear more I am forced to sit idle and not going to help to be upset at this time. Hopefully he is able to clarify things soon.
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:46:05
Seriously? Awesome for you bud! Did you have the synapse or BitGo problem?
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:49:20
Sounds like that's the case based on the audio I've heard so far... My thread was the one he asked them to down vote. See my history for link. It has 20ish upvotes. Woke up to it having 2.
EDIT: Someone else in the group requested the down vote and not PGP.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:19:47
US verified customers still can't withdrawal or transfer post hack but they had time to get margin trading back up and running. Unforgivable...
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:18:48
Understood. I guess I really don't understand how they are supposedly in need of assistance from BitGo. The CSO stated they were handling these on a case by case basis. 
My BitGo wallet and nearly everyone else experiencing this issue; is empty or has $2-4 in it. Just deduct it from our balances and move on/allow us to access the tens/hundreds of thousands in assets they've locked up...over $4...
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:25:12
Yes they are responding which is great; but they have been not responding and ignoring every single one of our cases for 3-4 days now. Therefore, I have zero sympathy.
My company runs support for a fortune 50 company among other things and anything beyond 30 min response times for emails and 2 ring phone calls is unacceptable. We have less employees than BitFinex handling that specific account. We also have people manning support 24/7 achieving these statistics. 
There's absolutely no reason for BFX to take 3-4 (so far) days to respond to customers that have 10's-100's of thousands of USD and BTC frozen in their company following a hack and loss of $70 Million USD. Simple as that.
@_date: 2016-08-13 14:10:03
Still holding my funds. I was asked to upload my BitGo private key that I held when creating my BFX account and that was it. No response since.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:33:07
I really don't know. If you check the post in my history there's a bunch that have shown up there. All US/BitGo users. Wish I had answers...
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:10:46
I posted about this yesterday. Might find it in my history.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:34:30
One more question; you admit to stating they weren't compromised. Then why was their key signing a transaction to send my funds to a hacker? That sounds like being compromised to me?
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:12:28
BitGo blames BFX, BFX blames BitGo. Not a very fun game to be playing with their support teams.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:46:14
They have blocked my withdrawals and even sale of their BFX Token with the error/reasoning "Your BitGo wallet has been frozen and cannot be properly accounted for. Withdrawals are locked until this has been resolved. Please contact support." ... There's nothing in my BitGo wallet thanks to the hacker.
I opened up my BitGo wallet Audit Log and the only people have accessed it were BitFinex. BitFinex placed a 2 hr freeze on the account after it was raided. 
But... Here I sit not able to claim 5 figures because they screwed up some configuration with BitGo. 
BitGo even emailed me back through support and stated "We have confirmed with Bitfinex that they have overflagged accounts connected to BitGo to not allow withdrawals. We will work with them to get this sorted."
So Bitfinex is intentionally doing this... I just want what's left of my money at this point. Stop dicking me around.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:30:08
Same boat as you and every other US verified user. Have you heard back from support at all on this? They've gone silent for nearly 4 days now.
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:59:25
No worries man! Saw yours before you deleted. Thanks for coming back here to share with us. 
I actually performed these exact steps in hopes it would help two days ago but haven't heard back. Sent a new support ticket with the mentioned subject line in case that brings attention to it.
Here's to hoping we can escape this mess...
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:53:33
Nope. They haven't allowed any US verified customers to withdrawal their assets at all. They give the excuse that "SynapsePay" or "BitGo" is preventing them from performing appropriate accounting and to contact support. Support doesn't reply (4 days now) and the CSO is recorded publicly stating that they "don't want to deal with the issue as it is a headache".
...Not able to perform accounting on our balances yet they were able to accurately alter my balance and take a percentage of my assets and hand it out to others for withdrawal. 
Rather disgusting what they have done to their verified US customers while convincing everyone they've "honored their word and allowed their customers to access 65% of their funds".
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:50:32
I dropped my Coinbase account a while back due to frustrations with their services and support.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:30:25
@_date: 2016-08-11 00:13:54
I attempted to withdrawal the second they opened it up. I've had this error ever since. What are you even talking about?
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:24:43
- are you able to w/d now or same problem? I really need this fixed myself.
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:56:58
Thank you. You as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:53:47
Funny how more and more people have come here having the same issue yet the thread votes go down. BFX trolls on brigade still. *Publicly confirmed by their CSO*
This all boils down to one thing. BitGo and SynapsePay (another group of users having frozen accounts) are blocking Finex from accessing anything so they are holding our accounts hostage.
This is a minority of the userbase so they just simply don't care as long as the overall messages is "BFX refunded it's users". *Publicly confirmed by their CSO*
They think they can just skirt off with our assets and hope we don't sue. If I'm still locked out of my funds in the next 24 hours my lawyer will be contacting them for a full 100% of my assets. Not the 65%....
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:17:24
The shill is strong with this one. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:31:59
Sorry I don't mean to argue or want to get into semantics of being compromised versus at fault. But, based on your responses you've made it quite clear that the BitGo insurance policy it holds for all wallets is not available for this loss which means they are not "at fault" even though their key was signing the transactions that allowed the funds to leave "their wallets". 
Is your company planning to hold BitGo responsible for their lack of security (none at all in this case)? These people were entrusted with our funds by your company. We opened accounts with them per your registration process. I was provided the third key to my BitGo wallet. Therefore, the two companies responsible for the loss of my funds is BitFinex (Key 1) and BitGo (Key 2). I also had a withdrawals freeze on my BitGo wallet before the attack happened as well as 2FA/confirmation required to move funds from my BitGo wallets. Beyond that; I had withdrawals disabled, confirmation required to process, and low limits set for my BitFinex side of things. All of this was thrown out the window because Key1 and Key2 were stolen or abused. 
Therefore, how is it you plan to open your site for access and eventual withdrawals for people not compromised when I have not been made whole after a complete failure on the part of both BitFinex and BitGo? Why is BitGo insurance not covering my funds when they were as responsible for the loss as BitFinex?
Thank you for taking the time to respond to your customers @_date: 2016-08-13 03:15:52
They are still holding all US verified customer funds hostage. They cannot withdrawal or transfer funds between wallets. Errors state their accounts are frozen and to contact support. Support has not responded to the requests for 4 days now.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:49:30
Nice work..
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:46:38
There's a bunch of us having the same problem but their support is not responding or assisting with the issue.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:03:36
Well of course it's not definitive proof. I don't think we will ever have that. But the evidence we do have supports that conclusion. If they had gained access to the keys themselves from BitGo and BFX; there wouldn't of been an Audit Log entry.
Anyways, I get what you mean buddy. 
Edit: words
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:38:08
Their CSO Phil Potter asked WhalePool over team speak to specifically down vote brigade this thread and post/upvote threads about people successfully withdrawing. 
If anyone cares in the slightest about us desperately trying to get what's left of our funds back and not allowing their corp shills to get away with this theft. Please help and upvote this thread so it gets attention. 
We were at 20 and now showing 1. Thanks Phil. Great customer assistance bud...
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:29:28
Are you kidding me? Do you remember what exactly was said?
I'm still one of those stuck with a message saying "withdrawals temporarily disabled because your BitGo wallet is frozen" and have made a Reddit thread about it. According to the beginning of the chat he just doesn't care. Makes since why support has yet to respond going on 24 hours now...
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:17:02
I pointed out a few holes in their infrastructure within another thread (may have edited it out for security sake). All I did was a very basic examination of the IP ranges used by BFX and what services were being hosted. I found DRAC systems with default credentials still enabled as well as legacy PHP applications running with publicly disclosed exploits.
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:58:09
Redditor for 4 days. Relevant username. Keep doin your thing BFX shill.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:29:51
/I/zanetackett - Don't you mean their limits? They are only your limits if you control them; and if you control them it is easily deciphered why they weren't functional. Your systems were compromised. 
Either way you spin it; BitGo is also responsible. The funds were stolen from your sites customers out of BitGo held wallets. 
How is it you can publicly state (hours after the hack) they are not at fault if they signed transactions that caused loss of funds? That's the entire point of their business...
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:57:00
Congrats! It seems they've sorted the synapse people. Now for the remainder of us waiting on our BitGo frozen accounts... Keeping my fingers crossed...
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:09:15
I've got the same problem except they blame it on BitGo freezing my wallet (that has nothing in it). BitGo support got back to me immediately to inform me that BitFinex account for me has me flagged for no withdrawals and confirmed my BitGo account isn't frozen. BitFinex support hasn't responded in 4 hours.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:16:45
They have a key, I have a key. There's nothing in my BitGo wallet. They refuse to respond to support emails. It's a bunch of lies.
@_date: 2016-08-15 19:03:49
"dad" - haha. 
Same situation bud. No communication from support. Account still locked. No way forward being provided by their team.
- As you can see we have a lot of people in this situation. We could really use your assistance bud.
@_date: 2016-08-12 06:00:49
If you got this error how did you bypass it to actually submit a withdrawal? This is all that comes up when we click the withdrawal navigation button. We can't move funds between wallets or buy/sell either. (All same message).
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:10:05
No... They haven't. I'm still unable to withdrawal and so are hundreds of others. Their site gives the excuse "withdrawals disabled as your BitGo wallet is frozen". 
So pretty much every US verified user... 
I have 5 figures still aboard that sinking ship with support not responding for 48 hours now.. They just want everyone to believe they made users right before they close up shop.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:12:35
I can't get a dime out. See thread I posted. They are fucking US verified users while letting everyone else off the sinking ship.
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:45:52
Same here. Even offered them my BitGo key in my initial support email. 3 days and not a single response from them.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:46:41
Thanks for your update. I'm hoping we all get what's left of our funds but things look worse every day that passes. I've yet to receive a comment from support on this and Zane refuses to comment on it as well.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:28:44
Thanks for the explanation. Appreciated. So my key was a pointless attempt at transparency and everything was under a "hot wallet" style system controlled by BitFinex.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:40:51
See thread I posted and make sure to comment so we get an idea of how many users this is affecting please. They haven't responded to any of us.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:57:02
Great... I'm sure I won't get my assets before this drops to zero and they claim bankruptcy...
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:42:38
Maybe "leaked" was the wrong word here. But, nonetheless the CSO and whatever positions Giancarlo holds; have gone to this outlet to speak to individuals but refuse to do any sort of personal updates to their users publicly. I know users would like to hear more from their higher up directors.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:47:59
I dont think they have access to transfer between wallets or buy/sell just like us in the "Frozen BitGo" wallet user group; otherwise that would definitely be a smart idea.
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:03:28
Hi. I believe it is from your Slack member list. Same with OpenBazaar. So I don't believe your actual mailing lists or databases were compromised. 
I use specific email addresses for specific companies and the ones for BS and OB both got hit but were both on mailing lists + slack for each service.
Good on you and your team for reaching out about this. That's how things should be done. Don't see it much these days.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:58:04
Thanks for the kind words. I'm quite devastated right now but keeping my head up. 
It definitely sounds like they gained control of BitFinex and BitGo merely sat in the middle as a silent actor with no checks in place signing anything sent their way. What I'm confused about is this (4th?) key has mentioned that they keep in cold storage in case BitGo goes offline. What is the point of my key or them having a second one?
I had all my Bitcoin savings in cold storage for years. I transferred to BitFinex yesterday before bed to sell for current debts (kids are expensive). Never used BitFinex prior to this and have ALWAYS kept funds offline due to this happening so often. Who could of guessed the one time after five years of accumulation that my coins are on exchange; this happens again...
Anyway, I've been silently following your trades here for a while. Great respect for you. Keep at it. You seem to have a bright mind. You will go far in life.
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:35:07
Sorry to hear that man. If you don't have your key then I suspect they are going to give you one helluva hard time convincing BitGo to hand over theirs to BFX. 
Either way your money shouldn't be lost; just gonna take even longer unfortunately. Try sending the email they mention but write in that you do not have a user provided key available. Hopefully reaches the right people. 
Keep your head up; we are aboard this sinking ship together...
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:42:52
Exact reply I received. Just more run around. I'd really prefer to get my assets in queue for withdrawal before their company is forced into liquidation or shut down again... This is just beyond retarded at this point. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:52:05
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:44:21
Great! Instead of owning an asset with great potential to increase in value over the next 5-10 years; I've had those assets converted against my will into shares of an insolvent Bitcoin exchange...
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:33:50
Can confirm that I have a copy of my key from BitGo. Am verified. Just deposited for the first time 30 hours ago to BitFinex. All funds were moved. 
So either:
1) BitFinex Key Stolen (known)
2) BitGo key was stolen or somehow able to be abused remotely via the BitFinex API (thus invalidating the entire point of 2/3 multisig and everything was technically in thousands of Hot Wallets)
3) BitGo was leaking user provided keys.
Either way; BitGo has some fault here and don't see how the insurance policy does not cover this or at least users with this setup.
- Could you potentially fill in where I am wrong (if allowed at this juncture)?
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:52:24
Hi Flibbr,
I did join after the fact so I could try and catch PGP and ask about my situation. Again, I wasn't insinuating intentionally this was a 'private meeting' but that it came off as one due to the fact it was used as a media outlet where he personally spoke with ~40-50 people where only a few have the ability to ask questions. 
If this was to be used as a publicly open Q&amp;A it should of been announced, recorded and posted to their site for all of their customers to hear. I had to resort to listening to "leaked" audio of this session to hear anything about my specific situation of still not being able to access my funds as I can't get answers from support at all.
Thanks for sharing the link for others.
EDIT: **No Idea why Flibbr deleted these messages as well as the other fellow from the "club" above. Even more suspicious activity.**
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:24:10
Being composed is the only viable option for me at this juncture. Unfortunately, nothing I can do to alter the situation at hand no matter how emotional I become. Just trying to find a way to rebuild. 
We aren't going to be on he streets or anything but this was a severe hit to my emergency funds and savings for a real home (live in apartment) one day for my family. We were almost there...
Thanks again bud.
EDIT: While I would love for to take a closer look my direction I couldn't ask this of him with so many people affected and likely others in my same predicament. Everyone involved deserves the same fair shake to regain their funds.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:03:48
US verified user with their account still frozen and not able to withdrawal, buy/sell, or transfer between wallets. 
"Your account is restricted due to a frozen BitGo wallet."
No actual communication from support for close to 5 days. Doesn't seem like they are even attempting to work on our situation as they spent their time working to get margin trading going instead of ensuring their entire userbase was able to access their funds. 
BitGo support has been responding daily and informed us the accounts are not frozen on their end; just the BFX side. There is nothing in my BitGo wallet connected to BFX besides $4 after the hack.
Latest from BitGo was this message: 
(I did these exact steps days ago hoping it would help BFX verify the wallet).
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:13:53
No problem. I figured it would take longer honestly. I don't recall sending multiple mod mails?
EDIT: Oh. The comment about no response. I was merely stating I hadn't received a comment was all. I knew you'd get to it when you could but was simply explaining that I tried to post the above and awaiting a response. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:15:27
Well this makes a little more sense presented in that fashion but the entire being upset by the recording still leans towards "not wanting public to hear". To avoid dramatized headlines or snippets used to sound negative or nefarious they could have recorded it themselves and posted to the blog as a "public Q&amp;A session" and the public would have been much more satisfied hearing "publicly" from these individuals. At this point, to gather information on the situation; one has to know Reddit usernames, teamspeak groups, etc and then go searching through comments or listen to hours of audio. 
For example, I had no idea what was happening with the Frozen BitGo wallets. Even after asking support for a week. But in the first few minutes Phil touched on this as someone there had the same issue. I would never have found this information otherwise and support still hasn't responded with anything about it.
Again, not accusing or insinuating nefarious actions. Just could of been handled much better. Especially if the goal is to retain your user base and build confidence.
(Personal opinion from one of your users)
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:49:27
That's the thing, they did give me my BitGo key when signing up. It seemed like it should be impossible for both to be compromised.
Edit: Missed your other question. Claimed value is 5 figures.
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:46:14
Not this guy. Still 100% haircut as they claim I can't access my funds due to "BitGo wallet is frozen. contact support". 
Happy to see people escaping but I'd prefer to be on the life raft with them rather than the ship that's sinking...
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:17:26
We have tried. 48+ hours of no response and my 5 figures attached to their sinking ship.
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:02:18
I'm beginning to think it is likely that since you deposited prior to verification you were in a slightly different subset of underlying configuration compared to us that verified first. 
Did you have a personal BitGo key given to you or did BFX hold two of yours? I know they have two setups they used for this. One with user holding a key and one with BFX holding two of them.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:56:04
I was hit at OpenBazaar and BitSquare related emails that were registered for their slack channels. 
Someone below mentioned their 21.co slack email was also hit.
Seems they just compiled a list of Slack/Bitcoin related emails and used that. No databases were compromised it appears.
@_date: 2016-08-14 11:51:51

Extremely relevant and so is the username. Still shilling I see.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:01:03
If you take a look at the originating transaction to your BitGo address you can see a group of other's being setup at the same time. Some as large as 300 BTC in my case. All of those have been moved to similar non multi signature accounts. If the movement of coins out of BitGo means they were stolen; I'm seeing at minimum 3,000 BTC just from the group of transactions created around the same time as me.
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:44:51
I just got the same BS...
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:13:25
I cannot transfer between wallets or withdrawal because you claim my BitGo wallet is frozen and my funds cannot be accounted for. I need this resolved NOW so that I can get my funds off site. please help me here.
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:37:09
Yes I am aware. I joined recently to try and keep up to date on the situation as I still can't access my funds. Thanks for sharing the link for others though.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:44:05
Same blanket response we've all received unfortunately. It's been over hours since I received that message and haven't gotten anything else back.
Please keep us updated here if you hear anything more and we will do the same.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:16:22
Understood. Hoping to hear something on ours soon. Been 48 hours since I sent them my BitGo key. No response yet. Emailed asking for an update today.
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:40:25
**They have taken the email lists for OpenBazaar and BitSquare according to the emails I received. See information below.**
There has been a plethora of Reddit posts being submitted that are links to a 40% off Trezor with a site that is emulating that of the real Trezor website as well as Email campaigns from them as well hitting Bitcoin related email addresses. 
The emails and posts link to  which is not a Trezor affiliated website.
It appears they are hitting the subscribed emails to OpenBazaar and BitSquare as I use custom emails for each website from my personal email server (for exactly these reasons). These email addresses were only used for signup at these services. I'm not sure if these emails are public or not but they aren't found in any google search.

Sounds like only verified users with BitGo attached to their accounts were compromised then. Not sure if that makes the attack larger or smaller in respect.

Got me. I've been planning this for so long. I would of gotten away with it to if it wasn't for those darn 1 week Reddit accounts.

Oh Christ. You again? Did you read before posting AT ALL? Or are we just blindly shilling again?
Nobody with currently frozen funds has a damned SynapsePay account. BFX is claiming they can't release accounts or funds because of frozen BitGo wallets. Wallets they control and now have 3 of the 3 keys for. 
Every verified US user is in this category if you initially deposited in BTC. So it's not some insignificant problem. BFX hasn't responded to anybody for nearly a week and has everything they need to "unfreeze" the accounts. They refuse to do so and refuse to respond to anybody's support requests. Therefore, yes they are in fact holding the funds hostage...
Now kindly take the BFX cock from your mouth and go fuck yourself with it.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:40:07
Indeed sounds like it. Probably holding US verified user funds hostage for the inevitable litigation costs. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:13:43
A lot of people still can't get off the sinking ship. They've intentionally locked a ton of accounts. Most appear to be the US verified users. My account with 5 figures claims "withdrawals not permitted. BitGo wallet is frozen".
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:28:58
I haven't even gotten support to respond let alone provide them with any information to help with the situation. :/
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:43:37
Wish I had answers myself. Sick of being attached to this sinking ship. Just want what's left of my coins and be done with BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:50:48
Please answer this if you don't mind. I show a movement of funds early this morning. Were you guys moving funds to secure them or was this part of the hack?
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:24:32
I am in quite a different spot then yourself and am obviously quite angered with them as I still don't have access to my account or funds. 
However... I do respect and appreciate the fact you brought this to the community. Most of us can't get a response from their support and when there is one; it's simply "sorry, we will try and fix this at some point in the near or distant future." Very aggravating. 
So to see a more detailed and personal response is appreciated. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:36:31
They have a comments section on their website already. And 90% of what was talked about in the "leaked" audio was new information or more detailed information not found on their website. But I completely understand your point.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:17:21
Well now it only has 0.5% customer funds. The rest were taken by the hacker... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:04:03
I know of two others that have had their BitGo freezes removed. I would kick them another email asking what the hold up is. Good news is withdrawals are processing within a few minutes. They must have automated parts of their hot wallet again. And yea I dumped all BFX for roughly 36% of my haircut. Just want to get away completely at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:43:55
Still in the same boat and know of three others (you make 4). Nobody has received anything from support about this being resolved anytime soon. Please keep me updated if you do hear back.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:38:59
See thread I posted. They aren't helping any of us. No message from support for 48 hours now.

Welcome to the unfortunate club bud. None of us have been able to receive any answers. Been told to wait on support that isn't responding to any of our requests. Please keep us updated if you hear back at all. We are all doing the same for now...
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:42:40
Definitively understood your conclusive remark.
Lol. Sorry was on mobile and trying to hurry during a lunch break. The conclusion is pretty conclusive. I agree.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:53:14
You stated 90% of your funds were in USD. Can I ask if you held any BTC and if so which of the BFX wallets was it in when the site went down/hack happened?
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:47:10
Maybe... 
We are still trying to get an idea of how large of a userbase and which portions are affected. You are the first US Verified user with BitGo account that I've found with unfrozen account. You dodged a bullet we are still fighting unfortunately. I'm glad to hear you managed to get access.
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:22:11
Keep dreaming.
(This guy has outed himself time and again for being a BFX shill with obvious ties to the company.)
I will stop back in - in a decade - and we can see if you're still working for.... I mean... shilling a non-existent company.
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:54:25
They're pulling this with all the US Customers. Same bullshit here and support is "sending the information to "administrative support"" 4 hours ago and still no response. 
BitGo support immediately emailed back saying they contacted BitFinex and was able to confirm that BitFinex has placed incorrect locks and flags on the account. 
So ... What gives here - support is giving me the run around all day. BitGo immediately responded saying there are no frozen accounts and that they spoke with BFinex and discovered you have accounts flagged incorrectly. Care to help now or are the group of us having this problem just screwed while everyone else wthdrawals their funds?
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:20:59
Same. Can't move them to exchange due to same error. They will be worth less than a penny by the time I have access. Again, another loss thanks to BitFinex systems. 
They've got a limited time to fix this before I pursue legal routes since there appears to be no possible way of fixing this with them. I've kept a positive attitude and provided them the benefit of he doubt up until now. This is the final straw.
Funny part is; this "limit" wasn't on my account prior to then opening withdrawals. I was able to move assets between wallets today; minutes before they went "live" with trading and withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:32:19
Thanks for the suggestion. Will take it into consideration if support is able to unlock my account.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:09:28

@_date: 2016-08-15 17:04:38
I would also like to mention that in the conversation with Phil on teamspeak; he publicly announced how upset he was that someone was recording the conversation(s). I would think if he intended for users to hear what he had to say that this would be no issue. Just seems odd is all Zane. I'm not attempting to insinuate nefarious actions by anyone but the actions themselves are quite odd. I'm sure you can understand this perspective.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:47:52
Sure lemme see if it lets me alter it.
EDIT: Doesn't appear I can alter the title.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:23:17
Would be nice to do anything at all. :( Rather disturbing that they took the time to get margin trading up and running before ensuring all customers could access their funds.
Have you gotten any responses from support yet?
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:28:47
Makes since. They would have had a large client (if they looked at the balance I deposited 22 hrs before the hack) but they've lost me just from the support issues. The prioritizing of clients is ridiculous. They even allowed their "whales" access early to submit withdrawals and trades on BFX. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:22:36
Which I understand. I just want my coin off their bullshit exchange. Watching everyone hit the life rafts while your chained to a sinking ship with what represents a large portion of your crypto is not easy to swallow. If my coins aren't in my possession tonight and they haven't been sued; they will be soon.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:01:00
I was only provided a single document that was a PDF entitled "BitFinex BitGo Keycard.pdf". It contains a QR code and an XPRV private key.
I only retained the printed version of this document and they are claiming the image/scan of it I sent is invalid while also telling me in a previous reply that it IS valid. This is such a mess with their support team...
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:39:59
Mine are frozen with the claim "my BitGo wallet is frozen" which is 100% false. Support refuses to respond for 48+ hours now.
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:10:11
Nothing to do with any regulations in my opinion. BFX has admitted they can solve the issue but "it is a headache to do" (unlocking the accounts). It was brought up in the leaked audio of their CSO Phil Potter. This BitGo setup was created by BFX months before the CFTC investigation.
Edit: concerning your edited portion. These users are not being locked by banks or connected to the SynapsePay debacle. This is 100% BFX &amp; BitGo.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:14:54
I'm having the same problem transferring between wallets and attempting withdrawals. Please help.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:23:04
withdrawal received with 8 confirmations.
what is everyone doing with their bfx?
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:57:58
Good to know.
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:11:50
Sorry to hear that. Please post any updates from support here if you do get one. We are all still waiting ourselves...
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:18:45
That's unfortunate if so. Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:54:58
Understood but not many know of this place or how to access it. Even when you do access it - you are only a listener and cannot join in asking questions.
I wasn't attempting to make the assumption they went there to give "private" updates. But that there are better outlets that they could of used (such as their own site/blog, etc). That was the point  of my comment i suppose.
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:11:51
Thanks man. I've been terribly stressed out since this all began. I just want off this ride and what's left of my assets returned.
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:48:16
I have received a response from BitGo support that details how we are to unlock our accounts. See below instructions.
From: BitGo Support
Our apologies for not reaching out earlier, we did receive an update for you guys mid-day today.
You'll have to unfreeze your wallet and you can do so by providing them the key to unfreeze it.
Here are the instructions they provided us for doing so:
1. There was recovery key information / PDF provided to you upon wallet creation, have this ready.
2. Log into the Bitfinex website and navigate to the verification section. Click the "manage documents" button.
3. Upload the key file / PDF from step 1.
4. Contact Bitfinex to let them know you have completed this step and are ready for them to take further action. Title your email ”Unfreeze Request - Documents Uploaded”.
Note: iIf you have two or more wallets, it is possible that only one has been frozen. This can result in the BitGo balance being displayed as frozen and may not reflect all of the Bitcoin held in all of your wallets.
If you have any questions regarding multiple wallets, please contact Bitfinex.
BitGo Support
@_date: 2016-08-18 00:14:45
You bet. Keep up the excellent work.
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:49:24
I am under the exact same scenario. $4.50 in control @ BitGo. I have a key and BFX has a key so should be quite easily retrieved or they could simply deduct the amount from my balance (x100 for all I care at this point) and let me access the rest. 
At the bare minimum some information on it from support would be wonderful rather than silence.
- how were you able to acquire this information? It's the only bit of related communication we've received. Do you know of their plans to fix this?
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:51:49




I apologize but I'm severely confused and maybe it's just the wording and emotion involved but what you said in the comment prior to this one directly conflicts with this one. "didn't say they weren't compromised", "said they weren't compromised"
Again. Thank you for being open but please help me better understand the situation here from your perspective. Was BitGo signing the transactions and if so how are these losses not being covered by both BitFinex and them or their insurance policy they have in place for users like myself that held the third key to the wallet they maintained. My key was safe; BitFinex Key and BitGo Key signed away my money against the limitations and withdrawal freezes I had in place.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:06:12
I also posted to their blog and had it removed. Zane is silent on the issue even though he helped people resolve the 2FA and login problems. Claims nothing he can do. 
At this point I've come to the conclusion that we won't be seeing any of our funds and will need to pursue legal recourse. It's good we have a group of us in the same boat able to communicate for now. Let's be sure to stay in touch.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:39:35
Was your account locked when withdrawals were initially opened? Are you positive you are completely verified as in all verification steps show completed before you deposited any USD or BTC?
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:07:35
I could tell you the IP it originated from quite easily by looking at my BitGo Wallet audit logs. They did in fact hit the BitGo API directly from BFX server (same IP as "real" interactions). 
**Real BitGo interactions prior to attack**

**EDIT: When BFX "unfroze" my bitgo wallet and released my BFX account to me yesterday. There was no audit log entry as they simply signed the transaction with their key and my key. This proves they did in fact go through BFX/BITGO API via BFX Server.**
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:22:07
Have you gotten any response out of support?
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:15:15
Wow. They actually respond? Today is Day 11 of no access to my account/funds and nearly the same amount of time since they last responded to my support request(s).
While I am happy that 80% of the userbase received most of their funds and accounts back. The fact they are even open for trading and bringing in profits before each and every user has a chance to withdrawal or even access their funds is quite sickening. 
The hack was caused by ignorance and a lack of priorities. They have placed priorities in the wrong place before and AFTER this attack. Therefore, they've shown that they are not capable of preventing this type of situation again. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:27:44
I also get the same message tryign to move BFX to exchange wallet. I need my funds (whats left of them)...
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:51:48

**I tried submitting this to earlier but my post was immediately removed. No answer from mods on that..**
There has been a plethora of Reddit posts being submitted that are links to a 40% off Trezor with a site that is emulating that of the real Trezor website as well as Email campaigns from them as well hitting Bitcoin related email addresses. 
The emails and posts link to  which is not a Trezor affiliated website.
It appears they are hitting the subscribed emails to OpenBazaar and BitSquare as I use custom emails for each website from my personal email server (for exactly these reasons).

From what I'm told its all US Verified customers that were linked with BitGo (for BTC) or SynapsePay (for USD). BitGo and SynapsePay are not allowing BFX to raid their accounts therefore we are being locked out of ours. Unfortunately there is only $4 worth of BTC in my BitGo so I have 5 figures being held hostage at BFX over $4 worth of coin.
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:47:22
I didn't provide much more than what I stated above. Might find the comment in my history if I didn't edit it out. Left it high level so people couldn't abuse the information yet BFX could look into patching it up.
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:15:36
Tried keeping calm since the day the hack happened. But when their support hasn't responded once in three days it becomes worrisome. Especially while everyone else manages to withdrawal successfully. 
But thank you for the words of wisdom... It's appreciated.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:02:24
Thanks. Please keep us updated if it progresses any further.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:53:30
I'm a verified US customer getting the same BS but claiming it's BitGo's fault.
"Notice: Your account is currently restricted from withdrawing because your BitGo wallet is frozen and accurate accounting can not be determined for your balances.
Please contact support or open a support ticket if you have any questions or concerns."
I just want what's left of my funds so I can get the hell away from this mess.
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:25:02
Yah... I am just going to stay quiet until I have my funds and more information comes out but things haven't been necessarily straight forward. Let's see what the next few hours bring. If we still don't have access before I go to bed after this mess today I will be extremely upset. There's going to be a huge wave of BFX selling and I prefer not to catch the bottom of it.
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:32:28
I sincerely hope so but try and place yourself into my shoes. Witnessing everyone else able to access their funds and not being able to get a single word from their support team while their CSO publicly states that this scenario is handled on a case by case basis and is "a headache they just don't want to deal with". (Leaked team speak conversation of him).

@_date: 2016-08-15 22:18:50
Just received confirmation from support my key is fine (obviously since the funds moved out of BitGo.). Crossing my fingers I will gain access soon.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:24:31
Not trying to be an asshole myself so please don't take it that way. 
That's a completely reasonable standpoint to have but you've been given access to what's left of your funds. You are obviously going to be a little more optimistic and hopeful. 
We have not while watching everyone hit the life rafts as we are strapped to the sinking boat. All it takes is a single lawsuit to lock their funds and we are screwed for years. We simply want access that everyone else has been given so we can get something back before that inevitably happens.
I'm extremely glad you got access to part of your assets and everyone else that has. We just want the same thing and 4-5 days of radio silence from support doesn't help to build confidence. :/
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:57:57
Stop with the spam. This isn't the yellow pages. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:12:10
This. Not a single response from anyone but Zane, Support and leaked conversations where Phil Potter and Giancarlo went to reassure their "whale" buddies.
They should also probably fix that wide open DRAC system and highly exploitive PHP based ticketing system osTicket over at another sub domain of theirs. Because if it wasn't an inside job then it's plainly obvious how they got in...

@_date: 2016-08-13 03:34:33
Handled what? They still have every US verified user locked out of their funds. This idea that BFX has let everyone access what's left of their accounts is getting out of hand. They need to be held accountable until everyone has been given a chance to get off the sinking ship.

It is misinformation because he stated that speaking with support will alter the limits. It does not.
My apologies for not being the genius you are and dumping everything I have into BTC along with convincing your friends to do the same. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:57:45
Wow... Okay let's try this again...
They don't review... They respond with the same templated statement. There is no review process.
Now that we got that out of the way...
This will be my last response to you. As your history clearly shows; you are of superior intellect. The first page alone depicts a man that spends his time smoking heroin (and bragging about it on the Internet?) while binging all day on manga and tossing all your liquid funds into BTC hoping to get rich quick. I have met my match it seems... 
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:16:35
I would disagree. I have purchased nearly $2,000 USD worth of BTC via my CoinBase account (over more than a year); and have emailed/support ticket 5x now. Each time I have been given a templated blanket response telling me to just buy more to raise my limits....
So no, your statement is inaccurate and you shouldn't spread misinformation. 
Maybe I would purchase more if my instant limit wasn't a measly $200/week... I have since started using another service willing to accept my business...
@_date: 2016-01-22 03:25:37
Come down to Peoria, please?

I would be ecstatic if all exchanges implemented a standardized Proof Of Reserve. Something that anybody can look at; anytime. 
Not sure what the point of not doing it is beyond there being discrepancies or activities a company not wanting public. It's free publicity for doing it and additional trust in your platform for basically zero work. Win for everyone.

Could someone with more understanding of these laws explain what potential changes to BitFinex may result from this?
@_date: 2016-02-02 03:27:46
Well that's awfully kind of you. I mean you just registered your domain only 2 days ago! You have to be making some ridiculous profit margins; to be able to offer 20% above market AND 24kt gold coins for people kind enough to send you their BTC. I would guess somewhere around 100% gross profit ... Am I close? 
Get lost...
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:46:36
No, but they weren't exactly given any other options. They were forced to take them in exchange for their much more valuable BTC and Fiat due to the failings of the company; not the user base. The users lost funds while the company profited. 
Are we going to pretend BFX didn't buy up all the BFX for $0.30 on the $1.00 during the first week? Because.. they pinky swore they wouldn't? Good on them for paying themselves out by claiming the tokens... The same week the stolen coins started moving around?
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:09:35

They absolutely are. There's audio recordings of them in group chats (WhalePool) using bots to upvote and asking others to do the same and leave positive comments. Likely the reason this thread and the positive comments even exist. 
Fuck BFX and the bullshit they pulled on so many people.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:05:57
I would venture a guess that most anyone with common sense sold all BFX the moment it and withdrawals were made available. At that time BFX was 30 cents on the dollar. 
Most lost between 5-35%. People speculating on BFX, the owners, and all the insider information they consistently leaked to their "buddies" (e.g. Whale pool) gained those profits.
Meanwhile the stolen coins have begun to move...

You can't double his reward and keep the cost of electricity the same. That's not how any of this works. 
After the halving he will have paid for two more miners and double his monthly net loss on mining. It saves him money to not plug them in whether he has 1, 2 or 4.

2,500 BTC moved through it thus far with 1,100 currently sitting in it. 
When you make a deposit it will jump through your unique deposit address and end up here. Seems like they are getting some pretty decent traffic so far for a single poker/sports site.
Some rather large deposits and withdrawals mixed about. Also something else neat; one could make estimates about their profit/loss to a small degree just by parsing this address over time.
