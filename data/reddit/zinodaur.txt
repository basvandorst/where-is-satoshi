Jeez. Has it stopped ? Any signs of going up these days ? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:29:32
I'm obviously in the minority here, but the blue makes it look like a huge ad or a pamphlet you'd hand at the mall instead of an actual paper...
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:27:39
The text on the designs can be changed, no biggie. I just used Bitcents for the sake of convenience I guess.
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:52:48
Nah. Looks like he's just an idiotic troll.
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:44:10
What the fuck is going on with the price...
@_date: 2013-06-26 08:28:49
Haha, why would he tell you ? It'd be like "hey, yeah, here. take all of my clients :D". Sheesh.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:51:30
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:17:52
Is that still available ? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:49:10
That don't look so good.
@_date: 2013-05-18 09:44:11
Where can I buy shares ? You're saying it's about 2 BTC each, but on Havelock Investments it 0.2 BTC ? I'm confused.
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:08:23
I was reffering strictly to those things you paid directly via BTC, not with an intermediary. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:01:15
Did you ever find that shirt again ? :(
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:21:42
I didn't try anything. It's a 2 minute doodle. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:08:31
Link ?
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:36:20
Ugh, god damn some people can be assholes. THANKS, OBAMA !
I guess there's no way one could prove he's not a scamer and use paypal, eh ? Sigh. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:24:27
Photobucket ? Really ? 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:01:05
Weren't Colored Coins seen as a bad thing to the community, making some coins useless or bad or something like that ? Why the hell would we use this if that's the case ? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:55:04
PMd !
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:37:11
Hey thanks ! But I don't see any USD/BTC exchange option, and the Bitinstant link is messed up. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:13:25
I've received a few PMs, so I'll post here as well: 
if you are interested in me doing any comissioned art for you, LET ME KNOW ! I am a graphic designer and I will gladly talk about new projects. 
My portfolio is:  :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:29:42
Only if you want him to. *magic internet wink*
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:57:50
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:39:23
Hey, thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:09:08
What about warranty ? How does that work.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:48:20
Silly things in general. Stupid faces that only amuse stupid people ( me ).
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:46:25
Thanks, yo ! 
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:31:48
The default one (?): bitcoin-qt. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:41:19
No one ? :(
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:18:29
What would it get frozen for ? I don't think it'd be necessary to be specified it's for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:44:45
There's no other address. :\
@_date: 2013-03-31 10:10:58
Whoa. Bitcoins at 60 bucks in 2011 ? 
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:41:44
Site's down. Guess all those orders rushing it got to it, eh ? :p
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:53:45
Neat ! Thank you. Now I gotta wait for the manual verification and I'm good. 
Is BTC withdrawal usually instant ?
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:35:48
Ah, it's not that, really. The problem consists in the fact that I need to cash out like 2700$ by the middle of september, and now I'm going to lose all of my BTC. Fucking hell...
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:07:50
Ah, it was the number of searches. My bad.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:14:18
Hey. Anything yet ?
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:35:33
I'm glad an exchange has opened in my country, but BTC-E rates kinda suck. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:57:00
Welp, I think I've made up my mind. I will be investing the 1000$ in bitcoins. But not right now. I'm waiting for the value to drop a lil' bit, cause I see it's gone bonkers in just a couple of days ( holy wowza talk about missed oportunities ). 
I am debt free, the 1000 bucks were won by me, not given by anyone, I do NOT have any amazing financial status ( on the contrary ), but you know. I'm young. I gotta risk it sometimes, eh ?
Thanks for all the advice and everything, guys ! 
Cheers ! 
ah, by the way: best site to buy Bitcoins via PayPal / Credit Card ? 
@_date: 2013-06-29 18:02:19
Aaaaaaaaand I lost it all. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:14:32
Doesn't work for my country.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:52:45
It's free game for everyone, including exchanges. If they don't like it, they can trade OTC, or change to some other site.
HFT is what is causing the downfalls, because of the automated bots doing this. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:20:14
We should contact the page creator and tell him to set that sound for transactions running over 1 million $. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:24:08
Uh... ? I don't get it. Do people go around and tell paypal what they bought and under what accounts so often that it became a problem ? 
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:05:53
Check the names of your categories and products. Some of them are in german. 
Also, check PM. :p
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:09:15
Speaking of graphics, some dude also hired me to do some illustrations for his business, paying me with BTC.
So I guess I'm speaking in his name here. :p
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:15:56
Idiots in my area charge 90$ when it's at 70$...
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:02:43
Hah. I could only imagine it'd be like finding 2000 bucks in some old pants. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:22:21
Neat ! Thanks ! :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:20:01
Haha, fair enough !
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:25:13
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:26:57
Could you please let me know when you get your BTC ? 
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:00:08
So you had to email them ?
I haven't received anything yet. :(
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:30:36
Ah, no need. I received my BTC a few hours ago. :)
