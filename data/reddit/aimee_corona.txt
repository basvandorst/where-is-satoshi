This will be the next season of Ozark, his son mentioned it as an idea this last season that was just released. But yes, and thank you for giving me that idea! Best make multiple wallets and hide them in different safes everywhere you know is secure; your parents place, families places, your own safe. That way if any is ever found you still have backups all over the place to collect, like s spy with hidden cash of multiple countries hidden in various places. Holy shit, I wonder if spies use bitcoin as their travel currency? Cause they could just take one wallet when they need, and withdraw in any country at any BTC atm. Only currency where you can withdraw it converted without having to visit a conversion market that takes ridiculous fees.

Same, I literally put every check into it now. I pay off all my cards and whatever is left over goes into my choice crypto. Currently etc until I feel it's time to choose another coin to hedge my bets.

That's what they wanted it to be. In reality it's the smartest being in the universe making a move to be a billionaire in a couple of years. Domt fuck with the squirrels man, you fuck with them, then you gotta hop universes just to survive.

Would this take effect in the US too? Or is this going to be like the 711 thing, where only 711's outside the us accept crypto?
