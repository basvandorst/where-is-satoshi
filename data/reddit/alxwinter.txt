Hi Patrick, no questions, just wanted to say you're doing a great job reporting the trial. You've been uncommonly fair, balanced and thorough. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:14:23
I think it's a really amazing time. We're definitely covering those!
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:59:58
you can adjust the number on the BTC page to whatever amount of BTC you want :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:20:28
we are exploring that now. with Downloaded I was able to free stream the movie on AOL, but we were owned by VH1 so it was not possible with our financing to offer the movie without copyright worldwide, as I didn't own it. We will have to see how we progress with this one. I am a huge supporter of new models, and Creative Commons. But it's a messy world right now, as my docs are exploring, and so it's sometimes easier said then done to make it work. which is very frustrating for filmmakers and the fans.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:50:00
Yes the film is an expansive examination, not a one-sided white (or black) wash :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:29:58
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:09:00
too late :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:37:17
haha, no i'd be doing this Reddit from my island :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:33:42
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:56:15
Theaters and all digital platforms, like Downloaded. it may be a "Never to DVD" production :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:24:30
done, thanks!

yes i agree. it's a macro story, not a micro one. the best way to give context here, i believe, is to give a thorough overview
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:18:07
Let me elaborate. These are all valid points. I have been making them in the press and will definitely draw these parallels in the film. The fact is that standard currency is far more anonymous and untrackable in the use of illicit markets than Bitcoin, which because of the blockchain, is fixed and transparent. People trade for all sorts of reasons, legal and illegal, with all manner of systems of exchange. To specifically demonize Bitcoin because some people use it to buy drugs is absurd. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:18:41
We have to wait until our Kickstarter is complete, then we are examining a page for BTC with similar rewards. would that be of interest?
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:32:25
haha. perfect! or buy the movie from our Kickstarter:
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:14:13
Yes the Deep Web contains a lot of uninteresting tech-related content, which is often overlooked in the media. But as I'm sure you know, it is being used to contain an expansive community using encryption to commune in private on the web.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:55:25
thanks! meantime join our kickstarter and be part of the process!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:43:18
litecoin, but there are a lot of them that are valid and real.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:28:00
Thanks! I can't give a list of subjects due to the nature of our shoot. But always open to tips if you want to pm me or use my gpg
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:28:21
Cool! PM me your info :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:43:24
do it!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:04:41
appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:34:04
cool, thanks, we are looking at doing that!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:44:50
yes it's a double edged sword for sure
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:24:46
Oh definitely. This is NOT a Silk Road movie. This is a Deep Web movie and examines the rise of Bitcoin and crypto-currency and the global implications of this vast web-based community and these new crypto-technologies.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:03:35
Hey there :)
1: yes we are examining all the significant crypto-currencies
2: Of course you can support us with BTC! 
3: If there is a Matrix 4 the world has much bigger problems than if I am in it :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:29:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:09:22
Hah. Have a great paper that is all about this :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:40:53
Yes it's early days for crypto-currency in the open market, despite having been around for almost five years now. But the more it's used openly, the more it's exchanged and the more outlets accept it, the faster it will iron out the wrinkles. That's the great thing about open source technologies :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:35:05
Hah. Good example, but that is not hoarding, that is a transactional use of BTC, which is exactly what i'm talking about. Using crypto-currency as currency and not just for investment is what will keep it alive :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:55:55
We do :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:53:34
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:58:08
yes i do.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:08:45
hey there. I am following these guys and what they're doing with BTC. If it fits where we're going, I'll reach out to them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:31:05
I will definitely be outlining the evolution and implications of black markets. re The Deep Web; the Dark Web is a small subset of the Deep Web. This is not just a movie about the Dark Web but about how the Web functions, and how cryptographers were able to make use of the Deep Web. Hence the title. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:08:08
Exactly, but with an opinion. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:13:32
I do! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:19:40
hard to say. it's being used for more and more legitimate/mainstream uses every day.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:54:53
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:16:11
it's not at all. it's a very balanced and mostly positive examination of Bitcoin and the rise of cryptography on the web
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:32:14
hah thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:57:36
yes and yes. you can already pay into the movie with BTC, and just stipulate there you would like to allocate those funds for a copy of the movie, as long as it equals $30:
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:27:25
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:06:53
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:44:44
my movie is a documentary :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:43:21
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:09:55
Thanks! Not unlike my treatment of Napster, another highly disruptive peer-to-peer tech, I want to debunk the myths around crypto-currency and cryptography in general. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:34:18
Well not to spoil the ending :)
I have a thesis, but the facts of the story are still very much unfolding. My own POV on BTC tho, is that people are making the same mistake with crypto-currency that they made with Napster back in 99. At best it's dismissed as a fad, at worst it's criminalized. I think both of these approaches are wrong. Some form of crypto-currency is here to stay, and a lot of folks are underestimating how disruptive it will be.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:36:04
Thanks! Not sure I've seen a Vice doc. Can you recommend one?
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:16:20
yes we will have a reward system for BTC, after our Kickstarter ends in a week. I will post.
thanks for the interest!
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:18:49
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:35:20
Thanks Dave! Sure PM me your info :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:46:37
very easily. check this out for all info you need :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:51:09
it will not be censored. nor will it be raw, it will be thorough and balanced. i feel strongly that it's vital to debunk myths around the digital revolution and avoid hyperbole. these things are hurting, not helping.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:46:57
We're making a thorough examination of the prevalent culture on the Deep Web, from one end to the other and including the black markets. that culture definitely includes a substantial amount of the worldview you mention
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:18:38
really appreciate it! and i still say beeth-oven, just because :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:13:12
Hi there! I first became interested in Bitcoin on '09, as i was putting the Napster movie together. And then as I was researching this rise of cryptography within the web, the black markets hit my radar.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:47:45
i do. but whether it's allowed to continue without a central authority is another question entirely.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:39:24
check your pm :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:25:37
My point is that in order for Bitcoin, or any crypto-currency to become stable and flourish in the marketplace is if it is used, transacted, and not just hoarded by speculators.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:49:09
That is the media's spin, not mine. The Deep Web is not a negative thing, and the film is very clear about that. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:40:04
completely. i'd say one of the primary aims, other than to tell an important and compelling story, is to debunk a lot of the misconceptions about this world
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:20:39
good points all!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:44:29
:) it's hugely appreciated and goes right into the movie's fund!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:43:16
I totally get that. But as we are currently an indie movie in production I don't yet know what, or even if, there will be a dvd release alongside theatrical and digital. So I can't offer it unfortunately
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:15:23
Agree totally!
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:57:37
Great stuff and agree!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:45:20
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:16:43
Well, like the Napster movie, we are explaining how this technology works without driving people batty :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:08:17
Also, many of you have asked if we are accepting donations for the movie directly to BTC. We are indeed here:
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:53:56
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:12:29
That's great! We are absolutely looking at where this is all going. And feel free to message me if you want to take part!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:15:52
use this
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:20:59
I was an early adopter in terms of interest, and a late adopter in terms of purchase :)
So no, i did not get rich off BTC investment. And while it's not stoppable, I worry about the hoarding/speculating around BTC. If anything kills it, it will be that.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:23:10
very cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:15:36
This is a very interesting question, and one i'm responding to within the context of the movie. not to be evasive, but i don't want to express all those views in print before i express them in the film. hope that's cool! :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:53:28
That's cool they liked the movie! I think we can change his mind about Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:11:19
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:14:01
Hah! Not at all. He and I got up to all kinds of mischief :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:44:08
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:36:11
It's similar in that I hope to give context and clarity to a world that is very confusing for people, and largely misrepresented in the media. But it's different because this is a story that is happening right now, and Napster was an historical perspective.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:47:28
Good idea. Let me work on that
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:42:54
are you Jason King? If so, or affiliated, can you PM me?
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:45:00
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:14:44
We will hit our goal!! :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:18:26
there is no link in our title that presumes these areas are tied together. the point of the title is to express the arena our film explores; the deep web, bitcoin and silk road. meaning, the vast expanse of the deep web, its origins and evolution; the explosion of crypto currency, which inarguably changed the game; and the rise of black markets on the deep web, like silk road.
