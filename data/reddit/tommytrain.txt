current public permissionless Blockchain (capital “B”) in the
Bitcoin system as the backdrop for our discussions regarding
ChainAnchor, **even though ChainAnchor is aimed at permissioned
(private) blockchain**. This is because the current
Blockchain is the only operational blockchain system that has
achieved the scale of several thousand nodes in a true peerto-peer
(P2P) network topology. The Bitcoin system and its
Blockchain has received much attention, and therefore well
understood compared to other proposed blockchain systems.

If the project is tied to Ripple at all you may not get a response, he has published incomplete half-truths with dubious conclusions about their protocol before. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 04:22:06
Step 1: Ignore direct evidence
Step 2: Divert attention to and misinterpret a generic example of architecture as specific political intent (you might be coming down with PeterTodditis, get that checked)
Step 3: Present hypothetical rationale which doesn't at all solve the use case in the same manner presented: delivering anonymity *between* competitive participants on the same private blockchain while maintaining regulatory oversight. There is no inherent inter-participant anonymity on a private blockchain unless it is instant and permissions only the participants involved in a single transaction (see R3 Corda, also ILP). Also, thinking outside the tiny little bitcoin box, the overlay could possibly be used for multiple instances on the same blockchain, allowing for selective participation in different regulatory shards, or none at all (risky as that is).
Step 4: Demonstrate poor understanding of PoW. PoW mining is, itself, a codified system of bribery intended to disperse authority but in practice leads to miner optimization, cartelization and a massive waste of energy overproviding security because it relies solely on direct bribery instead of properly aligning validator motivations with network performance. What's a little more bribery to add important features which proper money needs?
Step 5: Ad hominem, but astute. I [wrote about semi-permissioned ledgers]( 7 months ago. 
I have a feeling the retained ability for permissionless participants on Ripple didn't sit entirely well with their partners and ILP was intended to be their plan B if just using the user-issued tokens wasn't powerful/flexible enough for banks and integration partners (they still aren't really touching XRP). They recently tacked back publicly to XRP and some of us in the observer community weren't entirely clear why or how that strategy choice was made instead of just following their current profit model: consultation and integration services. 
If ChainAnchor or GlobalID is part of their plan there is some sense to the move: they can now lock down their ledger even more so than it is AND provide flexible regulatory shards - meaning legitimacy from domestic governments, privacy from competition as well as foreign governments with interoperability between shards provided by FSB/MTS Market Makers holding their liquidity in XRP, the most frictionless asset on Ripple. This squares with their pending announcement to develop an XRP token incentive program for Market Makers and Exchanges instead of validators. 
tl:dr there are going to be a lot of different ledgers talking to each other in the near future, will yours be part of the conversation?

You may want to re-evaluate Ripple's level of centralization based on the progress Ripple Labs has made in refining RTXP protocol and expanding its validating network in the last six months. 
With over 70 validating nodes operating it no longer has centralized 'control' of the ledger but still dominates the UNL trust validation process for nodes (nodes are kind of like miners except they don't get direct reimbursement for running hashes, they do however get votes on which nodes to trust and votes for setting account/trustline/offer reserve values, which could eventually become a form of monetary controls for XRP valuation should it reach a critical mass of adoption. This is interesting because it will be a decentralized, democratic method of currency control) This aspect of the design of the protocol and consensus network means Ripple will start completely centralized (as has been noted often) and through gradual adoption by gateways (banks, exchanges, merchants, governments, individuals) will become increasingly more decentralized (opposite of Bitcoin mining network)
An interesting and controversial new feature (Probably not popular on this sub) was released today: they introduced optional 'Freezing' for gateway IOUs, a step they chose to add to enable gateways to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Fidor bank in Germany has started its trials with cross border wire transfers last month and rumors about a large US bank in talks with Ripple have sprouted on the forums. They have formally joined NACHA, the organization which controls ACH network and are presenting at SIBOS (in Boston in a few weeks) the main conference for the SWIFT network. 
As a payments network it has notable efficiency improvements of the public ledger (blockchain) and directly addresses within the protocol some of the centralized choke points of Bitcoin. As a currency and instrument of financial "disruption" it truly does not hold the same values of the bitcoin community through its implementation and adoption strategy, although it has now (finally) fully released as open source all of the node and client code.
Degree of centralization of both networks is relative and currently rather fluid. As a currency, there is not much competition with Bitcoin's decentralization. But keep in mind the U.S. Federal government is currently the second largest individual holder of bitcoin through its confiscation of SR assets.

The replacement of mining with consensus is both it's strength and weakness when compared to bitcoin. Consensus is faster, more efficient and more scalable than bitcoin proof of work mining but it requires multiple diverse parties to be invested in the health of the network and committed to running a consistent and robust network with trustable validator nodes in order to maintain security aspect of a decentralized network. In this way, ripple seeks to make its network a global utility, with the potential to become fully decentralized by attracting enough gateways to provide liquidity and hence the vested interest to support the security of the network by running a validator node.

Ripple labs is not an exchange, it is a software company which created and maintains Ripple which is a protocol, it mainly works by using an algorithm to find an exchange path on the network to connect sender and receiver with most efficient exchange rate. The path can be between any number of gateways, market makers, banks, and other entities on the network which have established trust between each other and basically grade each other's risk levels with the value of those trust lines. The path finding renews at the close of every ledger, which is about every 5 seconds.
Gateways on ripple typically require money transmitter licenses in the countries where they accept fiat. Examples include Snapswap, Bitstamp, BTC38 and RippleLatAm. So there are potentially multiple intermediaries when you send currency on ripple, or maybe just one if both parties happen to trust the same gateway and it has the best rate. 
Hope that helps a little.

Such an approach is essentially a hybrid between the pure and perhaps harsh trust-no-one logic of Bitcoin and the total dependency on socially-driven consensus found in networks like Ripple. In Ripple’s case, users joining the system need to select a set of nodes that they trust (or, more precisely, trust not to collude) and rely on those nodes during every step of the consensus process. In the case of Bitcoin, the theory is that no such trust is required and the protocol is completely self-contained; the system works just as well between a thousand isolated cavemen with laptops on a thousand islands as it does in a strongly connected society (in fact, it might work better with island cavemen, since without trust collusion is more difficult). In our hybrid scheme, users need only look to the society outside of the protocol exactly once – when they first download a client and find a checkpoint – and can enjoy Bitcoin-like trust properties starting from that point.
In order to determine which trust assumption is the better one to take, we ultimately need to ask a somewhat philosophical question: do we want our consensus protocols to exist as absolute cryptoeconomic constructs completely independent of the outside world, or are we okay with relying heavily on the fact that these systems exist in the context of a wider society? Although it is indeed a central tenet of mainstream cryptocurrency philosophy that too much external dependence is dangerous, arguably the level of independence that Bitcoin affords us in reality is no greater than that provided by the hybrid model. The argument is simple: even in the case of Bitcoin, a user must also take a leap of trust upon joining the network – first by trusting that they are joining a protocol that contains assets that other people find valuable (eg. how does a user know that bitcoins are worth $380 each and dogecoins only $0.0004? Especially with the different capabilities of ASICs for different algorithms, hashpower is only a very rough estimate), and second by trusting that they are downloading the correct software package. In both the supposedly “pure” model and the hybrid model there is always a need to look outside the protocol exactly once. Thus, on the whole, the gain from accepting the extra trust requirement (namely, environmental friendliness and security against oligopolistic mining pools and ASIC farms) is arguably worth the cost.
Additionally, we may note that, unlike Ripple consensus, the hybrid model is still compatible with the idea of blockchains “talking” to each each other by containing a minimal “light” implementation of each other’s protocols. The reason is that, while the scoring mechanism is not “absolute” from the point of view of a node without history suddenly looking at every block, it is perfectly sufficient from the point of view of an entity that remains online over a long period of time, and a blockchain certainly is such an entity.

The 28mil series A will probably last them at least another two-three years. Development tracks are largely divergent at this this point and not interdependent.

It is happening, but not on the bitcoin block chain. You are correct, the issue is compliance with regulations, in the US these were established by Bank Secrecy Act with the 'travel' rule and by Dodd Frank with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both seek to tie identity to transactions so that blacklists can be cross checked and money laundering patterns identified.
 Ripple is targeting this use case using a distributed consensus ledger and their open source but mostly privately developed protocol RTXP. They are integrating identity confirmation into their protocol, complying with regulatory measures already on record (instead of hoping Lawskey changes his mind) and signing banks in Germany, US, France, England and possibly with Earthport - a foreign exchange compliance expert.
 That said, XRP may never increase in value because it is currency agnostic for the function of transferring value. It is only a unit of account whose value is determined by liquidity of its built-in exchange markets currently available in about a dozen foreign exchange markets including bitcoin, doge, and some native IOU currencies including gold and silver.
 They are presenting at Sibos (swift conference) starting tomorrow and at ACH payments alliance initiative event at end of October. It may end up being used by small to medium banks to eliminate inefficiencies of foreign correspondent banking which powers the top of the food chain banks on wall st. Compared to the peasants revolt that is bitcoin, it is more like a bourgeoise haircut for the banking industry:

Agreed, the permissioned nature of its validator network is a subset of "decentralized" - geographically and organizationally it can be but will likely always subject UNL inclusion to those willing to follow local jurisprudence.
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:05:49
This is where I found it 
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:57:40
The current state of "centralized" validators is no different then the early days of bitcoin or any altcoin when a protocol is first turned on by the devs. The UNL system in Ripple exists to ensure a stable topology, the architecture of which, although currently 100% permissioned and restricted to the 5 core Ripple nodes, has the capability to be expanded through open-source policy, incentivized through smart contracts, and permissioned by validator consensus only. Critiques which focus on 'what it is' vs. of 'what it can be' are maddeningly short-sighted, especially given context of TPS and block-size debates. Can we call bitcoin unscalable because it currently only has 1mb blocks? 7 TPS? That is only takes any two pools colluding to execute a critical double-spend? 
  
Ripple's [testnet]( is already exploring the possible decentralization and incentivization models which have the potential to easily outstrip the unchecked bitcoin mining arms race in terms of "decentralization" were it to be measured quantitatively in terms of unique actors, all while costing orders of magnitude less to run. i.e. a full node can be run with typical [desktop]( for less than 300$ per month.
  
AA and others have consistently sought to stretch this characterization of "centralized" and apply it in ways that are simply not true despite several ironies. Andreas' specific example in your interview, that Ripple has a switch they centrally control which they can throw at any time, on any account is pure fabrication, freeze flags exist to enable gateways to perform a function on the protocol which in the Bitcoin ecosystem is handled off-chain on private exchange systems, the freeze-flag is therefore a more transparent and accountable compliance feature than bitcoin's own system. Piles of comments on twitter misrepresenting the FinCEN ruling as "impossible to happen to bitcoin" are also false, any bitcoin broker who sold 250K of bitcoin without DD would or has (Charlie, DPR, etc) faced similar fines or worse. Misrepresenting the portion of the settlement which resulted in protocol revisions as an example of direct government control is also fictitious, because ther were actually offered by Ripple to ease implementation of live compliance tools they developed for banks which are simply a way to better understand information already available on an open and transparent ledger. The separation of validator and caretaker is not *yet* existent, but is in fact baked in and not the opposite.
Andreas' focus on blacklisting is indeed a critical discussion for bitcoin community to have because the fact remains that Bitcoin is less fungible than Ripple. Ripple is a deterministic, account based ledger - double spends are impossible and XRP in any account is not unique. Whereas bitcoin relies on unspent transaction outputs, so every bitcoin is traceable through every address in its entire history and could, with proper tools like the ones Ripple enacted or extensions of Blockchain.io's products, result in lienable assets. This would break the desired economic model bitcoin was designed to operate as "digital cash". imo, this is why the bitlicense is so scary, it recognizes that even wallets can operate and should potentially be regulated as MSBs. This is a political fight which lies at the core of bitcoin of bitcoin's purpose, which they hope they can win by appealing to 'innovation' even though other innovation is already working this into their models and moving past this obstacle.

AndrewSF from XRPtalk could also be good, he runs OMG which does third-party consulting for onboarding gateways.

Permissioning restricts pools of validators, but does not alter the structure of the consensus process which adds cryptographically validated blocks of transactions as a chain. It may invite unfavorable attributes such as by not being open and public enable certain kinds of censorship or by excluding competitors narrow its market and usefulness. But assuming that permissioned is a state determined by a sole majority actor with the capability to make arbitrary alterations as opposed to a circle of partnerships, or a consortium or congress organized for mutual benefit under shared rules is naive.

They are also collaborating with folks at Ripple on an ancillary project separate  from their token based distributed ledger and in lieu of Codius which was meant to be an Ethereum competitor. It's a low level protocol for using cryptographic escrow to effect atomic and universal transactions between any two capable ledgers. Stephan Thomas outlined it [here]( and Marley Gray of Microsoft's Azure program endorsed [here]( when they announced they would be running a Ripple validator node.

Check your facts: Ripple consensus is **distributed** but not **decentralized** ... yet. It does have a cryptographically secured blockchain-like ledger but does not use proof-of-work to incentivize validators. Its staged avalanche consensus algorithm provides a statistically significant security improvement to Finney attack. Its currency is designed as an integral reserve currency for faster and more efficient Forex, not as daily consumer use means of transaction or permanent store of value. 
  For the privacy and identity rights enthusiasts in the crowd, be sure to follow their progress on the third leg of their mandate Ripple Identity, reported on here by MIT tech review  an effort to cryptographically secure identity credentials which aims to provide AML and KYC compliance through 3rd party registrars while protecting individual identity.

I believe it is the opinion of the author, one I share along with others developing distributed ledger solutions which are more congruent with existing financial standard practices, flawed or imperfect as they may be. I believe these standard practices preclude Bitcoin adoption for the failure of its authors to recognize the crucial aspect liability and accountability of the validation system within current jurisprudence. As the author states, bitcoin's design process included certain political intentions which steered the decisions leading to the structural choices of anonymous validation along with the low bar of simple majority, a parameter finance-oriented developers are proving they would set differently.  
  
As for your prognostication, this may entirely be possible with further technical and legal developments, some of which may need to occur at the core development level and some which must take place at the mining cartel level, but ultimately will need some form of legal precedent set in some court of law for how a failure is recognized, arbitrated and resolved.

By what mechanism would the invalid transaction be identified, sequestered and accounted for? Could this mechanism be used to invalidate otherwise valid transactions? Why does a validation system reputed to be beholden only to 'immutable math' require third party monitoring and resolution?   
 How could any person or corporation with interest in following current jurisprudence submit the validity of their property rights to an anonymous or post-mortem socially enforced negation process?
   Bitcoin's answer might be "because we paid them to" and game theory says they probably won't, but if the condition "we can probably pay them more not to" is even a singular possibility **without legal recourse** it will not be acceptable to current standards of financial world. 
 For bitcoin to progress to next stage of adoption, a double-spend or legally invalid transaction must occur and legal proceedings established to set a precedent for just resolution. Interestingly, this is happening as we speak with Ripple

Actually, I think shitcoin is appropriate. Any commodity can be listed on Ripple as an IOU including shit, so a commodity of manure like UROcoin can be traded on Ripple's built-in exchange.

100b&lt;infinity, can confirm.
Pull a Stellar? Ripple is operating in the big boy world now supporting multiple businesses and multiple banks on their network, oh, and Earthport and Western Union pilots. A fork would make about as much sense as jumping off a bridge.
Also, they are spooling up the protocol for full decentralized deployment - just released custom DB for scalability, running a smart contract incentivized testnet as we speak (hardware requirments posted yesterday) and are in discussions for possible SWIFT, Fed and NPP integrations. Bitcoinistas are going to miss the boat on this one.

Comparative business and development models with similar technology and overlapping regulatory burden. Also, 20% of Ripple trading is with Bitcoin, so institutional adoption of Ripple would constitute new avenue for Bitcoin use by large centralized repositories of wealth with regulatory concerns. Ledger token competition is a red herring the hodlers simply can't let go of despite non-focus of Ripple on direct consumer use as currency. Raiding, downvoting and shitty modding killed ripple on reddit, even though straightup knowledge is generally rewarded across other reddit subs, here subs are treated like a marketing media outlet.

Isn't proof of work a straight up bribe to maintain ecosystem security and hence inextricably susceptible to innate market forces to sell out and fail at a certain profitability margin?

Some clarifications: Ripple Labs cannot freeze funds, but gateways on the network can freeze trustlines - this is the "feature" which makes them more compliant with existing regulations. It more closely models current banking relationships, for better or for worse.
Ripple cannot "print" additional tokens, but they do have possession of 68% of all tokens, which they sell OTC to banking and development partners to fund operations. 
They aren't really pushing their token as a consumer facing currency, they'd rather sell their network and support for being on the network as a currency agnostic settlement rail with a built in exchange to banks and gateways. The value proposition for their currency is not the same as for Bitcoin, they do not expect people to use it as store of value, they do expect market-makers to hold it as arbitrage tool. 
The only true part of original Ripple concept from Ryan Fugger's original idea is called "rippling" and is based on the idea of chain-effect ripples of trust emanating throughout the network, enabling far reaching transfers of value where no direct correspondent relationship existed ... and Ripple Labs generally advises you to turn this off.

Bitcoin has same structural limitation for entry at gateways, ripple gateways do not provide ledger transaction validation, so "trust" is not really a differentiating quality of the networks. I certainly do not believe the networks are the same, my post highlights differences between protocols and the basic flaw of POW relying on bribes to prevent collusion between at least half of validating nodes.

This, possibly with SWIFT controlled validators within a protected UNL loop

Proxy value with a built in exchange is an integral feature of ripple in addition to a protocol specific token (XRP). That's why they call ripple, BitShares and Ethereum bitcoin 2.0, they have the ability to transfer value of anything, not just tokens . Bitcoin is trying to replicate this with sidechains and pegged ETFs, but the truth is, The token is just a stamp, who pays 300$ for a stamp?

left out this bit
Councilwoman: "So Bitcoin isn't for consumer to use?
Chris Larsen: "There's a lot of debate around that, if people want to use that as store of value they certainly can, just like internet of knowledge lets you communicate in any language, internet of value lets you transact in anything of value."

Look if you want to limit your understanding of the potential for distributed ledger technology to the singular tree you call bitcoin, by all means, ignore the forest. For bitcoin or any other ledger to function as medium of exchange and interact with existing stores of value it needs functional gateways, especially now that mining is an entirely inaccessible entry point.   If you are going to cast shade on facts regarding Ripple you really need to understand what you are are talking about and you clearly don't. Gateways in Ripple are the exact same as exchanges in Bitcoin. They have hot wallets, cold wallets, and now [warm wallets]( . They do not validate transactions to the ledger, in fact, they have nothing to do with the consensus protocol or the integral exchange token (xrp) which tracks value except that they hold a lot of XRPs to facilitate the markets they operate. Trust in a gateway is only required if you choose to hold their assets/ious/debtmarker, which is the exact same level of trust thousands of people placed in the dozens of failed Bitcoin exchanges. Of course the protocol isn't affected by a gateway failing but they are part of the economic ecosystem known as Bitcoin which no-one in their right mind will ever trust.

Satoshi owns 7.5% of the entire bitcoin inventory.
There might be some interesting repercussions to someone assuming the identity which controls that stake.

"left in disgust" is an interesting way to frame laying ultimatums at the feet of the board and getting voted out as a consequence.
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:50:10
Mining incentive is no different from a bribe, tax, or kickback. A Federated and Distributed ledger is just as effective as a fully decentralized ledger for transferring value, and the trust level required is substantially lower with a multi-stage plurality consensus voting engine at the core of Ripple. 
Also, Bitcoin is trackable enough ... ask Ross, Charlie and Karpeles.

Attribution is fine, or "Ripple" community, not that it carries any weight in this forum.
If you'd like some irony to throw in, after publication he did [offer]( to fully evaluate the consensus algorithm for a small fee of 30-40k. Not a bribe per se, but interesting given the original was funded by R3 and stopped short of any meaningful work which actually fulfilled the title of the piece while deliberately throwing shade with the weight of his reputation.
Welcome to bitcoin.

Fact: by 2013 45% of bitcoin gateways failed and took deposits with them  
Fact: Bitcoin reward is a bribe for validators to stay honest, there is no mathematical guarantee.

You [quoted me]( in that document, but my quote was directed at Peter Todd's [research]( and [statements]( regarding Ripple, not Bitcoin. I also doubt I qualify as a member of the bitcoin community.
Incidentally, the person everyone would rather be talking about right now instead of the much more important interface between cryptocurrency and regulators, [Dr. Craig Wright]( made similar, incorrect points as Peter regarding Ripple in an [article]( last year regarding Australian banks experimenting with it. [Nick Szabo]( and [Jon Matonis]( were both fans of his opinion then.

Have to point out, its a Cold War euphemism generalizing the POTUS as the leader of non-Communist nations. It is not a literal title, but a slightly tongue-in-cheek honorarium because it is does not have explicit powers or legitimacy.
