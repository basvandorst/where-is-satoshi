If you have a debit card tied to the account you can fund instantly.  If you want to put money back in your bank then use the "cash out" button, the cash out does take several days depending on your bank.  But to add from your bank to Circle its applied instantly and you can then send out in Bitcoins or dollars to whoever you want.

Great service, never had any issues with it.

I'm not sure if any wallet other than Ledger Live has the Bluetooth support yet.  I would assume Coinbase app doesn't have it yet, but that would be a nice feature.  I'm sure Ledger will allow it once they are sure its bullet proof.

I have a Segwit wallet on my Ledger, I just generated a Native Segwit.  How do I get the funds in my Segwit to the Native Segwit account?

From my point of view all of them are still under development and burp every now on then, but overall tend to be a better solution than software based wallets.
I've tried Trezor, KeepKey and Ledger.  My favorite is Ledger, the Nano X at the moment.
Keepkey: Started out ok, really nice hardware, then was sold unexpectedly.  I have not tried it since it was put back in service by the new owner, but assume it still does not support a lot of ALTS.
Trezor:  Used it briefly, worked fine.  Did not support a lot of ALTS when I tried it, but I believe it does now.  What I didn't like about it is that the hardware had a cheap feel to it.  But still not a major complaint as it worked as advertised.
Ledger: Good quality, support for lots of tokens.  Frequent software and firmware updates to correct bugs and add features.  The "X" has more memory so it supports a lot more apps for tokens.  The "S" required constantly having to swap apps in and out due to less memory.  Overall I would suggest the Ledger, also because of the Bluetooth feature which now lets it work on mobile devices.

Bitcoin was designed to be forked.

I opened a ticket when it happened to me and very quickly received a reply that I needed to go through the process, even though I had explained in the ticket that I had gone through the process already many moons ago.  I wrote them back, told them the problem was on their end to look at my history.  They fixed it without replying, has been working ever since.  Shortly after that I've heard many complain about having the issue and no resolution from Bittrex.

Ledger, I own them all including Keepkey.  Ledger is my favorite. Just works and easy to use with nice apps.  I own Nano S and the Blue.  Like them both.

Its not an exchange, my personal checking account.

I bought 1.9, will buy a lot more once the darn bank goes through its 5 day process for depositing a check!

If someone wants to take Bitcoin out of the picture the most realistic way would be tear it apart from the  inside, since the outside is encrypted. :)
By sowing division and infighting it could delay or possibly collapse it if people go with the flow.
I think we the people are Bitcoins' weakest link in that sense, but also potentially its greatest strength.  I'm optimistic of the final outcome.

The VG didn't work for me.  Its very thick and kind of builds up in my windpipe and causes me to cough.  Also I've read it's not very friendly for some coil units, my Kangertech OCC's were kind of choking on it as well.  I was using 80/20 VG mix.  I've now switched back to 80/20 PG and don't feel that gooey effect.
That's been my experience with it.  Everyone is different though.  Might be just me.

Here's another Vegas Bitcoin tip, look at the scrolling sign:

I have Trezor, Ledger, and Keepkey. Ledger Nano S is definitely my favorite so far, its the last one I purchased, I thought it looked kind of cheap and clumsy to use online, so had held off.  After receiving it, its great quality and easy to use.  As someone else mentioned, the only negative is that you can't install all the available wallet apps into it.
The Ledger Blue which I've pre-ordered is supposed to allow for more apps, looking forward to trying it.
KeepKey I love, but kind of disappointed at the slow development.  So I'm holding judgement to see what happens with the ShapeShift deal.

Quality product worth the wait.

Same here.  Memorizing it is not the problem, forgetting it is the problem.

I think the Syscoin wallet has the feature in their marketplace.  And I believe it allows Bitcoin transactions.

Translation of "grow our economy" in his comments is, keep putting more dollars in my pocket.

Does KeepKey/MultibitHD have the functionality yet to keep more than one wallet in the Keepkey?
If yes, how do I go about adding the second wallet?
@_date: 2015-11-23 03:37:48
I may be confused since I have just started using Bitcoin.  But from the marketing I've seen from KeepKey, They mention that it is virtually limitless in the amount of wallets it can store.  
What am I misunderstanding?  Are they referring to some other feature?
So if I wanted two wallets I would need to purchase two Keep Keys?  Or is there some way to create a sub-wallet, kind of like a folder structure in an OS?  But that would use the same private key?
What I'd  like to have is a place for my regular wallet and a separate place for my mining income,  but both in Keep Key.
EDIT:  This is the specific section of their FAQ that I am referring to:
How many private keys and wallets can be stored on my KeepKey?
KeepKey supports BIP 32 wallets, or what are commonly called HD wallets. This allows KeepKey to generate and store an unlimited number of private keys. KeepKey also supports BIP 44, which allows for an organization of accounts. KeepKey can support practically an unlimited number of wallets with an unlimited number of private keys.

Ok, I see what you mean Jim.  Thanks!
One more question - sorry but I'm really new at using the wallets.  To be able to use Multibit on my laptop, with the same wallets that I have on my desktop....
Do I just need to install MultibitHD on my laptop and do a recovery off the backups being generated by the desktop?  Thus allowing me to add entries from either the laptop or desktop? 
Would I then need to specify two separate locations for backups?
Thanks
