Why are so many people mad about one using BTC as a currency? If there are no actual use cases for BTC then it is just a value store equal to gold. This is not what we want Bitcoin to be.

Please tell me if I am wrong.
Coinbase still seems like the cheeper option for the US.
ACH (Bank transfer) is free
Purchasing $1,000 Bitcoin at .005 fee: $5
Purchasing on kraken
Wire transfer, ACH not available, $5
Purchasing $1,000 Bitcoin at .0014 fee: $1.40
What am I missing? What is cheaper than this?
Note I hold and don't day trade.

Coinbase pro, Kraken, Cash App(Tho I can not really get a good read on fee's), Gemini, and Binance

I am located in central USA

Sorry, I wont do this. No key no bitcoin. The way I see it if I were to sell something and they showed up and tried handing me an IOU for $100 I would not accept that as payment for said object.

What do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-10-10 19:52:37
Yeah I am in the USA and according to their fees section we don't have that option yet. This why coinbase is cheaper. FYI (I learned this recently) ACH: automated Clearinghouse.
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:43:40
Can you explain the fees?
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:44:29
Square as in cash app? What are the fees for that?
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:00:59
Thanks can you give me the btc price on cash app and coin base at the moment? Or do you know the general percentage difference between the two?
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:36:17
Thanks for the reply, Yes I meant .005 not .0005. And Yes I was talking about coinbase pro / GDAX.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:45:47
It seems very few people use this in my area. :/ I do really like the idea tho.
@_date: 2019-10-10 23:54:15
Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:40:31
I agree tho I. Not really a beginner just looking for options. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:59:31
That is pretty much what I have been finding, I thought I was missing something thanks for your input.

Does converting to USDC Not cost anything?
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:32:48
This actually does look cheaper. I was not aware they allowed ACH.

To be fair I don't believe this is what the person above meant. They are concerned people are just getting into Bitcoin as it is exciting and because everyone else is doing it. They don't feel the general Bitcoin population understands banks, what is wrong with them. 
Please enlighten me if I am incorrect.
