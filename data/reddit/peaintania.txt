Bitcoin Core plans to change consensus algorithm in PoW. That'll make a lot of ASIC useless. That why Chinese miners want to create Bitcoin Unlimited with same consensus algorithm in PoW
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:27:30
Yeah, Segwit can solve this problem and improve a lot of things.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:11:41
Thank you so much for answer. 
I afraid they are going to make the hard fork before reach 75% support. Because Bitcoin have serious problems now.
Now I use  to follow up. 
Do you think it is going to fork before reach 75% or not?

Bitcoin Unlimited is coin that has been built for Chinese miner. They don't want to change consensus algorithm. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:16:58
That's bsolutely true.

A few people create the BCH hard fork and have already gone to Rest of the people still want 2x HF unless they will go to support BCH too.
I also don't like bigger block cuz it increases blockchain size fastly.
but we have to do cuz we promised.
Just don't put gasoline in a fire of hate.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:51:51
Imo, Segwit2x will increase blockchain size get too big fastly. 
That's the biggest problem of every blockchain and make it unworkable.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:01:12
me too. But I think It won't be this hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:11:39
Stupid people want a war. Smart people want an alliance.
I don't curious, why they hate people like you so much and 95% posts on fuck up us.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:07:49
Of course, they do. That's a good thing.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:13:20
WTF. We have to keep bigger block supporter in BTC. Don't drive them to BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:54:22
Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:02:29
Yeah, Thank you, Wang Chun.
Someone broke the controversial scaling agreement Segwit2x first by created BCash. So, we don't need to care it too. We have to do only something best for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:11:26
We have to do the hard fork.
People like you fuck us enough.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:02:17
Yeah, I think so.
How merchants and customers choose Lightning Network node operators, that they want to accept payment?
Is it like a credit card companies, merchants choose the best operators?
Imo, Operators get profit from their network is a good thing because they're going to work hard and make the best product. 
Nobody can work for free and I don't want someone do it too.
But, monopoly market structure is very terrible. 
After they become monopolies, they can set any price they choose. That's known as price-fixing. 
They can do this regardless of demand because they know the consumer has no choice. 
They lose any incentive to innovate. They have no need to provide "new and improved" products.
That is true of software OS, credit card, and cable companies.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:01:45
You can do whatever you want. I don't care.
If you support Segwit2x, Bitcoin community will be stronger. BCH will be weaker until worthless.
If you don't support Segwit2x, It'll be ok for me. I love free coin.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:39:25


So, if Lightning Network transactions are private between their participants who mine those transactions?
And, how they get a reward?
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:23:47
I also don't like the hard fork but we have to do something that we promise. We promise to increase block size 2 years ago, we lied one time that enough.
People like you make our coin split to Bitcoin Cash. The hard fork won't make anything worse than this. If our coin is going to split again, that is OK. I love free coin. Gonna be 3 coin fight together like a 3 kingdom.

There was 1 block has &gt;4% segwit transaction and 6 block have &gt;1% segwit transaction.

I know but big block supporters want 2MB on-chain block.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:18:30
I think we use the whole previous transaction as a hash of the next transaction.
That why we have to download the whole blockchain for verifying by ourselves, before start pruning it.
Someone said the difference. I just want to know their reason.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:12:25
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:45:24
We have to keep big block supporter in BTC. don't drive them to BCH.
Users don't pay many fees on the Segwit+LN transaction. Miners don't like it, so we need more supporter.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:34:12
The Chinese person with US citizenship is American.
Because they live and work in the US and they want to make the country prosper.
But BCash supporters want to replace Bitcoin.

Can Bitcoin block pruning solve the increasing blockchain size problem?

@_date: 2017-08-31 19:39:37
Why would people buy BCash when they can buy the real thing?
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:48:09
BCash is a coin for miners. A miner took the matter into his own hands.

@_date: 2017-08-26 15:42:36
1. Developers will be able to code the best for the protocol as they always did. (CEO, manager, employee)
2. Miners will be able to mine in their own self-interest coin like they always did. (Sub-contractor, supplier)
3. Users will be able to choose the best coin for their purchase like they always did. (Customer)
4. Coin holders should be able to vote pivotal for direction of their coin like stakeholders of every companies always did. (Investors, owner)
Miners shouldn't be deciding who codes or what gets coded.
Proof of stake is make sense. That why I prefer it. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:42:27
more our blockchain size increase, more node validator we lose.
If our blockchain size becomes too large, there will be only a few active validator. Most of the users don't want to store the whole blockchain on their computer without any profit, so the blockchain will become unreliable and unworkable. That's no difference between the blockchain and the bank's databases.
In concept, everybody should verify the blockchain when they open their wallet.
Too large blockchain size is the biggest problem. That why core developer always focuses on keeps blockchain as small as possible.
The original chain have to be reliable settlement layer and off-chain have to be fast and cheap payment layer.

@_date: 2017-08-25 09:11:01
If there are a lot of Segwit transactions in the block, Block will more than 1 MB.
Because Segwit replaces the block size limit with a block weight limit. Segwit transactions use less weight than normal transactions, which is how more than 1MB blocks can be made. 
By using non-Segwit transactions, your transactions will weigh more, and hit the new weight limit sooner, while the tx size is the same.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:10:11
Can someone explain how to use Segwit?
Do we have to wait for a merchandise active Segwit first or we can use it immediately?

So, there will be many LN node operators. Merchants have to choose operators, that they want to accept the payment. 
It like a credit card, that's monopoly market structure, right?

Please do UASF now. No more conflict of interest.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:06:56
maybe I don't. I confuse. someone told me we don't need to use. we can use a raspberry pi to securing Segwit network.

I know lightning network on Segwit can buy coffee for sure. But can Bitcoin Unlimited buy coffee? I very confuse.
Bitcoin block time is over 10 mins. 1 year ago when bitcoin block size wasn't full, I had to pay a very high fee and I had to wait for confirm more than 15 mins. 
I think increase block size cannot make bitcoin as good as Visa and Mastercard, not even close.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:37:26
I meant more than 15 mins. 
Whatever wait for 10mins, 15mins or 1 hours aren't ok with buying coffee.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:17:17
15 mins is (lucky 10 mins + unlucky 20 mins)/2

I didn't mention about email confirmation because email confirmation easier to hack than password/2FA.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:57:49
Let's me explain.
When you log-in many times a day, somebody can see your password. If they can get your phone and you don't know only 2 minutes, they can steal your money. Because they can get 2FA and Email from this phone.

Core developers get some profits is a good thing. I don't want developers to work hard for us for free. Nobody can do that.
Example, developers of ethereum and zcash get a lot of profit from their blockchains. That why they work very hard and successful. Everybody's happy. Win win.
There's free lunch.

I've paid a lot of Newegg product with bitcoin before but now no option for bitcoin payment. I called support then he told me they no longer accept bitcoin. He doesn't know it's temporary or permanently.
A lot of merchandise have the option to pay with altcoin in this month because bitcoin has a high fee and long confirmation time.
That's good for bitcoin. Bitcoin market share goes down too fast.
