Ok, so quick dumb question as I'm just heading out.
With a Trezor, there's no longer really a need to keep a cold/paper wallet.    This thing is completely safe enough on its own?
Right now I use Armory with a paper wallet, but it's kind of a pain in the butt when I want to make a transaction, plus I use OSX with limited space, so having to run the blockchain as well is a hassle.   If I could switch to the myTrezor web wallet (something I would never ever do usually) knowing that it's 1000% safe as the Trezor handles everything, well that sounds pretty awesome.

I'm completely out of the loop when it comes to altcoins, I stopped paying attention to them a long time ago, but does "solidity" have anything to do with that nutcase who "built" Solidcoin a few years back?   God help Ethereum if that's the case.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:28:12
Well that's the difference here.  Segwit was very, very extensively tested, unlike some other upcoming HF attempts ;)
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:55:43
Unnecessarily large blocks aside, my main issue is that I simply don't have faith in the developers on the 2x team.   The vast, vast majority of the proven, skilled devs code for core, and the amount of issues and bugs that core devs have found and helped fix in 2x in its (very limited) development time is just scary.
Bitcoin can't be maintained by unskilled devs, it just can't.  This is a really really quick way to kill the entire thing.

@_date: 2017-08-27 20:57:53


Sure, that's open source software for you, however why would anyone in their right mind even consider moving to a dev "team" that excludes all the smartest people working on Bitcoin for the last 7 years and is essentially just one or two people.   That's a really awesome way to quickly lose all your money.   Nobody is that stupid, it's not going to happen.

@_date: 2017-08-19 07:39:17
That's a great post, well done ����
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:04:29
It's to be expected.  I think we're at a point now where anything that even remotely sounds like it could be pro Bitcoin and/or anti-2x is immediately jumped on by people who really don't understand enough to know what any of this means.  They just see an excuse to attack and go for it, even in cases, such as this, where the changes benefit everyone.
Someone said it above, and it's true, that a large majority of the people in favour of 2x/bCash are (and this isn't meant as an attack) technically obtuse and really don't understand what they're fighting for, or against.  They're just victims of propaganda and don't bother (or aren't capable of) reading up on the proposed changes and forming their own opinion.  Again, that's not meant as an insult, Bitcoin is complicated, but it's a shame nontheless.
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:34:11
My worry is that even if all these miners stick to 2x (which remains to be seen), and 2x actually succeeds, I simply don't have faith in whatever developers remain on board (non core) to keep things running.  They've demonstrated they can't quite get it right so far (the amount of bugs core have found and helped fix in 2x is just scary so far and it's not even out yet).
If the core devs step back if 2x "wins", then I have real concerns that Bitcoin won't be properly maintained going forward, and that'll be the end of everything in crypto (if Bitcoin fails, you bet your ass everything else will go with it for the forseeable future).
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:44:25


Again, it was ready ages ago and miners blocked its release.

@_date: 2017-08-25 05:14:47
Ok, well keep that Jalapeno mining both chains then, I'm sure your shortsighted math will work out fine :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:01:38
Well it wasn't even particularly subtle.   Jihan etc started pushing their rhetoric ages ago and the mempool started filling.  Literally right as the NYA was signed, the mempool dropped right to almost nothing, there's a great graph around here somewhere that shows it.   When the mempool didn't need to be full anymore to push their agenda, it miraculously emptied.   As I said, not very subtle.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:17:02
Bitfinex used it first I think (and still do).  The bcashers just find it offensive, presumably because they want to hijack the Bitcoin name and this makes it harder (not that they ever had a chance anyway).
Love your stance by the way, we need more of that lately.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:50:42
Lucky all code is peer reviewed by the other devs in that case.  It's a non issue.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:30:55
There are hundreds of devs that code for core.  I understand it's easy to single out Luke due to his weird beliefs, but one dev out of hundreds doesn't tarnish the entire group.
Besides, while I fundamentally disagree with Luke's personal beliefs, there's no denying he's a talented coder.

@_date: 2017-08-22 21:40:01
I don't think they're trying to define Bitcoin in general with that statement, they're just identifying the current version to more easily highlight their intentions in that particular statement.  
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:55:08
They're opposed to how it's being built and rushed out.   No core dev has ever said they don't want bigger blocks, they simply want to spend the required amount of time planning and building a suitable solution.  2x is none of that.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:09:54


Nooo, Roger would *never* manipulate votes or encourage people to, never in a million years!  Good job there are no previous examples of him doing just that we can link to.

Everyone, including Garzick, knows that the benefits of Segwit aren't going to be seen immediately after implementation.   He's just desperate now.

@_date: 2017-08-20 00:00:00
At the end of the day, bcash is going nowhere for the same reason as segwit2x, and that's lack of good (or any) developers.   It simply won't be able to survive.

Roger has never been particularly subtle with his shilling.

If they cared at all about doing the right thing 2x wouldn't be going ahead like this in the first place.

Thanks for your efforts Pieter :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:56:57
I understand why it's good, but I think it's such a trivial non issue that we shouldn't stoop to their level and post essentially "weee we're winning for another few days" every time the hashpower swings.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, bcash is not a threat, let them post their petty topics if they want but we should be better than that.

I couldn't care less if you believe it or not, doesn't worry me whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:07:40
I'm no Garzick fan lately, but it's not really fair to say he's not a competent developer.  He's competent enough (that's about as far as I'd go though), the problem is he's doing most of the coding for 2x himself and that's just an all round terrible idea.  No-one's competent enough to code for something this complicated without a great deal of help and peer review.
His issues aren't his coding skills, just his shitty morals.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:14:30
Yeah that's not even slightly true.
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:57:29
I think once the "hey everyone, look at Bitcoin, the fees are high" posts stop, and the "Segwit isn't doing anything, lies lies lies (core nazis)" posts stop, well then maybe we'll see them actually focus on their own coin and....   no who am I kidding, they'll think of some other nonsense that barely makes sense to start picking at.
It's going to be a long couple of months :)
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:21:16


That's right, it's not a problem because of all the many reasons the many other people commenting pointed out to him.  You seem to be incapable of accepting that maybe HE'S the one who's wrong in this instance.   
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:13:58
Just one of the guys who keeps Bitcoin purring along.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:45:58


It is, but it also happens to be a fact.  Big changes like this require careful planning, coding and testing.  3 months is rushed for a change like this, especially when there's only 1 or 2 developers actually working on it.    It's madness.
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:47:26
Exactly my thoughts.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:17:46


That's not what he said.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:39:18
Yep fair enough.  Excuse my prickly response, it's hard to distinguish the legitimate posters lately.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:21:14


Well luckily that's happening in about 20 mins ;)
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:00:18
Well firstly, clearly not as the devs are already planning to get rid of it much quicker than expected because it's causing havoc, and secondly it works well because no one uses it and there's no use for it (aside from changetips and sending to and from exchanges).  Of course those things are quick, that's all it's doing.
Perhaps it should be renamed ChangetipCash in one of the upcoming hard forks (not even joking, it'd be fine for that).
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:23:14
Fatal bug due to lack of testing and all your money is gone.
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:16:24
Yep exactly, thanks for that (that's a good article)
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:04:22
Well at least one of the devs think it is:
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:27:38
In all honesty, really reminds me of 4chan.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:00:55
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:17:38
They're not the ones that have any reason to be desperate.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:33:01
Er, ok, show me the other most competent group then?   I'll wait.
Core is made up of hundreds of devs, and yes as a whole they're really bloody competent.  They've built up and maintained Bitcoin for years, and guess what, it's still around and trading at over $4000.  
Still waiting.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:52:25
Good one Dad :D
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:54:38
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:13:36


Perhaps, but even if that's the case (and Segwit 2MB blocks for some reason don't count), trusting the entire network to one developer is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:34:25
Ver has a history of it, this is no surprise at all.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:26:51
I understand how it works just fine, seems Garzick could use a crash course though.  The core devs aren't going to "give in" and work on a broken implementation as it goes against everything they believe in.  It's Garzick on his own or no-one, which is why nobody is going to want to use it.
If you don't agree with the many core devs reasoning, well it doesn't matter, it doesn't change the facts.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:38:27
It's just how Ver works. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:44:56
It doesn't have the vast majority of competent devs behind it.   I have zero faith in those involved to be able to keep it running sufficiently.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:04:01
It's been 1 day, be less of a dick.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:36:23
Said the bcash developers
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:57:33
Or you just upload them another way.  SMS for example.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:52:34
At this stage that's a pretty big if.   Those people signalled it, if they follow through is another matter altogether.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:18:16
Probably, but it's not possible for the core devs to "back down" as it won't change the fact that 2x is rushed and untested.   There's no way it can go ahead safely at this point.  Replay would help, then we could all just get rid of the 2x coins immediately (and safely), but it won't help the fact that an entire network hard fork has been put together in a few months by a couple of people.  Screw that, it's lunacy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:33:15
No it shouldn't.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:09:14
He's 100% correct with that, I've come to the exact same conclusion.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:28:09
Hard to tell who's being spurious with facts and who's being sarcastic lately :D
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:12:09
We're already in that situation (many places don't have reliable, or any, internet), this just opens up more avenues for those people to participate if they so choose.  
Short a nuclear war (which admittedly isn't as far fetched lately, thanks Trump), we're not realistically going to suddenly lose the entire internet.   This isn't about disaster recovery, it's about broadening scope and providing redundancy.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:47:57
Luckily that's probably one days gain in Bitcoin lately so hopefully it evens out for you :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:46:00

Nope, just pure risk :D
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:24:28
Ok flat earthers, how about this.  You're discussing this in a Bitcoin forum so I'm going to assume you own some.   Here's a way for you to prove your theory correct (or learn a long overdue science lesson).   Save up your Bitcoin, pool it together with likeminded folk if need be, and give $250,000 to Richard Branson.  You'll get a comfy seat straight into orbit and you can check out the flat earth with your own eyes.  Think of the acclaim and riches you'll receive from your people, being the one to prove your theory right after all these thousands of years of not being able to for definitely no reason at all!
At this rate, by the time Virgin Galactic is ready, you'll probably only need a minimal amount of BTC to get a ticket, and you'll likely get a nice seat next to Leonardo Di Caprio or some other famous person, assuming you don't believe he's a robot from the future or something.

Wait, are you calling Segwit a brutally ugly hack?    Wow you really have been drinking the cool-aid haven't you.   There's nothing ugly or hacky about it, it's really well put together.
Again though, if you want to look at ugly hacks I can link you to the btc1 git repo (but I get the feeling you'd rather put your fingers in your ears and la-la-la).

@_date: 2017-08-23 21:15:46


Luckily Segwit activates soon, then Lightning.  Evolution :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:16:15
Well when the troll army are back parroting the stuff they've been told to say (high fees!  No lightning! Segwit isn't working! etc etc), be sure to remind them it's mostly caused by their badly coded, badly thought out coup attempt and it's a perfect illustration of why amateurs shouldn't try and code for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:29:51


I think most of those people, even the nazi types, are starting to realise their mistake (finally) ;)
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:17:55


The downside is that the person building it is:
a) one person
b) not competent enough to pull it off
If it were many, many competent devs with a long history of coding for the protocol (I can think of one such group as luck would have it), and the hard fork had been carefully planned and tested over a long period of time, I don't think many, if any, people would have as much of a problem with it.
As it stands it's reckless and downright stupid to even think that 2x  is a safe way forward.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:50:33
Maxwell deserves a special mention for Segwit as well, while the memes are throwing :).  Well done Greg, keep doing what you do.

That's the plan :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:59:33
I never really went in that sub before all the bcash nonsense, but to be honest I find myself visiting a fair bit now just out of morbid curiosity.  The stuff they come up with is golden, and 90% of all topics are just "durrr, look at core being stooooopid".
It's a fascinating study in paranoid schizophrenia if nothing else.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:03:50
You have your big block coin in bcash, it's just not Bitcoin.  Go use that, problem solved.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:57:29
It's slowly eating itself alive (its big feature is a huge bug).  They can fix it with a hard fork, but it highlights that it wasn't well thought through.  Are you going to need to hard fork every couple of weeks to fix these silly oversights?  Hard forks should not be taken lightly.
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:52:36

Like he said, read the discussion, but actually READ it and attempt to comprehend it instead of just following along with whatever garzik says.   This is PREVENTING a problem from occurring.   If you're not able to understand the technical workings of Bitcoin (and that's fine, it's a complicated machine), maybe just don't get involved in technical discussions.   Hell if everyone followed that advice this place would be tumbleweeds and Bitcoin would be purring along just nicely.

The fact that is needs removing so soon and requires a (not to be taken lightly, despite what too many people might think) hard fork would suggest it's not good either :D.  At the end of the day though I don't really care so I'm not going to argue with you too much about it.  If you prefer to think it's all fine and dandy I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:49:31
I'm aware, but the HF part would fall into the "don't know what they're talking about" part of my post ;)
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:40:06
Well it boils down to two things for me:
1 Will all the miners that signalled for 2x actually still want to go ahead with it now that either 
a) Segwit solves the bigger block issues they were after or
b) bitcash does
2 Are the devs competent enough to action a successful fork in the first place and if so not have the coin implode shortly after release.  That sounds like a troll but considering how much help they've had from core devs and the amount of issues discovered by core devs in the... weeks of development, it's actually an honest question.
As for 2x being more secure, I'm assuming you're referring to amount of hashpower there (in which case see point 1), and usable, see point 2.
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:23:45
It's bcash on bitfinex and that's the exchange I use, so it's bcash as far as I'm concerned.  I don't care if it's hurting someone's feelings to be honest.  If they were worried about that they shouldn't have tried to piggyback on the Bitcoin name.  If their coin had any merit then it should be able to stand on its own with its own name.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:49:05
They don't make money from it (I imagine they'll sell some sort of all in one starter pack with the dish and equipment needed to get up and running quick, but you can source that stuff yourself easily so it's not mandatory).
They're making Bitcoin better for everyone (what's that "reeeeee" noise in the distance?)

I totally agree, and I don't always practice what I preach either so I'm as guilty of it as the next guy here.
I do think it's a good idea going forward to just totally ignore them though, as honestly that's often more annoying to someone than engaging with them.   It will clearly draw the line between the subs as well, as one will be 100% negative and hopefully this one can be much more positive and welcoming to newcomers.

That's good, but could we not get into this habit of posting this stuff just because that other sub does?
We're better than that, and bcash will run its course naturally without us having to highlight which chain is more profitable this week.   Let's not stoop to their level.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:38:38
Sure.   But again, I (and I'm going to presume the vast majority of sensible people who don't want to see Bitcoin die) am going to go with the hundreds of devs experienced in Bitcoin who have maintained it for years and know it inside out, verses basically one dev, Jeff Garzick.
I code for a living so I'm pretty across how the development lifecycle works, but it's become fairly clear that a decent percentage of people (and pretty much 100% of people in the other subreddit), don't.
You simply can't build code this complicated and test it thoroughly with a handful of people in this short timeframe.  You will miss bugs, and bugs in Bitcoin are about as bad as it gets.   How many billions of dollars is it worth now?  $50Billion?   Do you seriously want to trust that with 1 or 2 devs?  It's absolute madness.   Shit the stuff I build is absolute peanuts compared to Bitcoin, but it still goes through extensive testing and peer review because if I push out a buggy piece of crap then the business could easily lose money.   This is no different, just orders of magnitude more complicated and important.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:53:35

You'd be a pain in the ass around here if you were so stupid :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:20:18
Maybe losing all their money and destroying Bitcoin with rushed code is a better solution then?   No?  Didn't think so.  Segwit is here in a few days which will bring a whole suite of enhancements and benefits along with it.  This would have been merged a year ago if it weren't for miners blocking it, so maybe direct your annoyance at them.
Unless you understand the intricacies of coding for Bitcoin, which you clearly don't, don't presume to trivialize what is a very complicated problem to solve which should be carefully planned and thought through to avoid disastrous consequences for everyone involved.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:59:55
Great, you can send those useful transactions to and from exchanges all day long.  That's about it though hey.
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:45:24
Honestly at the moment, it's 2x.   Not enough devs working on it, not tested thoroughly enough, stalled development at the moment, rushed out.   One major bug in there that slips past the 1 dev working on it and we're in trouble.
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:20:52
Honestly, I think the resistance to it at the moment is just to the rushed implementation.  The simple fact right now, after Segwit, is that there's no rush for an increase.  When the time comes for it to happen, it can be carefully planned and implemented (unlike what's trying to be forced through with 2x at the moment).
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:10:34

I'm going to agree with magerpower3 on this one.  It's really easy to take a quick win and have a dig at the other sub when they're down, but honestly it doesn't do us any favours.  
If you want to "get back at them", the best way to do that is let them post the daily rages and nonsense about us, but we should focus on positives for Bitcoin and forget they exist.   New users will quickly nope out of there as it's so negative, and they can come here as they should and discuss Bitcoin properly.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:46:50


2x isn't hasty code at all though.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:03:11
Welcome to the real world, where useful complicated nice to have stuff takes time to code and test.  Despite what you may have been told lately, with a rushed hard fork (oh guess what, it's not working properly and another hard fork is needed to fix it, maybe testing it longer would have helped) and another rushed upcoming hard fork (I'll be surprised if that even works at all), nice things that don't break take time to put together.
Now if you cared enough to bother checking, instead of just parroting off the same nonsense that is being bandied around by those who want you to believe them, you can go and test working implementations of lightning apps right now, there are several to choose from.

Honestly, most of the people we see coming in here arguing against Segwit/Lightning/Useful code merges etc are the same.  They don't know if the code is good or bad, they just come in with "Um Core are bad and this change is probably bad too!!" because that's all they've been told and they're not technically minded enough to parse the data themselves and understand it.
The BB's have just sort of built an army of non-technical grunts to attack these changes blindly and without question.   Can't help feeling it's these people that are going to be burnt the most in all of this, as they're almost fighting for something that's going to harm them in the long run.

Totally.  This has been my argument all along (I'm not alone, I know) but it's just insanity to leave development of something this big, this complicated and this important to a small number of devs, let alone one dev, let alone one incompetent dev.
It's madness and there's absolutely no chance in hell anyone with an ounce of common sense will want to use that version of Bitcoin.   It's a really quick way to lose all your money and bring the whole idea of Bitcoin crashing to the ground.

@_date: 2017-08-09 22:41:56
One of the main issues around 2x is it's rushed timeframe.  It doesn't allow for adequate development or testing.   There's zero need for one solution or another by November so why put out that ultimatum?   Let Segwit settle in and do its thing, and over time Lightning will be tested and implemented when it's necessary.   If, far down the line, a hard fork is needed then so be it, but by then a solution will have been thought through properly and tested to high heaven, as it should be.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:43:39
Implementing replay protection requires a hard fork.  Why the hell would core do that when they're trying to prevent a hard fork in the first place? :D

Haha, wow, what an amazingly bad post.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:21:32


They planned their solution 12 months ago, it's called Segwit, and certain miners blocked it for their own purposes.   It's happening now anyway, so there should be no issue in waiting to see how that goes before rushing in with a quickly built (by a ridiculously small group of people) inadequately tested hard fork, should there.
It's not about that though is it.  They want Bitcoin and if they have to destroy it in the process then so be it, apparently.
You're not an idiot Erik, you have to know this is a bad way of going about this.   What's the issue in waiting now, observing Segwit, and in that time put together a solid, well tested, thoroughly vetted scaling proposal the way it's supposed to be done, through a BIP.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:13:24
Well said
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:27:47


They certainly should, and putting their faith in 1 or 2 developers (Garzick and.... well just Garzick I guess) vs the hundreds of experienced developers that fall under core that have gotten Bitcoin to where it is today, where do you think they'll gamble their profits?   The guys who know how Bitcoin works (because they built and maintain it), or one guy and whatever other randoms he can get to help him.
It's not a hard choice.

Oh look at that, the successful software developer knows what he's talking about, who would have thought!

They are of course replaceable, but the replacements need to be equally skilled at minimum and there needs to be more than one dev total...
All this is moot of course as Bitcoin is open source.   There are hundreds of devs from all over that choose to contribute, and anyone else can choose to as well.  If their code proposals have consensus then it gets merged.   It's not a complicated system, and it's certainly not unique to Bitcoin.  It's just open source.

It simply required testing as all things do (especially in this space), and as there's (supposed to be) a responsible declaration for issues like this it wouldn't normally have been a problem.   It's not really a simple bug to manipulate so the chance of someone actually pulling it off is slim.    If it were a gamebreaking bug needing an immediate release then it would have gotten an immediate release.
Basically, the devs were doing the right thing in finding and fixing the issue early then taking the required time to adequately test it.  It's unfortunate that someone came along and did something shitty forcing an early release, but it is what it is.

Well I'm not the best person to explain the intricacies as I'm still picking through it myself, but up until now there's been some "concern" that the topology of the lightning network will be several large nodes handling the majority of transactions, like a hub and spoke, thus adding some centralisation (though in reality you'd just route around that node if you really wanted to).   The above graph (from testnet, and obviously early days still) so far shows it's a much more fluid topology, but again we'll have to see in the long run.  Either way it's a cool graph :D
I agree though, I'd love one of the lightning devs to jump on here and give a deep dive at some point.

Tell me, why do you think that might be?

Honestly, no idea, last time I mined was with a bunch of GPU's, so that was a good while ago :D   Now you're looking at buying dedicated ASIC's which are anywhere between $700 and $1400USD each as far as I can tell.  Not sure how many of those you'd need to make a return, or how long it'd take.
I will say though, there's not a great deal of choice of companies to buy from right now (more are coming), but one of the companies is bad news and actively working to hurt Bitcoin, so I'm only going to link to the other one, and that's   Don't buy from the other company.

Ok, here's a basic gist:
* Sign up to Google Compute if you haven't already, this will give you $300 free credit.  
* Create a VM in the VM Instances tab.   Personally I just went with Ubuntu (choose whatever you're comfortable with) and 1 vCPU, 2.25 GB memory.  For the disk size I ended up at 180GB, just to give a little breathing room.
* Once created, click on your instance name to open the Details page and scroll down to Network Interfaces.  Click on "default" to open VPC network details.
*  Click Add Firewall Rule and fill out as per:  
* Head back to VM Instances and click on the SSH button to open a terminal to your box.
*  You have options now to get Bitcoind happening:  
   * You can build from source, which is always recommended, however I found the VM was too weak to handle it so if you wanted to do that you'd have to bump up the specs temporarily otherwise you'll find the build failing midway due to memory.
   * You can just install the PPA repo (this is what I ended up doing) - 
   * You can run something like the one liner script at  but I haven't looked at what that's actually doing, and you should be cautious of running commands like this for anything, let alone for something like Bitcoin.   However if you don't plan on putting any transactions through this node and it's just there to exist (and it's on a remote VM like this), then it's probably not much of a problem.
*  Once installed just start up bitcoind (sudo bitcoind -daemon), or play with some of the flag options if you want to limit bandwidth/prune/etc etc and let it go.   It'll take ages (took probably a week to sync for me, but this was before .15 which should be a little quicker, and I'm sure there are way to speed it up that I didn't bother with).  Once synced you'll start to see more connections and it'll just purr along on its own.

Changing his signal message has nothing to do with what he's publicly said several times that he's committing to.  You don't reboot a production server if it's not necessary, and as a signal message really means nothing at all, a reboot isn't currently necessary.

I've been around Bitcoin a long time, and a friend I work with doesn't own any but has always followed along vicariously through me.   We had a long chat yesterday about this, and this psychological barrier around "I want a whole coin, but a whole coin is expensive" is absolutely a large barrier for entry for a lot of people.   I usually have Bitcoinity open on a screen at work and showed him their mBTC option, and mentioned that there's been several pushes for people to switch to this over the years but it's never caught on.  Once he saw $5.7 per unit instead of $5700 I could almost see the lightbulb go off immediately.    He's now planning on buying in, slowly, with an aim to eventually own 1 full Bitcoin down the line at some point, which is obviously the right way to look at it nowadays.
We shouldn't underestimate this psychological barrier, it's a real turn off for a lot of people.

Hi!  No, don't worry too much about this post if you're really new to Bitcoin, you can mess with this later when you're a bit more comfortable with the whole thing.
Long story short, don't worry about mining, it's not really feasible for the average person anymore (not without a decent capital outlay anyway).  If you want Bitcoin, buy from an exchange or in person through LocalBitcoins or the like.    If you do buy, don't store it on an exchange, run a wallet on your computer such as Electrum, or better yet buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.

Do you realise that bitcoin is an open source project and github is a real website that anyone can check?   You can go and look at the fix and when it was merged right now if you want to.   Do you also realise (and you probably don't if you follow bcash or 2x) that these things need to be tested, and testing takes people and time?   I'm sure you'd be one of the first to cry foul if a quick merge and release resulted in you losing all your money.

Right ok, I'll take another look over the weekend to see if I can tighten it up a bit.  It's possible the options are a little different at the start before you have anything set up, so I might have to try and create a new account to see what it looks like fresh.
Leave it with me.
EDIT:   Ah, I see at least one thing I missed.  When you mention the list of options such as "Billing", "APIs", "App Engine", "Compute Engine" you want to select Compute Engine.  Once in there you should hopefully see the list I'm talking about (VM Instances will be at the top).


Ok, 200GB is fine (might cost a little more daily but whatever).   Centos is a type of Linux distribution.   That'll be fine, but I'm only really familiar with Debian/Ubuntu, and while they'll be similar, a lot of the instructions out there generally use Debian as it's a bit more mainstream.


To find that, when you have your VM up and running and you're in the VM Instances page (you should see your VM with a green tick (if it's running), the name (mine defaulted to instance-1), the Zone (central US or whatever), etc.   The name (instance-1 in my case) should be a link.  If you click that it'll take you into VM Instance Details, and if you scroll down you should see a small bold heading of Network Interfaces where the word "default" is also a link you can click to see the Firewall rules.

It's my preference that we ignore each other and just go our separate ways to be honest.  I'm more than happy for it to be a pleasant interaction when we do interact, and I think this sub at least is finding it a bit easier to "let go" (in that we don't spend too much time talking about them anymore), but they have a bit of a way to go to relax about the whole situation.   I've stopped visiting recently as there's only so much "front page filled with vitriol about core and this sub" that I can take.   Once that stops, and they start actually discussing their own coin rather than how bad everyone else is, I'll consider popping back.
TL;DR, amicable split is fine by me.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:53:34
Well said, completely agree on all points.
Personally I wouldn't touch 2x purely because it's not supported enough (one or two developers for a project this scale is lunacy), and I assume the majority of its supporters aren't technically minded otherwise they'd agree (it's an objective fact).
So that's my main reason, and it's a huge one, but I also completely agree with everything else you listed.  I don't recognise the authority of these people and they have no say in how Bitcoin should work as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:28:44


Replay protection solves a different issue.  It basically makes it safer to transact.  Without replay protection you run the risk of spending coins on both chains when you only intended to spend one, basically.


No, again that's a different kettle of fish altogether.    When markasoftware posted saying that "Bitcoin Core 0.15 was hostile", he's referring to a patch that was introduced that would block 2x nodes from connecting to core nodes ahead of time (ahead of the fork).  Without this, my scenario above would occur (the few existing 2x nodes would be searching the network for other 2x nodes, but running into the many many core nodes that exist instead.  They'd attempt to connect to the core nodes, and be rejected, and then go off looking for another 2x node, but likely find more core nodes and be rejected from those as well.   This happened with bcash, and people running bcash software had a really hard time trying to connect to peers because of it.)  Blocking them ahead of time saves 2x nodes from attempting to connect to core when the fork happens (they'll only find 2x nodes instead) and saves core nodes from having invalid nodes attempting connections, hence wasting resources with something that's necessary and easily fixed, for both sides.    The 2x types just saw it as an attack as they saw the word "block" and assumed it was a purely negative thing.

It all depends on how they choose to name Bitcoin.  Say you have 50BTC on Coinbase before the fork.  After the fork they decide that B2X is the "real" Bitcoin so they list that as BTC instead.  Suddenly your Bitcoin are now B2X coins (despite the name, it's not Bitcoin if it doesn't have consensus).
Maybe you're perfectly fine with that.  A very large majority are not, and until they clarify how this is all going to work your coins are (and always are regardless) much better off under your own control.

"Lots of places"
"Could you point me to the discussion in case an alternate proposal needs to be suggested"
"An alternate proposal will need LOTS of good reasoning and support and backup and review as we've left it so super late to be able to code anything"
"OK, can you point me to the original discussion where you decided on this current method so I can get up to date?"
"Oh it was lots of 1v1 private chat"

Feel free to share your support of Bitcoin here by posting your own acts of solidarity.
Now is a good time to close such accounts if you were on the fence, as it'll be directly correlated to the Bitcoin.org announcement so it'll be clear to these companies why you're leaving them.

It'll just make running a node more expensive for the average person.  Running a node at the moment can already chew up terabytes of data which is a problem for those with internet caps, or just slow throughout in general).  Bigger blocks will just compound that, and right now it's really not a concern.  Segwit has effectively increased them anyway, and when the time comes (and it probably will) when they need to be bigger, it's just a matter of taking the time to thoroughly code and test a solution, not rush one out haphazardly.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:48:13
Well, it's your money and your decision at the end of the day, but I'd highly recommend that as you're clearly not 100% sure of the outcome, you hold off putting any (more?) money on the line.
I'm someone who believes that B2X has no chance of succeeding, and that if I were to put all my coins into Bitfinex and sell off BT2 it'd be printing free money, but I'm still not willing to risk doing that purely because I don't trust my Bitcoins anywhere else other than in my possession.  
If you have even the slightest doubt that B2X will come out on top, I wouldn't be risking my coins on it.   Up to you at the end of the day though.

I have a node running in google compute, just because I can.  $300 free for 365 days for new signups basically gets you a good few months of a "free" node.

Sorry, crazy day yesterday and typing this stuff on my phone is no fun.   Essentially, it'll turn out just like what happened with bcash. Their (s2x) nodes are so few they're going to be constantly hitting core nodes and being rejected, it'll take them ages to find valid peers. The 0.15 patch that they're doing their best to circumvent would help mitigate the huge waste of resources once the fork is live by rejecting invalid peers straight off the bat (for both 2x and core chains), but you know, duh.

Just to make this even better, could you let us know how much money you've spent on them :)
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:16:02
While it's good that they'll support both chains, Coinbase still haven't clarified what they'll be naming each chain. They could decide to name B2X Bitcoin, then your current balance is suddenly all B2X (or vice versa if you're in the other camp, either way you end up with a coin you don't want). It's not safe to use until they clarify that.

Because heaps of people will be wanting to sell but haven't been able to yet.  Once they get access it'll more than likely be a quick dump at market prices.  The demand just isn't there so there's nothing to hold up the price (unless Roger and Jihan open their wallets again, but Roger now seems to be saying that 2x is the "real Bitcoin" after all so I guess he's abandoned bcash as well.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:41:15


For sure, and I wouldn't really recommend transacting with this node, or any node not under your direct control.   This is handy to fiddle with though.
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:05:25
Honestly I'd just point you to the commits on git and the developer discussion.  It shouldn't take too long to realise that this particular change actually benefits both chains.  It's easy to glance at the wording and assume it's "banning S2X!!!11" but as always there's more to it than that, and it's a net positive for both chains in the end.  It's all at GitHub if you have the time (and inclination, which is usually the problem with people coming in here and making false assumptions.  They can't be bothered finding out for themselves).

No (personally I don't think 2x has much of a hope), but they're refusing to implement replay protection, so there's a chance that if you spend one coin, you'll lose the other one as well.  Not what you want ;)

@_date: 2017-09-30 00:20:04
It's more to do with Roger etc believing that 2x will be the only Bitcoin remaining after the hard fork.  This bet is asking him to put his money where his mouth is.   If he believes that 2x will be the only Bitcoin, then this is a wonderful bet for him.   He's deluded obviously, but you know what they say about a fool and his money.
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:33:37
I'm not sure anyone is worried about these people attacking Bitcoin (with anything other than words and social attacks) as I'm not sure they're capable, it's more about them leeching off the dev work whilst simultaneous banging on about how crap the devs are and how broken Bitcoin is.
It'd be amusing more than anything to just say "ok, you're on your own then, good luck with that" and see how they cope.  Core has no obligation to fix other chains afterall.   They're nice though, and it's open source software, so normally it wouldn't even be a consideration, but it's almost like continuing to offer your next door neighbor use of your power tools while he proceeds to relentlessly kick you in the balls.

Well, you'll get a different answer depending on who and where you ask, but the majority of people in this sub, and basically all of the developers for Bitcoin (the core devs), don't see bcash as a threat or a worry at all.  It lacks developers and support, and the big feature they touted as making it different is a huge bug causing hyperinflation.  However if you were to go into the other sub you'd be told that bcash is the real Bitcoin and will somehow "win" eventually (whether they can provide adequate reasoning for why is another matter).
At the end of the day it's up to you to do your research and decide for yourself, but you can at least rest a little easy that the very large and diverse development team for Bitcoin is very experienced, very good at what they do, and they're not concerned by these attempted coup altcoins, and neither am I.

Posted this in another thread but may as well put it here as well.  You can get a free $300 credit for 365 days if you sign up to Google Compute. More than enough to run a node for several months.
Here's  a basic gist:
*  Sign up to Google Compute if you haven't already, this will give you $300 free credit. 
* Create a VM in the VM Instances tab. Personally I just went with Ubuntu (choose whatever you're comfortable with) and 1 vCPU, 2.25 GB memory. For the disk size I ended up at 180GB, just to give a little breathing room.
* Once created, click on your instance name to open the Details page and scroll down to Network Interfaces. Click on "default" to open VPC network details.
* Click Add Firewall Rule and fill out as per: 
Head back to VM Instances and click on the SSH button to open a terminal to your box.
* You have options now to get Bitcoind happening:
    * You can build from source, which is always recommended, however I found the VM was too weak to handle it so if you wanted to do that you'd have to bump up the specs temporarily otherwise you'll find the build failing midway due to memory.
  * You can just install the PPA repo (this is what I ended up doing) - 
  *  You can run something like the one liner script at  but I haven't looked at what that's actually doing, and you should be cautious of running commands like this for anything, let alone for something like Bitcoin. However if you don't plan on putting any transactions through this node and it's just there to exist (and it's on a remote VM like this), then it's probably not much of a problem.
*  Once installed just start up bitcoind (sudo bitcoind -daemon), or play with some of the flag options if you want to limit bandwidth/prune/etc etc and let it go. It'll take ages (took probably a week to sync for me, but this was before .15 which should be a little quicker, and I'm sure there are way to speed it up that I didn't bother with). Once synced you'll start to see more connections and it'll just purr along on its own.

It only affects regular users (not businesses) that use the core wallet GUI, which likely isn't a huge percentage of people.    Businesses use the CLI, a lot of users use the CLI or just other wallets (Electrum, Trezor etc).    Anyone who really wants a Segwit address in the core wallet can do so right now with a single CLI command.  
Adding it to the GUI isn't a huge priority, and testing takes priority as always (and as it should).

Well said.
Honestly, I just want what's best for Bitcoin.   At the moment, that seems like UASF as this "agreement" from the business types seems way more risky.
If the Core devs were given the task of taking that agreement, stripping out all the crap and pushing out the timelines in a way that made it perfectly safe for everyone, I'd be fine with it.   What I'm not fine with is the other lot saying "it's totally fine, it'll probably be totally fine probably", and pushing for ridiculous, unrealistic timelines around ridiculous, unrealistic rewrites of really well written, really well tested existing code.   
Also it just gives me the shits that these people think they somehow have the right to dictate how Bitcoin works, with shady backdoor agreements that nobody wanted or asked for.  That's against the entire principle of Bitcoin, and honesty they can fuck right off with that.   If it takes the users to show them that Bitcoin can't be "bought" like this, then so be it.

Armory is the way to go.  Offline wallet with a paper backup, then secure it somewhere (safe, lockbox, etc).
