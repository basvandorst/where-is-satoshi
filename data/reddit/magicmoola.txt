I don't agree with the laws and their punishment, but I've never been an ends justify the means kind of person.  I want my government to work, and I don't think I need to abandon it to make that happen.

That doesn't make them good analogies.

You are empowering the very system you disagree with.  It would be funny if it wasn't sad.

What does the government holding coins have to do with the free market?  A truly free market allows anyone to participate, including governments.

You are ultimately correct about that.  But what can be done to serve the sheep when the sheep are sheep by choice?
  
I know that right now many are not sheep by choice, but ideally, we could get to that point.

If you could come up with a less ridiculous example, I might try.  Your example ignores the complicity of its people and the laws they choose and enforce.

He was found guilty by his peers, so no freedom right now.  He does have free will, he's just limited how he can use it.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:59:36
More broken logic.  The coins were acquired while apprehending a suspect and they were evidence in the case precipitating the apprehension.  You can twist it so you sound edgy, but that doesn't make you correct.

He did not lose free will, he lost freedom of movement.  He could have still said no and not agreed to sign over control of the coins.  I think it's funny how the Ulbricht apologists like to gloss over his cooperation.  I think Ulbricht was in this for himself, to get rich, he was not fighting an unjust drug war on our behalf.

Personal responsibility won't always be assumed if people are free to not assume it.  And communities of people acting collectively sounds a lot like another form of governance.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:54:48
Just making sure, because as you can see, you are being down voted in the face of your honesty.  That can create apathy and turn off a lot of people over time.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:51:02
He could have said no but he chose to agree.

To compare rape to property forfeiture **is** ridiculous.

Mine all show up under transactions and mine go back further than 30 days.  They appear to all be there.  I would contact support, this sounds like a problem with your account.

How many signatures for NORML have you collected in your lifetime?  How many drug addicts have you helped get off the street?  What have you done to change the system you do not agree with?  I bet you have done nothing, most people who complain about the system don't actually do anything about it so chances are good that you fall in that category.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:18:23
There was nothing coercive here.  Ulbricht broke the law and the proceeds from that endeavor are now forfeit.  Even before the guilty verdict, he had already given custody to the government to sell off the coins at their discretion.
  
People around here are just trying to push their own agenda by twisting the facts.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:35:28
Silly me!  I forgot that Ross Ulbricht lost all free will when he was arrested.  I believe they will give it back to him at release with the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested.  I hope it still fits.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:05:22
Which is why I chose to say it was a ridiculous and lousy comparison.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:06:06
Try again later when you're smarter.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:29:24
It is sad that this is the "best" comment here.  The coins are forfeit(fact), Ulbricht signed them over to the government to sell at their discretion even before his guilty verdict(fact) and here is being down voted for simply mentioning that fact.  This sub just seems to get worse and worse as time goes on and people try and game it for their own agendas.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:27:16
This is where we disagree.  The government wasn't robbing him.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:21:07
Do you really believe the shit you just wrote?  Because if you do, you need to go back to school and educate yourself.

Government is there to express the will of the people.  The people in the context of the US started out as land owners and later evolved to encompass more and more of the population.  We still aren't there as we have millions of people who live here but have no voice.  Government in its traditional form is antiquated and does not take into consideration modern technology.  But that doesn't mean it can't be fixed or should be abandoned, it just needs to continue to evolve and improve.  It takes the will of the people to make that happen.

I would use characters from different character sets.  Try and avoid latin words.  It doesn't have to be long, but the longer the better.

What a ridiculous comment and a lousy comparison.
