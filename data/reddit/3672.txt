Because segwit activation made it impossible for them to use covert asic boost. Pushing for bcash was a way for  bitmain to become even more monopolistic.
This mistake cost him the golden goose.. but hopefully he learnt what Bitcoin being anti-fragile means! :D

Given the fact that they have a big Bitcoin (dot) com logo on their frontpage, I am wondering whether they will try to sell me bcash instead of Bitcoin.. 
I will never buy anything from them as long as they partner with the scammers!

First of all, stay polite. Who do you think you are to insult me? If you ask for comments on your dumb idea online, be prepared for people to tell you it's dumb.
If you can't resist shouting it aloud online, I'm ready to bet that soon enough you'll be bragging about it while drunk in a bar..
Go ahead and enjoy your lost coins! :)

100% relevant: "hey, this guy claimed online that he REALLY learnt his seed. Let's go punch him until he tells us! :D"
Also: you will forget both the seed and the unnecessary complicated scheme that you came up with to recover it.
1) Buy a hardware wallet
2) store the seed securely (something along the lines of: divide it in pieces stored in different locations)
3) ???
4) PROFIT
If you are really paranoid, follow the glacier protocol (huge overkill)
Otherwise, please go ahead, your lost coins will increase the value of the remaining ones! :D

They actually removed it after it was mentioned on Twitter!
Nice to see that legitimate business distance themselves from bcash.com

Looks great! You should write a tutorial for prior to build their own! :)

Salut Mark,
Thanks for doing this AMA.
While I understand why people who lost money in the colapse are angry, I do want to thank you for helping grow the ecosystem in the early days.
Giving back the remaining btc will earn you a lot of respect from the overall community.
A few questions for you:
1) Back in the days, did you at MtGox had an estimation of the volume of business brought by silk road? 
2) during the silk road trial, Ross's lawyer tried to name you as the DPR. Did that affected you in anyway? Was there any legal repercussions for you? Have you ever had a chance to speak with Ross?
3) what is your opinion on his case?

Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions!
Knowing that an important part of the business most likely came from silk road, did that trigger KYC / AML discussions in and out of MtGox at the time?
