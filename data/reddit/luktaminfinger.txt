You need end-to-end encryption if you are serious, you can do that with any mail provider including gmail.
Don't forget about the hushmail incident.

Centralization is the problem, if Mega makes security good enough they won't be needed and won't make any money. End-to-end distributed is where it's at, Mega itself IS the single point of failure.
But the world is not perfect, I'm sure it will be a great service.

20 digits [0..9] is like 66.44 bits of entropy, if I'm not mistaken. Not safe.

What about power outages?
@_date: 2013-02-15 11:49:49
Anyone have any metrics (computing power and/or time) and can predict when a good chunk of the economy would be affected?
Can client devs handle this by enforcing stronger crypto or increase the address space?

Printer might be saving printouts on it's hdd.

Oh! That (ASCII) would be around 131.4 bits of entropy for 20,
if I'm not mistaken. Very safe.

When you have Alzheimers, you'll be more concerned about "getting home".
Unless: early retirement! :)

Thanks, here's more

Yes, not even govt agencies will bother trying to crack it withing a reasonable time-frame. They might waterboard you though.
But there are other things like your seed for the random number generator being predictable etc.
Maybe use offline diceware with 20 words, tinfoil hat style.

Then why are you arguing?
