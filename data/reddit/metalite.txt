As a bystander, it really feels like a huge change on r/btc after the split. Before, it felt like there were some interesting thought points and argumentation about the direction of bitcoin and I found it a place to read reasonable counter-arguments to what I read here.
But now it really does feel like a cult and it's getting harder to justify why I'm still subscribed. The vitriol is really concerning.

To address the last question, selling fractions - it shouldn't be an issue. Say you put in a sell order for your 0.2536 BTC. If someone puts in a buy order for 1 BTC and your asking price matches or is better, it will be fulfilled, partially filling the 1 BTC order (under most default circumstances.) Heck, in some circumstances, someone else's fractional buy order might partially match your fractional sell order. That portion would be sold off, the remains would still be on the market as an order, and wait until it can be fulfilled. Just thought I'd give a more detailed illustration of how the actual trade process happens.

Just to clarify, when they say "add support" for BCH, this means they're going to allow users to claim their BCH - but they are not saying they will allow trading of BCH alongside the other three assets, correct?

@_date: 2017-08-28 05:52:59
Some people don't want to have a dozen exchange accounts floating around. If you don't mind paying a small fee, you can use [Shapeshift]( to convert your BCH into just about any other coin that you'd like. In Breadwallet, under settings &gt; advanced there is a feature to do a one-time withdraw (send) of BCH you have to a BCH address. You can go to Shapeshift and start a conversion from BCH to X crypto of your choice. Shapeshift will provide you with a deposit address for your BCH. You send your BCH from Breadwallet to that address and Shapeshift will give you the market value - fees of your crypto at the address you specify.

Not sure why people wait, but things like Bitcoin magic number 21 and Litecoin magic number 84 have been useful personal benchmarks for me to setup and plan for via budgeting. So personally, I understand why people like these. That said, I also don't know why someone would wait \- unless they absolutely believe it's going to be cheaper to achieve the magic number in the short\-run. I like the cost\-averaging method to remove my feelings from my plans.

I'm fascinated by the phenomenon of "experience" and how people negotiate their investment decisions based on the kinds of volatility and results they have personally experienced.
There's a new kind of uncertainty in the air right now for new people (BTC or BCH - one victor?) I would imagine the outcome of this isn't going to resolve itself in the near future, but is going to be a patience game where people with more experience ride this out as BTC gets back to focusing on its path forward. 2019 is going to be an interesting year.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:03:39
Sure. Just wondering if in your statement there was an underlying notion that it was somehow disadvantageous to do that. Seemed the seed comment was really just about how to convert from ETH to BTC so the answer to do that, through USD on an exchange like GDAX seemed like a reasonable answer to me.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:11:50
The real art here might be a metaphor for proof of work and human greed. People put in exorbitant amounts of time and money into cracking a code first for individual gains - a non-tangible product result. They squint their eyes and strain over a small pattern, only to neglect beyond the frame of what they're viewing - the things that are important in life.
Disclaimer - just a fun interpretation that doesn't reflect my personal view about crypto, proof of work, etc.

Older people, parents can surprise. I had a similar situation. My parents are quite old, didn't really use or understand computers until they got an iPad in their hands (now both have their own.) They're very conservative in their risk taking, have built up a secure nest egg by working hard and saving lots. So, I didn't think at all that they'd think cryptocurrency was a legitimate thing.
Their take was: 1) it's not for them at this point in life but, 2) one really need to understand it, 3) only invest what one can afford - but it's probably a good idea to have it in one's portfolio, and 4) to think long-term (25 years), aka hold.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:59:53

@_date: 2018-03-18 19:08:45
Heh heh. Yeah, I'm not refuting that it would be very uncommon. ;-) And to be honest, while that'd be nice in our little thought experiment  and ideal dream scenario - a drop that low probably isn't healthy overall so I'm happy with the bears we're having now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:28:58
Something like this would make for an incredibly interesting experiment but one the major hurdles is how do you ensure each individual receives 1 share of the pie, no more no less?
I don't think something like this would be a good currency, but the concept could perhaps be applied to other problems. It's certainly an interesting technical / social challenge.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:55:35
Well, if you believe Bitcoin will eventually rise - the longer you wait the harder it gets. It partly depends on how priority this goal is.
If it's a very high priority, start by thinking about all the stuff you have that you don't need. Sell it. Think about all the things you have that you can downgrade on without affecting the necessities. Do you have a car that is more than you need and you're paying a lease on it? Can you downgrade to an economy car? That's some savings right there. Do you pay for cable TV but could totally be entertained via the internet? Cancel it. Those kinds of decisions add up. May seem drastic for many, but that's why it's about what the individual prioritizes. And note, that I'm talking about the extras. Don't risk your retirement funds, education funds, health, emergency funds, etc. Totally possible to live below your means and be happy. Being smart about your money is different than being a cheapskate.
Second thing would be to budget (related to the first.) Put aside what you can each paycheck that automatically goes to BTC and increment your way up. You'll never know if you'll hit 1BTC with this market. Today, incrementally putting in gets you closer and closer. But if there's another surge - it might get further away. But 1 is just a psychological goal. If you believe it is going to climb, you'll be better off whether you reach it or not.
These are just some strategies assuming you don't have a lot of debt and other types of financial circumstances that might take an even bigger priority. If you need help in terms of learning about these kinds of basic $ strategies, r/personalfinance is a good place to start. Also, r/financialindependence is an interesting thread to see how some people think about money, saving, lifestyle, and future.
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:47:59
Huh. Thanks for that insight. Thinking about what you said, I could see how that could be a very simple reason for many.  I don't really carry around a lot of cash and tend to use electronic money most.
Out of curiosity, do you think Bitcoin ATMs are marketed toward lower income individuals? I'm trying to imagine whether people are really carrying a few hundred dollars (to thousands) via cash and using these machines. Or if the average investments are all sub-hundred? I'd love to see a statistic on the ATM purchasing behaviors.

Yep. I wish more people could understand what it takes to create something like this responsibly. It's not just about the core code and releases, but also about all the discussions going on in Github, the actual code vs. test code that goes into making sure it doesn't have bugs. Some people seem to lose sight of the big picture, and that getting it right requires patience and caution.

Probably because Litecoin doesn't have much drama and is a lot more conservative with its forward plan. People are more excited about flashy new things, rather than less obvious but substantial things. To me, this is how I like it. I think the value of LTC continues to build, utility continues to increase, but it's comfortable in the shadow of BTC, the older brother. It's an interesting bet for people who recognize that.
I don't think the game is going to be dictated by the newest marketing fan-dangled tech blitz. It's about which fundamental qualities and features are most valuable for the problem of trust and/or transfer of value. BTC is still the most advanced in this regard. BTC/LTC as an ecosystem gets this right - and in that subtle difference but collaborative relationship - it's going to become more clear later.

@_date: 2017-09-18 18:38:42
Just my opinion but I'm not a believer that old tech == less value. I don't even think Bitcoin is really *old tech*. It probably has some of the most thoughtful innovations going into it from the brightest minds. The market doesn't need many innovations every few weeks. It needs meaningful innovation that provides value to consumers present and down the road. Currency is something that is an artifact of trust. Time-tested, trusted technology with small but important progressions seems quite relevant. Bitcoin is still king here.
That said, some alts certainly have different value propositions and are working toward those niches. Litecoin for example is one of my favorites and I own both LTC and BTC. Personally, I don't think Litecoin will ever match Bitcoin's market cap and dominance in the crypto world. But where Litecoin is trying to get to is the area of smaller transactions and it provides certain benefits that I think consumers will value. Since most of the attention is on Bitcoin (rightfully) LTC presents an opportunity in my mind for a good ROI. Again, it'll never return like Bitcoin, but if it succeeds in it's smaller niche goals - the same dollar in LTC now might be worth more than if one had placed into BTC. It comes with it's own risks of course. Who knows, maybe everyone decides BTC side-chains is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:07:46
There are most certainly others. Over at r/litecoin someone asked about the community members age and gender. From quick glance, mostly 20s to late 30s, and while men outnumbered women, there was certainly enough to say it's not just a boys club.

You can think of dollar cost averaging as an "all in immediately" idea for most people.
For those who have X amount of income that can be allocated toward BTC, the amount they dollar cost average is the amount they can immediately and completely invest. The next month, after payday they have a new amount they can immediately go all in with.

Heh heh. For me, this kind of echos what we heard at the CFTC/SEC hearing - about certain cryptos having qualities that CFTC/SEC recognize and prefer. Others (eh hem... ICOs...) do not.

Bitcoin or not about Bitcoin, this sort of pattern difference between Engineering vs. Business values and concerns is something that seems all too familiar. I hate generalizing it but the stereotypes aren't baseless either. :-|
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:25:24
Think about it like this. If you think Bitcoin is a long-term investment, do you think the rate of returns would be better than average 7% annual return after 10 years? If yes, you beat the stock market. I'd wager, probably by a large margin.
This applies whether you have $1 or $100 or 1 BTC.
Also, it's a time in market game. Like says, you could dollar-cost-average $25 a week rather than wait to have $100 to throw down. Since crypto moves fast, money in BTC today, if it sees continual growth is better than the same amount later.
Now this assumes you believe in this though. Crypto is volatile and there is still a lot of uncertainty. Maybe tomorrow regulation shuts this whole thing down. While this is unlikely, no one really knows. Despite what many think, "past performance is not indicative of future results." Given that, how much are you willing to put in assuming it might all go to zero? That's the risk/reward part. Best of luck.

Can confirm it's pretty nice. When you do get yours, play with it before you drop large amounts in. I started with a low amount and went through the various functionalities including entering wrong pins and having the device wipe itself, then having to recover from the seed.

Indeed. The parallels are interesting. As humans, we can only learn from past cases we've experienced or analyzed second hand. Like history. That said, history does not always guarantee that the contexts are the same. Sure - we've seen bubbles like tulips. Our understanding of finance is based on the models from the stock market. But is crypto 1:1 the same model or context? It isn't. And that's what makes it both difficult to really get (albeit exciting) unless we're 100 years into the future looking back.
Andreas Antonopoulus had a great video (I think to students) about CERTAIN gains and growth in Bitcoin - and that emphasis was on skills around Bitcoin and Blockchain. Shovels man. ;-)

To be fair though, Bitcoin Banks might be much more reasonable than traditional banks of today. Since people have the option of having their own bank, for Bitcoin Banks to be competitive they have to provide value that competes with the individual's who do their own. At that point, the kind of security or rather, insurance, recourse, that can be provided might be a sensible option even for those who are capable of doing the basics themselves. I could imagine splitting my assets where I control some but also have systems control other parts of my portfolio to distribute various risks. For me, it's not about completely replacing centralized systems but for people to have freedom of choice.

It's really interesting seeing the different kind of people in the crypto space. I'm also a long term value believer so watching the fluctuations up and down are just fascinating from the side-lines.

Interestingly this goes for most things in life. You can regret things but it won't change things. Now if you use regret as a signal to self-assess so you don't repeat the actions that caused regret in the future - that's productive.

Also think that's smart. We all have different limits as to what we can afford to lose. If it's $10, it is what it is. Not controlling your risk and overextending can be as bad as not investing at all.

There is also the timing thing. Buying on coinbase is instant even if you don't have the money in the coinbase account yet. The market price offered is honored at time of purchase even if your payment takes 5 days to get deposited. Useful if you have the money in the bank but think it's better to make the purchase 5 days earlier.
