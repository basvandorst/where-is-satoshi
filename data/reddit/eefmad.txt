One thing that annoys me a lot about things like that (people saying bitcoin exploded and went to shit last april, and that it's gonna happen again), is how short sighted they are. Yes, it rose up to 250. Yes it didn't last.
What you need to realize is that in march it wasn't anywhere near 100, and in february people were dreaming of 50. The truth that those idiots don't realize is that even after the crash of April, bitcoin was still way higher than it ever was, notwithstanding the previous month and a half.

You realize that if we knew that, then we'd all be rich, right? There's a reason it's called speculation. And the speculators right now say that it will go down any minute now.
And some other speculators say that it won't.

Lots of people are just waiting for a drop to buy in.

If you think this is dropping like a rock, you clearly never watched it actually drop like a rock

I'm not really qualified to answer this properly, and someone is gonna likely come and explain. With that said, it would be silly to expect something as (relatively) new as bitcoins to have a stable value right out the barn doors (it wasn't this popular for very long really), when there's new adopters everyday, and old timers that sell their small fortunes here and there. Give it time.

That 650 000$ buy definitely kickstarted this by destroying the 270 wall

This is really inconclusive evidence you have here

Is it just me or this is everyday news by now? I mean damn. How is bitcoin supposed to grow organically when everything is getting hacked.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:11:32
They're just following BTCChina. Or trying.

Yes it is. The 1.5 (which becomes 1.4% after a while) fee is steep, but that's what happen when competition is scarce.
You can trade and even withdraw fiat without verification (unless the amounts are too large) as well. And it never took more than 3 days for me to wire transfer CAD into my bank account.
Be careful however. During the madness of the 900 peak a couple days ago, their trading engine just couldn't handle the traffic, and some people lost money.
EDIT: Also a week or two ago, they took half a business day to update their website, and it was during a pretty busy trading day. A lot of people were not happy with this.

Yeah, good lucydrop publicity that is not deserved after the drama/ripping off/weak tabs/receiving less than ordered/receiving nothing/1 month+ delivery of recent times.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:29
It costs more than localbitcoins. Their spread has been outrageous since the days of 100 bucks a pop.
But yeah, you can buy from there without ID.
EDIT: Actually I've just gone there, and it doesn't seem as bad as it used to be. But still a fleece IMO, can probably hook up for something better on local

You mean like it did yesterday at 22 PM EST? Yeah, okay. Idiot.

Some people need to realize that a scheme where early adopters benefit strongly from growth is not always a fucking ponzi. Jesus Christ.

What's up with China? Usually they are at the forefront of those movements, but right now it's dead quiet. 
I think this might be a good time to sell for daytraders.

In theory you don't even need to leave the western exchanges to get a profit that way. The difficulty is in the execution.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:32
Some people managed it. Hence the small percentage in the title. 
But lots of people got caught between two chairs trying to exchange, most likely yes.

You might think you know the banking system
But you don't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all nice and easy
Yes it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted loans, sick inflation
Well gather 'round children, here's some bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:48:49
In the short term, likewise. BTCChina is quite higher than mtgox right now, which is in turn quite higher than bitstamp. Although the latter is common, the former has shown that mtgox likes to catch up to the chinese.
I mean, BTCChina could go down the drain any second, but maybe it won't.
