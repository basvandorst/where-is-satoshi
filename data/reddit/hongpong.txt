Jelly? Yeah. There's other kinds of coins developing. Could corner namecoin perhaps :)

buttsec later sent me a twitter from account  saying that they fired their PR guy -- having inflated the claims in the pastebin. 
then of course the massive mtgox hack happened, so i think probably buttsec was on the right track but now they're laying low. just a suspicion right now :-P

Maybe it's a joke: as said on twitter by CrackMeIfYouCan KoreLogic 
"I've heard that whole "buttsec' thing is just fake - as a response to the DDoS and brute force attempts."

Anyone who is wondering why the hell OSX is slower with the same cards than Windows, fortunately 10.7 OS X Lion will close the gap dramatically. OpenCL has been fixed up mainly for Final Cut Pro and this is a marvelous consequence apparently!

the twitter is here with interesting claims
Do not just download any mining applications like an idiot. Asking for it? :-P
Why does Mt Gox use GET for login? Just check your address bar and you will see your username and password. Great!
The major Bitcoin exchanges have too many security holes to be in possession of people's money. Use a strong password!
and 22 hours ago - We have landed!

It is more economical to try mining than just leaving it running all day without it - if it works in the long run it would be worth it. Mine and hold :-P
OSX &amp; mac hardware at this point is obviously not a rational choice for new rigs but there are a lot of Macs around with good enough graphics cards to generate at least more than electricity every day.

posted June 14th on pastebin -- they're probably right that the exchange sites have all sorts of vulnerabilities &amp; need to really be checked carefully - the pools too, probably.
Message: Bitcoin exchange sites HACKED
Oh hai. We've gained access to some Bitcoin exchange sites. Obviously this includes Mt Gox, which is currently down. Hm wonder why? 
Here at Buttsec we're fans of Bitcoin, but we must get the message out there that security is sorely lacking on many of the exchange sites! We will speak with some of these sites in the coming days. If your users aren't given answers, expect some information to make it to the public! ;-)
Yours truly, Buttsec

on the other hand, it's really central banking/fractional reserve which is a main driver of the misallocation of resources, as well as misdirecting and misappropriating the wealth and activity of billions of people. Something on the scale of bitcoin is the only thing that can whack a system with that kind of penetration and dominance over all society.
