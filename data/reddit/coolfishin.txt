And this is why we need Bitcoin.  
The decent, supportable standard, a right, as described by the US constitution, is that third parties have no rights of knowledge in our affairs.  This explicitly includes "authority" who may only rightly know our affairs after they get consent from a judge and have proven suspicion of wrongdoing to a reasonable standard.  
They do not have the right.  Rights are not created in law.  Rights are innately part of a human's existence. Laws that define rights are descriptive guidance, merely recognizing rights.  
A law providing third party privilege of knowledge in our affairs is a moral affront and a disgrace.    
I am upvoting you, because you seem to want to have a civil debate.

US Fed Reserve Balance Sheet
I think you are confusing economy and money, not me.  Money is a simple conveyance of value.  Whether a monetary unit changes quantity or value respect to wealth growth is a debate too large and not settled for this forum.  We are unlikely to agree.  A debt based money of course suffers with wealth and productivity gains as the burden of the debt increases with economy.  An asset based money performs oppositely and the increase in wealth is reflected in the asset value.   
Flexible money theory seems to be confused.  Does increasing money supply act as a backstop to banks to save from fractional reserve runs or is it a reflection of wealth growth or is it to stimulate wealth growth? 
These things are ephemeral huge and irrelevant to Bitcoin of course as it is not really representing any sizable economy.
I hope you would not use force to have me use opaque flexible-supply type money.

Ultimately they have already lost.  But they won't just go away.  One does not simply remove the power to print. 
Until open consensus money is not measured in fiat terms, the ability to print unlimited fiat will buy power.  Power to manipulate prices, to create wrenching price volatility, to buy lawmakers, to buy media message, to send men with guns, to create coveting and coercion on whims, to infiltrate, to spy, to deceive and to enact unspeakable horrors. 
No-one yet has defeated the banker mafia.  
We must and we will succeed. We carry the weightless truth of an open source public consensus blockchain that does not seek power.

BIS = Bank of International Settlements
Its members are most of the world's central banks.  It coordinates world monetary policy.
All fiat money is purely notional.  A debf claim on a conjured balance sheet.  All bank credit flows from there.  The Canadian dollar is BIS fiat.  As a whole Canadians are deep in CDN dollar debt.

So I agree that the $300T is unrealistic.  But so is the lower bound of the net of gross derivatives.  In an unruly unwinding as nearly happened in 2008, all bets are off.  A firm makes certain risks.  They have net positions.  They do not hedge perfectly or they would never profit.  So if a derivative bet goes bad, risk becomes realized in a unhedged manner which can fail a firm.  This can have cascading effects and indeed that was a major part of the 2008 failings. The overall damage could be severe. 300T is interesting because it does speak to the gravitas of the market, but yes derivatives largely balance in the overall.
The numbers are not really the problem.  The problem is that when taxpayers guarantee the derivatives as a measure of law, enforced by government, it is a grotesque abuse of power of the large and powerful unto the average person who has no defense. It is not a market, it is not capitalism if the firms can't fail. It is fascism straight up, naked and undiluted.

Highly agreed.  
Bitcoin must happen! Not because it offers some convenience or other. Because it represents a leap forward in ownership of assets.  Because it is apolitical money.  Because it is open uncorrupted honest ethical money. Because it undermines the great evil of central banking.  
An easily transfered, open-ledger money: priceless.
I became aware of Bitcoin after its first spike to $30.  I did not participate because it had fallen to $3 and because there was no economy, nothing to buy. Presently there is hardly a type of  thing that can not be bought and sold with it.  It is not dominant or even prevalent, but the progress is astounding.
The price increase over reasonable periods is astronomical. The systems to exchange fiat, the community, the innovations,  the unique use cases, the ideas, are all exploding.

Its personal.   
My parents were wiped out by 20% interest rates.  Since then I have a keen obsession with the cause of the price of money.  
The short:  There is no real market in the price of money.  It is easily and always manipulated by the institutions charged with producing currency for the benefit of a narrow stakeholder group.  The benefits obtained by this group is theft of purchasing power.  
Owning assets impervious to those manipulation helps but what is really required is a money that is outside of these manipulations.  
I am compelled by the notion of a world where rational ethical conscience and self interest determine what money a person uses.

So the opinion that the quantity of money somehow is a factor in real economy is false.  Real economy is the serving of human needs through a variety of mechanisms.  Money is a mechanism for enabling the value exchange but in itself is purely notional. 
A consumerist approach to economy looks at GDP and sees overall activity as the sine qua non of an economy.  A capitalist approach looks at equity growth and return on investment as being more positive relative measures.  Consumerism likes inflationary money because it compels expenditure of the money. Capitalism wants growth of returns bearing capital.
In regards Bitcoin, the currency itself has not reached supply and demand equilibrium relative to its economy, so inflationary/deflationary, its moot.

We are arguing differences without much distinction.  
I actually prefer the term inflation to be kept to the quantity of the money.  The change in value should be referred to as such.  So I agree with your theory, bitcoin will increase in value should it become more used.  It should then stabilize in value as it reaches supply demand balance.  I disagree that a devaluing currency has a positive effect on economy.  Lets not rehash arguments that wont be solved here.  I understand  the Keynesian position and find it fallacy.
I also do not agree with your argument that government monopoly currency is somehow less imbued with political weight than the notion of a technical protocol that does not require legislation to create money.  That libertarians are attracted to Bitcoin is completely obvious.  As powers of individuals are more fulfilled by culture or technology, it is positive.  If money does not require intervention by governments in order to function, all the better.

It either falls to zero price and it was all just good fun and perhaps a beachhead for something or it has some non-trivial price.  
If it has some price, it has all of its good attributes.  Of course it is circular; without demand from utility the price will be zero, at zero it has no utility. With increasing utility it has higher price.  This is the most important dynamic of the price volatility.   The price comes currently from speculative investment.  These investors are alternately greedy and fearful as the price begets utility begets price.  
Your position is understandable but a bit immature. Yes the ecosystem is very primitive and nothing is guaranteed.  
But the progress is really manifest.

Think about a miner who is in up to his neck but running marginal.  As the price drops he doesn't have a choice.  He has to sell at any price even at a loss to generate cash just to get through the day.  The growth in aggregate hashpower and a longish downtrend in price puts alot of miners into that position.  
A speculator needs deep pockets, large gonads and long horizons to buy into this market.
I think until mining operating margins are negative for long enough to wrench capacity out, this dynamic will continue.  Then the price will rise to a point where capital can enter again but after a delay.  During that period incentives to hold will accelerate shortages and the cycle will start over.  
If you have the cash to waste and the guts, there are some real bargains to be had.

Your view on human nature is the answer.
The US Dollar is a troubled instrument with a poor dilemma.  Sure it will oscillate in value..  Bitcoin's potential will be realized whatever happens to the current system.  Fiat is doomed to a fate like the Bible.  Media, morality, institutions and now money are not controllable any longer.  In some ways it is rather a marvel that a notion like a dollar can actually move people but the means to put value into a notion are monstrously egregious.  Money without a state is no mean feat.  Can humanity exceed the brutality of coercive power?  Is a voluntary money important and desirable? Do we bend to Lawsky?
Every market has a price where supply and demand find some equilibrium.
The confusing thing about money is that the price of money is money.  So we talk about its price as a ratio, interest.
Central banks only control one thing: supply of their own notes.  Zero or suppressed interest rates can only be accomplished by increasing supply.  So until supply increase ceases, interest rates are artificial.
Much of the world carries deep debt.  The US Federal debt alone is $2000 per human on the planet.  The mean asset worth of all humans is $3500.
Too much of the proceeds of debt have gone into non productive assets.  Think suburban sprawl stuffed with crap from China. If interest rates had been determined by markets rather than by central planning, we can be sure that people would have borrowed only to finance enterprise with returns. 
We now face a dark dilemma.  Since the crap from China holds no cash value, we must pay the debt other ways.  
If price suppression of debt continues then the overall size of the debt can grow.  Sounds nice but ultimately it leads to exacerbating accumulation of non producing assets. Suppressed rates destroy capital formation.
The West and indeed Japan and China face an interest rate reckoning.  
We must go through a deep recession.  This is a result of having non productive assets.  Allowing markets to determine interest will lead to sharp increase in rates as risk must be compensated for.  Non productive assets are 100% risk so rates must go higher than some long term stasis. It would/will be brutal.  
The alternative of suppressing rates is worse.  It makes the ultimate recession worse.  And make no mistake, expansion of money supply endlessly will lead to a hyperinflationary depression.  So a brutal recession either way while we build productive capital to overcome the prevailing conditions. 
The Fed is in a unique position as it it controls supply of the world's currency of commerce and reserve.  The world economy can absorb alot more USD than the US could.  This allows some impunity.  It is sort of easy to see the impetus behind so much on the geopolitical scene.  Having economically and strategic geographies part of the USD system keeps value in the USD.
Most world currencies are co-managed. The Euro, the Yen, the CDN, AUS dollars are reflections of the same system.  The Yuan and Ruble are managed independently but they have to play along.  
Most people including most Bitcoiners miss the really important thing about it.  Bitcoin is truthful money.  We know everything about it.  If any changes to its protocol are coming we will know.  
Deceit is expensive.  The trick of any system of deceit is to get benefit while having another party pay. Pointing a gun to get someone else's resources is a good investment.  So is controlling their media inputs. So is monopoly supply of money.  All that is going extinct under its own weight because they are no longer good investments. Happily.

The US banking system is dominated by 6 banks that hold large ownership positions in each other.  Controlling interest in these banks is held by a dozen or so private equity firms whose ownership is invisible but who also own controlling interests in global media and blue chips.  
This is the conglomerate of power in the world.  It is likely to be held by very very narrow interests. 
The most important key to this power is control of monetary authority.   The BIS coordinates global monetary mechanism.  The power of government is a handmaiden to this apparatus.  
Wars, coercion, delusion. These are their tools, so screw Goldman Sachs.  Stop looking for them to give permission.   These are people that we have allowed to have a gruesome power to print money.

Maybe.  JPM as a primary dealer of Treasuries and one of the six banks that controls the Fed, doesn't actually print the money but gets access to as much as they need.
If JPM were to fail the current system worldwide would go with them.  The BIS and Fed won't let that happen and indeed they will add to US base money supply to maintain the status quo.  It is exactly what happened in 2008 and the reason for ZIRP, QEx, Twisf, etc.  
The US dollar base money supply has quadrupled in 5 years.  To save the bankrupt banks. So, yes, a failure of JPM would be salved with money printing.

The article itself is rambling and has some nonsense.  
Bitcoin represents a radical competition to the current system.  Within the Bitcoin system transfer of value is private, quick and very low cost with no third party intervention.  The author speaks of costs and inconveniences which are all attributable to the current system of banks.
Bitcoin is volatile in price.  Small margin transactions and for those that need old school money without risk of that volatility should use third party payment processors whose job it is take on currency risk.
There are those of us that are happy to take returns of 5000% per year in risk of some serious short term volatility.

In Weimar Germany, the central bank's balance sheet expanded enourmously during WW1 to help finance the government's cost of the war.  (Monetary Inflation).  
Consumer prices peaked in 1929 nearly 10 years later with hyperinflation. (Price Inflation).  Price inflation did not show up in the first few years of monetary inflation. 
 As inflation wiped out productivity, the answer was to create wealth for the few with accelerated money printing sacrificing middle class jobs and wealth.  
Populist radicalism ensued.
Price inflation happens with significant delay after monetary inflation. Monetary inflation destroys economies but gives an apparition of growth. Monetary inflation accelerates.

An asset on one party's books must match a liability on another's.  
World debt levels exceed world GDP by many times.  To pay back the debt is not possible. 
Those debts/liabilities show up as matching assets.  The assets, digits on paper and computer screens can not all be made manifest.
If your ledger shows assets in the financial system, it is quite possible you will not see the benefit of them at some point. 
Bitcoin then is an asset diversification that represents risk aversion from banks and governments inevitable failure at conjuring faith.

That is sleight of hand.  The primary dealer banks ( or chartered banks depending on the country) benefit from unlimited cheap M1 type money which they then have enormous advantage from.  They multiply it out 10-30X with reserves of assets of 3 to 10% (most banks are actually insolvent, so reserves are negative) and then lend and invest as they feel.  
Banking then is profitable and powerful.  These benefits do not go to the central bank per se nor to the government but to very narrow private interests.
Monopoly of money makes these privileges grotesque.

Bitcoin is beyond banning.  
Think of it this way.  People can stick you in a cage or put a gun in your face until you say you agree with them blue is red and up is down.  They can not force you to change your thoughts.  They can not force one to change what one holds valuable.  This is more inalienable than a right.  A person needs other persons to fend for rights, even morally objective rights.  A persons thoughts require no consent whatsoever.  
So the value of something can not be banned.  I am free to accept anything I like in an exchange of value.  If you and I agree to settle your debts to me with dollars, fishguts, dogshit or Bitcoin, it is perfectly moral and our right to do so.

The norm as described in the 4th Amendment is that privacy in financial dealings is protected.  
A series of legal and technical work arounds have made the 4th almost moot.  There is no privacy. 
Bitcoin does not escape AML, it merely re-establishes some privacy.  There is no obligation by anyone to give up their privacy rights.  A person is not legally required to identify themselves to transfer value.  Traditional account based finance establishes identity for contract purposes.  Grotesquely this has been twisted by law enforcement that the person has surrendered their 4th Amendment rights.  
Bitcoin lets a person transfer value without surrendering identity.  It does not violate AML.

Admit that you are not smarter than the market. But if you are trying to time this, let the price slide and wait for a strong reversal.  The price is falling against a torrent of great news.  So it wont go up again until the news is good and the fall has been exhausted.
If you think Bitcoin is a revolution that can not be denied (I do), what does the price matter? Buy some ( a third of your budget?) now, with money you can afford to lose and commit to not sell it for 2 or 3 years whatever the price is.  
Temper yourself with knowing that being obsessed makes you vulnerable (ever been obsessed with a love interest?).  
Also Bitcoin is quite corruptible.  If you think the Foundation and the core developers can't be corrupted (and therefore the protocol and therefore the principles, use cases and price), rethink.   Some key people in Bitcoin's governance have promoted principles of non fungibility, non anonymity,  pro regulation, etc.

If one were to ask authority to justify itself, as you propose, they will provide a thousand, mostly specious answers.  
The real question is, "Is some posed regulation - of Bitcoin or otherwise - rightful at all? "
The answer must at least meet the standard of not violating individual rights.  Ease in law enforcement to "follow the money" is nowhere close to a reason to violate rights.  
We have the freedom of conscience such that we can hold bitcoins in high esteem or value.  We have the right of expression to communicate information, ie digital signatures and ptivate keys.  We have the right to choose our association such that we can choose who (and who not!!!) to make party to our transactions.

With respect, forget about inflation and deflation. We are not central bankers. All a currency reaĺly needs to do is transfer value.  All other definitions or purposes are either in support of that end or distantly second to that end.

So there are three ways using fiat supports war.  
Just by using the fiat instrument, one provides value to it.  The issuer then can print more and keep the proceeds and create benefits to the issuer.  War at low interest rates.  Bitcoin is immune to it and using btc takes steam from unfairly issued fiat.
Inflation is a hidden taxation.  Conjoined with the first point above. 
Taxes. Bitcoin and perhaps later zero knowledge coins will not make tax evasion legal, but they will empower the taxpayer.  Most people will follow the law but they will now have a better toolset to move capital and choose the time and place of the measurement for taxation.

Disagree.  
I think of TCP/IP vs hierarchy, MPEG vs hierarchy, open culture vs hierarchical morality.  In all these cases, the will of the powerful was not upheld.
Indeed the pillars of control by the wealthy are down to one major and one minor pillar: banking and spying on private individuals.  These pillars are under serious threat of dissolution. 
Gold is nothing special as money.  Money is really tokens of abstraction useful in settling social obligations. Gold, puka shells, wampum, tallysticks all served as money.  And as you noted, the more abstract and ethereal the better. Fiat if not so brutally corrupted is superior to gold.  
 Bitcoin is better tokens than fiat.  Not counterfeitable, anonymous (compared to banks), frictionless, permissionless, on top of Aristotles elements of money. It doesn't need gold's subjective valuation.  It already has value far in excess of what it needs to act as money.
I think Bitcoin is in the middle of its Kittyhawk moment.  Its flying but it is only going so far.  But a huge success nonetheless.  We are not going to live in another fiat world again, IMO.
The very powerfully wealthy have achieved that status from controlling the central bank and benefiting from printing.   This is illegitimate on many fronts.  
Fiat also requires coercion to maintain value and thus inherently creates resistance.
Fiat is unwieldy when using it over a distance.

It attempts to license conscience, ie perception of value.  It is not morally defensible.   Only specie that is already illegal can be declared wrong to accept.  Bits are not illegal.  A specific ordering of some bits can not be made illegal or encumbered. The license is wrongful.

Not dead but maybe marginal.  
For a large scale miner, what is the marginal dollar cost of  GH/s? Including capital cost allocation? Only operating costs?
Once marginal cost (including capital)  is equal to value of mined coins then they won't add capacity.  Once marginal cost of operation is equal to mined coin value, they will start burning cash and then will eventually be forced to reduce capacity.
Eventually coin price and hashing costs will come into equilibrium with occasional periods of profit and of loss. 
Add in the complication of predicting bitcoin price and predicting capital and operating cost of new silicon, its a difficult business model.  Its also self-referential.  As coin price decreases the need to sell off increases and price decreases.

Easy to write laws, that is...
What kind of government goes after the activities that Bitcoin is made up of?  
The Nakamoto whitepaper, the protocol, the client softwares, the mining algorithms, each of them can be simply a long string of binary digits, a binary number.  What fool tyrant would ban a string of digits? Computation, communication of digits, apps?  
So, we stop calling it Bitcoin, we just scan QR codes.    
How many scenes of local corner store owners murdered by criminal government do you imagine can be afforded? "He was disrupting the economy with evil QR codes."    
Freedom of conscience can not be denied.  No gun or prison can change what you value.  Even death can not.  Holding something as dear (like bitcoin and Bitcoin for some of us) is not merely a right, it is just part of living and thinking.  Therefore, the value of something can not be regulated.  
The sharing of wallet addresses and signing a transaction is a tiny amount of data.  The transactions can be encrypted, so they can be made invisible.  Tiny diatoms of nonsense in a sea of Miley Twircus.

This exactly.  And why owning physical gold still matters.  And that governments have become subservient enforcers of their central banks.
Look at the relative models of BIS banks like the Federal Reserve vs that of crypto.  Secret, arbitrary ledger creating new notes and providing it to commercial banks whose ownership is opaque, enforced by coercive government.  This has resulted in nearly complete transfer of wealth from productive enterprise to financiers, immoral wars of mysterious motivations, mass surveillance, profiteering by the MIC. In short, a massive crime.
Vs open source software, an open recorded non-arbitrary ledger, with purely voluntary participation.
IMO, the weight of the BIS central banks to society and to themselves means they can not compete with distributed consensus asset ledger technology.
Rather than enforced and then violated trust, we now can transmit value without trust required.

Your argument is a product of the culture.  We think that banks and fiat are somehow not just dominant but universal and are the only expression possible.  This is a carefully constructed delusion.  
Red pill blue pill time.  
Saying that the banks can collapse Bitcoin is like saying television won't allow for the idea of the Internet to reach people.  Banks have no power over Bitcoin.  Bitcoin can do everything banks can in a message format as opposed to an identity based account format.  
Marshall Macluhan (do people still talk about him?...) said that a new media can be recognized as new when we see the old media inside of it.  Ie radio and television and print are all better within the Internet.  Bitcoin is a medium.  And perhaps even one that will super envelope the internet itself.  
Banks, central banks, and states will comply with Bitcoin, not vice versa.
Look, the old system is propped up with all manners of deceit and use of force.  An identity based account ledger system with coercion as the prime tool of breathing value into currency is rotten and expensive on base principles.  It will not compete.   
There are no laws or force that can stop Bitcoin.  There is zero inherently evil in Bitcoin.

But people need transaction mediums, equity management, contracts, etc in order to move labour and capital into action.
There will be some form of money. If the BIS sovereign fiat system busts (and it is certainly very stressed), as OP suggests, distributed open-consensus money may well succeed the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
The money, though notional, must have value or it is useless.  If Bitcoin is to play a significant role, its value will increase dramatically.  Hence all the excitement.
I am convinced that the breakthrough of an open consensus asset transfer system is a radical 100X improvement over tax-based, sovereign, arbitrary money.  Not only does it do a better job, it is not trapped in horrible ethics like fiat is.

Walmart ceases to be relevant.  This is what the bankers do with fiat, but we are all still compelled to use fedreserve bucks.

Think about a miner who has financed a big operation based on higher btc price.  Right now they are hurting bad and are burning cash.  They are selling the furniture to stay in the game and selling off btc for whatever they can get.  Mining sell pressure will continue until miners break even.  That won't happen until alot of reduction in capacity which I think happens at a wretchedly low price when they finally can't do it anymore. Businesses can run a long time just recouping operating expenses or even below if they have cash.  Until they cant pay rent on their residence or their financiers pull the plug they will sell at whatever the offer is.

We need a better word for it than just appending an antecedent to centralization.  This keeps us between the goalposts on the pitch of the debate as having central authority or not. Words like voluntarism and anarchy come to mind, but they come with semantic baggage.
The key to decentralization is the first principle that none is superior to another in relations to power, ie, no person can morally own another in any degree.
This drives most people crazy.  As Annie Lennox sorta said some of them want to own you and some of them want to be owned by you.  For everyone else, there's Bitcoin.  I think thats what she said... Centralization is highly cultured.  
Centralization of money is the source of much evil.  Voluntary controls over excess, especially the price of money, would have prevented unaffordable malinvestments into war, excessive social promises, housing and an array of "assets" loaded with risk suppressed by money printing.
Centralization has always been sold as a benefit usually as tribal protection.  
As we move rapidly towards a single tribe planet, much of the benefit dissipates.  Our wars are not about tribes anymore but against abstract notions.  
Imagine there's no centre no one to tend the nukes.  Imagine all the people moving and living and doing what they want.  No borders, no programs, no compulsion to belong to.   So much to live for.  Your reputation based on what you do for others and you as wealthy as you can imagine.
Bitcoin is better with regulation, the kind that comes from wise implementation of rules as built into the protocol. Regulation by informed minds, like those on ŕ/bitcoin.  Skeptics and to la lune atics alike.

So once again, I disagree with you pretty strongly but gonna upvote you because you are making cogent civil arguments.  I actually never downvote even to jerks. Not to imply anything about you! 
Questions then:
1) If there is no philosophy behind Btc (I think there is some evidence that anarchist cypherpunks were indeed trying to solve the problem that Bitcoin solves...that aside), is there philosophy imbued in other monetary and payment systems?
2) What is the philosophy you refer to as bankrupt and how is it so?  
For a reference point. I think value transfer between two parties should be strictly that and should not be political, or enabling of law enforcement, or attached to macro economic or social goals. These things are heavy, clumsy, immoral and corrupting influences.
As another, I have studied Bitcoin obsessively for a year now.  It is not perfect, it is corruptible.  But it is very close to an ideal mechanism for value transfer.  I also think that unless the Bitcoin Foundation completely bends over and submits to "authority", Bitcoin can not be undone.  Even if it is, it will be replace by an even better version.  Any success in quashing Bitcoin will only delay the inevitable day when "trusted authorities" ie banks and governments will not be required in things monetary.  
Lastly, I think that regardless of philosophical inputs, Bitcoin represents an astounding opportunity for vast improvement in human welfare.  I mean this.  There are literally billions of humans whose potential is degraded by 90% or more due to lack of commerce except within their direct physical confines (ie cash).

They are bits.  Therefore they are communication.   Therefore sharing them (your public key to me, my sharing a signed transaction to the blockchain) is not just a right but a protected right. Not just a protected right but one that is impractical to interfere with.  
The difference between any old string of bits and a signed transaction in the blockchain is value.  Value is a inviolable.  Would we tolerate for an instant a license to love who we choose, to laugh at A Midsummer's Night Dream, to be awed by what Science reveals?

In a rational market, sure.  
The larger monetary system is about power.  "Give me the power to issue a nation's currency..."

Losing money in shorts is a tiny price  to pay for a money issuing system that on a whim creates currency in $ T magnitude, if that helps dissolve the threat.

Self serving fantasy thinking by the speaker.  He would neuter bitcoin for a million dollars.  
Government can not openly quash Bitcoin.  None of its component activities can be characterized as criminal.  The burden of enforcement would be enourmously impractical. Deeming a particular specie as banned is a violation of a right so fundamental that we do not need laws to describe it.  What a person feels is valuable is a matter of conscience.  I can accept whatever I want in trade for my services.  
Legislating  conscience is impossible and such an over reach that immediate and complete dismissal of any fool government that tries it is the only proper course. 
This revolution requires no political action.  We don't need force and force can not halt bitcoin.  Only injecting politics into the protocol to serve short term selfish interests like those indicated by the speaker will defeat Bitcoin.
The protocol should do one thing only: transfer value as a message.  If it fails to do so, how many alts will step in?

Quite recently, I was in the same mental space as you, OP.  That is, just speak truth to status quo and truth will prevail.  I have moved on.
BIS banks control the world's wealth.  This is ill-gotten bounty from collusion with the state to control money.  The state uses force to keep the banks money printing monopolies in place.  The enrichment of a tiny few has become the distorted first purpose of government.
You will never be freed by your masters' consent.  
The distributed consensus asset ledger  (currently Bitcoin) ends the government-bank monopoly.  These people had us fight wars for much less.  
The good news is that no-one can enter your head and tell you what you must hold valuable.  No amounts of force can change a thought.  You are free to value Bitcoin.  Because Bitcoin does not process through bank and state, it is impossible practically to enforce bans on it.  
There may be battles lost along the way.  We might even lose Bitcoin.  But the die is cast.  The war is over.

Only speculating but seems to me that the clunky advancements in hashing technology, hash rate deployment and mining reward have contributed to volatility in price. I think the current stability in hash rate and mining marginal costs are a prime reason for price stabilizing.  
I think we are due for a speculative price rise in the coming several months followed by a gold rush followed by a miners consolidation.  Once mining rewards halve once or twice more the effects should ameliorate.

A value of a currency is largely linked to holders' confidence in the currency.  While you are correct, that confidence can be destroyed in different ways, Argentina does it in one way.

The average person gets poor.  Reset, grow wealth for a generation, steal it all again.

The author suffers from moral monetary delusion.  That is to say  he suffers from the common affliction that money has to suit many moral purposes.  These ill suited purposes include surveillance, and smoothing out ups and downs in economic tides.   
A money that serves the singular purpose of transfer of value will be far less clumsy and far less corruptible.  
The author's objections to Bitcoin are that at some societal level Bitcoin would not provide the cumbersome mechanisms that the current system does.  
This is false analogy.  It is like comparing a car and freeways to a jet engine.  Cars have air conditioning and shock absorbers and there are roads to travel on.  Therefore the internal combustion engine is better than the jet engine.   
Surveillance (ie identity) and insurance (ie risk management) can be implemented in systems surrounding Bitcoin.  But as a money and protocol, Bitcoin is just far better than government money.  
Peer to peer, frictionless, non-political, open source, public ledger.  
The author is something of a lost soul, truly believing that money must come as some negotiation within a larger social contract only within the context of groups.  Certainly it can, but this is not a requirement.  He sees Bitcoin as an outsider, an interloper, when it reality it can be used, examined and understood by anybody.  He thinks that only government permission provides viability.

Its sort of a practical matter.  There clearly is no respect for rights by the US government.  Free speech is happening, lots of it, not because of respect by government but because the technology is so indefeasible.  
The technological ability to transact value without a third party snitch will enable free transmission of value, not an appeal to rights.  That said, we must allow our selves to know we are not doing anything wrong in communicating value without the consent of banks and governments.  It is a pefectly human thing to do. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:33:17
Agreed, if the consequence of appreciating or depreciating value follows from the inflating or deflating.  
Ie Bitcoin is appreciating in value (if not recently) even though it is inflating due to more people investing in its potential.  The USD is holding pretty strong despite massive inflating due to the fact of its use in trade.  Inflation does not necessarily lead directly and immediately to depreciation.
Bitcoin in its fundaments is far superior in its theoretical usability, and perhaps in time, its actual use.

Bitcoin represents an existential threat to the pyramid.
This is where we come in.  
It is human conscience to decide what has value.  Ie what we perceive and exchange in value is as important and rightful as who we choose to love.  
Privacy is human dignity.  Third parties, especially those who claim a monopoly on violence have no right of knowledge in our affairs.  This is natural justice and is described in the US 4th Ammendment to the Bill of Rights.
Society only provides for our affairs to be peered into after authorities have proven to judiciary a certain standard of evidence of real wrongdoing.
Do not fear governments in these matters. We are not doing anything wrong. 
And remember Canada is part of 5 eyes.

Bitcoin requires much less trust in third parties. 
However, one might imagine that a highly trusted Bitcoin org (looking at you Bitpay) could print paper denominations that circulate that are certificates of claim NOT paper wallets (perhaps even fractionally reserved) These bills could be redeemed by the holder for actual btc, making the bill then void of further claim. 
I am not sure how this would be accomplished.  I do think it would be extremely valuable.

Most governments in the world have become enforcers for BIS banks.  Taxes, laws, weapons, debt, social programs, etc have become primarily instruments to funnel wealth to the owners of the banks. The debasement of the US Dollar in the past century represents a nearly complete transfer of the fruits of productive society into narrow sets of hands.  This is a crime legally sanctioned by your government.
Consider the obscenity that individuals have no expectation of privacy from government yet they print money with a ledger that is not even audited let alone public.  Why does the NSA not have to give a detailed account of the type of spying they do?
When the IMF speaks of write downs of liabilities consider this.  In our system, every liability has a counter party who is owed an asset.  When the write downs come, it won't be done at the expense of the banks! Ie TARP.  Your TeeVee newsies, your politicians, your spymasters, your courts, your banks, your police will coordinate to write down the liabilities that are the assets of those not in the club. Your bank account, your physical banknotes, your retirement funds, your healthcare, your pensions. The wealthy will give up nothing, just enough to pay the enforcers.
Mass poverty, Detroit writ global, civil unrest. A crisis, they will say.  Great and grand larceny is more like it.  It's happening all around us.
Then after a generation, when America as a free market Republic is a non living memory,  they will ask us to accept a new royalty of special responsibility in a new system.  Clearly the system of Republic is to blame!  And the New World Order will reign.
Bitcoin positive? Bitcoin essential!  IMO Bitcoin is corruptible.  But competition by an array of competing, arising then obsoleting, cryptos is not defeatible.  We just have to keep applying objective moral analysis of each crypto as they arise.
And Bitcoin is by far the best currently and probably for a few years.  To the Moon!

The net exposure is not fully accurate either.  The full effect could be much larger.
An institution failing for any reason might create a sudden realized exposure that may not be balanced between various counterparties.  One or more of said counterparties might also then fail and a whole cascade of assymetrical hedges might come unwound.  This was the key trigger in 2008 with AIG.  
The burden left onto the USG is the losses with potentially zero recourse to recover the offsetting gains by the counterparties holding the winning bets. So overall net industry exposure is not a relevant starting point either.  The whole point of the legislation is to dump losses onto Main Street with the explicit assistance of the US Government.  Nobody is hedging on Joe Q's behalf in this.
Regardless of the value, it is an egregious affront to decency.  There is no longer even a veil of difference between bank and state.  The bankers are private profiteers and they have the taxpayer to fund their increasing wealth and power.
There is a link in the article showing that the net exposure is not the correct way to look at this.

It is a natural right to transact in whatever specie the two involved parties hold as valuable.  
There are no rights for third parties to intervene in or even have knowledge of such transaction.  
Laws that do not uphold these are wrong and should be challenged. 
The purpose of money is to transfer value.  It is wrong,  delusional and ineffective to attach other purposes such as  law enforcement, macroeconomic outcomes or social organization to money protocols.  
Bitcoin, or more generally the distributed-assent asset ledger (aka Blockchain) makes trusted authority unnecessary.  
Bitcoin has strong societal value, it can not be uninvented.  It has deep and wide implications.  It is effective.  It will take the place of many financial systems and is much less expensive.  It can not be banned, or shut down without extreme authoritarian action.  
It will allow any one with a low capacity internet connection to participate economically globally.  It will be a boon to humanity.  
It represents an existential threat to the power structure created by hierarchical money printing.  
It does not require nor can it be defeated by any authority's permission. As with any technology, society ends up shaping to the technology.  It is very rarely the other way round.

This why honest money is so important.  Expansion of money supply does not grow food or put more oil in the ground; the economy really should be thought of as the organization of real inputs and outputs.  With static money supply the economy as measured by dollars would line up with the real economy.
Altering the money supply really only creates distortion in prices temporarily.   And move economic power from some to others.
Bitcoin is worth fighting for.  Competing money types like Bitcoin and gold are good foils to dollar supply changes.

There are many different reasons to be interested in Bitcoin. 
 Philosophical - boundless voluntary money.  
Technical - the radical utility of programmable money. 
Speculative Investing -making wealth.
Bitcoin has the potential to completely reorient the power dynamic of humanity from hierarchical rent seeking cartelism (the failing dominant form today) to meritocratic barrier-free network economy.  It is in the ilk of the printing press, the PC, the Internet and mobile in personal empowerment.  It is at least very worthy of the investment of a little of your time. While Bitcoin itself will probably not survive, that will only be because it is superseded by a more powerful form of voluntary programmable money.
Owning the asset is high risk, high potential.  If Bitcoin fulfills its promise, which is far from certain, the demand for it as a means of exchange will lead to much much higher valuation. Along the way, it is an emotion driven speculation, simultaneously hugely undervalued and hugely overvalued.  The biggest mover of the price is the price so it gets into positive feedback loops.
If any of this resonates  true, you really have to buy a little.  A few days' pay that you wont miss.  Anything less or more is a non-sensical starting point.

Privacy is a very important principle that must be asserted and respected.   The 4th ammendment explicitly prevents a priori fishing into private affairs. Evidence must be provided to a judge in order to follow the money.

Government compulsion provides value to pretty pieces of paper.  Most governments are becoming broke or radical (USA USA USA) as they are losing control.  It is not coincidence that great societies expire with their currencies.
Bitcoin is a radically successful yet flawed experiment.  It simply is the best value transfer mechanism ever invented. It is risky as hell.  But it works!

Privacy is a right that once upon a time governments actually helped defend.  Now they are infringers.  I will defend my right of privacy without permission from you or any George (Carlin, Washington or Burns).

In one swing of his legislative hatchet, Lawsky goes for the rights as described in the 1st and 4th Ammendments for all of the planet.
Phhhhhhht.  His audacity dwarfs his reach. As if any law can enter between two parties willingly and happily exchanging value. 
Clearly the establishment "gets it"as pertains Bitcoin.  The law is again revealing its conglomeration with entrenched power.  It is pathetic treachery that government would more deeply violate its trusts than the growing panoply of NSA, debts, miltary spending, Federal Reserve, NDAA.
It seems no quarters of freedom remain in play in the minds of men like Lawsky.  No minute particle of rights. Thesè are the ways of cowards. Powerful money printing cowards.
No permission is required of them.  Bitcoin and its ilk are made more essential. At least that much is clear.

Agreed.  But forget the harm to Bitcoin. What about the harm to humans generally by ignoring basic rights?  Privacy is foundational to freedoms of conscience, association, and expression.  
This man and his office are already egregiously offside.    
The 4th Ammendment to the US Bill of Rights denies authority rights of knowledge in personal affairs except in the case where its proven to a pretty high standard to a judge that this may be violated and only with a warrant.  
KYC and AML are already transgressions against proper norms.  
Ask him the hard questions.  
"State the case that Bitcoin is causing harm. Stay inside the lines drawn by the 4th Ammendment that says following money can only be done after proving suspicion of wrongdoing and not panopitcon."
"Does your office consider Bitcoin to be money or money substitute?"
"Are you not already in violation of the laws that premise all laws in the US?"   
"Two parties can and will exchange whatever form of value they like, in private (!) What they value is a matter of conscience such as taste and love. Are you prepared to violate that basic human dignity? What harm are they causing by not allowing 'men with guns' into their exchange?"

Bitcoin's size clearly doesn't matter.  Its an existential threat.  
People no longer require "trusted authority" to transfer value.  
The purpose of a bank is to be that "trusted authority."

@_date: 2014-12-22 00:38:05
You are correct as far as this: It is purely a matter of conscience what a person values and is willing to exchange for.  
That is inviolable.  It is more fundamental than a right because it is an internal belief which can not be regulated.  
However anything that has been exchanged is then commerce.  This is where society begins to want a say.  
With third party transactors, there is no choice about participation in regulation.
Bitcoin allows for the choice of participation.  That is its radical value proposition.  
While we live in a system of law, laws are to be respected.  One might however take the opinion that the system of governance has lost some or much legitimacy or even that it represents suffocating dead end for an individual.  In which case, Bitcoin offers hope and a humbling tool against those who would rule.
Out of control liability accumulation, central bank balance sheets run amok, perpetual war, hyper concentration of power, militarization of police, pan-opticon spying, torture, presidential kill lists, suspension of habeus corpus, might inform your thoughts on the legitimacy of the governing.

I think its worse than that even.
On top of wealth transfer, all manners of incentive are distorted.
There is a perverse Keynesian incentive to spend early.  The spender buys before subsequent improvements in quality and price, this should be perceived as a loss to the spender and a gain to the vendor.
This same Keynesian perversion transforms would be investment from moderate means to spending.  Most people start investing by cash savings.    Negative real interest rates make saving not incented and borrowing incented to have "things".  
Decision making at aĺl levels is affected,households buy houses and depreciating assets.  The USA "invests" in war with no immediate fiscal consequence.  It is hard to know what interest rates would be without the expansion of the US Fed Reserve balance sheet, but it would certainly be at a level that would impact the budgeting and  political thinking of the average American.
Wealth transfer is also power transfer.  The private equity firms that control the banks that control the Fed, also control the media and the big industrial firms and the politicians.  The inflating of the money supply is the main tool of the West accelerating away from liberal democracy into fascism. 
The process has passed 'the event horizon'.  Money printing in the West can only accelerate even with interludes of reversal.  The system must now draw in every possible resource, confiscation via inflation, taxation, limits on personal freedom, subverting other countries' resources.  
This is why we are accelerating into brazen outright war and brazen outright deletion of the US constitution.  
If you think expansion of the quantity of dollars by a factor of 4 or 5 in the past few years will lead to 2% per year price increases, better rethink.

I think we will find out the answers to your question.  Bitcoin, or rather, the invention that Bitcoin is the most current instance of, can not be uninvented.  The transfer of value without third party intermediary and without the large weight of government attached to it, is impossible for the current government-bank-policestate to compete against. So I think crypto is here to stay and they will increase in relative importance to whatever status the market forces decide. 
So I think we indeed will see.     
I don't know if all of your ideas in terms of taxes etc, play out.  
The USDollar/Gov/Federal Reserve may become one of many communities which by its nature of non-voluntary participation will be increasingly resisted, evaded and diminished.  I think the USDollar value and interest rates situation is going to happen anyway.  Thankfully there are good outlets for savers in gold and Bitcoin.  
The debts of the US will not be easy to pay off.  The holders of those debts are no fools and the controllers of the USD supply are substantial holders of those assets.  They own the game.  They wont let you off easy one way or the other.  They will either increase the value of the denomination with interest rates, or they will increase the size of the debt relative to your wage.  
At one point I think it comes down to the people asserting their power. Whatever that might have to mean.  You can not expect the government which is now completely conglomerated with private interests to do anything but coerce happiness from the average dude into the pockets of those private interests without some major coercion of your own.  I think it is self defense by the way.  
I think derivatives of Bitcoin are already showing up, see the Second Market and Fortress funds.  These will be tradeable securities in funds that own Bitcoin.  Loans denominated in the same security or currency hold no denomination risk within that security.  Ie a loan in Bitcoin to be paid back in Bitcoin with Bitcoin denominated interest has no risk vis a vis Bitcoin.  Its just that there are probably zero enterprises (yet!!!) that are operated solely in that currency, so the predictability of the business model is too poor to risk the venture.  
As more goods and services and customers become available in Bitcoin, enterprises can do accounting, modelling and financing in Bitcoin.  Financing will be desired and reasonable in Bitcoin denomination.  
I think by the time Bitcoin is 2% of the US economy, say, the USD lending system will by definition still be in place, but the Bitcoin finance ecosystem will be pretty sound by that size with real world interest rates.  It wont be like a light switch or something. The systems will coexist.    
But not too long after that point (if, if, if, assumption, caveat, please please please blah blah...) the USD banking system will not be able to compete.  I think the recognizable tipping point will be long after the point of no return, which, perhaps we are already at now....  
Then, then I sell my investment BTC.  Two orbits around the moon, past Mars and right to the Sun!

You presented a strawman argument:  that if someone objects to the ownership of a central bank by government, then that person must then think government must have no power at all.  That is a wild silly and specious strawman.
Governments impose a monopoly on currency use.  Central banks issue this one currency at their discretion.  This enters the system through very low cost loans to chartered banks.  The profits to the central bank is minimal.  The chartered banks essentially have all of the benefits of the ability to create currency. So while it is not at their discretion, they have no limits to access it.  Even when, as we have witnessed, they go bankrupt, the central bank simply provides more even lower cost loans.   They get much base money for close to free.  They then fractionally reserve multiply this into loans and investments.  Because the returns on these are higher and they are multiplied, bank margins are greatly in excess of central bank earnings.  
If there were competing currencies and the currency issuers were permitted to fail then the market would take care of malfeasance in the long term. It is the monopoly of the currency that creates the power and profits of the banks.
Because all of: the currency, the central bank and primary dealers/charter banks are highly protected, great excess can grow.  Limiting this excess was the purpose of Glass-Steagall.  Banks that simply loan have a special relationship with money the central bank and government.
As it pertains to Bitcoin, none of this debate matters.  
You and I or anyone else debating this is not going to change the nature of a deeply embedded power structure.  We each think the other deluded.  At least I can accept your perspective with respect (try it!)
But here is the thing.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing the banking system does has anything to do with Bitcoin.  Neither system relates to the other.  One relies on the tools of government and the other is voluntary.  One is borderless and one is domain constrained.  One has a single transparent ledger and the other has countless opaque ledgers. One is cloaked in a system of faith in law of language and people.  The other is a simple logical protocol.
I know which one I prefer.  I won't do anything to prevent you from using whichever you like.  And in fact I use both.

While not as fungible, people believe all of their fiat-denominated assets to be truly valued as published on their monthly statement.  Credit derivative dollars are perceived to be dollars. This is a critical artefact of a fiat to fractional reserve to derivative system.  We do not differentiate between them and completely forget faith in even base money is faith in central banks and the aircraft carriers that their puppets use to control real economy.  Grandma thinks her money market fund or mortgage backed security fund is as good as gold.  
One ledger's asset is another's liability.  The paper assets of the world (ie debt) are 170 times world annual GDP.  You could take 100% of profits from economic activity say at 10% profitability for 1700 years and just pay off grandma's assets.  
In other words,  its fucked.  Banks, fiat, central banks, assets on paper, all must die.  Its just a mathematical reality.  Assets based on liabilities are doomed. Assets based on physics (gold) and maybe math (bitcoin), will survive.
An open ledger system differentiates between a bitcoin and a derivative.  A paper claim on a bitcoin is not on the blockchain.  A bitcoin always is.   
Therefore bitcoin will have value for real world resources even when fiat and fiat based instruments do not.  So fungibility of fiat accounts is irrelevant in the long run.

This would indicate that the buyers were unconscious dupes of the pumpers.  Ludicrous.  Both parties made rational decisions at the time based on their own minds.  I am helping people right now to learn how to protect their upcoming investments in bitcoin that will pay pretty much whatever ask price is at the time.  This mentality is rational based on them wanting to participate and shows itself clearly when price rises reinforce price rises (and drops reinforce drops).  Yes btc price is largely speculative, but that is because its fundamentals and acceptance indicate a bright future. 
Bitcoin simply is the best value transfer mechanism ever invented. Better than gold, better than cash, better than banks.   Altcoins with superior technical attributes don't cut it because they don't have the network effect.    
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:54:45
Is it the best?  I hope so but that is unproven.  
In the Szabo paper linked below here and in the thread linked by OP, Szabo shows a number of evolutions.   Money evolved in its refinement from art to fiat along with societies.  The ability of humans to produce art and accept abstract tokenization of social favours are key aspects of money.  Tribal binding including internally and externally prosecuted violence are part of the social milieu of money.
Bitcoin is art but its esthetic is not readily accessible to most people.  Bitcoin did not evolve from a social construct.  Bitcoin is a pure abstraction that is designed with monetary properties.  It has the best form but it has no coherent attachment viscerally or socially. It did not evolve from a tribal nation. It has no ability or pretense for welfare or warfare.  
That says to me that it is important to support Bitcoin for its higher intellectual attractions rather than its utility.  It needs community first and foremost.  A community without borders, without political hierarchy, with rules but not rulers is a natural latent and increasingly manifest one.  
Bitcoin would benefit from a visceral esthetic for lay people.  Even paper cash does that.   
Can money exist without force of violence? "Why are these pierced clamshells money?" "Because the chief says so, now stop asking questions and fit in."

It is perfectly fine to talk of inflation in two ways, money supply inflation and price inflation.  It is also fine to understand that price inflation happens differently in different markets in different timelines.

I meant that there is a difference in the power distribution of the wealth gap that is created by fiat and that created by Bitcoin.
The current distribution of bitcoin is top heavy for sure.  But holding bitcoin does nothing for the holder.  They have to spend them or perhaps risk them as collateral to gain benefit. 
The operators of the fiat system have the power to give themselves the lion's share of the wealth from the fiat system in perpetuity.   They create new money at their whim.  Spending it does not diminish this power.  They literally have the monopoly license to print money. Literally.

I would like to hear him say what he feels about these things.

Mr Lawsky, what is the clear and present harm in Bitcoin relative to the tips of the iceberg malfeasance that we know of already on Wall Street?  
Polite, sure.  Same respect he offers us as humans...., I will remove the f key from my keyboard.  
The issuance of money is the key power that allows for fiscal incompetence, deficit budgets loaded with military expense, the lack of political scrutiny that would develop with an economy that had to pay the real costs of money.  
In other words, Americans have deferred the economic price and therefore political price of their horrific arsenal, mass murder in wars no-one else wanted, dirty bombs, coups and civil wars, mass malfeasance in the financial world through money printing and no accountability to any wrongdoing.    
The issuance of money is the core.  That's why Bitcoin matters. His job is to help squash it.  He is police and he is trained to be nice, but he knows his job.  
He's gonna give us blah money laundering, blah, terrorism, blah narcoterrorism (has a certain evil ring to it).

The terminology would change.  The current terminology does not delineate a base monetary dollar (ie. Federal Reserve Notes) from derivatives of same.  Indeed a base monetary dollar is in itself credit and not money.  Derivative dollars created by bank credit expansion  (fractional reserve lending) are still called dollars.  
A bitcoin is an asset.  It is unforgeable, absolutely unique and recognizable on the Bitcoin network.  There is no confusing the asset, which is specified uniquely on the blockchain, with a credit claim against that same asset.  The keeper of the private key has signing authority over its transfer.  A party with some legal claim to the asset has a derivative credit.  The two concepts are distinct in Bitcoin.

The chart tells me that hashrate/difficulty is in a springy leading/lagging relationship with price. 
Overall price seems to be rising. Rising price draws in hashing capacity, which then drives miners into marginality (like OP).  Marginally operating miners sell btc to stay afloat and like any business will even operate below marginality for cash for awhile, suppressing prices..  Hashrate stabilizes as inefficient operations drop off. Sell pressure subsides, price stabilize and eventually other factors play into price and it increases.  The delays by miners entering only after prices increase and exiting only after they decrease creates periods of positive feedback in both upward and downward periods. That btc investors are emotional, reinforces the sensitivity of the trends.
The cycles are becoming longer but no less drastic.  
Currently hashrate is above the joint trendline so prices are in a suppressed state.  
Very bullish once this stabilizes and very very bullish as rewards decline. As hashrate exceeds by a wide margin the joint trendline with price, the price will be down pressured for some time.

Gold is money in aĺl history and all human contexts.  JP Morgan stated that only gold is money.  Other physical things have served the purpose of money but none so well as gold.  I like gold and own it.  But it is so because it is the best tokenization or abstract representation of real value.  Real value is exchanged between people.  
Fiat would be better than gold but it requires trust in an authority that is horribly untrustworthy.
Bitcoin is better than either.  It is better abstraction than either and does not require trust in authority. It would suffer from an artificial attachment to gold.
Regards the 51% attack.  This is not much to worry about.  An attack of that nature would not be subtle.  It would be obvious.  When it happened the invalid blockchain created by it would simply create a new fork in the blockchain that would be ignored starting 10 minutes later.  The valid blockchain would be manually reverted to a known good instance, backing out all transactions to that point.  Some double spends would happen, a minor theft really compared to the investment put in to create the attack. As the value of transactions increase the value of the tokens (btc) increases and the cost of the hashing power required to perform the attack increases.  I am not sure if it all that is linearly proportional but it is definitely clearly aligned.  So the incentive is less than you say.  It does not destroy the blockchain. 
Edit: I think a crypto redeemable in gold has real appeal, but unless the physical presence of the gold is verifiable without trust, I dont see how it would work.

People believe in its underlying properties and ecosystem.
A nation breathes value into its currency through several mechanisms.  Legal tender law while not excluding other monies makes a widespread and common market  Having to remit taxes in government currency ensures constant demand.  Then there is lots of symbolism and culture icon attached.  Fiat carries alot of burden: bail out when the fractional reserve system fails, inflation management, "stimulus", etc.  It is also corrupt absolutely.  The power to effortlessly create instruments that have value is a temptation of power for politicians and wealth for bankers.  They have indulged themselves deeply.
Bitcoin has little of that.  
Bitcoin's  cultural appeal is that it is apolitical.  Ie it is not attached to any mechanisms of governance outside its own.  All we expect it to do is transfer value.  So for many of us that is very attractive, to not support vast QE, not finance deeply indebted warring superpowers through suppressed interest rates, So Bitcoin has cultural symbolic draw and quite a bit of mind space.
The most important thing about it, its most radical radical addition to human ingenuity is that the instrument itself, bitcoins, is a non forgeable digital artefact.  It can be moved with the ease of a text message but perfectly unforgeable.
Its bedrock free market value is from those of us that value its technical parameters and non governmental association. It also has use value, an ecosystem  and speculative worth.
The fact that it has a price is a spectacular  success. People believe it has value.

Human organization is nothing if not constructed of hierarchical middlemen. The barriers between any two parties is immensely expensive and unfair.  9% of world GDP is consumed by banks to provide banking services to a minority of the world's people.

Although this is wordy and self-aggrandizing, the main points are valid.  
It is indeed something of a belief that breathes value into money.  The Bitcoin protocol seems to work pretty flawlessly and provides roughly OK incentives.  But it is only the overall willingness to part with other wealth proxies  ($) that give it value.  And that is indeed why alot of naysayers go after this belief.

A voluntary-participation, unforgeable, electronic commodity with minimal barrier to entry.  
Being voluntary means it is not encumbered with the folly and harm of the power dynamic of the  nation state.  Much of the purpose of a taxation empowered debt based currency is to imbue power.  And vice versa.  This leads to all manners of political corruption and malfeasance.  The most damaging aspect is the violence and dishonesty that this structure requires. Every day America is served up its soul deep fried. CIA torture revelations, declarations of war on Russia, judges supporting NSA, Afghan opium war, Syrian geopolitical war, militarized and unaccountable policing.  Served with a little Its Good For You Sauce, Americans eat it up.  This only happens with deep propaganda, and stupidifying of people. This is all about power projection, which is completely inseparable from the USD.
Unforgeable money (and other crypto assets) greatly increases accessibility and efficiency.  Double entry ledgers kept privately require sophisticated audit and regulation which still fail.  This leads to high barriers to entry and enourmous expense.  A public ledger accessed via control of a key is radically not in need of gatekeeping and audit.  The ability for an entrepreneur with income of, say, $3000 p.a. to enter into transactions globally or to create a crypto-funded project with smart contract payout without need of identity or audit or authorization...
This opens up unprecedented opportunity for humanity.  It is nearly diametric to the dominant worldview probably best illustrated by the Eurozone and the Mastercard propagandist.  The world of forced "benefits" and every transaction visible to and requiring approval of "authority" can not survive the ad hoc, zero permission  world.  Propaganda will be seen correctly as advertising by the cult that asks for full submission.

Lets replace the banks and governments, firstly to the point that they are immoral, second to the point that they are unnecessary.  
The ability to transfer wealth relatively conveniently, ie.banks, is a mainstay of civilization.  A few people in control of money supply is a moral abomination, which compares to slavery.
Distributed consensus asset ledger and transfer (like Bitcoin) is a far superior wealth transfer mechanism.  It is not only efficient, it decouples banks and state.  The welding of bank and state has clearly left the banks in charge.  It has transferred the productive wealth of the planet to very narrow hands.

Central banking is a deeply immoral enterprise.  It is a mechanism used by the people who control the central bank to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone not required to continue the operation. This is a global enterprise coordinated by the BIS. The US Federal Reserve is the keystone central bank of BIS.  This is an open and obvious mechanism.
The Federal Reserve owns nothing on net.  It has a balance sheet that must net zero (while not marking to market).  It has a unique privilege of creating credit notes (Federal Reserve Notes) which are base money.  Legal tender law and income tax law cause their notes to become the de facto standard for currency. FRNs are referred to as dollars but they are not.  The dollar has a constitutionally defined correlation to gold.  FRNs are also called "money" almost exclusively.  They are money but so is anything that is used as money, gold, silver and bitcoin are also money.
The Fed increases its balance sheet on a whim.  It has the power to create FRNs (which are liabilities to the Fed) as long as it creates assets at tbe same time.  Nice work if you can get it.
The FRNs make their way onto the market through primary dealers which happen to be the big banks.  The big banks also decide who works for the Fed other than the coronation of the Chair by the POTUS.  The big banks control and benefit from the business of the Fed.  The benefits flow not really so much into shareholder value but from who benefits from the various bank activities. 
FRNs, commonly "dollars" run the economy.  The government needs dollars to move economic actors just as any other entity does.  Politicians, being the creatures they are, have made the business of expanding the FRN base well entrenched.  The Fed never hesitates to expand money supply for the government to spend today what they fear to tax or at least borrow fairly.
Everything has a supply-demand price.  The price of money is money, interest to compensate for risk.  Zero % interest is a severe market manipulation that is accomplished by increasing supply of money.  The BIS financial world is at 0% for several years.  In order to maintain 0% once money supply has expanded an even greater amount of supply must be created.  
Thus the parabolic increase in the balance sheet of the Fed.  
Price inflation follows monetary inflation with significant delay. The actors involved are skilled at maximizing their own benefit.  It does nothing for the government or the banks if everything costs more as soon as the money is created.   So they choose which assets are desirable and hodl them - London and NYC real estate, stocks, which projects buy the most leverage - control of Iraqi oil.
The big flaw in understanding is to buy the nonsense that this is all being done for some higher social good: "stimulation".  How can an arbitrary addition of a pure abstraction move real economy?  It can't! It is ludicrous on its face.  All it can do is change dollar denominated prices. At first selectively, then eventually all prices.  Price inflation has already happened in many asset types.  It will happen in consumer prices eventually.   Weimar Germany expanded its monetary base enourmously in 1914-1918 (a banker's war).  Consumer price inflation only showed up starting in 1922 or so and for the first few years only at about 12%.
The expansion of the money supply is controlled by the owners of big banks for their own benefit.  It is a mechanism of transferring wealth to themselves from the rest of us.  
Remember that the preference of what you receive in return for your resources is a matter of conscience.  You do not have to participate in the FRN system if you prefer to do otherwise.

Congratulations to Andreas. He was at his finest to date.
However, let's not get too excited.  
Canada is a resource rich, high income, esteemed BIS nation.  The Bank of  Canada is legislated beholden to the IMF and World Bank and has a similar relationship to chartered banks as does the Federal Reserve.   Canada follows US interest policy lockstep.  When TARP roĺled out, Canada bought a proportional amount of mortgages even though there was no imminent crisis.  The head of state is still the crown of England.
Canada is a socialist country and is in debt nationally, provinciaĺly and personally to unsustainable levels.  Government control of monetary and fiscal matters is deeply embedded and is a primary projection of power including cultural symbolism in currency.
The Senate will not write the laws. Nor will Andreas.  The elected Parliament will.  Bitcoin will be as disorienting to power as the printing press was to the Catholic Church. Enforcement of all laws is underpinned by controlling and issuing currency.
This was a fine moment for Bitcoin.  We should enjoy it.  It was a civilized afternoon tea before the battle is engaged.

Before there was money, there were obligations within a social construct.  Maybe think lions and wolves.  Social but bound by factors of hierarchy, family, dependence, sex, safety in numbers.  Blunt, but somewhat cohesive.  Trade is a form of extended social obligation.
Commodities, like grain, cattle, etc, became representative tokens of social obligation and interchangeble for other forms of obligation or contract. Because one bushel is sort of like the other.  Gold is the ultimate commodity token because of all of its properties.  
As a bit of an aside, the "definitions of money" are always done post facto.  Ie, when Aristotle defined the proper qualities of money, he didn't make them up, he merely described gold which was already in use.  
Fiat money is actually an advancement in the art of money from gold.  Enforceable value in abstract infinitesmal representation.  Better tokens.  But for obvious reasons, trust must be invested fully in the operator of the press.  This trust is violated every single time.  Almost every press operator in the world is working overtime right now, a horrifying betrayal with the most awful consequences. And it always has to revert to gold. 
Bitcoin advances money.  It is better tokens.  No trust required, identical, zero mass, 100% recognizable, not counterfeitable. Its still an experiment. 
What is dizzying about it, is that it potentially completely  divorces the cohesive social nature of money, from money itself.  Money is the centre pole in a society's circus tent.  Governments just aren't the same without control of money. What does it mean?  Who knows?   
Some implications of this are that the money becomes honest, no more printing to suppress interest rates to get away with outlandish political schemes like false social promises or war.  No more crony capitalism.  Those things just cost too much and the properly accorded interest and taxes, well, they just wouldn't fly politically.
Capitalism makes sense again. An honest yardstick, no inflation taxes, no malinvestment into chasing price increases in assets.  The only profit comes form investing in serving the  fellow human being, consuming the least resource possible.    
World Wars 1 and 2 were really the same war.  Britain, which dominated world trade, was printing money.  This moved the productive energies of the British merchants into the banking class (alot like America today).  British merchants faced what amounted to taxation and did not invest fully in capital.  German merchants with relatively sound money system pre WW1 and for awhile post Weimar, had better products and were beginning to displace British exports, because they re-invested capital into production.  You have to dig deep, but the news at the time was all about this.  Several prominent British politicians including Churchill produced much of this rhetoric.  Britain (and others) literally set out to destroy German mercantilism with a long war that was bookended by two physical wars with a horrible economic war in between.  German hyperinflation was a doomed attempt at inflating away war debts that were crushing Germany.  This is where most people start their understanding.  Hyperinflation, radicalism, scapegoating, horrors, war.  All agreeably bad, but a deeper understanding is required.   
True capitalism wants nothing to do with war-making and mercantilism.  Those are customers and investors, not enemies and financiers.  True capitalism is the production of utility for other people with lowest cost, and therefore profit.  In a financialized, rent seeking, mercantilist, money manipulation system  (like right now!), all the signals a capitalist needs get lost in distortion.  We should have been building cheap servant-drones and cheap quantum computers instead of bombing Iraq and building houses.     
The most exciting thing is when the social obligations attach themselves to the money through voluntary, observable, blockchain-recordable actions.  
I believe in the virtue of distributed capitalism  It is an absolute falsity with provably horrible consequence that centralised money and finance does anything really but enforce the power of those in control.  It is a necessary but ancillary purpose of the system that we actually fulfill human need while doing that.   
It is equally false and horrible that centralized social obligation brokering (politics) does anything but enforce power.  
I think that there is an abundance of humanity in individuals that can be made available with Bitcoin.  As a trite example, a rich Bitcoiner could directly transfer utility in a trivial amount and double the wealth of another human anywhere in the world, their charity recorded forever in the blockchain.  No brokerage or political "fractional reserve" social promises required.

Money heretofore is inherently tribal.  Its not just that people can accept abstractions as money; they also require some social cohesion to the abstraction.  They are only more than mere digital notions because we believe they are.  
Gold is money by tradition.  National fiats have tribal involvement.  Bitcoin springs out of no cultural tradition.   
Bitcoin is orders of magnitude more useful (as long as it has a non trivial price) than gold or fiat.  It has better memory, better unit of account, enforcement of ownership is a private key not identity, highly transportable....
But without a cultural bridge, is it merely a notional abstraction?   Without an historical bridge from artefact (clams, gold...) and without a tribe, can it create sufficient cultural cohesion such that it maintains value?
Is that perhaps what will really make it real?  An easy to attach to visceral cultural iconism as opposed to high utility.

It is inflation of the supply, yes.  Monetary inflation.  It correlates to price inflation with a delay.  It only does not lead to price inflation if the supply is deflated which corresponds to higher interest.  Note that a 0.25% return for a 0% loan is a mild deflation of money supply.  So the deposits while held in check at the Fed are not contributing to money supply inflation.

I am not referring to paper wallet.  I am referring to a printed certificate which entitles the bearer ability to redeem it for bitcoin.  
A note denominated  in btc, say, a 20 mbtc note.  It would need high quality non counterfeit features.  The holder cashes this note by giving it up physically to the issuer who then transfers 20mbtc to an address supplied by the holder.  
The issuer can publish all of the notes' serial numbers and prove reserves for all of them.  Anyone can check to see if the note they hold is on the list.  Public addresses for this might not be advised.
These notes might become trusted and circulate.  Its a project for a billionaire.

Technical workarounds (think NSA) and legal workarounds (that banks must KYC and report) have basically made for zero financial privacy.  That does not make it a moral norm, nor does it reduce that financial privacy is a right.  It just makes defending that right very impractical. Remember that the Amendments are not the creators of rights, they are descriptive of rights that are inborn and inalienable.  The purpose of the Amendments is to be used to limit lawmakers from transgressing inborn rights.  Lawmakers have already breached this moral defense in roundabout fashion.  There is an assumption that by providing your identification to a bank that you have surrendered your 4th Amendment rights.  
 
Now along comes Bitcoin and other meta and altcoins, that can create high bars of privacy quite easily. Note that nothing of the fundemental activities in Bitcoin is wrongful, protocol, software, computation, communicating, value transmission.... nothing wrong or illegal.  Neither is privacy.
   
Your assertion that privacy enables some bad behaviour is quite frankly backwards thinking.  The value of privacy is far greater than the threat.  
The value of expressing or transmitting value from one party to another in private is as fundamentally an act of conscience as expressing love.  We have the right to conscience.  
It is not your right or obligation to make law enforcement easy.

I own btc.  I verify that on a blockchain.  Any derivative not verifiable on a blockchain, I trust less.  I expect a risk return for non blockchain derivatives.
Conversely if one were to offer securities with blockchain verifiability, one would also expect a better profit.  
Ergo, blockchain verifiable derivatives, being honest derivatives will succeed where derivatives whose ownership requires court proceedings will whither.

Not for lack of trying.   Your point is a bit circular.  Hyperinflation comes from an (eventual!) loss of faith, and it lags monetary expansion.  As long as expectations are of low inflation, market perversions like QE and zero interest can happen with some impunity.
All that can be said of your comment is that 4X expansion of base money did nothing.  40 year low in labour participation rates, falling money velocity, falling house and commodity prices... I feel the need to point out social dislocations and rise of statism/fascism as symptoms.  Monetary inflation did not work to create real economy.  Real economy growth would have had GDP keep pace with money supply. 
Since the quantity of debt increased along with its relative value (as per your graph), debt consolidation will be even more dislocating.  There was no inflating the debt away.  It will either require a depression from debt reneging or a depression through hyperinflation.  
These things are not linear and will go through bizarre convulsions.  In Weimar hyperinflation lagged monetary expansion and then once confidence was lost, exceeded it!  The interim internal economy boomed in Mark terms but decreased in external terms.  Because the USD is involved in 60% of trade, there are no external frames of reference.
I do not think a strong USD is symptomatic of anything but a convulsion.  Until interst rates are determined by markets, there is no standard to judge by.
As it pertains to Bitcoin.  The fact that money supply increase did not lead to inflation speaks to the dislocation of arbitrary money to real economy.

It is rarely audited.  When it is audited, it is full of surprises such as revelations of purchase of distressed assets of foreign banks.  Specific investments are not disclosed immediately except in broad terms. The very notion of purchasing deteriorated assets at face value when there is no other market is dishonest pricing.  
The biggest form of dishonesty is that when the banks go bankrupt, their shareholders have the exclusive privilege of not having their equity wiped and taken over by debt holders.  This is the purpose of the Federal Reserve.  To back up the banks shareholders in perpetuity, regardless of their performance.  Just expand the Fed's balance sheet and voila, the burden of "bad decision"  and malfeasance gets wiped out.  No new blood or thinking gets access to the arrangement.  In 2008/09 if bank equity had been wiped out and bank equity acquired by the USG for later auction, there would have been a large scale turn over of bank owners.  Too big to fail is a scare tactic.  Businesses operate quite fine through restructuring. 
All other businesses' shareholders have to hand over equity in bankruptcy.  It has to be that way or there are no property rights.  Debt holders have to have the least risk because they do not get decision making power like shareholders do.  Debt holders get lower risk and therefore get defined reward.  Shareholders get unlimited upside but must take risk to do so.  This is fundamental and finance would not work without that.  
The existence of the Fed means bank shareholders do not face bankruptcy at any price.

Sure it does.  Monetary policy is the prime vehicle for gaining oligarchical position.  If money was competitive or at least transparent, all of the funny mechanisms of Bitcoin would not be be necessary.  If there were an honest static transparent ledger at the Fed and all subsequent ledgers were honest, there would be no oligarchy and no need for Bitcoin. If access to the base money were as available as a smartphone, no oligarchy of banks would exist. If there were no compulsory monopoly on issuance of currency, institutions that expand supply would have loss of faith.  If faith wasn't falsely derived, an honest media would prevail.

Increasing prices is a symptom of decreasing value of the currency unit which happens due to dividing its unit of account into smaller subdivisions by increasing the quantity of the units in the same economy.

The last time the Fed was audited by Congress in 2011 in a mildly thorough audit which was resisted by the Fed, unreported loans to foreign banks and other central banks were revealed in the order of $16T.   Surprise!  Although Joe Q P,  didn't notice, for a thinking person this is egregiously unethical behaviour. The Fed, whose power to control money is proxied by Congress, fought being audited, trying to defend their secrecy as a matter of protecting the Fed from "political influence."  In other words, they don't want voters to be stirred by their actions.  
Another audit process has been initiated by Congress currently.  It is also being resisted by Her Yellenness.  She doesn't want to be monitored in "real time."  Unlike an open consensus blockchain.  I prefer the latter to money priests in secrecy.
The TARP bailout and subsequent interest suppression (6 years on emergency footing) is an externalization of losses that if any standard similar to other bankruptcies were held,  all of equity in all of the banks would have been wiped out and provided to bondholders and the bailers ( ie taxpayers).  The overall shareholder structure was held.  Bear Stearns equity ended up in the same narrow hands specifically to TARP bailees, JP Morgan.
That central banks play with their monopoly power of money in secret at the world's dominant derivative trading house says:  there are no markets.

They did not.  In fact the opposite is true.  The expecation keeps hyperinflation at bay until it doesn't.  Money is faith based. 
In Weimar, monetary expansion created a small but not proportionate price inflation during the first years.  Then when expectations and faith  turned, price inflation greatly exceeded monetary inflation. Hyperinflation happens from a loss of faith, as a lagging result of monetary expansion.
To be honest, I think one should not back a horse in this race.  Unless one has  the time horizons figured just so, it is easy to get burned.  Until interest rates are determined by markets (no time soon).  As long as the vast majority of trade is conducted in BIS coordinated money (60% by USD alone)  the little guy has to play along.

@_date: 2015-04-18 13:36:10
Circumstantial.   As is the case against admittedly.   There are no accurate accounts of what happened to the Library when Alexandria was sacked.  This in itself should be troubling.  
The Library held the legacies of Aristotle.  It was likely the physical repository of Aristotle's collection and his own works from his Lyceum.  He was the tutor of Alexander for whom Alexandria is named. The city was the seat of Egypt's empire and the museum at Alexandria was a source of knowledge and thus power.  
We do know quite definitely that Caesar was in Alexandria to destroy it in order to capture Egypt in to the Roman Empire.  He used the stone walled Royal quarters of Alexandria as his command garrison.  It is inside these stone walls where the Museum and Library existed.  
Caesar's destruction of Alexandria's power included the destruction of the Egyptian navy and its grain stores.  
We do know that a great loss of knowledge from the Library happened at this same point including some significant amount of Aristotle's own works which have never been recovered. 
The only account of destruction of the Library by accidental fire comes from Plutarch, a biographer of Caesar some many decades after Caesar's death.  Again there is no eyewitness record of this event.   People, including Caesar would have recognized the gravity of the event of capturing Egypt. It beggars belief that the first self declared  emperor of Rome would leave the source of rival power, knowledge, intact.
Caesar was a violent ambitious military man of rather mixed accomplishment.  Achieved on the battlefield, he performed a coup on Rome itself and installed himself as emperor dragging Rome into civil war and extinguishing The Roman Republic.  Intelligent but not wise. Accounts are that his son Caesarion with Cleopatra who would have ruled both Rome and Egypt as one was not his.  He lost the best parts of his conquests, Rome, Alexandria, and Egypt. He lost Rome the Republic, Alexandria as a fount of wisdom, his son as inheritor of all the Mediterranean and his life at the hands of his colleagues.
It is worth noting that the Roman Empire created by the first Caesar did not value new knowledge.  Its history is largely themed with suppression of competing  philosophies and violent persecution of opposing ideas.  Suppression of competing wisdom became central to the Roman Catholic empire.  
Caesar's murder at the hands of a man he treated as a son and their cohorts, is less brutal than symbolic of the failings of Caesar.  History shines a kind eye on Caesar, a violent self promoting man who largely inherited the conquests of Alexander and seeded the end of Rome by being the first in a long succession of ludicrous jerks ruling by avarice and violence.   
One thing we can be universally sure of is that knowledge is sunshine on the infection of tyranny and tyrants know it.  Perhaps a blockchain record of knowledge will provide a more objective history than the one written by the victors.

Ok.  That is probably the best one anyway to discuss our different outlooks.
Obviously there is divergent feelings on Mr. Snowden.  He clearly did something wrong for which he will live his life entirely as a fugitive.  I do not dispute it.  He also did something vastly good.  He did what his government had responsibility to do.  
I have become quite convinced that America as Republic is long gone and that governments  have stopped feeling limited in their disposal of individual rights.  Note that this is an abrogation of duty and an act of aggression by the very agency trusted to sustain rights.  So, the fine notion of government by and of free people is deceased.  My point here is that the idea that the US people have consented to what Snowden revealed is untrue.  Consent of and respect for individuals is no longer part of the process.  If the real possibility of Clinton vs Bush 2016 doesn't tell us that elections are farces, I don't know what will.
So we are being invaded without our consent paid by taxes.  
Snowden's act in revealing this tyrannical situation is a gift of highest proportion and quality.   
These of course are only my opinions and surely you will disagree, which I accept.
But I do assert the right to not be censored by you or a bank or a government of any sort or moral standing.   And there aint nothing you or any cop can do about it.  
You say supporting Snowden is invalid.  I say it is not up to you to decide.

Money is absurd.  The properties we want most from it, esoteric nothingness valued by other people is a bizarre contradiction but it serves a critical purpose.
People who control money have known all along that the trick is to get people to value a pure notion.  Promissory notes for gold receipt, "legal tender", "full faith and credit of the USA."
The best aspect of Bitcoin is that we cherish the coin, the bits of notion, without tricks or fakery or coercion.  It is not the promise of bankers or rulers.  It is specie in a text message.

I think appealing to the average person is not what Bitcoin needs or is all about.  It is a powerful enabler and potentially disruptive precisely because it defies sanction, permission and censorship.  The way forward to widespread use for crypto is by enabling new modes of commerce.  Looking for mainstream usage via improving the status quo is a slow boat to nowhere.  Its like inventing television and then using it to broadcast turning pages in books.

Congratulations on an audacious and important endeavour!
Hooray to all of us!.  Even before watching the vid, the name and brief description had me celebrating.  It is time to realize this inevitability. With your idea and already nearly even prior, we have achieved something precious.  Indestructible, growing, timestamped, record of consensus making, ie culture and objective history.  
One of the primary tools of tyranny is controlling the narrative, the message, the media. Control of history is very powerful.   Did you know that the US government spent many more times investigating MonicaLewinskygate than 9/11?  That the man most charged with the investigation, ordered the destruction of the failure point evidence of the steel structure of the WTC?  You dont know it because powerful people do not want you to.  We have to take their word for it.  
This edifice of power of narrative control is on quicksand with Alexandria!  Control of narrative is vastly weakened. At least the near past history can be objectively  maintained and perhaps some degree of sanitization can be achieved by removing bullshit from deeper history. 
Control of money is one of the last fundamental pillars of tyranny.  I have a hunch how that is going to go. We have had our day at Kittyhawk;  a man can fly and he can transmit value without third person.  And blockchains and open source code last forever.  At the heat death or gravitational collapse, information is preserved.  
Free at last.  Free at last.
The name is perfectly apt.  All we really know about the ancient Library of Alexandria is that it was a treasure destroyed after many attempts by many tyrants.  The control of history prevents us even from knowing who finally succeeded.  Culturcide is important to grow a supplanting monoculture.

I really appreciate when people view goings on in the context of the unfolding of the universe.  I guess its easy to look backwards in cosmological unfolding and see of course the strings had to vibrate in 11 dimensional space in order to create quarks et al, but its a little harder to judge local thermodynamics in their, dare I say, currency.
BTW, design in this context is really not a neutral word.  It opens up the door to "authorities" that "know"  what our purpose is.  You seem to think its more organically unfolding than that, but somehow in this stunningly beautiful and intricately functioning complexity that is so perfect in the general but so specific in its unfolding it seems perhaps not designed but just so so perfect in a way.
I do think intelligence and free will are cosmological forces emerging here, and hopefully many more locales, as undeniable as chemistry.  I also think the trajectory of human history is to unshackle from the nonsense of authority.

So firstly yes, I would prefer to hold btc than a derivative of such.  That said, there still could very well be a market and a price for a FRL claim to btc. 
We can imagine a fund, on a smart contract funded with bitcoin, that has a pool of depositors and borrowers.  10 btc deposits, 50 btc FRL claims.  The price of the FRLs ie what they can actually buy in say capital equipment and labour relative to btc is the price and determines the interest rate.  
Note the inherent honesty.  The whole risk profile is known so no regulation required.  A reputation system on the borrowers improves things more.

So lets do a contract for gold vs bitcoin in say a day or two maturity.
They both seem to be languishing a bit vs USD.  Bitcoin got a boost with the FINRA  announce for BIT. .....  I want to bid bitcoin decreases against gold a small amount in the next couple of days.  Just a small position unleveraged or leveraged with say $20 position just for fun really.  Funded and paid in bitcoin.
Can that be done?  Are you willing to take the other side?  How do we get specific?  How is the data found to resolve ie via Comex, Bitpay??

Its wishful thinking.  
It took me awhile to realize, we probably only need one blockchain.  Let it sink in.  The blockchain whose units have a market price is necessary and sufficient  to underly all other applications.  Private or specific blockchains will have an impossible task to bootstrap.  Why bother really?
With a few tweaks like some tiny permanent annual inflation to pay miners, more divisibility to handle teeny token values, fewer active full nodes perhaps with some federation with reputation, distributing copies of the blockchain Maidsafe-like, and ubercoins and other records of consensus, there just isnt a need for parallel blockchains.  Maybe.
In such a short time even big institutions have already gone from ridiculing to promises to use the blockchain tech to back their federales coins.  
But we already have a blockchain.  Works fine.

Whatever you do to enter, have an exit plan based not on emotion and stick with it.  Bitcoin is very much an emotion driven investment, so beware. As much as you have a plan for this investment, do not make it part of your bigger life plan. It will be zero, 10^5, or somewhere between.
Goes to 1000, what do you do? Hint:  Take your initial investment plus 15% out.
Goes to 10000, what do you do? Hint: Take out more, enough that the rest is moon money.  
Goes to 100?  Sell 50% and avoid total loss. Or buy more.
Goes to 75? Sell out.  Or buy more.
Face that as fascinating and as potential enriching as Bitcoin is, it has proven only that "the horseless carriage" or "manned flight" or "binary math at near lightspeed, the transistor" is possible.  In buying bitcoins you may well be buyinga bunch of Model A Fords.  The instrument may not be the revolution.  That is to say btc may well be valueless.  The revolution is here to stay.

Regards emotion, you already have taken the first easiest most important step.  Knowing that your decisions are inherently emotional.  The next step step is far more difficult.  Understanding our own proclivities and acting against them with intellect and data is not easy.

A Bitcoin bank could very easily perform fractional reserve lending. It would be superior to dollar banks because the fraction ratio would be open and the assets known via the blockchain.  But it comes at a cost, a cost that perhaps a hardier generation will be willing to bear.  No more dreams of free lunch.  The loan instrument would be distinguished from bitcoins.  They would be claims on bitcoins. The ability to create credit would be embedded in smart contracts viability determined by the market, not by regulation.  The full risk model of a credit creation smart contract openly knowable.
Fractional reserve lending is normal and legit.  But if the fund fails, the depositor must bear the loss.  We would see a market with a scale of risk/reward/reserve ratios and risk would be priced by the market.  
Currently risk is priced inaccurately.  Banks that hold 3-10% reserves ( in some cases negative and in all cases dubious asset value)  are pricing loans near zero.  This is a bizarro scene only accomplished by central bank pricing interference.

Inflation of money supply is theft of purchasing power executed against savers and producers (ie the productive part of capitalism)

A) and B) are much irrelevant.
Not only is price volatility inevitable on a path from zero to somewhere (even to zero again), it doesn't interfere with the fundamental ability to transmit value.  All that is really necessary is non trivial price and then it has full utility.  It has that for a few years.  Volatility  is inconvenient and does diminish Bitcoin as money but not fundamentally.
Confirmation of transfer of a bonafide specie (like gold or court enforceable ownership) takes a ton more time than 10 minutes.  XBT are specie, not representations of specie.  Instantaneous credit card acceptance is not a transfer of ownership, it is an acknowledgement of debt collection ability.  Soon enough institutions will arise that do identically the same thing for XBT.  Ie grant credit denominated in XBT and provide instant acknowledgement of the transfer of obligation.

Fiat is a racket requiring the power of government to force value into the instrument.  I marvel that notions can have value and think fiat is useful.  However it is a corrupt monopoly supported by force and with enourmous benefit to a narrow few.  The ability to expand base money and narrowly distribute much of the benefit is the prime cause of wealth mal distribution, is socially corrosive and plain theft.  The John Law episodes alone show that fiat as an institution is malfeasant in its core.  You seem to think otherwise.
Bitcoin is a new type of money.  It is far more than an augmentation to the current system.  It is not some minor innovation like Paypal or even credit cards.  It removes politics and subterfuge from money.  It is a radical change in the definition of money.  Although tiny in use, and certainly far from guaranteed to be successful, its potential is an outright replacement for central banks and chartered banks.  Its native utility and honesty is 100 fold that of fiat central banks.  Use requires no permission. It is a programmable message type in the instrument itself. It has openly defined properties. It serves no political end. The sanctity of its transactions require zero trust faith law or regulation. 
Bitcoin can end the power association of bank and state.  That is as an important step forward as any prior in human liberty.  The array of coercions and incentives required to force faith into fiat is harmful and now unnecessary.  Bitcoin is a peaceful overthrow of the most grotesque corruption in history.  The purpose is to remove forever the marriage of state and bank.
I don't think a lack of understanding on your part should be taken as an insult.

My mom and my teen age children use btc with no understanding of it.
I do see the utility and accept that fiat systems do provide value.  I think the evidence is very compelling that this system has been captured by narrow rent seeking private interests and is thereby deeply corrupt and malfeasant.  Fiat instruments require legal tender law, chartered oligarchical banks, regulation, secure permission etc to instill  faith into value of the instrument.  BTC requires none of that, valuation is completely voluntary and so it is relatively  much more ethical.  
It is also much more powerful in its application.  I can simply sign click a button to update the blockchain to transfer ownership.  Working in a clearing bank, you undoubtedly recognize how radically simple and powerful that is by comparison.
Risk amelioration in the Bitcoin ecosystem is already evolving.  A backstopping central bank does not eliminate failure, it absorbs it and shifts responsibility, the costs ultimately borne by those not taking the risk.  Every person can learn to ameliorate serious risk.
It seems clear to me that banks are self interested.  Same for the players in government.  I think compelling the common person in to their fiat monopoly is a trust that is consistently violated.  Massive expansion of base money supply for the sole and open purpose of maintaining the shareholders of the banks is high crime from a morally objective perspective.  That government colludes and abets in this leaves a person with no alternatives but to abidingly bear the costs of bankers' risk.
While I have an intellectually informed conviction that Bitcoin's technical properties will carry it very far, I am also convinced that it is an ethical improvement.  This ethical aspect is more important than some gain in efficiency.
In your employment, you might have a close up look at the harm caused to average people by cutting Russia from SWIFT and surely you recognize the money rivalry dimension of the open military conflict between Russia and NATO.

We live in a day of attempted deep centralized control.  I have a personal relation who actually states very unequivocally that there is a "necessary" agenda affot to create deep hierarchy in human society, only a few governors in charge of morality, information, law and of course money.

Its doubtful in that, as he states in the interview, he takes very few investment  positions and he has only had two in his career, subprime mortgages and Japan that were extraordinarily compelling. So just based on that Bitcoin is one of tens of thousands of positions he could be developing, its not likely.  
When I watched the video, linked through zerohedge, I thought that indeed Bitcoin might be his next baby.  He describes the same process of fascination that we all go through.  He looks for high high upside, based less on risk but more on his insight versus lack thereof by the larger market, where the market doesn't see massive inflection potential and miscalculates reward, which I think describes Bitcoin highly. He has the mind for it.

You have it backwards.  Interest rates are fixed by supply.  Rates have been severely off market price since at least Volcker.
