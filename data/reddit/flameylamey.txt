No one knows for sure, but it was probably the best tactic for anyone who has bought bitcoin so far. There are plenty of situations over the last year alone that have looked like absolute catastrophic crashes that I'm sure stressed plenty of people out, but if they had just forgotten about it they would've saved themselves a lot of headache.
I have a friend who bought into bitcoin earlier last year at 2k, but ended up selling it around August just because watching the charts all the time and seeing his investment fluctuate so much was stressing him out. He has ended up buying back in at various points and has still made money from each trade, but he would have been a lot better off if he had adopted the "set and forget" strategy.
Similarly, how many people would have mined bitcoin in 2009/2010 for a few cents each, watched it rise to a dollar and cashed out? The people who are the best off are the ones who mined it and forgot about it on an old hard drive, then found it years later.

Maybe not today, but there have been moments over the last month when there was certainly blood in the streets. Like the absolute apocalyptic crash a couple of days before christmas, the sheer panic as people sold while it was in free fall, not believing it would bounce back. 
Then the entire market pulling back a couple of weeks ago on top of that, right as people thought it was on the way back up - with bitcoin dropping below 10k multiple times. There were soo many posts of "Wake up, this isn't just another "dip", this is the bubble bursting!". Morale was definitely at an all time low at some points.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:59:23
Yep, I think that absolute apocalyptic crash right before Christmas has desensitized me to this sort of thing. Now I can wake up in the morning, see bitcoin down 20% and think "oh well".

Haha, nice analogy. It's still very much the same in oldschool runescape today, the version that released in 2013. Can't even count the number of people I knew who got cleaned staking when I was actively playing a couple of years ago.

The fact that the model number begins with ATH... seems oddly appropriate.

Selling bitcoin is as easy as transferring it onto an exchange and clicking to sell at market price. A buyer will be found within seconds and you can transfer your $$$ back into your bank account from there.
But the other outcome (which some are speculating may happen in the future) is that bitcoin becomes so common as a currency that a large portion of the population is using it to buy and sell goods/services. At that point it's no longer something that "needs to be sold" or cashed out - it's a currency in itself.

There's no point sitting here and regretting it, hell, some are speculating that we're still in the "early adopter" phase right now. If you want to get in, get in.
Check out this post from 2010 where someone tries to sell 10k bitcoin for $50, and gets no takers. 
At the bottom of the first page, people start coming back after a couple of years, talking with regret about how they didn't get into bitcoin early, if only they could have known it would explode etc. Followed by the classic comforting post of "even if you had known back then, you probably would've sold after a small gain like everyone else - but you still have every opportunity to get in now" etc.
Know what the price of bitcoin was at the time that post was made? About $5.
Point is, people have been feeling like they've missed the boat for *years* - even when bitcoin's price was a fraction of a percent of what it is now. Numbers are arbitrary when you can buy whatever fraction of a bitcoin you want, all that matters is the % increase over time. If you want to get in now, get in now. It's probably a good time after the recent dip. This time next year, you could be kicking yourself wondering why you didn't get in when bitcoin was "only" $14k.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:57:49
Plus the fact that the entire market is tied to bitcoin at the moment and if bitcoin dips, almost everything dips with it. By owning monero for example, you're not on some safe island watching all this unfold from afar.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:29:22
Pretty much. I feel like the anticipated dip from futures tomorrow has already happened, because people were selling "in anticipation of the dip"... which itself created a dip prematurely. It's a self fulfilling prophecy really. If enough people think they can game the market and "sell before the dip", suddenly the dip is happening right now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:30:36
It broke 9k only 8 days ago.
Funny how our perception of time gets warped in a market that changes this rapidly. It stays relatively stable for a day and suddenly people start wondering if something's wrong, lol

Owners of multiple bitcoins can do this even now though. The number "one bitcoin" at some point just becomes arbitrary terminology like throwing around "one thousand" or "one million". When you can buy any fraction of a bitcoin that you want, there's no need to own one whole bitcoin to be into trading crypto, in the same way that no one needs to own one whole million to be into trading USD.
The percentage rises/drops are all that matter in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:51:03
The market will almost never do what you expect it to do, especially if a lot of people happen to be thinking the same thing.
I suspect a lot of people have been selling today "in anticipation of the upcoming dip". Of course, when everyone thinks this way, all it does it create a dip prematurely. 
So in a sense, if you expect that the best time to buy will be tomorrow, there's a high likelihood there will already have been a massive upswing by then due to others thinking the same thing, trying to time it and getting it wrong.

I think "the owner sold it" is more likely to be the bitcoin.com co-founder (the bcash guy) selling his BTC and the general public being unaware that bitcoin.com isn't even the actual bitcoin site.

It's a shame that many people probably made a decision last night that they'll end up regretting, but I can at least sympathize with them to some extent. When you're in the moment, especially if you just got into this, it can definitely feel like the world is falling. I'm sure many people felt that they were "getting out while they still could".
Personally, I got into this fully prepared for the possibility that I could lose it all, and honestly my life wouldn't change all that much even if I did. So I was pretty calm through the whole thing. But I know how easy it can be to make emotional decisions when a lot is on the line.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:52
Oh, I'm sure plenty of people did.
This market is not for the faint of heart.

Today's all time high is tomorrow's dip.
I was buying over the course of last week at all time highs and wondering if I got in too late and missed the boat. Now if it dropped to that price it would be considered a pretty significant dip.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:28:38
I think it's less of an issue of coordination and more that Bitcoin is the big dog in this market - as things are now, the entire market is tied to BTC.
It doesn't help that that many altcoins are paired to BTC and can only be bought that way, so when Bitcoin's price dips, a lot of alts actually *further* dip their price in terms of satoshis as well, so they're effectively dipping twice.
At the moment, buying into an altcoin doesn't put you on some safe island where you can watch BTC's price action from a safe distance - anything that happens to BTC tends to happen to other cryptos as well.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:53:32
Because you're getting a bunch of short responses that don't really tell you much, I'll get you up to speed: yes, it was at 4k in September at one point, you're remembering that correctly. 
It proceeded to explode over the next couple months before it reached a high of 20k about a week ago. Over the last few days, a bunch of factors set a significant price dip in motion, which eventually gained enough momentum that it set off panic and the price dropped quite rapidly down to a low of around 10.5k at one point. It has since been recovering and is back up to over 15k at the moment.
So yes, it was at around 4k in September, it climbed extremely rapidly to 20k and has now pulled back a bit. It's still up a lot since September though.

Just a misspelling of hold that came from some guy's drunken post in 2013. Ended up becoming a meme of sorts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:55:50
Sure, there are plenty of alts which, in theory, have better technology than bitcoin itself and should operate much better as an actual currency. But bitcoin is the big dog in this market - any time it experiences a significant dip, pretty much all alts go down with it. It doesn't exactly help that many alts can only be bought *with* bitcoin, and when bitcoin drops alts drop even further because their value in satoshis *also* decreases. So they effectively get hit twice.
So the idea that you're safer holding other cryptos is mostly a myth, at least unless the market sees significant changes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:00:33
Keep in mind the mainstream news channels are usually a bit behind with what's happening with bitcoin also. It's very likely that the news of what happened a week ago only just hit them.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:28:49
Dude, what? It's literally a matter of clicking "sell" on an exchange. Sold in the blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:19:07
Whatever dude. Looks like you're not changing your mind.
But your misconceptions about bitcoin are purely psychological. The comment about "I'd feel comfortable for selling for a few BTC but not less than one" is proof of this. The number of units of a currency you own means absolutely nothing. 1000 USD, 1306.60 AUD, 112567 yen, 0.086500 bitcoin, it's all just different ways of writing the same value. If you invested $1000 today and it turned into $10,000 in a year, it wouldn't matter it it was 1 bitcoin or 0.1 or 0.001. It's about the percentage increase.
People have been saying Bitcoin is overpriced since it went from a few cents to a dollar. Then when it reached $10. $100. $1000. I recently found a post from March 2012 full of people talking with regret about how they missed the boat, "if only I could have known it would blow up like it did" etc. When the price of Bitcoin was about $5. I guess people will never stop saying this.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:31:42
It seems that way at first glance but really, the number "one bitcoin" at some point just becomes arbitrary terminology like throwing around "one thousand" or "one million". When you can buy any fraction of a bitcoin that you want, there's no need to own one whole bitcoin to be into trading crypto, in the same way that no one needs to own one whole million to be into trading USD.
The percentage rises/drops are all that matter in the long run when we're talking about an investment.

@_date: 2017-12-28 11:33:44
I think this has more to do with some Aussie banks refusing to co-operate with crypto exchanges than it does with the exchange itself.
Of course they're locking accounts when the banks are doing the equivalent of a charge-back, sometimes after the user has already bought crypto with the money they transferred. There's really no other option unless the exchange plans on just giving away free crypto to its users.
It sucks for any users who have gotten caught up in this exact situation, but it's more the fault of the banks than anything.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:56:43
Just psychological barriers, really. A moment of resistance where no one wants to sell below that magical even number.

There's a very good chance that bitcoin will be worth a lot more than $11k if you hang on to it for a while.
That being said, it's always going to be a risk, and if you aren't familiar with the workings of cryptocurrencies and the process of setting up a wallet, keeping it secure and transferring it to/from exchanges, it might be easier to just accept the cash. Cash is a lot less volatile, at least.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:12:00
Bitcoin is the big dog in this market. Being the original cryptocurrency + being the one receiving mass media attention + people being fascinated with its growth over the years, has basically put it in the position of being the anchor of this entire market.
Sure, there may be other coins out there with better technology which, in theory, are superior, but the reality of the market at the moment is that when bitcoin tanks in price, pretty much everything else goes down with it - most even go down further than that because they can only be bought *with* bitcoin and their value in satoshis decreases on top of the dollar decrease of bitcoin.
Because of this, I can't see anything "overtaking" bitcoin with the current state of the market. That doesn't mean altcoins can't have higher % increases over a period of time though - it happens quite a lot.

I thought about doing this yesterday, let's just say I'm glad I didn't.
Unfortunately none of us know if or when a dip will hit. What if it rises another $1000 and "dips" back to current price?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:55:26
It's more that bitcoin is the anchor of this entire market. If it dips, pretty much all alts dip with it.
As things are right now, investing in alts doesn't put you on some kind of safe island where you're immune to whatever happens to BTC.

I'm just getting in now.
Thing is, people have been wondering whether it's too late for *years*. I recently found a forum post a couple of days ago from March 2012 where people were looking back at 2009 and regretting that they didn't get into it a couple of years ago when they were only worth a few cents, if only they could have known how much it would explode, etc. Followed by comforting replies of "don't worry man, don't beat yourself up over it, there's no way you could have known it would explode like it did" etc.
Know what the price of bitcoin was in March 2012? About $5.
The truth is, no one can really know whether it's a good or bad idea to get in. But historically, it's only continued to rise - every time it's dipped, it just bounces back even stronger.
Some are speculating that we're still in the "early adopter" phase. I guess it just comes down to whether you believe in it long term. If this is really going to catch on and become a revolution in storing/exchanging currency, there's a good chance it's only going to continue to rise as more and more people get in.

Was it a "I've got nothing left to lose, fuck it, I'm putting all my money in Bitcoin" situation?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:38:46
It's basically an online exchange. You can deposit money onto there with a few different methods (I use bpay and send it from my bank like it's a bill), it shows up on the exchange in a day or so. 
Once it's on there it stays there until you withdraw.
I bought a hardware wallet and was able to withdraw my bitcoins to it from the exchange, took around 15 mins to confirm the withdrawal transaction.
If you withdraw your AUD cash from the exchange it'll take a few days to show up in your bank.
