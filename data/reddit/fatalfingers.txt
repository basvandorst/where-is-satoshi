I'm very confused.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:22:04
That is exactly what I am here for.

Thanks a lot for the advice. I am from Alberta currently looking to move to B.C in the next few years. I will definitely come check it out. Currently waiting for some $$ that is coming to me but of course, as we all know, that takes days. Just scalping a bit off the top before it gets to me! Thanks, Manulife!

Thanks for the heads up. I haven't finished the process of veryifing my account yet, but it looks like active trades are  being made? Will definitely look into localbitcoin.

Great advice thank you!

Woah dude...
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:51:01
Yes, because I want the government to know about my crypto portfolio.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:33:49
Well I am so that's taken care of. I do see your point but just because it is available do you really think my dad will be putting some of his retirement money away in Bitcoin?  People still do not know enough.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:27:37
Sure give me your money, I'll get you some BTC right away!

I am curious, if the world is shifting towards renewables, why does it matter how much power Bitcoin uses?
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:19:42
Lil' Windex did it first.
@_date: 2018-10-24 05:24:25
I doubt if you told a bank that is what you were doing with the Money they would not give it to you.

Sing up for an exchange, I use coinsquare.

Find the closest, 2-Way Bitcoin ATM.

Looks great, I'm dumping in my life savings as we speak! 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:28:38
Oh ya totally, 333k that day for sure!
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:07:47
No but really, I wonder how much of Bill's money has touched the wrong hands. He is probably responsible for most of the world's deaths if that is the case?! Indirectly and Directly

Wow, Craig looks like shit.

You could make your own subreddit r/positovebitcoinvibesonly
@_date: 2018-12-26 23:16:57
You may have to narrow down the question you are asking, it is somewhat all over the place.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:10:56
You could also just leave no?
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:32:18
You do know that is worthless right?
