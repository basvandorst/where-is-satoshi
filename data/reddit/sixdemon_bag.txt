Quadrigacx, localbitcoin, ATMs or even Kijiji.

No, you can't withdraw cash from coinbase in Canada.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:09:56
Why don't you contact Quadrigacx support?

If you don't see risks in btc as an investment you need to do more research. That being said if you're just buying pocket money level amounts I think it a good way to learn about investing.

How can an investment be profitable if there is no risk?

I won't argue that, but in a 1st world, where the author of this article is from, 500k is not even close to rich.

You mentioned you're in Canada so you won't be able to withdraw directly from Coinbase. You need to make an account on Quadrigacx send your BTC there and then withdraw or sell them locally.

It means the highest offer to buy is 17811. Please go google market orders vs limit orders.

Just FYI even if you get validated they have "temporarily" disabled most deposit methods so you probably still won't be able to buy coins there.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:54:49
Unfortunately no.

Net worth of 500k is far from rich.

To be fair 99% of bitcoin enthusiasts don't really understand it's value and judging by the post here 50% are pretty much Vincent Adultman. I'm in the 99%.

Let me put it this way if you put $0.54 in your pocket and left it alone for a year, when you reach in your pocket again you will still have $0.54. Unless you have a magic pocket of course.

Where does it say they are against it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:06:07
Why coinbase to buy? Seems to me coin prices are always significantly higher on there.

A sound investment strategy if I’ve ever heard one.

How would you feel if your $1000 is worth nearly zero for a long time?

Look at the order book, there is a 50 BTC+ sell order at 21999.  The trade volume is pretty low on quadriga compared to bigger exchanges so it will take a looong time to get through that order if it stays up.

Not to mention managing ones bitcoins responsibly is still a pain in the ass compared with other payment methods.

The real question is who cares what this guy thinks? Next Don Cherry will be weighing in.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:19:44
What a meaningless statement. Almost anything "can" happen.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:21:46
I agree, it's frustrating to see crap like this posted all day every day.
