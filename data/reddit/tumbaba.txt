How do you short bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-04-09 01:44:06
Good question.
@_date: 2016-04-30 21:12:28
Thanks. So no fee and unconfirmed. Wow.
@_date: 2016-04-30 13:52:19
What are unconfirmed bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:30:58
You're made this 5yr old a little smarter. Thanks.

EIL5 secp256k1? Looked it up online but...words?
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:40:47


Except that the clue of throwing half out was in response to someone posting:


@_date: 2018-05-21 03:44:54
Thanks for this.
FYI, your angles are off:
* -30 = 30
* -60 = 60
* 0 is correct
* 30 = 330
* 60 = 300
Someone early mentioned there are 239 BIP39 seed words in the picture but your spread sheet only has 113.
However, the OP did say that you could throw out at least half of those.
Is that what you did?
On what basis did you throw out 126 of them?
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:43:39
Oh, I had assumed they used a script to do it before going into the cloud maker because they would have needed a full list to create the seed. 
You made a very good find that should help eliminate red herrings (ex. John).
Well done!

It's not Work Sans font.
It's Trebuchet MS font.

“You guys are crazy” was my first thought.
Then I decided to draw some lines.
Connecting the 3 ‘lambdas’ intersects BOTH the notdef glyph and the square dot on the Bitcoin symbol.
Another fact that may be relevant – Lambda Lambda Lamdba was the fraternity of the nerds in the 1984 movie Revenge of the Nerds.

Meaning they will only make it a little easier, not a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:24:58
You counted network twice.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:40:49
This puzzle has uncovered some holes in my bitcoin knowledge. Posts like yours are helping to fill those holes.
Thank you for filing my holes.
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:41:18
Ah, I see what you mean about the angles. Should have realized but I was tired last night.
Didn't check for any missing words. Guess the person that said they found 239 bip39 words was wrong?
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:39:54
Thanks. Isn't that odd?
@_date: 2018-05-25 02:42:05
You're creating wallets, not uncovering them. That's why they are empty.
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:21:01
What does "scaled by log n" mean in this context?
The more often the same word appears in the white paper, the exponentially larger it appears in the picture?
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:47:25
But they also removed all punctuation from the words.
All hyphens and apostrophes are also removed:
**'fan-out' in paper is 'fanout' in picture.**

Keep in mind that best practice for an address linked to your reddit name worksbe to use a new wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:37:16
So you keep the private key the same and change the public address, like sending the coins to a different address in the same wallet. That doesn't expose the private key.
So how does that make it one less step, unless "one less step" is another clue. But then why move the funds unless it is just a red herring.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:40:05
Can't figure out what are you two talking about.
The word modify is covered by a line but what else do you see?
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:21:34
Satoshi is obviously in the whitepaper and is also a BIP39 word. Bu I cannot find it anywhere in the picture.
Am I just too tired?
@_date: 2017-02-11 09:20:24
Is this done by miners to finish blocks quicker or ppl that want to push for bigger blocks?
I thought blocks were at capacity already.
Is there evidence of this?
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:04:20
Tatiana Moroz said in a press release: “After experiencing firsthand the troubles artists face trying to make a name for themselves, I sought a revolutionary way for artists and fans to help each other through incentivized financial support and social connectivity. The only way to achieve this is through the power of the blockchain: a technology that presents countless opportunities for artists and musicians.”
The only way?! Guess she's never heard of the internet.
@_date: 2016-03-03 09:21:43
Got it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:05:49
What is the spam you're referencing?
Fake transactions?
Real question.

Can someone please ELI5?
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:15:47
Do they get rewarded for discovering empty blocks? If so, seems like a quick and cheap way to exploit the system.
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:05:31
Agreed. I only disable it for pron.
@_date: 2016-03-03 08:27:12
I'm still learning about bitcoin.
Can someone EILI5 this?
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:49:49
How much do they earn in fees per block, on average?
And if they don't solve the block, no fees either, right?
Seems like they way to quick money.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:23:59
New to bitcoin. Serious question - what is breadwallet? Is it a brand of wallet like electrum?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:15:34
Great explanation!
@_date: 2016-09-25 20:46:04
Can someone ELI5? Is this bad for current players? Seems like it was planned and more are planned for the future...
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:58:56
What's EDA?
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:07:49
Serious question - why?
@_date: 2016-05-13 00:23:27
What are two way pegs?
@_date: 2016-05-01 04:20:42
Thanks. Love learning about this stuff.
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:08:18
Can you eil5? It sounds cool but I just don't understand.
