They pretty much all need to be protected, so I don't have much of an interest in limiting the conversation on that axis.

How do you intend to account for negative externalities accrued by free market activity?
The notion of the destruction of the state unit is absurd. The state came about through the will of the people to band together for the collective benefit of society. It will not go away because some tiny group of people incorrectly think that the ultimate motives for good in the world are the incentives of free-market capitalism.

How are you going to defend public goods?

Defense agencies? Go after aggressors? That sounds a whole lot like unnecessary violence in pursuit of economic gains. Does your magical stateless free market society condone violence as a means of monetary gain? That situation sounds ripe for the formation of tyrannical governments.

Your suggestion is that somehow major firms will run an exit scam and make enough money from the pollution betting market for it to have been worthwhile? 
I don't see this scenario playing out well for the environment. Other firms will gladly pick up the slack in pollution, bet for it, and make money off their normal operation as well.

What I meant is that in such a market I don't see the incentive for individual companies to reduce pollution.
