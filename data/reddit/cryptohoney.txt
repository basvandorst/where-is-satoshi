Sure you can, but in the reset economy everyone gets guaranteed income(of course if you work your guaranteed income will be higher) so there is no need for making profit.

just keep your eyes on the ball:
- no taxes
- much much more freedom
- no separate government/ everyone is government
- no poverty
- no super rich that control government
- crime reduction in order or magnitude
- freedom to choose your work - not worry about paying rent etc...
- no inflation
- no central bank
- true democracy
- decentralized government

Yes it's hard for people that grew up in this dysfunctional economic system to change their thinking, but when you have guaranteed income and the freedom to do what you want in life, the younger generation will see that stock piling gold is completely unnecessary.

you would use the raspberry pi to connect to the asic miner via your home network (they will give you the ip address). you use a browser. in essence you can use any computer you want to do this. but mining with the PI is useless.

Bitcoin exchanges can be designed in such a way that you keep the bitcoin in your own wallet. When agreeing to sell or buy at a particular price you are entered into a contract if you do not honor the contract you get a bad rating (think ebay, yelp, etc...) or are banned from the exchange.

The fact that we have an economy where you gotta go out and get the money youself, you are not taken care of, causes a huge amount of stress on people.

100% open source. Decentrlaized. Public blockchain. Emmutable blockchain. Strong programming team. Most wdiely accepted. Strong merchant support. Strong user support. Strong node support. Longest reputation. Most powerful network. Limited supply. Not premined. Creators name is satoshi nakamoto. Any cryptocurrency that meet these properties are a good bet, for now there is only one. Bitcoin.

Those (all) corperations are centralized where one(or a few) 'kings'/'bosses' control everything, and they get super rich from it. Bitcoin is the opposite, there is no one that owns the bitcoin system, controls it, no ceo, no boss, no king, no one (or a few) people profiting and getting rich. Insteaded it is a shared system where everyone controls it a bit, where everyone gets profit a bit, this is the future, sharing.

I was brain washed by the main stream media CNN/FOX, etc.. news my entire life and totally believed that man made global warming was real until I saw both sides of the argument. Main stream media pushes on side only the same side that makes you believe you will be killed by a terrorist when you have a much greater chance from dying from a lightning strike. Main stream media also wants you to believe that the US is the 'good' guys when they create and fund  al qaeda, ISIS, Osama Bin laden, and many other terrorists organizations. If you want to keep believing Man made global warming is real, go ahead.

i think they'll come out with an app where you deposit bitcoin and once it has 6 confirmations you now have the equivalent in fiat and can buy coffee. However if bitcoin goes way up in price and you loaded your 'starbucks wallet app' the other week, you won't benefit of the increased bitcoin value.

You WILL have twice as many coins because now there is a duplicate of the blockchain  (and your coins). However,  after such an event the price will drop on both chains so the total value will not double, actually it'll probably go down at least in the short term(look what happened to ethereum when they forked in 2016) at the end there is a good chance(maybe?) that one chain will have more support from miners, nodes, wallets and exchanges than the other and it'll be that one who's value will keep going up. The least popular chain will either die off of still be alive albeit have a fraction of the value than the popular one. And you will have control of coins in both chains. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:37:00
So it uses about 3% of the full blockchain?

Not so much miners but the mining pool operator. When you are part of a mining pool you don't get to choose the fee system(or anything else for that matter) you are just mining. The owner of the mining pool is the boss of those things. However, you have the option to join other mining pools albeit there aren't 100's to choose from.

Confirmation times are not affected by the size of the blockchain.  I think it's around 130gb currently but yes the blockchain will keep getting bigger. The theory is storage space such as hard drives keep getting bigger and less expensive so It won't have much of an affect on running full nodes. There is also pruned nodes, sharding which are not full nodes, they need little storage space albeit not as helpful as full nodes but still helpful.

Censorship resistance is more about someone blocking your bitcoin transaction, which no one can do. Any other system like paypal/banks is very easy to stop you from sending money. The invention of bitcoin doesn't affect in any way the ability of a gov. to make new laws.

70% of global miners are in china, that aint good :/
Why do I say this? if a law ever comes out to make bitcoin mining illegal in china then the bitcoin network hashing power will drop so much that the bitcoin network will be useless for a few weeks until the difficulty adjusts, this is why I say bitcoin needs a gravity well type difficulty adjustment to overcome this.

@_date: 2016-06-19 20:10:52
1) Yes governments can do this and more, but since bitcoin is global will all governments do this together? not likely, there are even albeit small countries that already want to use bitcoin for their own currency,
2) transactions will be delayed however there are several upgrades to bitcoin rolling out in the next year that will help this in orders of magnitude. 
3) if a country shuts down huge mining farms then the bitcoin network will be almost useless until about 10 days later when the difficulty adjusts. This could also happen with a solar flare or war. This is why I am constantly suggesting a 'gravity well'(some alt coins use this, the difficulty is adjusted much faster than 10 days) type function for bitcoin.
However in all situations no one can ever take your bitcoin from you if you hold the private keys safely. And all problems we encounter can always be fixed with software upgrades. Bitcoin is here to stay for a long long while.

The only long term success a taxi app can have is if it's decentralized. The driver app reveals your location and id, rating (which is stored in the taxicoin blockchain). And the customer app is used to see the taxis and call them to your location for pickup. Miners would verify all interaction and build the blockchain, you get rewarded  with taxicoin? It's only a matter of time.........

Bitcoin is a new type of system which can be used like money to buy things, and that citizens around the world control. It has no attachment to banks or governments. The software is open source (look it up) so fraud is greatly reduced. There is no company, ceo, boss, owner of bitcoin, it is decentralized around thr world.  Why do we need it? google and learning about banking fraud, and also federal reserve system scam.

If you look into the history of encryption it is not a invented by a kid in his basement. It is always either some multimillion dollar think tank, or some special funding to selected schools.
When something 'new' gets invented it isn't made public immediately. It goes through filters (special ops. gov. officials). If it is deemed too powerful it is never released. (and yes inventors get their lives threatened)

If China seriously cracks down/bans bitcoin outright and raids/stops the miners, bitcoin will be absolutely clogged up and pretty much useless until difficulty udjusts and that can take over a week. So if you think simple FUD can drop the price like it's hot, that is nothing compared to a full ban. 
That's why a 'gravity well'  type difficulty adjustment is needed for bitcoin.

The reason why the miners play this game is so that no one can predict who confirms the next block. It's a way Satoshi designed bitcoin to be random, ramdom in who solves the blocks. This way the blockchain cannot be controlled by a single party.

There are mining pools that automatically switch between a whole bunch of alt coins so that you are always mining the most profitable ones. You would then exchange them for bitcoin, if u  want

@_date: 2017-01-07 01:28:57
Not only that, with a pos system you can create another(counterfeit) blockchain without any  work required . So if 50% of miners go on the fake chain there would be no way to prove which is the original one.
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:39:02
If CC compqny charge merchants to support fraud expenses, then the merchant will charge it's customers for that. You think the merchants will pay that? Hahahaaa

When a block is solved miners jump on solving another another block instantly regardless of the amount of transactions picked up from a node. The amount of transactions does not change the difficulty of solving the block. So sometimes when miners start mining on a new block, by chance, they can actually solve it before having time to fill up the block with many or any transaction, kinda rare but normal currently.

They do. Coins go up and down through out the day for profitability.  One coin can be more profitable for only 1 hour. Some for days but they are worth pennies. Also the most secure network in the world is bitcoin so people always go back to it because they know it's the safest place to have money on.

Refunds: think of bitcoin as cash. Refunds would work the same way. The person you sent bitcoin to would have to agree and send funds back to you.       
Coinbase: from what i know coinbase is safe to acquire bitcoin but not to keep/hodl bitcoin. If you purchase send it to another wallet where you fully control your private keys.

that's complete bullshit, we don't have (a fully functional quatum computer) nor will we have one in the next 25 years that will be even close to that.  AND the bitcoin network is more powerful than the top 500 super computers combined.

Like all things in life, especially 'systems', and especially economic systems, bitcoin won't last forever. It is here now, it will probably be around for the next 10-30 years, it is totally amazing, i love it, it will solve many problems, it will make many people rich but to believe bitcoin 'as is' will exist in 2140 is foolish and naive.

easy. humans are hodling on an old trait that in todays day and age, most of the time, is destructive and that is to compete with one another. Winner and looser mentality. BTW capitalism is not helping because it is 100% competitive but when people loose in this system (and most do) your whole life can get affected in a negative way.

The bitcoin system  has the highest hashrate (computational power) for preventing fraud on the blockchain. However, many other coins also have a lot of power,  making them safe also.

the news headlines and articles you see are much over-hyped. 1) There is no quantum computer in the public sector even close at hacking someones private keys. 2) if a real properly working quantum computer is released ALL banks are affected in the same way, the whole banking system will be fucked not only bitcoin.  3) we can alter bitcoin so that it becomes quantum computer proof.

When you create a new address, no part of bitcoin 'checks' if it exists already. In the creation process of a new address a private key is generated, so at that moment you are the 'owner' of that address because you possess the private key for it.      
     
What happens when you randomly create someone else's private keys?     
It is called a collision. The chances of this happening are so astronomical it is only but a minimal concern to the programmers and community.

For example there are worker cooperatives such as  [ workers (80,000+ ) have equal voting power in where to produce, how to produce and what to do with what they produce and the profit.  Companies moving to china leaving their old ~~slaves~~ employees unemployed simply does not exists in such an system.

The LN is taking off a bit of pressure but overall it is because there are not a lot of TXs on the bitcoin network. Dont worry when the huge bull run starts in the next 6 months, there will be again more TXs then the bitcoin network can handle and the TX fees will get very high again. How high????

you deposit bitcoin into a payment channel, lets say $500 worth.
you will have to wait the regular time it takes for bitcoin to settle this.
now you can spend that 500$, lets say you buy some gas for your car, when you pay through the LN it will be instant. you keep spending until you  are low or  run out of funds, you can top up at any time.

You can see what miner solved the block, and if he is in a smart contract he will not be able to spend the btc. until everybody of the pool signs (or 3/4 of them or whatever) then the btc gets distributed to those on the smart contract. And you can see if miners are working by orphan blocks and so on.

A very good unit of value is the cost to keep one human alive for a day (including food, rent, energy, exercise, travel, leisure activities, etc...)  this can be called HDV (human day value, I just made that up)you can have it country by country or average for the planet. This unit of value will never change unless we evolve into something else.

Well people that see the harm in centralized mining would opt to go for these decentralizing pools taking away the power of the ones that don't.
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:00:32

I just read  and it's not quite what I mean, they don't use smart contracts. Also P2pools required an operator for the pool, in my way there isn't one person.

It's not open source and it's not decentralized. That means it's nothing like bitcoin, it's the same shit like the banks.

I agree but it's not in the news 
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:22:05
No because all the blocks/transactions can be verified. Something like that will easily be discovered, then people will go to the correct chain.
@_date: 2016-02-09 23:43:22

Yeah just the other day me and grandma where talking about distributed computing..  :/
@_date: 2016-02-09 23:48:56
well first off you need one operator of the p2pool, so if he closes shop all stops. In my way there is no one person running the pool.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:17:56
I LMAO every time when people ask should they mine bitcoin and r/bitcoin response no no, you can't make money anymore when in fact you can make profit(depending hydro costs) and without mining there is no bitcoin.

Joe gives me an important document(in person on a usb stick)but I'm allowed to send it to 1 of 5 people.  So after sendind my TX needs to be verified so that they know it came from me and the document needs to be verified to make sure it's the original one from Joe

I think it's quit easy to make a small program to check for double spending attempts. An alert can be sent to the merchant and that transaction can be marked as a fraud attempt.

- Are there any spend limits for Interac Flash?
A single transaction can’t exceed $100. If your purchase is above this limit, you will be prompted to insert your card and enter your PIN.
As an added layer of protection, there is also a cumulative spend limit of $100 for Interac Flash transactions. This is the sum of all contactless transactions made with your card since the last time you entered your PIN. When this limit is reached, you will be asked to insert your card and enter your PIN. This will reset your limit so you can continue to use Interac Flash.
Expand Will I still get a receipt for Interac Flash transactions?

Slavery &gt; master and slave. Capitalism produces private corporations, boss is master, worker slave. However, the slave can leave the master any time for another master. In rare cases he can become a master and have slaves work for him.

A real/pure quantum computer that is usable and works like a quantum computer is supposed to is far from a reality. The best one 3 years ago can only add 4+5=9. To do something so complicated as to breaking digital signatures is very far from the near future. D-wave is NOT a real quantum computer. It has maybe 0.01% quantum processing power and the rest is standard computer processing.

1st it takes 100,000,000 satoshis to make one bitcoin. Yes you can buy satoshi units, if you accumalte 100,000,000 you'll have one whole bitcoin. 2nd a bitcoin economy will only work really well if everyone uses it (one day...) this way companies get paid in bitcoin but pay all their expenes in bitcoin. 3rd if my 2nd point happens this means adoption is at an all time high so people will view bitcoin more usefull, thus with a  limited supply, and more demand, bitcoins price will sky rocket.

- no poverty
- no super rich that control government
- crime reduction in order or magnitude
- freedom to choose your work - not worry about paying rent etc...
- no inflation
- no central bank
- no wealth accumulation
- true democracy

DECADES BACK: taxi's were not regulated, some had no insurance, no drivers license, not mechanically UNsafe, and so accidents happened ,people got injured and died. the people cried out to the government DO SOMETHING. new rules were put in place making IT much more safer and stable (albeit raising costs)
TODAY: Uber cars are not regulated, costs are cheap. just wait for the same shit to play out and people demanding regulation. Uber will get regulated, costs go up, and by then the regular taxis will have the similar app as uber.
Now i ask you is it a good thing that the taxis got regulated? or should people of let the taxi companies work it out a la capitalism and where ever there are the least deaths thats the taxi company people will choose as the victor?

@_date: 2015-10-12 16:29:21
The only reason Bitcoin survived and evolved so far is precisely because of the incentive that an investment can pay off big time. You need to be really naive to think Bitcoin has come this far for the possibility of it helping out the poorest/unbanked people in the world. This is what you get with capitalism. If the incentive is always wealth accumulation we are fucked before we even begin. But Bitcoin is very very clever because greed is making if grow and eventually can change the world, help the poor, provide alternative payment systems, etc..
P.s. You think all the players like coinbase, Gemini, blockchain.info etc... got into this because their number one goal is not to make a huge profit ? Hahahahahahahaaaaa

Recreational mining died due to competition. If you down vote this you are in denial. Where ever in the world electricity is cheaper/free they win against the rest of the world. When there is a winner, there is a loser. Competition.

capitalism (like it or not) now is big corporations that want o screw you as much as you allow. If only every business worked decentralized like Bitcoin + OpenBazaar, maybe the future? but even like that capitalism is always a conflict of interest because its always 'make profit' vs. 'i'll sell you something good'

A private company (capitalism) is a form of dictatorship because the owner/ceo/(or people that own the most shares which is usually a dozen or so of people) because decide on EVERYTHING, what gets produced, when it gets produced, and everything else.

I agree, you need to peg it to something that never changes. I suggest the average cost required to live for one day(rent, electricity, food, leisure activities, etc) . This will always remain the same, more or less. Cannot be manipulated. Let's call this unit HLD or human living day. So all loans will be calculated on this standard. I will borrow 100 HLD, so no matter what happens with bitcoin, gold or fiat, you can always pay back the loan with interest and nothing gets disrupted. OK I'm not that smart so, guys destroy this idea go!

The argument, " No one forces you to work for a company " has about as much depth put into it as getting robbed at gunpoint, "if you don't want to hand over your money, then just don't".       
Come one, statistics show over 75% of people live paycheck-to-paycheck. If they quit they might not be able to pay the rent/mortgage etc..."

something to consider: it's centralized power, its a dictatorship, the ruler can change his mind any time he wants. If you want to put faith in that then you don't understand bitcoin.

But my point is its even worse today - it costs more to mine with current diff.
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:35:15
yes it does somewhat because if it costs 2000$ to mine one bitcoin worth $450 then no one would mine.

If all miners in the world stop mining the bitcoin blockchain (history of all transactions) will still exist because there are 1000's of duplicates around the world. When miners come back online they will continue where it left off.
If all copies of bitcoin blockchains are erased its all over.
the less miners there are the easier the difficulty so yeah it will adjust however, it will take days or weeks(if 100's or 1000's of miners stop) to get bitcoin chugging along prior to the difficulty change this is why I suggested a 'gravity well' type difficulty adjustment incorporated into the bitcoin protocol, this will make difficulty adjustments very very fast.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:22:35
Depends which month
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:31:45
Except the difficulty went way up. It's right now it's about equivalent to last year at about 230 a btc
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:08:04
"a miner can trivially generate any number of transactions to fill their own block." 
- yes they will pay transaction fees, this is normal and nothing wrong with that.
- an upgrade can be done to remove the ability to accept empty blocks. 
"if a malicious miner tries to broadcast a block that's 100 MB to DOS the network, an honest miner can eventually mine an empty block at the same height and it will zip around the network quickly" 
- It takes the same time to mine an empty block than it does a huge 1 gb block.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:37:15
Anyone who responds " no" knows nothing about bitcoin mining.  Let's see bitcoin exists because mining is profitable...... hhmmmm  .to the newbs all you need to do is Google a good bitcoin mining calculator enter all required data like mining power, cost of electicty. Etc...  if the number comes out positive  you are good to go.

The argument, "don't like it? quit" has about as much depth put into it as getting robbed at gunpoint, "if you don't want to hand over your money, then just don't".       
Come one, statistics show over 75% of people live paycheck-to-paycheck. If they quit they might not be able to pay the rent/mortgage etc..."      
You say it like everyone has the luxury to do whatever they want whenever when in fact most are stuck in a job they hate and CAN'T afford to quit"

Not true, why do you think some blocks have 0 or only a few tx in them? Miners start solving a new block immediately, they can add tx as they are trying to solving it, it does not reduce the chances of solving a block.
