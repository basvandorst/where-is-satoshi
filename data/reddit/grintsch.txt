Some might argue that a less decentralized governance model could lead to more agility and faster development. This certainly is true for some projects, but obviously Bitcoin's entire proposition is also based on it *not* jumping on every train.
Or did you mean those specific people? ;-)

I was thinking right now. And yes, it's decentralized, but there's usually people who stand out, sometimes despite the fact they're not actually part of the controlling / a contributing organization.

This is really cute, thanks!

This is a brilliant one.

That's right, and sure it is a good thing. But there's been other decentralized movements where no single person sets the rules or the direction, and still there are influencers who are listened to more than others.
Thanks for mentioning Saifedean Ammous whom I didn't have on my mental list at all.

In theory that's true, but in practice it usually doesn't work like that (see Ethereum as an example). 
Many people have also argued that it might be more effective (and for sure more efficient) to actually have a governance model where a bunch of people (whether democratically inaugurated or simply the creators / founders) control the ongoing development. Bitcoin, in that respect, is a rare occurrence. The more interesting that it's by far the most successful.

Who would you consider influential?

Cool list. Any idea why Adam Back should be ahead of Tuur Demeester, Jameson Lopp, or Nick Szabo (who all have more followers) - I mean outside of the algorithm?

It's Andreas Antonopoulos, so you almost got it right ;-) I was thinking about him, as well.

I didn't mean it as "hero worship" (and you're right, Bitcoin doesn't need that), more like:  
"Who do you think the majority of people would listen to regarding Bitcoin?"
