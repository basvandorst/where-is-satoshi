Just moved to BTC.com. That would be my base until these other snails implement SW

even if it was free, I'll rather have better information stored there in than receipts of coffee purchases.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:33:01
Use BTC.com. they've implemented segwit

Legislative gray areas might make it legit but it's against the company policy.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:22:48
use BTC.com. They implemented SW last week. It's just as great as blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:58:34
Not likely
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:19:23
:-) how unfortunate.

My tx from blockchain.info got stuck for almost two weeks with no confirmation. I just decided to export my priv. keys to my electrum desktop wallet. I was perplexed to discover that my tx was rejected by the network for low fees but still never reflected on my blockchain.info wallet. Just sent the tx with a slightly higher fees and it went through in less than an hour. I think blockchain.info has a bug.

Here's a test to prover if you're psychologically a Bitcoiner or Bcasher: You have issues with space, do you buy more hard drives or look for ways to compress your file?

IOTA pays no fees. Miner-free platform
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:57:44
for me it's the later

you should at this point be able to identify a bully. they're intelligently insultive
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:39:59
you guys need to understand that every innovative sector designed to aid the middle class always get hijacked by the upper class. bitcoin mining is one. ICOs are now just a makeup of IPOS

This information could prompt other sites with traffic to adopt this system of using visitors processing power. Thanks for transparency though

apologies! gray-headed redditter!
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:40:42
all those planning to dispose their 2x, you might lose your btc in the process. go check out what a transaction replay really is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:03:44
Jumped in at $3500. that was late though!

BITCOIN IS A THREAT TO ANY BANK. WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING MORE CRITICS LIKE THIS OVER THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:26:23
these same guys (Miners and Exchangers) who want to double the block size are finding it difficult to signal SegWit in their blocks. So this move is clearly not for wan of space, it's political.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:37:19
the fork never happening perhaps. 2X has no replay protection so unlike bcash, you'll have to stick to one side. if you make a tx using your 2x tokens it would automatically move your actual Btc to such address aswell.

GOVERNMENTS ARE LEGITIMISING BITCOINS. ANY GOVERNMENT THAT ATTEMPTS SUCH WOULD CAUSE A SPARK

yes the Knowledge is spreading but most Nigerians still see bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme. that's why we've taken the pains to enlight students and business folks 
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:07:18
ordo ab chao! THAT'S WHAT SEGWIT IS DOING.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:18:33
i for-see a split. the guys mining coins are the guys with voting power and don't forget they're making more cash with their ASIC chips than ever. I just paid 0.001BTC to move 0.0045BTC to another wallet. Good 20% transac fee and guess whose benefiting?? MINERS
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:36:24
why not use localbitcoins.com. it's a crytpo blackmarket
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:51:07
yes ETH is in a bubble but one that will last till after August 1^st. ETH will touch $550 before that date.
