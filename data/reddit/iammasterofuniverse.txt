Cats are a great way to test the network while scaling it out. Popular enough test and stress the system but not too popular that it will break the system or totally flood it.

So let's say  bitcoin tanks to 1 dollar and stays around 1 dollar forever for whatever reason (futures rigging, quantum pc hacking, whatever) Are you still going to buy bitcoin and use it? I doubt it. If bitcoin crashed to 1 dollar probably 99% of current people would be Turned off and you can be sure bitcoin would be the new tulip meme. People want bitcoin now because its rising in price. It's a way for financial freedom. They don't understand it but they understand "damn it!was 600 dollars and now  it's almost 12k".
If you start telling new people about lightening network and scalability and transactions per second and blockchain, their eyes will glaze over and you just lost them just like if you tried to tell people how to program java to use the internet. Regular mainstream people don't give a duck about that and these people are what you need if you want widespread use.
What you need for bitcoin is price. Once it hits critical price where people can sustainably use bitcoin without losing large amounts of bitcoin then they'll use it. The preference is bitcoin will appreciate at a rate of growth such that even if people used it for regular transactions their value would remain the same, if not rise in price, if that makes any sense. So let's say I spend 20,000/mth and I have 1 bitcoin. I use my bitcoin to spend 20k/mth but bitcoin rises 21k/mth. Now when people see that shit and you explain it to them, you will get mass immigration into bitcoin. When you start telling people you spend 20k/mth ( the equivalent in satoshi)and bitcoin paid it all off and gave you some more left over, man, it would be game on. Every one and their mom and grand mom would get on that shit.
Tech is also important but it should run in the background like a credit card. I don't know how a credit card works. I just know I zip it and my bill is paid which I have to pay at the end of the month.

Instead of byoerinflating the dollar and thereby destroying it, they could hyperinflate crypto, tax it,  reduce the deficit and still keep the usd. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:17:53
Gold is much uninflatable. The problem here is they can write as much paper/digital contracts as they like and will always be blameless and guiltless because they investigate themselves. 
If anything, I think a lot more people, not just gold and silver bugs, will wake up to the crookedness of wall street. Of course I hope I am wrong cuz I'd rather be rich.

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:02
Total us currency m1 supply (bank reserves,  cash, etc etc) is 3 trillion. Let's say 4 trillion. Total bitcoin minus lost is around 16 million.
4 trillion/16 million = 250k
Incidentally total forex volume is around 4-5 trillion.
I think 250k is a good estimate tho. but that doesn't mean bitcoin use will be more than usd. Bitcoin holders will have to hold at least enough  fiat to pay bills and taxes. And just a note during fdr tax rates were insane like 94% on the top level. The power to tax is the power to destroy. If they decide to tax crypto at 99% what are you going to do? In the USA it's not impossible for ridiculous laws to be passed. Look at drug laws, anti-terrorist laws,  gold ban, etc. they will destroy the few to save the many.
Otoh let's say they do let bitcoin go through the roof. The questions would be why and what for? Why let bitcoin threaten the usd unless there was some benefit. That's when you def know something is up. They have destroyed countries, assassinated presidents, and started world wars for money, and now they let the usd go away? Yeah right!
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:55:19
They didn't it with gold. Why not with bitcoin? The big banks, tbtf banks, you know, the same banks that caused the 2008 recession and got the fed to load up 4 trillion balance sheet. Now who's mad? Money is nothing to them but a means to an end.

What you really want to do is convince people. That doesn't work unless they want to be convinced. Seeing a bunch of broke teenagers talking about money and how it will transform the world doesn't work. 
You know what will work? Being rich. When people see your life has changed drastically for the better, they'll be interested (not yet convinced), and that's when you can talk to them about it. When the media starts hyping it and talking about how it exploded to 6 digits, then they'll be convinced but maybe not trusted. Time earns trust.

Why does bitcoin have to be about one thing? If you want it to be widely used, It should be all things to all people. Maybe people want it to kill the banks. Great! Bitcoin does it. Maybe others want it as currency. Great! Bitcoin can do that too. Maybe you want bitcoin for anonymity. Bitcoin does that. You want quick global transactions for cheap? Bam, done! Pedro wants it for stability against a currency crisis. Check! The more uses it has, the more people will use it.

First they use btc which is confusing in itself. I'm not new to bitcoin but to that subforum and recently figure out it's not related to bitcoin. It's really slimed how they try to confuse btc, bitcoin cash, and bitcoin. I thought it was related to bitcoin.
 Second they only spread fud and half the posts were about tether. While tether maybe a problem, I think the real reason is bitcoins price is going up so they make more tether to provide liquidity for bitcoin to usdt transfers. Just a guess. Think about it. If there are 200 tethers for 200 bitcoin. If bitcoins goes to 2000 should tethers go up similarly? Otherwise there's no liquidity. Btc won't say that. All they are spreading is fear  of bitcoin. And that's all they do. I just un subscribed from that forum cuz it's trash

Sounds really good. To me this is like how credit cards started up in the beginning. Back then it was hard to get a credit card, and that made people want it, but I suspect it was also to scale the system out in a safe manner. Still there were some hiccups and a lot of fraud and abuse and transactions that didn't/couldn't go through etc etc, similar to now.
The important thing to remember is that bitcoin will change and for the better. It's hard to be patient in today's time where everything is almost instant, but the internet took time to get here get from text chat and bbs to aol to fiber and mobile hi speed. Crypto will too.

You don't know because you still live with mom and dad and they still pay your lunch money but You're using "money" that has negative rates. You're being charged to use it in the form of a fees. It's just hidden. And your incentivized to use t with points and other bonuses. It's one of the end results  if a devalued system of currency that has lost all value. No one wants it but everyone has to use it or else go to jail. That's why people have to work more and more to get paid (value wise) less and less. Money today is worthless than money a generation ago.
Otoh crypto value goes up over time so people want it. Once people realize this they will realize they would rather have (and get paid) in deflationary currency (gold or crypto), and keep just enough fiat for daily necessities and maybe emergency fund.  
This is why you get asset bubbles (housing, stocks, gold, oil, etc) too much fiat is chasing too little assets, so the fed has to whack a mole with a wide hammer by raising interest rates.

Of course we are on the right side. but they are crooked and don't give a damn. Their tactics are naked short selling. They can write up as much as they like until the paper p rice begins to dictate real price. 
They'll also smear campaign and complain about volatility. Hurrhurr muh price has gone too high. But what do you expect when people see freedom. They run for it. Who wants to keep money in a devalued asset! 
And they'll also talk about fees and. Transaction times and  teerorists and drug dealers to magnify the usual complains until people just say fuck it. It's weaponized media designed to grind down your willpower. They did all this with gold and silver back in 2010.

Just a quick calculation ofnbitcoin. Let's say 50,000 people bought 40 usd/Mth of bitcoin. That s 2 mill/mth going into bitcoin. Let's say only 20% of those people follow the hodl philosophy. The rest sell. Within a couple years the holders would own the entire bitcoin market. This doesn't count the rising cost of bitcoin per buy but it also doesn't count the 1% who own most of the bitcoin, are probably already wealthy, and most likely hodl the majority of their bitcoin. Maybe someone else can do a more precise calculation.

Another option , instead of the slow grind, is the opposite, a  blitzkrieg.

It's not about money. It's about control. They can't put bitcoin back in the box and banning it won't work because bitcoin started in dark web. They want to control bitcoin and run it into the ground, discredit it, and make it like bitcoin is for drug dealers and terrorists. 
So they will try to run it into the ground with market manipulation via leveraged naked shorting, rehypothecation, and various other unethical Wall Street tactics.
They can't let bitcoin supplant the dollar. They want to continue their imperialistic regime of war, colonization, and financial slavery. Bitcoin threatens all that. If you don't think so, just consider bitcoins market cap is 200 billion, putting it in the top market cap of corporate business.  At a bitcoin price of 56200, bitcoin is larger than apple. At 250k, bitcoin is larger than USA currency m1 supply. They can't allow that to happen. 
So they're attacking bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. Wall Street bounty hunters and the IRS are just two examples. Hacking is a third.

It can be spent as a currency if one chooses without having to answer to banks or any centralized governmental body. It can be a store of wealth like a house or gold but transferred much much much more easilyI can send 100 bitcoin to a guy in Korea as quickly and easily as a wire but with minimal fees and it is quick and no gocernment can stop me or meddle. Btc doesn't respond to borders or nations or governed laws. 
On top of all this btc is throwing out various forks that are also gaining in value. It's like dividends on top of dividends.
Government can stop this any more than they can stop marijuana or drugs. If they try to ban it, it will simply go underground. The only thing they can try to do is pump and dump like they did gold.

The IRS can accuse you of selling. It's up to you to prove otherwise. I had a dealing with them before where I cashed out a Roth IRA with penalties taken out. Their records said I owed money. I had to call vanguard and pray they still had my records, which they still did (vanguard is awesome), and I was able to clear my name.

Market cap. Bitcoin currently has a market cap of 122 billion. That puts bitcoin in an extremely exclusive club. Just to put it into perspective. McDonald's is less than 100 billion. Nvda, Amgen, and Altria group are around 120 billion. Will any of these companies go to 0? It's possible but highly unlikely at this point. 
Once you get to a critical mass amount of money, that market cap takes on a life of its own. I'm not sure exactly what the amount is but I am sure 120 billion and growing is enough.

The fed wants inflation. Gubmint wants inflation. The fed wants fiat. The gubmint wants fiat. Fiat and inflation go hand in. It's the zombification of the masses. Fiat allows the gubmint to grown, and when faced with an existential crisis like in 2008 and 2001, to continue to exist. What gubmint would throw that away? Not a single one.
now a lot of people are saying hyperinflation, but that won't exist. They will simply tax (take away, deflate) any amount to offset inflation. A popular method is to mandate health insurance. Suddenly everyone has to pay, and the masses love this "free" health care, and the entire country's population is further zombified into the hive mind system of fiat based authoritarian gubmint cloaked as muh freedom and progressivism

If it meets their threshold of 20k, They will then send you a letter stating you owe such and such amount of money. (They like to accuse you of shit like selling first even if you didn't.) then you will kindly show them that you either still have your bitcoin (maybe a copy of the bitcoins and wallet) or that you sold at a loss later (notax) or that you sold and made a profit and have to pay tax.

Let's further say timmy's deflationary currency pays an inflationary dividend. Timmy then uses the devalued currency to pay for his daily living while keeping the deflating asset. Because the dividend devalues over time, the asset pays out an increasing amount of dividend fixed to real inflation (not the bogus made up numbers used by the fed). Timmy can now live more comfortably than before. Well in theory.
In this case bitcoin should be considered more as an asset like a house and the dividend should be considered as incoming rent. You would trade your house for use as currency. You would use the dividends/rental income to pay for daily transactions, and you do t have to deal with tenants, upkeep, property taxes, etc

Take a lesson from the USA and change the calculation for inflation. Just cut out food, energy, healthcare, education, and anything important. Then calculate inflation from useless junk, such corn flakes and potato chips, aspirin, computers, typewriters, pen and pencils, and copy machine paper. If the numbers don't sound realistic, you can always "adjust" the numbers afterwards due to seasonality or events such as earthquake, drought, or any other reason. Finally, pretend that inflation is good and that people should be paid in something that loses value. The clueless masses will fall in line and agree, especially if you say it with lots of fanfare, paparazzi, and flood the news media. In just no time India too can have inflation if &lt;2%.
Also forgot to add that if the people wake up to the shenanigans of the ruling elite, use the devaluing worthless fiat currency to hire stupid ignorant people who blindly enforce the law. give theem weapons and the authority to kill people who don't obey. Remember to flood the airwaves with important people, presidents and senators and even local mayors and governors, saying how important the military and police are to further influence the small and weak minded. After all democracy wouldn't work if the masses weren't so stupid and  whose lives were so cheap.
