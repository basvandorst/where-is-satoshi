Where is a good place?
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:22:38
I just want a shitty lego set that costs like $15

We aren't down voting because we are opposed to you, but you are making a completely wild accusation.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:06:39

They don't even look good. Definitely not something I would ever wear.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:10:56

He seems like he is brand new tbh so don't give him to much hate.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:02:47
perfect time for me to buy?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:08:06

Edit: I also saw newkidsontheblockchain down below and that seems like a great name.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:25:33
Yup, but remember it's still not too late to buy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:29:16
Did you read the thread? Every single person said no.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:13:04
You don't know that
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:19:14
It's not a good troll unless you admit you are trolling
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:14:03
I don't know I'm just a big idiot.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:46:55
I'll buy at 3500
All time is a good time to buy in my opinion though just don't spend enough to be detrimental to you.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:22:03
How long has it taken you to get .011?
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:09:07
You mean 30$ in 5 min?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:06:32

@_date: 2017-09-14 15:07:23
It will for sure, give it a few weeks though
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:43:43

@_date: 2017-09-13 04:13:01

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:47:41
That's one exchange as he just said.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:03:00
Sell all now and cut your losses sorry buddy
Edit: hopefully you know I'm joking.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:33:27
Yea, take some London classes it was hard to decipher what you are saying.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:18:59
