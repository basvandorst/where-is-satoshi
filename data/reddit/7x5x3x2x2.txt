It may also be a shock to you that news articles are written on average at a sixth grade reading level. With that being said, the fact you consider two syllable  words to be "big words" is a tell-tale that you are just bitter and old, or jaded youth.

Yes. Stand on the corner, send money to QR code, give product. Dude it's the 21st century. No need to keep money on hand that can then be used as evidence in court as "drug money".

I agree that it'd be easy to put files on a person's computer without their knowledge, but...
That'd mean you would have had to acquire CP in the first place to even frame the people. That's creepy as fuck.
With that being said, I'm sure the NSA has a large archive of CP. 
I know there are international authoritites that are actively trying to stop the human trafficking but I have to think there may be some double-agents so-to-speak working at things like  
NGO's have a history of being set up by governments for undercover ops/black ops. 
Edit: So what I'm saying is there is certainly plausibility and I think cases of attempts at the very least.

The bank has apologized today after visiting a different branch. The people we dealt with were reported by the other branch. They supported my side of the debate that the direct deposit was clearly not fraud. Some people simply let ignorance blind their perspective.

They gave her a hard time, so she explained where the funds came from. They gave her more shit saying that "young guys like to use girls like you" and other bullshit that was irrelevant to the situation as a company wired the money. Furthermore, they claimed that company defrauded them, which has never been reported about CoinBase. They are a legitimate company that I've had 0 problems with and neither has my bank. This bank sucks, that's all. I tried to help to further verify with them as I was at work and she was physically at the bank. I got tired of being accused of fraud when I've had to work hard for everything in my life. I'm not letting some ignorant prick keep me from helping my fiance get a better vehicle with real, valid money I earned.

@_date: 2015-04-04 02:04:55
A better solution is 
Dash (DASH) is a privacy-centric digital currency based on the Bitcoin software. It allows you to remain anonymous while you make transactions, similar to cash. With Bitcoin, transactions are published to the blockchain and you can prove who made them or to whom, but with Dash the anonymization technology makes it impossible to trace them. This is important because the blockchain is accessible to anyone with an internet connection – a significant drawback for those don’t wish their transaction history and balances to be publicly available. Dash does this through a mixing protocol utilizing an innovate decentralized network of servers called Masternodes, avoiding the need for a trusted third party that could compromise the integrity of the system.
 
Why choose Dash?
 PRIVATE
Keep your payments private so nobody can track you, your transactions and balances are nobody’s business. With Dash’s ahead of time anonymization only you have access to your financial information.
 FAST
Payments are received almost instantly by the other party thanks to faster block times. Ahead of time anonymization lets you send Dashs anonymously without waiting for processes or people.
 
Advanced encryption and a trustless protocol for complete security in your payments and anonymization process.

I think that was their point? They were able to game the market banking on mining at the current or estimated rates, and by the time the miners were released, a large economy of preorders existed whilst the manufacturers most likely used their hardware to capitalize in the meanwhile before difficulty increased. This type of action allows the hardware manufacturers to manipulate the market.

Some speculate this was done, but the more likely scenario is that the manufacturer knows that providing fast hardware that hasn't been available yet will drive the difficulty up very fast, so by creating a synthetic production delay, profits increase for the manu. The manu. of course puts a number of their machines to mining for purpose of creating money and testing. Months of testing and tweaking could yield more BTC than you'd expect.
