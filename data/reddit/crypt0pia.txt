Any act of selling or trading your crypto into another crypto or fiat assumes a tax. If an audit hits you, you better have enough evidence for everything or else they will start giving you a massive headache. Sometimes its just better to pay the tax man or move to a different place with better laws.

I think it is a lot bigger than we imagine because it has the outreach of the entire world. The problem is, its still so small that a big problem somewhere takes a big toll on the price usually. That's what keeps crypto fun!

I wear my crypto shirts every now and then and all I get are "You gotta teach me how to trade Bitcoins, man". Kind of frustrating because in reality, they don't really care about Bitcoin itself but more like how to make money trading Bitcoin. A lot of the people who are in crypto seem to not really know what anything they are trading is and go by trading news feeds and staring blankly at charts while making up lines lol 
I suppose any awareness is better than no awareness.

Crypto is such a headache for regulators lol It has the ability to be "mostly" fungible while also being able to be lightweight enough to be transferred all over the world in a matter of moments. It is literally nothing that the world has ever dealt with. 
Anything else in the world, even cash, it is physical so you have to smuggle it with the chance of getting caught. I think this is the reason why Bitcoin (and crypto in general) will always stick around. Value transfer worldwide safely.
Its something that just can't be stopped. The only way governments could potentially give crypto a low is to ban it outright and cut off all entries and exits that exist today like Coinbase. The problem is, even if they did that is that people can still transact with it but it wouldn't have a USD value to reference. 
Banning crypto would also have to be a world wide agreement among countries. That won't ever happen.

I'm going to give Gyft a try. Egifter keeps giving me bunk gift cards and when contacted, they just say tough luck.

Actually, the Lambo in the photo has been modified to feed on weak hands. I think it gets 6000 weak hands per gallon.
