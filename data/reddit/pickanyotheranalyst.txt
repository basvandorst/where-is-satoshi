I'm not sure if other exchanges would actually want this. Seems kind of like allowing leveraged tulip trading circa 1630.

Or not. There would be a huge latency between a theoretical full bitcoin adoption and the current systems. Most people like the currency they use, sorry just reality, and they're not stupid so in NIRP environments they'll stop depositing in banks. The countries most inclined to NIRP like Japan risk deflation or in Japan's case furthering deflation. As the purchasing power of their currencies grows, especially as it grows more and more rapidly, consumers are more incentivized to keep their currency.
The hard reality is that bitcoin will never experience widespread adoption until it's a stable store of value.
The ultimate stimulus to bitcoin will be when it's able to be traded by the FX traders looking for pips because it's so stable.

In addition to leveraged shorts, there's even more to be made off options

Why: they could be less liquid than they claim, the present value of the btc accessible via the exchange could be higher now than the present value of dollar settlements after liquidation, bitfinex liquidation could soften the market, etc.
You're right. There's no guarantee someone would necessarily come off worse. But I think the answer to your "how about suing" question is that a more than insignificant amount feel they risk coming off worse. I don't think the company has assets that could cover a loss of close to 50% of bitcoins.

Haircut caused by forced liquidation + legal fees &gt; 36% haircut. 
I can think of some lawyers who are probably trying to get this into works now though.

No central banker has ever said they control the natural rate of interest. They attempt to reflect it in policy, in theory. The natural rate of interest is never nominally sub-zero because the time value of money is always positive. Obviously NIRP attempts to stimulate inflation. But it clearly doesn't work which is why BOJ considered helicopter money.
Not sure what you're attempting to say. Maybe I just don't understand your comment.

The moon memes are always fun. 
Reality: Bitcoin would also be too volatile for real major adoption due to most trading being pegged to fiat that would experience "interesting" trading conditions. On top of this, already illiquid firms wouldn't want to capitalize a secure bitcoin infrastructure in a major crisis. Smart traders would make lots of money though.

Leverage over HRC, delegitimization of American administrations, meddling in the American elections as a test of future viability, long psy ops game that can't be deciphered without classified intelligence on Russian objectives in the long term. 
I buy that its a coin flip between Russians/inside man/other. But it's also a little quick to assume Russians have ZERO incentive.

It would seem that they could't use liquid holdings of other currencies to mitigate the size of the haircut to bitcoin holders without giving a haircut to other currency holders or dipping into profits, no?

Lack of confidence in issuer → high capital velocity → high inflation. You seem to be assuming that A. countries like Japan would fall into that trap after close to 2 decades of QE. I personally think alternative easing policies have some merit and can be used to maintain confidence. &amp; B. lack of confidence in an issuer would translate to confidence in bitcoin. If xbt isn't a stable store of value, they'll likely do what most every other consumer in a country that's experienced the deflation to hyperinflation rollercoaster has done, switch to a stable currency. The dollar comes to mind...
... At least in the short-medium term that is ;^ )
Edit: Liquidity crises are very ugly, but they're technically self-correcting on a long enough timeline. But then again, on a long enough timeline we're all dead.

"what are the implications"
"I will probably invest 10.000€"
These two things should never go in the same sentence. You sound like someone investing a large sum of personal savings. Consider if you've done enough objective research and if this is the capital allocation you want.
