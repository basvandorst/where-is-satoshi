Thanks for your answer. I did not sell my BTC. I only did a withdrawal after buying them (so from Gdax to Coinbase). When I check the history I see the same amount of BTC bought and the same amount being withdrawn so I don't understand why it gives me +91€ and not + 100€ on Coinbase :)

Shit I'm getting to this routine too. Damn I'm screwed...

After buying on Gdax should you send it back to Coinbase?

Make sens. So would you reckon that buying stuff for the moment with BTC would be a wrong decision due to its high volatility?

Can you give me a bit more explanations on this ?

Thanks for making that clear. Even more reasons to hodl

Yeah that's what I understand too...

Try using Gdax. You should not have fees (or low) if i'm not mistaken.
Let me know

Okay I think I kinda get it. I was just expecting that the rate would be the same between Gdax and Coinbase, so when I move 100€ from Coinbase to Gdax and buy 100€ of BTC I was expecting to get 100€ worth of BTC when moving them back to Coinbase. I have to keep in mind that they are 2 different platforms even if they're owned by the same guys. Sorry for the newbie question but that was unclear for me.

Yeah the idea is to get a hardware wallet but in 3-4 months as I'm on the road now and can't order one. Currently my btc are on the exchange (don't know what is a significant amount, let's say between $300 and 700$).   
So I'm just wondering if during these few months what would be the safest way to hodl.
