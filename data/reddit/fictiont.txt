I want to say that its pretty easy to make profits in auch bullish markets. But anyway you made just half, that you will lose on bearish market, if you will follow your rule.

You will just make a big christmas present to GDAX users, who will buy at 1000. Yes, it wpupd move price on other exchanges, maybe 20-30% even. But it will recovee in few days.
You are ready to pay millions loss to make a 2-days selloff?

If you would buy and hodl 2 weeks ago, lets say at 7000, then you would need 2500 USD
Now 0.35 BTC is 3850 USD, so you would have 1350$ profit. Congrats, you losed 600$
When you day trading, you should tell how much BTC you made upon starting amount

I trying to say that he didnt got it by his skills in day trading.
He got it because of market moving up. And he got much less than he got just by holding.
You could get more just for luck (once/twice) or if you skilled day trader (which also should get luck)
In other ways you would get same or less then juat holding.
I tried to earn more a lot of times. If i just hold from jan 2017 and buy each month, i would have 200% bigger earns. Holding from september now, even though i have some daytrader skills and read couple of trading books/manuals/blogs during 3 years.

Its true, it called "day trading". But day traders are professionals, who making money on it for years, and even they losing some on stop-losses, so from this move (10000-9000) typical day trader would get 500-700 points (remember about previous loses to catch this move). But its professionals.
He pointed that he doing it FIRST time. He dont know any about support/resistance/etc. He wouldnt buy at 9000 if he seing that bitcoin crashing. He could sell at 10000 after fall from 11000, it calls panic sell. So if he selled at 10000, usually he would buy back at 10500, when he would be sure that its rise to make this +2% as he said. 
Dont trade just with your feelings. There are a thousands of other persons doing same. And some more of others, that knows how to play on your feelings.
If you try to day trade, firat rule is - DONT SELL ON CRASH AND DONT BUY ON MOON

Why you think that banks are scared? They arent. They keeping their eyes on crypto. 
And banks always would be needed, to provide loans, mortgages, etc.
