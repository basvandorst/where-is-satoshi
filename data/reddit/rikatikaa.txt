For the record, regulations have been put in place to prevent the crash of 08 from happening again. Ask anyone in the mortgage or banking industry, it's increasingly regulated (yet, still not enough) there was a government entity enacted specifically to prevent this again, I'm pretty sure we stopped listening to Greenberg, the President halted all foreclosures and gave everyone a chance to get their house back real quick, I think a tax stimulus package too, I'm sure there's some other things I'm forgetting about but oh well!
Not disagreeing with your point, just trying to clarify some facts for the record!

Her onion is my favorite thing ever she says it is like that she doesn't really know what you want and she wants you to help her with it. I'm not trying to be rude but I'm like a man who he wants me lol

The 90s are before 2008 so that's not what I'm referring to unfortunately. Obama is the one who halted foreclosures. Regulations are still being increased, they just made a major change in the mortgage industry last year changing the way disclosures are given. 
Like I said still not enough, and the banks shouldn't have so much power. The way the government is involved in the banking industry, I doubt their hands are too clean.

Yes, the Big Short was actually rather uneducational if you ask me! But you're not.
