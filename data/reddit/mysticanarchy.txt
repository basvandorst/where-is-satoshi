Yeah guess who appointed Epstein’s lawyer to the offical position of labor secretary, which coincidentally is in charge of combating human trafficking, which again, coincidentally, is an area he cut funding to. 
Not to mention he’s had a case brought against him alleging he and Epstein raped a 13 year old girl which was dropped due to death threats.


I think the takeaway here is that this is not an issue exclusive to either side of politics, and seems to be widely prevalent in the upper echelons of power and not limited by national borders, as we can see from the wide range of international visitors to Epstein’s island.  My guess is people like Epstein are assets used by intelligence agencies to compromise individuals who they can then manipulate once in positions of power. If you’re still hung up on right v left politics you’re not paying attention.

Corrupt governments and corporate actors being exposed and potentially undermining their power to back fiat currencies through military force or economic sanctions would certainly be good for bitcoin IMO, although I’m just being utopian now.

Who’s supporting this idea? Where are people pretending this is true? Or is this just a blatant straw man?
Like I said, if you still don’t understand why the U.S is heavily criticised then you need to study the impact American foreign policy has had on global conflicts over the last century.

Can you name one country that’s had more military interventions in foreign countries than the US in the last 50 years?

Imagine being this clueless that you think Iran supports ISIS in destroying one of their last allies in the Middle East, Syria. If you had even done a tiny amount of research you’d know it’s actual U.S allies and the CIA who supported ISIS in Syria to try and overthrow Assad, an age old tactic. Saudi Arabia and Israel provided support for ISIS while its common knowledge that Iran funds Hezbollah, their own proxy who fought ISIS and defended the Syrian regime. Perhaps you should try educating yourself before spewing your educated opinions everywhere with such conviction, it only embarrasses yourself and detracts from the point you’re trying to make.

Ah yes you’re right, I don’t understand why more people don’t criticise the mongols or the Roman Empire!? Clearly you know the answer to my question or you wouldn’t have dodged it and started with this whataboutism. If you’re genuinely wondering why a lot of people don’t like the U.S maybe you need to research the history of U.S foreign policy over the last century.

Why do you assume he hasn’t already bought bitcoin? Maybe he’s only made the announcement at this time just to boost bitcoin over that $9-$10k threshold it was sitting at?
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:31:12


Seems to imply he hasn’t bought in until now. The timing of the announcement is still interesting either way.

Buying your first satoshis and effectively protesting and disrupting the system more then any no coiner could ever hope to:
If you genuinely believe sitting at a computer buying bitcoin is all it will take to change the world and have a revolution you need to get outdoors more.

Do you actually think I’m a troll or a bot?
So you’re telling me that all we need to do is trade bitcoin and the big bad banks will leave us alone and we will all have financial freedom? This is just naive, or more likely, confirmation bias mixed with self congratulatory ignorance.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is just one method amongst many, but it is no panacea. If you genuinely care about tyranny and freedom you should broaden your perspective. This isn’t a critique of crypto, I am calling out those who think buying bitcoin alone makes them some kind of revolutionary.

What’s the value of being backed by the worlds largest military and being the petrodollar?
