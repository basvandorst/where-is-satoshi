Agreed about the energy price. 10 cents per kWh is almost double the average cost for miners

Nebraska? more like NeBitcoin

Is this metric tons per year? Why would the numbers be decreasing?

Stay positive brother

Well ultimately someone has to pay for the electricity, and presumably the only thing created by it (to pay for it), however far downstream, is the bitcoin that was mined. And if they’re mining at a loss, this system ain’t gonna work

lol- "I'm Nigerian Nakamoto and want to send you Bitcoin, but need you to send me some first"

This is great!!! thinking about tweeting it and giving you creds- how do you want me to cred you?

Good point. Cool to see people try to use Bitcoin in everyday life!

Well didn’t you amass the list?

...in hindsight isn’t that what most of these ICOs were? Lol

Octonions are the highest level math we can prove exists, which only goes to 8 dimensions (really 7 bc e0 is a scalar). And yeah, you are right that if they are carrying our universe in their backpack then they probably won’t care about Bitcoin. Lol

Fair.. but we probably wouldn’t be able to mine their coin bc the PoW would be too high and the latency of propagating to their network would be too great. That’s why speed of light will be a limiting factor for how widely used crypto’s will be in general
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:58:41
�� IT’s a trap!!!

How do you think they’ll solve byzantine fault tolerance/consensus?
