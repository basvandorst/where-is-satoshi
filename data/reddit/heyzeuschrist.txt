I have answered so many of your questions and now you're asking questions to things you already know the answer to.   
If you lose your private key you can generate another backup. If you lose your phone and all of your backups you're shit out of luck.  Similarly, if you lose your cash you're also shit out of luck.   Your original post was asking about the benefits of bitcoin. When benefits are addressed you ignore them or act like they don't apply to you or anyone else in the world. 
You seem to be getting angry by this bringing my age and education up is kind of irrelevant and insulting.   
I'm asking because your comments are often riddled with typos and ignorance. I want to know who I'm wasting my time on because I genuinely want to have a conversation about the benefits of bitcoin and I'm not convinced you do.   I work in finance. I see situations every day where bitcoin would be useful. 


Yes, and this is often what trolls do. 
 &gt;I honestly am looking for an answer for because it doesn't make sense to me.  Im sorry if your answer's don't seem like real benefits to an average consumer to me but would you prefer I lied and said they did?  But like I said I have no background in finance so here I am trying to learn.   
How can you reasonably say you haven't come across a single benefit after all these comments unless you're  trolling.    
How can you sit there and say instant global transfer of wealth is not a benefit that you can acknowledge?

Hey man, if you don't get it you don't get it. Any time someone explains a benefit or feature you come back saying "yeah but that doesn't apply to me" or "that's not average." I'm not sure you know what the average person deals with on a daily basis.   
As I said, I'm a financial advisor. Every single day I see people having problems with their day to day banking where bitcoin can solve their problem.   
If you can't think of one situation where bitcoin would be beneficial in someone's life you're either not trying or simply trolling.  
If I lose my wallet my cash is gone.  
If I lose my phone my bitcoin is not gone.   
That is just one example of where bitcoin is useful. If you can't see that as a benefit than I honestly can't help you.

You only have debit and credit cards with the same bank? I have chase, citi, Amex, bank of America, and a couple of department store credit cards. Can you walk to your bank and get new department store cards? Can you replace all of your cards with different banks in one trip to one bank? No you can't. 
Please answer this question honestly.  What's more convenient, walking to the bank during the hours their open in order for them to get you a new card... Or typing twelve words in your phone at any time during the day? Which one is honestly more convenient?
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:04:28

I once lost my leather wallet. I had $250 in there. I can't reverse losing cash. That cash is gone forever.   
I once had someone break into my house and steal my mom's jewelry, cash, and some of our electronics.  That's all gone forever. Can't reverse that. 
Individual stupidity and single targeted attacks are very hard to remove from the equation.   
Bitcoin removes millions of people being hacked all at one time from the equation. That is a huge advantage.   
Bitcoin is programmable money aka smart money. If someone robs me at gun point and steals my leather wallet, all of my cash is gone. If someone robs me at gun point and has me send them my bitcoins to them in a non reversable transaction, I can put a fake password in so it only appears I sent the money to that person when I really sent it to a different wallet I own. Can't do that with cash.  
Understand, bitcoin is not perfect. Bitcoin is not meant to completely replace cash, credit cards, and checks. Bitcoin simply solves a lot of problems that currently exist in the financial world. Not only does it solve a lot of problems, but it also allows us to do stuff with money we could never do before. Bitcoin isn't necessarily the end all be all replacement. Bitcoin is simply another option with advantages and disadvantages. At the end of the day it's another option we didn't have before.    
Email allows instant global communication.  Bitcoin allows instant global transfer of wealth. Both have advantages and disadvantages.    
The world is better with email.   
The world is better with bitcoin.  
Email didn't replace letter writing. Email just added another option for communication.   
Bitcoin won't replace cash, checks, and cards... It simply adds another option.  
More options are always better than less options.

If I lose my phone I don't lose my bitcoin.  Same thing.   


If I loose my debit which is more or less the only currency I carry and what the majority of transaction are done on I cal the bank, Cancel it, and go get s new card.    
Yes and that is a bigger hassle than typing 12 words.  


Yes and this is why people keep multiple backups. No one is losing all of their backups at once.  


You haven't clearly explained why the examples I've given you are not benefits.

Why are you asking questions about the US dollar and then when examples are given as to the benefits of bitcoin you come back and say you haven't used cash in a long time?
The US dollar is physical cash.  
If I lose my US dollars they are gone forever.  If I lose my phone where my bitcoins are I can enter 12 words and recover my money.  
If you do not see that as a benefit you are a troll. Period. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:36:12


Target, Home Depot, PSN, Wendy's, and countless other companies or websites have been hacked where thousands if not millions of people had their credit card information stolen. Gas stations, restaurants, bars groceries stores all have the occasional person working there who will steal your card information. Identity theft is a huge problem.   
If you, the everyday consumer, were to use bitcoin instead of credit cards for these purchases, you would not be subject to identify theft and therefore avoid a huge headache.     
That's only one benefit yet it's a pretty  big one.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:48:23


Bartenders, food servers, delivery drivers, and  ton of other "average" people deal with cash a lot on a daily basis. You are not the only person who exists in this world. You  are acting like you genuinely want to learn more about bitcoin but it's clear you  don't. You're clearly trolling. 


You also need to have them send you new cards in the mail as well. Meaning you are without cards to make purchases for significantly longer than it takes to type 12 words.  You know that's  benefit over credit cards.  Stop trolling.    


They insure your fiat dollars. I specifically brought up the example of gold which you ignored. Do they also insure gold bars? Probably not. If your bars of gold are stolen will they replace your gold bars?   Stop trolling. 
 &gt;So if my bank is robbed My deposits are insured up to 100 000.    
What about gold? What if you have $500,000?     
It's obvious you're a troll.  
I've already said it before.  Bitcoin is simply another option. Bitcoin is not the be all end all replacement to cards cash and checks.  Bitcoin is simply another option. Stop acting like you don't see benefits to bitcoin.

Yes, but plenty of people do. You're asking about average consumers. Unless you're trolling, this thread is about average consumers and not just you.  
Have your friends ever spotted you money when you were in a cash only position and didn't have cash? Bitcoin is a cash alternative. I've had my friends cover for me a number of times and I always give them the option "I can give you bitcoin now or cash later, what would you prefer?"  
Most of the time they prefer getting paid now. 


It's an example. The point of the example was sometimes people are targeted and attacked.   Bitcoin is an asset. Sometimes assets get stolen. 


Uhh, what makes you think you are qualified to make that statement?   
I'm a financial advisor. My client base is the average consumer. People do international wire transfers all the time.  Parents sending money to their children studying abroad or to family in their home country. Do you have any idea how much wealth gets moved around globally? 


Yes. And bitcoin is kinda replacing other payment options for a lot of people.    
You've been given a plethora of examples from me and a lot of other people.   
Now, you tell me, why might the average person consider using bitcoin? In your opinion, what benefits can bitcoin bring to the average person?

Most bitcoin users dont keep a serious amount on their phone. They keep it in a hardware wallet. That's besides the point though.  The point is losing cash is still losing cash. If you lose cash whether it's $1 or $100 it's lost forever.  With bitcoin it's easily recoverable.  How is money that can be recovered not a benefit over cash? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:45:08


     
When people move their coins into an exchange they are releasing control of their private keys. They no longer own their bitcoins. Instead, the exchange owns their  bitcoins.  Much like putting gold in a vault at a bank. If the bank gets robbed and they steal the gold, the gold is gone.  
I have the private keys for my coins in a 12 word seed.   
If I lose my phone I can simply download the mycelium app on my tablet, input my 12 words, and instantly have full access to my coins again.   
I control my private keys therefore I control my bitcoins.  
Losing my leather wallet and losing my cash and having to replace all of my credit cards is a significantly bigger hassle than typing 12 words and instantly having all of my money back.   
Does that make sense? Do you now see at least one benefit to using bitcoin or does losing your phone / wallet not apply to you because you've never lost your wallet and the average person doesn't lose their wallet either? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:55:41

Ignoring a loud pest in the middle of the night doesn't make it go away.   
Bcash shills are constantly claiming to be "the real bitcoin."   
The problem isn't a closed circuit problem existing in some sort of vacuum. The pest spans across social media and the mainstream media.   
As it stands, Bcash has only existed a few months and most people don't know if the loud pest they hear is a lion or a cricket.    
Posts like these put things into perspective.  
You cause a divide by advocating people ignore the pest and assume it to be the  weak cricket rather than to shine the flashlight and remove all doubt.    
Especially with all the newcomers, it's important to put things into perspective and realize the pest is nothing more than a loud cricket. Loud yet harmless.

I'm willing to accept the possibility it was my own error however I think things could have been clearer to prevent the mistake.  This was a few weeks ago.  
When I clicked send I don't recall a confirmation about the fee in Satoshis or USD. I just remember it going thru and then seeing I paid way too much.

Yeah, I'm generally pessimistic around things like big timed announcements.  
These are small little heartbeats for bitcoin. I'm pretty sure the Winklevoss ETF back in the spring followed a familiar pattern. A bunch of buys leading up to the timed event causing a small but noticeable increase upwards, a panic sell bringing it down, and then stabilization within a few minutes.   
These timed events never shift the trading trend of bitcoin. They typically only give it a minor heartbeat which from a macro perspective is all just normal bitcoin.   
Then again, I'm not a trader. I build investment portfolios focused around specific goals so short term volatility is meaningless to me.

Imagine a one lane highway from one end of a country to another. This highway is the one and only highway used to get to and from work for the entire country.     
 When cars were first invented, only one lane was needed but as more and more people started using cars, the highway started to get congested causing traffic delays.   
A reasonable way to reduce traffic is to make more lanes on the highway for more people to fit. Having 2, 4, hell maybe even 8 lanes seems like a reasonable way to reduce traffic. This is the BCH aka Bcash solution to solve the congestion problem and definitely a very simple solution.  The big problem here is, this is very short sighted. Once you start having 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 lane highways, you get to a point where you are running out of land and making the highway indefinitely larger just becomes infeasible. The simple solution is not necessarily the best solution.      
On the other hand, you have BTC aka Bitcoin which would rather build maglev trains, airplanes, and rocket ships, instead of simply making highways wider, in order to reduce congestion.    
Or in otherwords, Bitcoin innovates while Bcash remains stagnant.

Well, first and foremost, everyone's situation is different obviously. However,  generally speaking, young people should not be chasing short term profits on their investment unless there is a critical need / emergency to use the funds.   When it comes to investing, time is your number one greatest factor.   
The Hodl meme is simply the "buy and hold" strategy with a new name. The importance of hodling goes with every investment.   
Like Warren Buffet said, if you wouldn't hold onto an investment for 10 years why hold it for 10 minutes?

KEEP LIVING LIKE YOU'RE POOR!   
Due to compounding interest the money you save in your 20's is the most important money that needs to be saved and invested throughout your life..  
You're a smart kid. Just fuck around with a loan and interest calculator. 20k over 40 years averaging 7% annual return and compounding annually is about $300k. 30 years is $150k and 50 years is about $600k. This doesn't even take into consideration additional monthly contributions. Adding only $100 / month to your investment adds an additional $500k to your net worth after 50 years.  
 "Catching up" in your 40's and 50's doesn't work. It leaves you broke.   
You were given a gift. Think about your future self, not your current self.

While true, people get raped regardless of what they wear, it doesn't change the fact bad people will do bad things to easy targets.    
 
A girl walking alone at night in a bad neighborhood dressed provocatively will bring unwanted attention and possibly unwanted action to herself.   
A girl walking with a group of people at night in a bad neighborhood dressed proactively will still bring the unwanted attention to herself but the chances of the unwanted action occurring is reduced substantially if not eliminated.    
Coincidentally I was having a similar conversation with my friend last night. She lives in a major city and told me she's been mugged on several occasions. Most of the times she was mugged she was either carrying her mini purse on her wrist (I think they're called wristlets??) or her wallet was just in her hand, or her wallet was in the mesh pocket of her bookbag visible for all to see. In every situation she was an easy target.

By hoarding you're hurting your investment.    
If you want bitcoin to grow there needs to be demand.    
By hoarding your bitcoin you're not stimulating the bitcoin economy but rather holding it back. You're hurting your own precious investment.    
The more merchants experience customers using Bitcon or expressing a desire to use it the quicker adoption occurs creating more demand and higher prices for bitcoin.    
Everytime I spend my bitcoin I'll replace with a larger amount so that way I'm constantly accumulating more in addition to my regular intervals.   
In fact, because I spend and replace, I'm accumulating faster than you are and therefore growing my wealth quicker than you.

Good job. Investing can be mentally exhausting. Setting a firm date helps reduce stress. There have been plenty of times I wanted to sell because it was up or down but thank God I set a firm date otherwise I'd be a sad boi. I like to pretend my investments are CDs that can't be touched until maturity date and they also require a minimum monthly deposit. 
Remember, DCA in. DCA out.  
Also, for the love of God become more frugal. Reducing your expenses is so underrated. Just because you have money, **doesn't mean you have money to spend**. I make 6 figures and live a lifestyle as if I only make 40k per year. I used to be on food stamps so I'm accustom to living like I'm broke. All of my clothes are 5-10 years old. My car is 10 years old. My apartment is only slightly furnished (eg. I use cardboard boxes for a bed side table and my couch was a family members who was throwing it away).

See? This is all emotion. Your comment wasn't reasoned out before responding, you simply let your emotions speak for you instead of speaking on behalf of your emotions. There's no logic. There's no reason. You didn't actually read what I said. You just reacted to it.  It's all emotion. And that's the problem.    
          
Take this as a learning opportunity folks.  In the same way reacted to my comment with emotion instead of reason, most investors make the same mistake with their money.   
I can't even tell you how many clients demanded to sell out of their retirement  investments in preparation or reaction to Trump, NK, different elections, Brexit, oil crashing, or just because they wanted to buy a new car or go on vacation etc..   People are always letting their emotions speak on behalf of their money instead of establishing a plan to make their money work for them so they no longer need to work for money.       


The idea that anyone should have, what you have claimed to be, 90% of their assets losing value to inflation, aka a *guaranteed loss of purchasing power*, is skipping right over ludicrous and [going  plaid.](   
Depends on the situation. Depends on the person. Depends on the investment goal. Depends on the financial stability of the person. Depends on the risk tolerance of the person. Depends on the short and long term plan. Depends on how it was acquired. Depends on how long they've held the asset. Depends on the tax consequences. Depends on when it's occuring. It all depends on so many factors. Every person is different.

It depends on a lot of factors. How thorough was your conversation with him?

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:33:04


 Was I given good or bad advice? Would it have still been a good idea to at least diversify my money into other accounts if I had to pay debt?
To add onto my comment and depending on your situation I would say you received bad advice. Because with that logic, anyone with a mortgage should not be investing.   
Again, it all depends on a lot of factors. You also likely spoke with a banker not necessarily a financial advisor. The banker was likely comparing your return on investment to CD's. In that case he was correct and you got good advice. Putting money in a 5 year CD and earning 1.6% interest is a waste of your money while you have 7% student loans. Although student loans are potentially tax deductible. Again, there's a lot of factors to consider. Giving financial advice isn't a cookie cutter process.

Not sure if troll or legit but whatever.  
Something to consider is that as far as the digital world has existed, we've always been able to copy and paste data.   
For the first time, bitcoin prevents us from being able to copy and paste data. Bitcoin is the world's first finite digital asset. It's a finite digital asset that can be transferred instantaneously, globally, and anonymously for little cost.   
To say it has no value is purely subjective in the same way I think a Picasso painting has no value. It's just paint on a canvas arranged a certain way. There's no real value behind that.

The Internet of Money Volume 1:       
Start here.  
Watch all 11 videos in the playlist.  
Understand what you're investing in to the best of your understanding.   
If you're in the US you can go to coinbase.com or gemini.com (I suggest both incase one site is down for maintenance).    
Determine an amount of money you're willing to lose.   
Establish a firm timeframe for how long you want to stay invested in bitcoin regardless of whether or not you're up or down.   
Determine a price target that you would consider to be life changing money.  
Dollar cost average into BTC.    
Once you've met your price target or timeframe, begin dollar cost averaging out of BTC. Enough to recoup your principal. Establish emergency saving. Pay off debt.  Buy yourself something somewhat expensive but not too expensive that you'll cherish for a long time. And then let the rest ride until you can retire while dollar cost averaging some more.     
Good luck.

First it's going to trend downwards after an insane peak.   
That will take a total of about 8-12 months.   
Next it will be relatively stable for about 3-6 months.   
Then it will slowly trend upwards for 6-12 months.   
Finally we'll reach new highs and go parabolic before crashing and burning to a number 5-12 times higher than it is now before repeating the cycle.

I wrote a long response and then accidentally deleted it. So now you're getting a Tldr. Sorry.    
I don't think it's appropriate to say every portfolio should have XYZ in it. I can't make an honest recommendation in an open architecture portfolio without understanding my client's financial situation, their comfort with risk and volatility, and the goals they're trying to achieve (among other things).    
That which is appropriate for a 25 year old may not be appropriate for a 93 year old.   
Every individual is different. Therefore every portfolio is different.    
Assuming what a client needs before understanding what they need likely means I'd be acting in self-interest as opposed to their best interest.    
As a professional and fiduciary, bitcoin should not be in everyone's portfolio.   
As a Bitcoin fanboy, however, everyone should own bitcoin.

 They don't control their private keys.      They don't care about cryptography.     They don't use bitcoin as a way to escape the legacy financial system.    
They use bitcoin as an investment.    
The minority of people who use bitcoin for its decentralized &amp; permissionless nature are likely on Reddit.  However the majority common man just has FOMO and wants to take a risk on the next Google.   
People are going to use bitcoin and crypto in more than just it's purpose. Denying that fact is simply ignorant.   
The majority of people don't use the Internet for its "purpose" but rather for the purpose they benefit from.

Lmao, you moron. I often do shorten bitcoin down to bits.

And no one gets offended because my friends understand what an abbreviation is and aren't a bunch of hyper sensitive pussies like you and When did I say BCH stands for Bcash?    
I didn't.  
I said Bcash is a naturally easy way to shorten things down for the sake of  simplicity.  It's called an abbreviation.     
Just like T-notes and T-bonds are naturally easy ways to shorten Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds.    
  
Bcash is not a slur. It's an abbreviation.  
The whole reason Ver cries about Bcash, like the little bitch that he is, is because the plan has always been to shorten Bitcoin Cash down to "Bitcoin" so he can confuse newbies who don't know any better.   
When the market shortened it to Bcash before he could slowly socially engineer the moronic masses, like yourself, into calling it Bitcoin he started throwing a soy boy hissy fit.

Lmao     
***whoosh***    
You are not grasping the concept of what it means to be charged a fee, vs bidding against another individual to receive a product or service.  
Do you know what bidding is?  
Do you know what it means to bid on something?     
Sending bitcoin is not at all the opposite.   It's literally the same things as bidding on eBay.   
Bidding is bidding. 
You are bidding to have your transaction be part of the blockchain.   
You are bidding for a service.  
You are bidding to have miners exert energy in order to get your transaction into the next block.    
Those who bid the highest receive the service of having their transaction be part of the next block. Those who bid lowest do not get the service of getting into the next block.     
Those who bid the highest on eBay receive a product instead of a service. Those who bid lowest do not receive the product instead of a service.  
Whether you're bidding for a service or a product, the concept of bidding is the same.     
Bitcoin miner fees are determined by you bidding against other individuals,  who are bidding against you. In the exact same way you bid against other people in eBay to receive a product while others his against you.   
Bitcoin miner fees are not the same as a fee being charged by eBay.    
If this concept is too difficult to grasp, you may have a learning disability.

You completely just tried to evade the question. Here man, I'll help you out.   
If the miners were ***charging*** the fee, users would have no say in what fee they paid. The fee being ***charged*** is set by the miners.     
Miners don't charge fees. They collect fees. Fees are determined by a bidding war amongst users.  
Users set the fees.  
Users try to outbid each other in order to get priority treatment over which fee is ***collected*** by the miners in order to have their transaction added to the next block within the blockchain.  
The more users who set higher and higher fees in order to get priority treatment, the higher the average transaction cost.    
It's a bidding war.    
If you want your transaction to have priority you set a higher fee to compete against other people who are setting the fee to be collected by the miners.   
Does that make sense? Do you understand the difference between charging a fee and collecting a fee? This is not a rhetorical question.

I'm sorry dude, but once you start using the whole "we must protect the children" argument I know you're coming from emotion and not facts.   
Silk Road was regarded as a significantly safer alternative to buying illegal drugs (or anything really) over the street.  
There was no epidemic of children overdosing on drugs from silk road.    
Your argument is pure emotion.  
If you want to stop children from overdosing on drugs then be a better parent.

@_date: 2018-05-25 01:54:23
I kept mine solely for 1 reason.   
I believe there is a lot of deception and manipulation within the crypto community given its lack of regulatory oversight. Don't misunderstand me here, I don't want regulatory oversight. I believe the market will solve its own problems. However, there are certain things people can easily get away with.  
For example, Roger Ver is one of the biggest and loudest advocates for BCH and owns the website bitcoin dot com.  
He is actively trying to mislead people into believing Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. He even goes as far as calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin" but pairs it with the ticker symbol BCH as evidenced below.   
     
Needless to say this is exceptionally misleading and deceptive. If someone tried to do that with traditional investments they would have an abundance of lawsuits coming their way.    
Why do I bring this up?  Because I think a lot of people will fall for his deception, and the deception of others,  and accidentally buy BCH due to his influence over bitcoin dot com, the other sub, and other platforms.   
Most non tech savy people who want to learn about bitcoin will default go to a dot com website instead of the appropriate dot org.    
For this simple reason alone, I'm holding on to my BCH for now.    
There is a less than 1% chance that I will ever buy BCH.

BTC dominance is the dumbest measure of bitcoin's success or measure of anything. Of course as new coins enter the market it will reduce BTC's dominance. The more orange juice I pour into my vodka, the less vodka dominance in my screw driver.

I work in financial services. My colleague is licensed in technical analysis and did it professionally for 7 or 8 years.  Generally speaking, his opinion is year end predictions like that are kind of foolish.   
Based off of the charts he showed me, it appears we need to get past July before we can start predicting anything.    
Technical analysis is not a science it's more of a guide or suggestion. It can help with short term trading but is far from being a science.    
All in all we would need a lot more buying pressure to get above 20k.  
Is it possible? Absolutely. Is it likely? Well, no one knows. Only the future will tell us the truth.   
The price is irrelevant if you intend to dollar cost average into bitcoin.

Do you not realize the service you're paying for is to have your transaction added to the next block?   
Your fee is determined by bidding. If you are outbid then you have to wait for the next block.     
Miners do not charge fees. They collect fees after bidders bid against each other.

How comfortable are you with taking risks in life? Very comfortable or not at all?   
If you're comfortable with potentially seeing your investment drop to zero for the off chance that it might increase substantially then go for it. Buy and hold. Give yourself a time frame. "no matter what the price does, I will not sell for 5 years. Even if it goes to zero." 
If you think you'd likely panic and sell if it goes down 50% in value, then maybe investing isn't right for you.  
Either way, you need to look at this as long term and be willing to ride the wave of volatility.   
I can't promise you it will go up in value. And I can't promise you it will go down. 
I can promise you however it will be an interesting ride nonetheless.    
What would be more detrimental to you? Losing 10,000 dollars because your investment went to 0? Or knowing your 10,000 could have turned to a million of only you took the chance?   
Life's a gamble. You decide if you want to roll the dice or not.    
I first bought at 980 about 3 years ago and watched it fall to below 200. And now it's back to 1,000.   
I never once sold. Even when I was down 80%.

Haha 100%. I would never advise a client to do that. My number one concern for clients is making sure they are taking as little risk as possible. 
However, when advising myself, this is actually an extremely smart position to be taking.    
Consider this, most non retirement brokerage accounts allow for margin trading. Margin trading often has about an 8% interest rate and goes down with the more you borrow. However the interest starts accruing right away. 
A 0% credit card, however, is simply a balloon loan. It costs a 1 time fee of 3% to borrow and then 0% for 18 months. As long as I have enough fiat in my checking account to pay the credit card in full before the interest kicks in then I'm essentially taking on no credit card risk. 
It's an extremely risky and aggressive position to take. But the risk that comes with using a credit card is removed by always having enough fiat to pay the card off in full.  
Tl;dr - when investing in bitcoin, never invest more than you're willing to lose. When acquiring debt, never borrow more than you're able to pay off.  
I'm an extremely aggressive investor. I have some investments that have lost me 70% of my principal and some that have returned me over 1,000%. But ultimately I know what I'm doing.

I have a better idea.   It's kind of wild but bear with me.    
 Instead of having a centralized authority dictating which memes are okay and when we can post them, how about we instead decentralize the publication of memes by some how incorporating a voting system. I'm thinking something that allows every user to have one vote. If they like the meme and want other people to see it they can vote it up for more attention. If they don't like the meme they can vote it down for less attention.

Possibly. And they would have been correct.   


Because a qualified individual would never advise a client to put their entire life savings into one stock. They would say make it part of your portfolio and diversify your assets to reduce the amount of volatility you incur.

Obsolescence - if bitcoin becomes obsolete it will be replaced by another cryptocurrency. If that happens you'll know about it and be able to diversify your crypto. As it stands, there is no reason to assume bitcoin will become obsolete in the near future and especially not overnight. It will be a long and obvious drawn out process like MySpace.   
Regulation can really only go so far. Christ, plenty of drugs are highly regulated yet it's often easier to buy pot illegally than it is to buy alcohol legally. Because bitcoin is decentralized there is nothing that can really outlaw it or shut it down. Bitcoin solves too many problems in the financial industry to not be adopte in some regard. Bitcoin allows for innovation and politicians are typically a fan of innovation and growth in a society.   
Anything else - Google "purchasing power of the US Dollar".   
It's a steady decline in value. That's inflation. That is a guaranteed loss in value of your money.    
Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etfs, bitcoin, real estate, rare coins, autographs, collectibles, art, bitcoin etc etc etc are not a guaranteed loss of value like fiat currency. They are all things that fluctuate in price. Often  upward. I'd much rather "gamble" my fiat currency into something that has a higher chance of growing in value than leaving it in an inflationary fiat currency. 
You say I'm a gambler not realizing life is a gamble. You could die tomorrow. You could become paralyzed tomorrow. You could go to jail tomorrow. Anything can happen.   
What are you doing to make your money gain in value rather than guarantee a loss in value?  
After spending the past 3 years learning everything I can about bitcoin I can't see how it won't be successful.

A few months ago, on a whim, I bought some litecoin, dash and ethereum.  
So far only litecoin is down.   
Ethereum I honestly don't have much faith in but it seems as though it's gained a lot of popularity as the number 2 spot so I'm willing to throw some btc at it incase the use of smart contracts increases with this crypto.  
As it stands I think dash might have some upside potential. 
Dash has been climbing the ranks and seems to be more user friendly. I don't know much about it but I think it solves some problems within btc.  
Litecoin was always seen as the silver to bitcoins gold. It may have some potential but I'm more starting to think it's becoming more and more worthless.   
Ultimately I think in another 5 years a lot more infrastructure will be established and we'll really see if any alt coins (or bitcoin) have any real worth in society.  
For now all of my alt coin holdings I view as extremely risky gambles and bitcoin my more conservative investment.

In order for a government to control liquidity they'd need to purchase a vast majority of bitcoin. If they do, the price of bitcoin would skyrocket. The likelihood of a government attempting this let alone succeeding is slim to none.

My take on why this was posted.   
Money laundering and terrorism are often associated with bitcoin.  
However, cash and banks are the biggest money launderers.   
When people complain about Bitcoin being a tool for money laundering, it's nice to have a connection to cash proving widespread money laundering of the current strongest currency while there aren't any for bitcoin (or nearly as much) for Bitcoin.  
In other words. I think OP was trying to say "fuck you" to cash and centralized systems.

**Bats Exchange Objects to SEC’s Denial of Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF**   
    Exchange-traded fund would track the price of the digital currency    
WASHINGTON—An exchange that would have listed the first exchange-traded fund to track the price of the digital currency bitcoin is formally objecting to a regulatory decision rejecting the idea.     
Bats BZX Exchange, operated by CBOE Holdings Inc., told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to effectively appeal the SEC staff’s March 10 decision to turn down the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, according to a letter posted on the SEC’s website.      
Bats said it plans to petition the commission to take up the matter, which had been delegated to its staff. It isn’t clear if there is any mechanism requiring the commission to act on such a petition. The SEC is operating with just two commissioners, three less than its full complement.     
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust first applied for approval of the product nearly four years ago. The bitcoin industry had been hoping an exchange-traded product would make the currency attractive to Wall Street and retail investors. The SEC’s denial set that back.     
The Bats letter was dated March 17 but not posted publicly until this week. A spokeswoman for Bats declined to comment Wednesday. An SEC spokeswoman had no immediate comment.

My point exactly.   
I really don't think the etf is going to do a whole lot to the price. Most investors have never heard of bitcoin. Most people who work in finance still think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or already dead. 
Only the bitcoin community has been anxiously waiting for this approval.

@_date: 2017-01-22 18:55:16
If this were all up to me... 
1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin or 1 BTC.     
1 bit = 1/1,000 of a bitcoin.    
1 millibit = 1/1,000 of a bit or 1/100,000 BTC.   
1 satoshi = 1/100 of a millibit or 1/100,000,000   
 
Currently when talking to my friends when I cover their bar tab or something I tell them to just "send me some coin" or "throw a few bits my way."   
Microbit sounds corny. I love bitcoin, don't get me wrong. But transacting in microbits is not sexy.

It's not petty at all. The whole point of reviews is to give feedback to the world and the company on how the company is doing. Circle developed name brand recognition due to the service they provided to the bitcoin community and then completely abandoned the community that built them up.

 If they weren't driving a profit selling pizza, then they should have offered soft drinks to go along with the pizza. Or put some advertisements on their pizza boxes to help generate revenue. Or increased the cost of their pizzas. Instead... They chose to stop serving pizza all together in an attempt to ramp up how cool their one and only arcade game is when the main reason people went to the arcade place to begin with was to eat the delicious pizza not to play an arcade game.  
At the end of the day. Circle was a great company the grew in popularity like wildfire within the bitcoin community. In return, Circle extinguished the fire and will now die a cold, lonely, and miserable death.

It was less than 5BTC.  
I just don't understand what causes the fee to change in value. I transfered a few millibits earlier in the day and that was $0.16 which is higher than I was expecting but $0.99??? I just don't understand. I thought the fee would be ~0.16 whether it was 10mBTC or 300BTC. If I were to send 300BTC how much would the fee be?

Just a guess - the $50 million funding by Goldman Sachs decided they wanted Circle to go a different direction.   
Pissing off the bitcoin community is a risk worth taking. The bitcoin community is small in the grand scheme of things. Circle was able to test their app in the bitcoin community to see how well it was received. After the anger from the bitcoin community cools down, Goldman Sachs will aggressively market Circle to the fiat community and it will likely be successful. Bitcoin is often associated with buying drugs online among the ignorant masses. Bitcoin has a negative reputation. Goldman Sachs will make more money abandoning the bitcoin community and essentially rebranding.    
Perhaps I'm wrong but at the end of the day, the reason why Circle dropped bitcoin is because of Goldman Sachs.

Started buying at 980. Dollar cost average for 2.5 years. Current average price is around $350 - 400. Currently up 40% above principal. However this does not factor in the reduction in mbtc used to purchase a variety of goods and services. So in reality I'm up more these are all just rough numbers anyway. 
But in the end it doesn't really matter. I just prefer using bitcoin with my Internet shopping. That extra layer of privacy goes a long way with me. 
Price is irrelevant. Bitcoin is an online store of wealth. It all depends on how you choose to utilize it.

It's a matter of simplicity and recognizing where bitcoin is today. Bitcoin and the language surrounding it will naturally evolve based on simplicity.  
If one bitcoin is ever worth $100,000 to $1,000,000 then yes, let's use bits. But when the USD is closer to parity with mBTC it makes more sense to use millibits.   
Using bits at current prices is like using cents when discussing prices in USD equivalents.   
"How much is the bar tab?"   
"Oh, it's only 7,920 cents."   
"How much did you pay for your car?"  
"3,275,500 cents."   
People don't like to say unnecessarily long strings of numbers. People like to simplify numbers, especially when referring to money seeing as how it's such a big part of our lives.   
"Bar tab was only 79 millibits." 
"I bought my car for 32 Bitcoins."   As oppose to 32 million bits.  
Keep the number small, change the denomination as appropriate.   
Hope you see the light.

Writing a review is how customers provide feedback to a company in a public setting.   
If a company advertises a service that they offer, and I provide them with all of my personal information in order to receive that service, only to have them stop offering the service which caused me to give them my personal information...  then I have not only the right but obligation to write a review expressing my dissatisfaction in the company for the whole world to see.

It's reasonable to conclude the halving can affect price, absolutely. Basic supply and demand. Can we put a time prediction on it? Not exactly.    
I believe 3-6 months  leading up to the halving we will see a slight bull run in anticipation of the halving.   
The actual halving will be uneventful.   
And then 6-9 months later we should see the effects of the halving affecting the price upwards as miners need to sell to offset costs and less bitcoin is being circulated (err being injected) into the cryptoconomy.

This guy.    
Right here.   
Me. 
I.  
I am using bitcoin to purchase goods.   
I don't know how to make it any clearer.  I use bitcoin. Therefore I receive goods.  
You can't just disregard my use of bitcoin as being invalid because the receiver of my bitcoin sells it for fiat. That does not negate my experience and my use of bitcoin.   You can't say "no one is actually using it" when I'm blatantly telling you I'm actually using it.    
If you don't understand why this is a real use of bitcoin then idk what to tell you.     
There is literally nothing different in my experience. Whether I use a debit card or bitcoin. Either way. I'm spending a currency, or as you put it "trading currency", in exchange for goods.  
Either experience brings about the same result. The only difference is one avenue is cooler and significantly cheaper. You know, the one that "isn't real."  Which is odd because the toilet paper I purchased with bitcoin feels very real on my ass. So I'm not sure how it's not real.

This!   
This is exactly why I don't care what the price is.   
1) I strongly believe anything under $5,000 is still extremely undervalued especially while bitcoin is still in its infancy and under major development. $5,000 / btc would bring the bitcoin market cap from where it is today at about $14bn to ~$80bn. In comparison, Apple has a market cap of ~$620bn. 
2) I also view putting my money in bitcoin no different than me putting money in my savings account or into my 401k. Either way it's liquid money that is being ***saved*** not spent. Yes, there is volatility. Hell, life is volatile. Bitcoin could crash to zero tomorrow (highly unlikely) and you could drop dead tomorrow (more likely). The price doesn't matter. It's money that's being saved for the future.   
Keep buying. Dollar cost average.

Correct. Market cap refers to the market value of a company. Technically gold doesn't have a market cap either but everyone knows what you mean when you talk about the market cap of gold.  
It's an example, dude. Not an identical comparison. 
For all intents and purposes, bitcoin behaves like a stock and it's easy to draw a comparison between the two even though they're very different.  When people are ignorant about a subject, the best way to explain it is drawing a comparison to something they are familiar with.

It's just like Benghazi? What? How could you possibly draw that comparison?     
Benghazi was the investigation of an objectively true terrorist attack  resulting in a US ambassador being killed. Ambassadors report directly to the SOS.  
Of course there is going to be a thorough investigation into the individual who was responsible for the safety of those who died. There is an objectively true path of evidence and an official chain of command to properly investigate.       
This is nothing like Benghazi... There is no objective evidence to begin investigating in order to formulate a credible accusation.   
Benghazi started with investigating a terrorist attack. Something that was objectively true and objectively happened.    
You have to start with something that is objectively true, not subjectively true. You don't start with a suspicion, or a hunch, or a chance ***and then*** prove  that person to be innocent. 
***Before*** you accuse someone of something you need to have objective evidence against them.

Exactly!   
We are early adopters. Owning 1 bitcoin is still an achievable goal. Just a couple years ago it was easy to own 100 and a couple years before that 1,000.   
Bitcoin is volatile af. Huge gains, huge losses.   
This is a rapidly growing technology that has no signs of slowing down.  
The lower the price the more I can accumulate.    
I'm a long term investor, not a short term gambler.

Bitcoin is a new asset. New assets often borrow the names of old assets in order to ease the understanding of the new asset and make it as relatable as possible. I don't think the term is being "misused"  but rather borrowed or shared. Language evolves. Market cap is evolving.

Have you heard of hyper inflation? Go to Argentina and tell me it's easier to carry around bricks of cash in order to purchase everyday items rather than a cell phone.

No.   
It's using bitcoin as a payment method.  
Rather than spending USD directly you are spending bitcoin directly and then replacing it. I do this as well.   
Pay $100 in BTC.   
Immediately buy $110 worth of BTC.   
This way you are able to enjoy the convenience of using BTC without lowering your BTC balance.

You mean hitting $20k?  


If we are entering a bear market now then likely not hitting 20k until end of 2019 or early 2020 before going parabolic and crashing back down to like 35-75k depending on how parabolic it goes.   
General rule of thumb for the time being, if you're a long term investor and plan to hold for many years to come, then setting up automatic dollar cost averaging will reduce stress and allow you to accumulate.    
In the long term, any purchase under $10k is a steal.    
I think we're going to mimic 2013-2016.  
Those who manipulate the markets can be as patient as they need to be.   
Of course, no one knows the future and a random surge of bullish volume could completely change things around.   
Establish a timeframe to dollar cost average. My timeframe is 10 years.   
Establish price targets to sell to recoup principal.   
Only invest what you're willing to lose.

Yes. It's only been 6 months. That is all recovery from the bubble.    
The next 6-12 months will trend towards $4,000.   
Unless some big bullish volume comes in within the next 6 weeks, we will likely not see above $10k until Q3/Q4 2019.    
And then around Q4/Q1 hit $20k before going parabolic.

I own a trezor and it gives me great peace of mind. However, the most important thing to secure is the 24 word seed. Personally, I have the words memorized. If you can memorize a song you can memorize 24 random words. I also have the words written down and in a safe but if that safe gets stolen, well, I still have my brain.   
As far as the mtgox hack, keep in mind, any time you use a brokerage type service like an exchange, Coinbase, or Circle (R.I.P.), you're entrusting another entity with your money. These institutions are much more likely to get hacked or stolen from than your trezor or even your mobile phone wallet.   
Do you live in a high crime area? Are you often burglarized? Do you have a lot of enemies? Do you often lose very important items?

Not everyone wants to own or be responsible for securing their bitcoin. But plenty of people want exposure to it.

This is the biggest load of bull shit argument. Nothing against you, I just hear this nonsense constantly being repeated and am tired of it.   
Adoption has not been falling because of fees. Adoption has not been falling at all but rather steadily increasing.      
Yes fees spiked during a period of abnormally high demand. Welcome to basic supply and demand. Miner fees went up only for those who wanted their transaction in the next block. This is how bitcoin was designed. It's operating exactly like it was supposed to.    
Bitcoin is still in a very experimental phase and not ready for mass adoption.  It's a damn good thing fees got as high as they did as the network was able to experience a major stress test only to come out unscathed providing mountains of data.    
Lightning isn't needed right now. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, sure. But as it stands, bitcoin is still very much underground and no where near close to being an everyday household item.

It's so funny how people think the man is stupid. What does he need to do to prove his intelligence? Have a degree from an Ivy league institution?   
The man outsmarted the mainstream media into giving him free press coverage throughout his campaign. Outsmarted every professional politician to win the White House.  He has been adored by Americans for decades. No one called him stupid when he was on the apprentice or while building his empire.   
This really is the best timeline. I love that man. He has accomplished so much in such a short time. I'm so excited for another 6.5 years.

A little abrasive but accurate.  
The important thing to remember is that the price does not matter. Just keep buying a little bit at a time, $1 -$100 / paycheck, aka dollar cost average, and see what happens. Maybe bitcoin will "go to the moon' or maybe it will crash and burn. Either way, if you understand the potential value and benefit behind cryptocurrencies then investing in bitcoin is a no brainer. Invest what you're willing to spend on a sandwich or on any nonessential item like a cup of coffee or a burrito and be part of an incredible piece of technology.

It's not dumb at all, actually. It's just not compatible with what you want. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:03:23


I didn't say that exactly.  
I look at it like this. Blocks are storm drains and each rain drop a transaction.   99% of the time the storm drains handle the rain and prevent the streets from flooding. Every once in a while a hurricane will come by and cause highly abnormal amounts of volume causing a little flooding. No one likes the flooding but we know it's rare and temporary. We don't freak out and panic and protest in the streets demanding that we must exponentially increase the amount of storm drains otherwise we're going to be mildly inconvenienced again. We deal with it.     
Sometimes it rains. Rarely does it flood.   
Now, if flooding became the norm then yeah, we have a problem on our hands.  However, we're dealing with the free market. Exponentially Increasing the amount of storm drains isn't the only solution.    
Right now, I view lightning network as zapping the rain with a "fricken laser" (Austin Powers anyone?) and turning the rain drops into mist.   
I've never seen a misty rain cause a flood.   
But those two solutions aren't the only two solutions.   
We're dealing with the free market. Supply and demand. Someone might randomly develop another solution making the lightning network obsolete.  
No one knows.     
The market will decide.

To use it as an investment product to profit off of instead of a currency to transact with.   
In the same way you can buy a gold ETF but not actually withdraw the gold, you will be able to buy the representation of bitcoin without being able to withdraw it.

Again, you're looking for instant gratification. 7 years is nothing. Bitcoin is an infant. It's still growing. It's still in major developmental stages. Be patient. This is revolutionary technology. The mere fact that bitcoin is the world's first finite digital asset is huge. The mere fact that bitcoin has a value of more than 1 penny, let alone almost $1,000 is huge. The mere fact that the total value of the technology is currently valued at ~14bn is huge.   
You want instant gratification and unfortunately these things take time.

More level shitposting, memes and upvoting.   
Most posts on don't exceed 1,000 upvotes. Hell, even breaking 400 is rare.   
If we had more memes, more shit posting, more high energy, more sense of a community, more love, more upvoting, more memes, and overall more fun then we'd receive more publicity which would bring on more people interested in bitcoin causing them to buy bitcoins and drive the price up.   
is a fantastic subreddit whether you're a fan of Trump or not. The level of "high energy" is astounding and brings about an almost euphoric effect. If were to mimic a similar level of high energy and upvoted more then we'd see more people joining the community.  
TL;DR - getting to more 
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:05:48
The idea that bitcoin will "replace cash" is simply absurd. Bitcoin will never replace cash. Just like e-mail did not and will never replace physical mail. Bitcoin is and always has been another option to utilize. Get rid of the notion of "replacing cash" because it's absurd from the start. Those who preach "bitcoin will never replace cash" should also be saying "checks will never replace cash!" Both statements are equally dumb.

Lol, I'm not bitter. I've been working in financial services long enough. I've seen it all. People who think a prenup is enough to protect their hard earned money are naive at best.  
No two people on this earth have the exact same views on monetary policy. Having a joint operating account is fine for monthly obligations. But money has the ability to change people quickly. I see it everyday.

Adoption is growing quickly.  
Next year will be a minimum of $20k per coin. 30-40k is more realistic.    
200k per coin will happen in less than 5 years if not 2-3 years. That's only a 4 trillion dollar market cap. That's nothing.

A better idea, setup ach payments directly from your employer to a separate bank account. Put 5% of your monthly income into that account and the remaining 90% in your normal checking account.

The moon is so much higher than $5,000.       
I was literally having a conversation with a stranger and a bartender tonight about bitcoin. Surprisingly this roughly 50 year old woman knew about bitcoin because of her 19 year old son who told her about it this year.   
She was new to bitcoin but talked about selling her house to buy bitcoin.    
Understand this... That woman is an early adopter.    
The bartender has never heard the word bitcoin before. But she was all ears to learn about it tonight. If she takes my advice and does her research, she too will be an early adopter. When she found out one bitcoin was worth $3,800 she kept saying she "just wants to own one."  And ***that*** is the mentality so many people have. "Just want to own one." As it stands, I would assume less than 10 million people will actually own one bitcoin.   
   
Until every bartender uses bitcoin in a way the feels second nature like a debit card or cash, bitcoin isn't anywhere close to the moon.    
The moon is coming.  Quickly.   
$5,000 or $3,000 or less or more.  It doesn't matter.  No matter how you look at it, bitcoin is undervalued. It's currently a fantastic time to buy. Adoption is going to come very quickly.   
Buy while you can.

No, it's still a currency. All currencies fluctuate in value in comparison to other currencies. Things will likely never be priced in bitcoin and they don't need to be. Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used as a medium of exchange in comparison to local currencies.   
Fiat currencies are a bad store of value in the way they are a guaranteed loss in value year after year due to inflation. That is not a good store of value. A good store of value would either remain constant or increase in value. On average, bitcoin regularly increases in value year over year while fiat decreases in value year after year. We've never lived in a world where we had a choice of currency. Now we have both inflationary and deflationary to choose from. I don't know about you, but I choose deflationary.

Luckily we only go back to 2015 where net neutrality laws didn't exist.    
It's not in a company's best interest to implement these scenarios as they get ridiculed online and receive a lot of angry calls, complaint letters, lose customers, etc etc.   
Competition allows this to be avoided.   
The lack of net neutrality laws keeps the Internet free and open, much like Bitcoin, and minimizes government sabotage.   
Less government = more freedom.   
If too much freedom causes companies to stronghold customers and competition is impossible, then government can get involved. For now, let the free market be free baby.

Outside of that, memes have sparked the creation of small business owners selling memes as mugs and shirts and other things. Being serious all the time creates a boring community.

As Bitcoin grows and develops it's going to go through a lot of stages and be used in a lot of different ways. One way will be a store of value. A gold 2.0 of you will.

Big blocks are bad if they're being implemented prematurely. Think of it like putting plastic bottles of water in the recycling bin.

You save a lot of money on bags if you're filling them with more bottles.

These bad loans were bundled and sold as a diversified investment product known as mortgage backed securities.    
The MBS's were rated as high quality, aka, investment grade products. However, the MBS's were filled with bad loans. Through a series of people defaulting on their mortgages and triggering other consequences, shit hit the fan.

This isn't a problem if you intend to hold long term. In fact, this is a good thing. However, you are basing this literally off of nothing other than fear, uncertainty, and doubt. 


No. Buy the dip is a reminder to those panicking about the price that the price doesn't matter. The tech is working exceptionally well and adoption is growing everyday throughout the world.   
Most of us are not traders. But we are buyers. Dips are buying opportunities.     
Time after time after time have I heard my friends complain about not buying low when they had the chance.   
The next all time low is uncertain. If you're in this for the long haul the only thing that matters is how many bitcoins you own.

Right now, due to a series of unfortunate events, my monthly expenses are about $300 more than my monthly income. Every month I have to dip into my savings just to survive. I'm racking up credit card debt and eating one meal a day. I can probably survive for another 4 -5 months at this rate. After that, idk what I'm going to do.  
If a billionaire sent me a Bitcoin it wouldn't get me out of my financial hardship necessarily, however it would keep me afloat for another 30 days. Giving me an extra 30 days to find another job or at least a part time one.  
Additionally, the value of one Bitcoin may be worth $1,000,000 one day. Maybe tomorrow? Idk. So one Bitcoin has the potential to either keep me afloat another day, get me completely out of financial hardship, or buy me a slice of pizza. Who knows? We'll see what the future brings. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:02:18
You're correct. Let me rephrase. It's not testing new resistance levels. Whether it drops to 5800 or 5700 it's still the same resistance level. It's not breaking through and falling to 4,000.   
It's still hovering around the same general range.    
The resistance lines are more of a blur rather than a defined number.

Friendly reminder:   Lehman Brothers + ETN = financial collapse. 
An ETN is very different from an ETF.  
One factor that affects the ETN's value is the credit rating of the issuer. The value of the ETN may drop despite no change in the underlying index, instead due to a downgrade in the issuer's credit rating.  
Very risky investment.

The plan administrator would need to allow it. Usually only very diversified and balanced mutual funds and ETFs are allowed in a 401k.   
A 401k is not your money. It's your employer's money. You usually have very limited options for what you can buy. Usually like 15-25 different funds.

Lol, citation not needed.  
I'm a financial advisor I have advised well over 10,000 clients in my life.   
I literally just got done speaking with a woman who told me there's nothing she can do to reduce her expenses as she's tried everything.  
I start going through her banking statements and what do I find? She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day ($3k / year), pays over $200 / month for cable TV ($2400+ /year), just got a fucking $600 tattoo 3 weeks ago, spends about $35 every 2 weeks to get her nails done ($840 / year), goes out to eat constantly (thousands per year), leases a car for $550 / month with no intention of every financing to own as she loves driving new cars, I mean, the list goes on and on and on. I showed her how she could easily save well over $10,000 per year if  not closer to $20,000. And my client got upset with me for telling her she needs to stop spending all of her money. People hate admitting when they're wrong. And when it comes to their finances, they're usually wrong.  
People are poor because they don't understand the basic concept of living within, if not below, their means. Just because you have money, doesn't mean you have money to spend.    
People in America these days don't give a fuck about saving and investing. It's all instant gratification.    
People are poor because they don't want to deal with the inconvenience of making sacrifices now to plan for the future.    They wait until it's too late and then try to come to me for advice on how to magically have more money.    
You want more money? Spend less. Save more.    
The overwhelming majority of people are poor because they make bad financial decisions like having kids before they're married, getting pets or simply living above their means. People don't realize how often they nickel and dime themselves into poverty with buying coffee, going out to eat, giving gifts to friends and family, buying expensive makeup, etc etc.    
I see it literally every day.     
That's my fucking citation.

Glad you could acknowledge the self evident fact that you're not too bright.   
You're having a really difficult time understanding the basic concept behind actions often have consequences.    
If I ask you if you think someone *should* and *must* get their hand burned for placing it on a hot stove you're gonna come back with "oh so you think people shouldn't be treated for burn injuries? Noted"     
You really are dense.    
You fail to understand someone who spends money recklessly will be in a bad financial situation due to the consequences of their actions.    
You fail to understand someone who refuses to eat will starve and die due to the consequences of their actions.   
You fail to understand people who play with fire get burned due to the consequences of their actions.    
You live in some fantasy world where consequences don't exist.

I never said anything about bitcoin being the greatest game changer in the industry. All I'm saying is that there is an industry that can be enhanced / upgraded very easily by the use of bitcoin. The current system is simply outdated and bitcoin solves ***some*** of the problems within the industry.   
I don't know much about other applications for bitcoin. However, because I work in finance I see some clear holes in the current system that could easily be filled with bitcoin.   
Also, being a financial advisor vs being the president of some country are not the least bit comparable. Financial advisors are a dime a dozen.

People have bought already.   
There are a variety of ways to get a stock on the market.  
One method is strictly through sophisticated investors - 
 -    
These people have already purchased the stock over a year ago. They are required to hold onto it for a year before selling.   
That year has passed.  
Now it's time to sell.

Your previous comment:










I don't see it as investing. I see it as a volatile checking account. That can get me some discounts if used right.   
To me, it's no different than cash.  
The only thing is it can be used in ways that are currently not possible with cash. That alone gives it a certain value.    
Plus, you know, the US Dollar hasn't been performing much better over the years. 
There is no innovation with the US Dollar. There is plenty of innovation with bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is only 6 years old and already used by millions.  
Yes, there was an awesome bubble 18 months ago. However, now we're getting back to where bitcoin was naturally progressing prior to the bubble.  
I think the next 6 years will be very interesting.  
What will come of over $600 million dollars of VC money?

Giving away all of his money wouldn't do shit. Socialist seem to fail to understand basic economics.   
Trump is worth about 3 billion. He lost about 1 billion in net worth since he took office.  
Imagine if he decides to take his 3 billion and give it all away. Split it up evenly so every American gets an equal portion of his net worth for the sake of equality.    
That means every one in America would receive about $9.37.    
And what did Trump do to help America? Absolutely nothing.   
Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, the whole Robinhood myth, is the biggest load of stupidity the world has ever seen. It doesn't do anything to solve any issues. Equality of outcome is the dumbest idea known to man.

I see... I just did as you said and see a new address within my HD account as well as the corresponding transactions on blockchain.  So please bear with me while I try to understand.   
My HD account has a public address to which I can send and receive. Let's call it address "ABC". Every time I use the ABC address, whether it be to send or receive, Mycelium will automatically create a throwaway address def, ghi, jkl, etc, for each individual transaction. So although I'm funneling all transactions through ABC - ABC isn't actually doing anything other than generating new throwaway addresses. Therefore, I *really* don't need to have multiple HD accounts for privacy sake because the HD account / address is actually an unlimited amount of addresses..... did I more or less get that right?    
Additionally, if I really really want to I can look at the transactions within Mycelium and reuse an address on the transaction list but there's really no point.  
Am I more or less grasping the concept?   
Thank you very much for your response btw.

The context of this post is banks control the money stored with them and we are subject to them granting us permission to use our money. Without banks we are unable to move our money around easily and depend on them to grant us permission.   
Then it rains, showing us banks aren't the only option for us moving money around and we are not dependent on them.   
And here you step in,    


You moron. This post is talking about not needing permission to use your money. This post is not talking about insuring your assets.   
If you want to insure your assets then go use coinbase. The point of the post is we don't need anyone's permission to use our money.   
That being said, this is programmable money. We can program safety features to prevent our money from being stolen. We are no longer dependent on banks.

During the mtgox fiasco in 2013 / 2014 we learned about transaction malleability. Basically this was a bug in bitcoin that allowed people to make certain changes to their transaction before it was confirmed. This bug could be exploited by malicious hackers.   
In order to fix this, Segwit was proposed as a solution.  
Segwit also disabled a mining exploit called covert asic boost. CAB allowed certain miners to secretly mine at a greater efficiency than others.  
Certain miners (Jihan Wu who is the CEO of Bitmain) wanted to continue utilizing this exploit and did not want Segwit adopted.  
On August 1st the hard fork happened and Bcash was created to avoid Segwit so certain miners could continue their covert exploit.  
In late August, Segwit was activated within Bitcoin but not Bcash.   
Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, Craig Wright and a few other individuals who are behind Bcash have since started a social deception campaign to try to convince people Bcash ***is*** bitcoin.  
Roger Ver who owns bitcoin dot com has utilized shady deception by referring to bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core" and Bcash as "Bitcoin (BCH)".     
     
There are a ton of other things going on but this is the gist of it.  
There was a whole big block vs little block debate that was going on but in my opinion that was more of a distraction.  
The main thing was fixing transaction malleability which prevented malicious actors from attacking Bitcoin. Low and behold, malicious actors did not want Segwit implemented.   
I wonder why. /s

Came here to talk about dollar cost averaging. I bought my first 0.3 worth of BTC at $980 / coin. And have been dollar cost averaging ever since. Thanks to DCA I was able to accumulate a lot of coins between $200 - $250 / coin and now hovering around $450 I am most definitely in the black. 
DCA everyday.

Again. At no point did I say a house (primary residence) is a ***good*** investment. Just like a car isn't necessarily a ***good*** investment. The fact of the matter is, both are investments regardless of how you personally view them.     
Investing and investments go so much further than just capital gains which every financial expert in this thread with no financial background keeps trying to argue with me because they read Business Insider aka the WSJ's TMZ.

Uhhhhh, duh.  
The fuq?   


Lol no it isn't. Not at all. Lolol.   Not even close.    
Stop acting like you know what you're talking about. You clearly don't.   
I guarantee you there were a lot of people who in 2008 wish they didn't make all of those extra payments towards their mortgage because even though they put an extra 20k towards their mortgage, they're now out of a job and the equity in their home is gone so now they're under water and there's no way they can get that money back. It's just poof, gone. Risk free my ass. And that's just one example. I could go on.   


Uhh, no.   
1sf of all, I don't even make a commission on mutual funds, or stocks, or etfs, or REITs, or CDs, or bonds, or CEFs, or anything else you can think of. So let's just nip that one in the bud, mmkay?    
2nd, most people (like yourself) don't know Jack shit about investing and making their money work for them in a way that is in their best interest. Just because an investor ***wants*** to do something and they ***can*** do something doesn't mean it's in their best interest.  
 Do you have any idea how many non retirement aged clients take money out of their traditional IRA in order to pay off their mortgage? Do you know why that's a horrible thing to do? Do you have any idea how many people don't save for retirement because they think they'll worry about that in their 40's, or 50's?    Just because someone is risk averse doesn't mean they shouldn't be investing.    
 Do you have any idea how to construct a portfolio for a conservative client to give them an average rate of return higher than the tax deductible mortgage interest they're paying?    Did you even know mortgage interest is tax deductible? Do you know how much mortgage interest can be written off?  
I would love to view your portfolio and see what you have going on.    
Dude, your heart's in the right place. You think all financial advisor are scummy because you've seen wolf of wall street and boiler room and you read business insider so you're an expert. I get it.   
The fact of the matter is you don't know shit.

I think you're getting a little too philosophical with this one.    
General rule of thumb - if it's your problem to fix, you own it.  
Legally speaking, you own it when you hold that deed... Unless you get divorced. Then it's going to your cunt whore of an ex wife Fuck you Tammy you lying cheating whore! (I've never been married.)   


Correct. Mortgage interest rates are at historic lows. We will likely never see this in our lifetime again. To be able to have a tax deductible loan at a low interest rate for 30 years is the greatest luxury someone can get. Low rate = lower payment = greater cash flow = greater opportunities to make your money grow = more savings = better life. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:15:54

I think we were in the car when it hit ~178. 
It will probably hover between 250 - 325 throughout the majority of 2015 until more publicly traded funds, like ETF's, hit the market.  
Once that occurs, the everyday Joe will be able to purchase BTC with his everyday brokerage account and expose himself to a little BTC, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. As it becomes part of one's portfolio it will, yes, crash land on the moon.  
For now, enjoy the volatility and day trade less than 10% of your Bitcoin net worth while holding on to the rest / using it to purchase everyday items.

@_date: 2016-05-14 19:43:03
Yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.   
First, provide the "studies" you're referencing.  
Second, dollar cost averaging absolutely works. No one knows when "the right time" is until the time has passed. The right time to buy is always now. Additionally, "the right time" is purely subjective depending on what your time horizon is as an investor. If you're a long term investor dollar cost averaging absolutely works. If you're a day trader with a short time horizon than yes, timing the market can work to your advantage however most people time the market incorrectly. If you're trying to time the market all you're really doing is gambling and not investing.   
So it comes down to this. If you identify as an investor, dollar cost average. If you identify as a gambler, go for broke and try to time the market.

The purpose of bitcoin isn't to sell it for crap cash. The purpose is to utilize it. 
If there has been something on amazon you've been wanting to buy for a while but couldn't justify the purchase and you want to spend a portion of your recent gain then now might be a good time to check out purse.io. 
You can get 15-30% off on amazon in addition to your big gain.  
I think the better move is to think more long term. Bitcoin has been steadily growing since it's inception. Bitcoin is a store of wealth. Bitcoin is literally the greatest advancement to money... ever. 
This 100% gain in the past year is a blip in what the next 10-15 years will bring. 
I'm currently kicking myself in the butt for all those 20% discount coffees I bought by way of foldapp.

Ledger Nano S is a close second.   
I'm in America so can only speak for here. Coinbase is a great place to get started. Coinbase, gemini, glidera. All great platforms to get started. I recommend signing up to all 3 at once because verification can be time consuming. If you're being verified by 3 companies instead of one you're diversifying your opportunity cost. Gemini, I've heard, takes weeks. Coinbase can be frustrating. Glidera has been the easiest for me and my friends.

At the end of the day it all matters how comfortable you are with risk.  
Me personally, I'm not the least bit risk averse. I'm perfectly comfortable having a large amount of my net worth in extremely high risk investments.   
My portfolio looks something like this:   
40% in ultra high risk investments. (Other) 
40% in high risk investments. (Equities. Growth stocks like Netflix, Tesla, Apple, Google, etc. Sector focused ETFs. Mutual funds.)  
10% in low risk investments. (Fixed income like bonds, CDs, or large cap value funds paying high dividends (AT&amp;T for example))
10% in cash. (My foundation. 6 - 9 months worth of monthly expenses in checking / savings. No investing until this is established first.)   
Investing 101 = Diversify.   
Don't put your life savings into bitcoin.    
Edit:  (Disclaimer) In no way shape or form am I recommending anyone to mimic anything above. These are not recommendations. This is a rough example of my personal portfolio. I would never recommend anything above without fully understanding someone's financial situation first. Investing can lead to a loss of principal. Only risk what you're willing to never see again.

Yeah. I was planning on withdrawing about 2-5k / month over the course of several months. DCA in, DCA out.   
I have every intention of paying my taxes. I just don't know how the IRS would find out about it, outside of structuring, if I focused on selling under 10k / month.  
I've been hodling for a while, and because I don't understand the tax code, I don't understand why I need to immediately report a gain if I still haven't withdrawn any principal.  
If my principal is 100k over the course of 4 years and I withdraw 20k /month for 5 months in 2017 and don't report it, would that raise any red flags?

 Comparing investing in bitcoin vs an IRA or 401k is the equivalent of saying, "Should I invest my entire 401k into my company's stock?"   
The obvious answer is no. It's a horrible idea to not diversify.  
Now, a better question, should everyone have bitcoin as part of their portfolio? Well, absolutely. Having a sector in one's portfolio dedicated towards technology and emerging markets is already part of standard diversified portfolios. Utilizing the tax benefits of an IRA with the growth potential of bitcoin is a no brainer.   
Investing 101: only invest what you're willing to lose.

Dude, bitcoin is still in massive amounts of foundational progress. This shit isn't ready to "rise" as you say. Bitcoin is a new technologyn that is still being explored. Yes, there is value behind it. Bitcoin is not a static invention. It can be used in a variety of ways. One of those ways is through selling it for a higher value.   
Plenty of people on here talk about the price and cashing out for fiat. And in the same respect, a shit ton of people on here hodl.

I got you...     
Bitcoin is a ledger system.  
A bunch of computers continuously communicate with each other and roughly every 10 minutes the ledger gets updated and the computers reach a consensus on what the current status of the ledger is.      
No single company, government, or entity controls this ledger but rather it's a decentralized system of computers coming together to reach a consensus.   
When individuals say they own X amount of bitcoin, what they really mean is they have the ability to move X amount of bitcoin on the ledger. 
That and some Internet magic.

It's insane bitcoin exists at all let alone being worth $2,700 per coin currently.   
To be fair, I never implied certainty. With that being said, depending on the development of this technology, I don't think a 10,000% increase is all that unreasonable.   
I work in the financial services industry. I see first hand all the problems bitcoin can solve. I know first hand just how greedy people are and how FOMO can drive people to be irrational with their money. I've handed out 20 copies of the Internet of Money to friends, family, and colleagues. Usually around page 27 everyone says they've read enough and want in on this.   
Sure another coin could take its place. Sure bitcoin could plummet drastically. However there are far too many people contributing towards this technology at the moment and far too many people who are completely ignorant of its existence to assume it will be worth anything even remotely close to what it is now or less. Too many hedge funds. To many accredited investors. Too many hodlers. Too many people it can help. Bitcoin is a huge huge huge huge deal.  
The problems of today will be forgotten tomorrow.    
It's fair to say I'm quite bullish on bitcoin.

Purchasing 100 mBTC today may only be $260 and a drop in the bucket but that could easily be worth $26,000 in 15 years.  
Yes adding 0.1 btc is still only 0.1 btc 15 years from now but your purchasing power increases substantially if we hit moon status.   
Additionally, when converting fiat to crypto you're (hopefully) not only buying one time and saying "this is all the crypto I'll ever own." Chances are you're dollar cost averaging a little bit every paycheck increasing your position slowly but steadily over time.

I'm under the assumption Circle backed out of the bitcoin environment due to a private dealing with coinbase. Whether it be generating revenue from referrals / some sort of partnership, a straight up buy out, or under threat of bullying from coinbase. I have no idea. However, without any evidence, I'm under the assumption coinbase, in some capacity, influenced Circle to discontinue their bitcoin retail purchasing services.

I made a decision when I first bought in at $980 in December of 2013 that for 5 years I was going to accumulate bitcoin no matter what the price did. I purchased at every peak and valley.  
I attempted to day trade a small amount between $200 - $300 when it seemed like that was a stable price.  
Sold a little at $330 so I could "buy more when the price went back down" and yeah. I'm still waiting for the price to come back down.    
The only time I've ever sold some bitcoin is when I accidentally over paid a credit card bill and got hit with an overdraft fee. Aside from that I'm still in accumulation phase. Once my 5 year time horizon has been met I will reevaluate my position and determine whether or not I want to realize a gain or loss.   
Until then I will continue to dollar cost average, buy the dips, diversify, and hodl.    
If you invest in something without a goal or a pre-planned time horizon you're simply gambling rather than investing.    
Be an investor, not a gambler.

Step 1. Accumulation phase. Buying as much bitcoin as I can for 5 years. Dollar cost averaging as well as buying the dips.   
Step 2. Hodl until 5 years have been met unless there is an emergency.  
Step 3. After 5 years begin to DCA out of bitcoin until I'm debt free.  
Step 4. Buy investment properties.   
Step 5. Retire.

Really thought you were saying they never split anymore as opposed to split less often today than they did a decade or two ago.   
To be fair most stock prices are in the double digits. Few are even above $300. The door is open to a lot of people to invest. Stocks splits start to become more common when stocks have held their price over $500 for a decent amount of time.
