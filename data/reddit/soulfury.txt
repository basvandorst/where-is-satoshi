So in what year will there be very little left to mine? Less than 5000 for example

To be clear I would be buying weekly at that day's rate?

Thanks for your reply. I'm just wondering if it has similar odds as any casino or if the stigma is just that it's a complete scam

Thank you for your advice.

Thanks for being so helpful. I only ask because I have a couple of btc and I thought a bit of gambling luck would save me from making an actual investment in btc.

And yet still infinitely better than yours.

I'm not looking for divination. Only advice. I appreciate those who have done so.

Thank you very much for your advice.

Interesting concept. Is it really likely that another coin will succeed while btc fails? I feel as though if any cryptocurrency is going to dominate it would be btc. What are your thoughts on that?

Thanks so much for your advice. I'm planning to invest monthly into multiple currencies and I'm planning to cast a wider net vs a deeper one. Any others you recommend, for now I'm convinced on btc, ltc, iota, and eth

Interesting, what about LTC, doge, etherium?
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:05:21
Any particular reason you prefer these?
