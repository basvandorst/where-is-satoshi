Good luck to you too!

At this point, if you invested the same amount of money in any top 5 coins at the beggining of October, you would have gained 2-3x your investment. BTC is up, BCH is up, ETH is up, LTC is up, Iota is up etc etc... If you could have seen the future, You could have invested in BCH at 300, out at 2500, BTC at 5000, out at 17500, Litecoin at 80-100, out at 300. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:52:49
Not even trying to defend your coin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:30:30
the people here are drinking some really strong Kool-Aid. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:23:23
That was stupid of you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:17:37
You can't be serious can you? If you need to invest minimum 1k  dollara into something to get started, it is clearly a scam or just broken... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:13
Well its crypto buddy. We are in the Far West here. I don't wish anyone to lose money. Last time BCH went to 2.5k, Bithumb suddenly went down for 5 hours when we were at the peak. Killing 40% of the volume, BCH's momemtum and our change to hold the price at a reasonable level because everyone went into a panic mode. Also, did you see the number of no-name alt coins being pumped by 200-300%? That would be manipulation at its best.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:30:11
Because they fucked up. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:13:29
And BTC is not scamming all its users with intentional high transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:28
You guys sure cry for everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:48:41
This whole 10-30$ transactions fee is not shady? BTC  is currently scamming thousands of people who try to move their 50-100$ investment with fees that represent 20-50% of their investment. How is that not shady?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:59:08
Bullish on sigwit, 12% by the end of next year!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:38
That sub is full of shills and angry people. They were saying to dump it at 300-500-1000-1500-2000. Now look where the price is at? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:07:59
How many people buy BTC for 20-50 dollars thinking they will be able to spend because you guys STILL promote low fees? THESE people lose half if not more of their money when they then move their BTC to their wallet or do ANYTHING with it. You coin is useless and stealing money from people who knows nothing better. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:42:23
much argument, wow
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:01
Shit coin that has use and actually follow the whitepaper mentioned on Bitcoin.org. Please enjoy your crazy transaction fees! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:58:41
It's cancer. Something that you want to get rid of, not help it kill you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:25
Yeah right, you guys decided you only needed 1mb block back in August. What about you deal with your choices?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:43
Sure it does. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:51:19
Before we reach the saturation/full level of blocks, BCH can upgrade its block size to 16/32mb etc. without any hardfork.  Work is currently being made for 3000 tx/sec block with other many other speed/efficiency features so BCH is always ahead of congestions to keep fees low. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:48:37
Welcome to useless BTC, better hope for better value and hope your transaction clears within 1 week. But seriously, do your research before buying into the hype, it will cost people money when they realized how useless BTC is as a currency or store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:06
The only one I never researched about is Cardano. Monero may be good, but the fees are alright high for what it does, we will see what the future has for it. Dash is a pre-mined coin so I'll just pass. IOTA may be good, but their transaction systems did not impress me so far, they had many problems 2 weeks ago when it pumped.  I try to keep an eye on them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:34
How is that coordinated? I would say very uncoordinated as Gdax was not even ready to sell BCH at market price... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:16
Yet no one could trade after only 5 minutes on Coinbase because gadax was selling BCH at 10k for godsake. I would call this incompetence. By the way, BTC was already down at 18-17k, 12-24 hours ago. You should try finding solutions for your mempool and 200k+ transactions waiting to be completed instead of crying "we are under attack". What a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:22:16
"Good enough" sure is a thing that comes a lot on this sub. 2$ fee(which I have hard time to believe) is what a person in third world countries might make in a Day. Please tell them how useful BTC is to make transactions. Or is BTC now only for rich people? Can't wait to see you guys pay 100$ transaction fees and still say "Good enough". Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:55:13
Thx, I'll give it a look.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:01:01
Julian, another puppet just like Trump. He will do anything to get money in his pocket. People who think that he is telling the truth on anything that is not helping his agenda need to see what is going on with wikileak.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:58:02
Deal with your 1mb block and LN. Big blocks are for BCH and other coins only.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:35:39
You made your choice back in August, it's the only reason why BCH exist. Deal with your 1mb block and wait for LN. If you are not happy, BCH has 8mb block. And please, look at BTC transaction fees and tell me who is stealing from anyone investing small quantity of money in BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:04:59
This sub is making personal attacks on people, brigading apps and website, and the mod are doing nothing about. You can really tell how far in the shit hole the mods and some of this sub users are. If you are a rational adult, go get a life, seriously. And BTW by doing that OP, you are clearly violating Reddit rules. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:09:58
Hold and never use it, what a useful "currency" 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:33:09
Who the hell is going to make a company and use BTC has main payment method with the current fees? Business are running away from BTC, don't you understand why?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:39
Look at BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:28:27
BTC is failling so hard in adoption rate that you guys are suggesting to harass people? How low can it get around here. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:47
This subs is now making fun of people selling? Just wow.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:26:06
Cancer sub still attacking people. The people here are really lowering the bar everyday. 4 posts about Roger in your "top" section. I guess BTC as nothing better going on for it than attacking people. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:56
Revert a Fork, that is the best one I have seen yet! 10/10
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:41:32
Don't leave too far, at this speed BCH will be there by December...
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:44:21
He is mad
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:46:06
You have to make plan 3 days ahead if you wish to make a transfer with btc? Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:40:57
Please, do keep paying 5-10$ transaction fee, BCH users will continue to pay our 5 cent for any transaction without waiting hours for them to be processed. People will soon understand that there is no value to BTC because of these fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:44:26
Did that guy just missed on 30% gain? Will he misses on more gain? I think yes!
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:42:14
I mean, why dot both coin available to pay for your sandwitch
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:02:39
you won't get any serious answers from this sub, go visit /btc for more information
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:28:47
Is the /The_Donald leaking? I swear this place is becoming more and more cancerous. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:25:22
Please do short, and hold it haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:37:34
why not both? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:53:20
Your personal BTC Pump station.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:19:57
is you heart okay? You really bought at the Everest's peak
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:35:50
Yeah no way i'm paying a 5 dollars fee for a Subway. Tell them to use BCH
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:42:51
you forgot in there
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:36:59
what a win strategy! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:46:01
Buckle up, it could go either way at this point!
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:31:41
This make sense. couldn't see it 5 years ago, but now with a 90billion market cap, I can almost believe it. Yeah, I'm slow...
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:12:20
For my Japanese account, I have to wait for a paper letter in my mail to proceed to the "next" step. I just hope the are not going to ask me to send them a real printed photo... Japanese companies can be really backward sometimes.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:57:07
1 Bazillion!
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:35:47
I understand most of the final goal, but so far, the only place I've heard the use of bitcoins outside for your neihgbor friendly hipster coffee shop is on the dark web. I will only have myself to blame if this thing hit 20k+
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:54:31
You are right, I'll wait for the lows before I do any major investment into Bitcoin. I'll put what I have on my wallet and wait for the Bitcoin gold fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:38:11
Sell sell sell, so I can buy at 4k
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:20:34
On Tuesday I was praying for a drop below 5k to get in, just woke up and bitcoin is now trading at 6k. fml
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:13:44
Thanks for the information! That is the kind of site to make me feel better! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:37:54
screw that, I want a big juicy drop so I can buy more
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:37:59
thank you for all this information! I will look into these tonight, can't say I know a lot about alt coins.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:13:41
Couldnt set up my trading account in time for when it was 5k. I pray for it to go down with the incoming Fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:22:41
I was not sure what would happen with the incoming Forks next month. But now I see that Bitcoin does not seem to have any intention of going down. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:57:22
It sucks, but wait till it reaches 20k per bit coin, 8k is still not enough to kill your self. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:28:24
Well, nothing new here... I watched it go from 10 to 700-800 dollars, then back to 300 dollars, but 5000 is another hit. At this point, I might just believe you guys.  I'll check for the price drop in the coming day to get it in...
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:43:29
Still don't know if it is a good thing, but at least it gives you more time, right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:37:59
I'll only be happy when it falls down below 5k. Even if I just bought at 5.6k.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:15:59
How did they do it if you had the two-factor authentication on your phone? :O
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:21:09
What a glorious hold. I can't imagine how much money you will have in 20 years.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:54:45
I have been hopping that since Tuesday.... 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:31:30
So what is it? 5k bottom?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:43:36
I bought in the lows, but was hopping for it to drop more...
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:50:59
I know, and it went up 500 dollars in 24h....
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:18:14
Any idea of which alt coins I should keep an eye on? Lite, Ethe etc? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:30:48
Bought mine on Friday on Amazon.JP, arrived Saturday morning. However, my Japan and Canadian accounts still need to be identity approved before I can transfer any money on them. Godbless Amazon speed....
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:04:43
I see that BCH started trading on the 1st of August, I was under the impression that a BTC dip would be after the fork and not before. Been telling myself this shit was crazy since I saw it at 10$ in 2012, then 100$ in 2013, etc. I guess I was the crazy after all for not putting a few dollars back when it was 10$. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:51:40
Simple, I'm new to bitcoin and didn't know this website hehe. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:58:36
Thank you for the advice, I sure hope we are at the top. I just wish I do not miss the 5-6k boat. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:58:00
Thank you for the amazing insight into bitcoins random stranger. I'll keep my 1 million USD on the side so I can buy 1 million bitcoins! I will be RICH!
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:52:21
Still too high! it needs to go down 500-600 USD and cool off for a few days. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:16:39
What time frame is this?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:25:43
Still waiting for my 5k/5.1k price...
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:38:44
That would be on August 1st, right? I don't see any significant changes on the BTC chart around that date, I guess we should see the same kind of movement when the fork happens.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:49:34
I was waiting for the Hard Fork in November before buying more. I don't know what to do anymore!
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:03:04
The incoming hard fork is really starting to become a huge pile of shit in the making. Can't tell how much it will dip, put I'm pretty sure we will see one.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:04:33
If it goes below 5k, I feel like it will drop a lot more. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:46:13
I'm setting up my trade accounts, got my ledger wallet and waiting for what will happen with the incoming forks. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:03:38
I don't get it neither, he somehow lost money and coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:51:55
What about a ledger? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:08:57
magic man, freaking MAGIC!
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:19:51
Fall Fall Fall! 
But it makes me worried about the November Fork. We may see a real drop, or a spike?
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:36:07
Price seems to have stall at 5.5k, anyone think it will pull back to 4k ish with the incoming fork for a few weeks? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:25:15
True to that, we have been testing 5.4k for a few hours now. And I still feel we are cooling off from the spike we saw 2 weeks ago. But it could go either way really. Note that we saw a 4-5% drop following the friendly bitcoin gold fork, I'm really note sure what we will see with the incoming hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:58:58
let me know every time you buy! I will make a fortune
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:30:24
I'll do the same for not buying at 10 dollars
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:11:37
I just managed to transfer money yesterday into my exchange account and was waiting today to see if I buy today. haha! fk Canada exchange companies.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:02:28
I think we all have in head that the value will go much higher than this and are waiting for a good entry point to buy more bitcoins. At this level a 5-15% change could still mean a difference of thousands of dollars if it ever reaches 100k+. If only I could go back in time and kick myself for not buying when I first learned about bitcoins, it was 10$ back then. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:47:13
First time I heard about bitcoin was when it was 10 dollars around mid 2012, didn't understand the concept of having "virtual money" that fluctuates more than a penny stock on steroid. I still don't understand, why would anyone "spend" his bitcoins on anything when the value just keeps going up. People are doing "investment", they are no one thinking of Bitcoins as the "new" currency that everyone will use in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:32:05
I sure wish I had bought a few hundred bitcoins at that point! Now I will continue telling myself that the bubble is about to implode anytime soon..
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:38:38
Thank you for the links kind person.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:24:05
I hope you still made a few dollars when it hit 1000$. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:27:26
praying for a crash, its a necessary evil for us, bitcoin poor people.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:05:56
I have been buying a little at every new lows. still waiting for the big buy, it may only be after the Fork in November, we'll see if it goes to 5.1k or lower
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:48:17
How much did you pay for the beer in bit coin? Why would you spend your bitcoins when its value went up 20-25% in the past day?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:16:50
Draw a line to the moon!
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:28:06
Say that to myself since it was 10 dollars, 10 freaking dollars! Now I bought a Hardware wallet that should arrive tomorrow and we'll be ready to spend my money once Bitcoin exchange account is ready.
