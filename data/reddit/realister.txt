Never had problems

People who bought at $14-$18k are still fucked.

Lets bomb both North and South, problem solved. jk

if you have 40k its probably better to buy some options on the stock market.

too real

Not buying BTC until it drops down to $300
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:57:36
No they will have to issue new currency eventually.

that idiot also said that Trump would crash the economy. He knows nothing. Whoever gave him a nobel prize should be shamed.

Thanks Obama for not putting anyone in jail.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:13:40
its such a waste of money
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:54:31
But if you HODL forever do you really have anything? You don't have it until you cash out.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:25:51
Lucked out.

277,000,000 kS still too large. 
The term Satoshi should refer to 0.001 of BTC then we all good.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:39:52
No mention of the volume and market cap though? What was the market cap in 1935 vs now?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:37:52
Its 6k and nobody is buying it. No new money is coming in. Bag holders are the only ones who are left.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:23:19
Bitcoin is very easy to trace. You thinking Monero. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:32:57
You continue to live in 1929 while we take our profits to the bank. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:20:57
That’s why you do it before. People who jump in to buy too late are the losers. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:57:41
nobody can
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:34:50
If you pay Tai Lopez any money its your own fault for being so dumb.
Use that $600 to buy Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:49:31
yea but not in 1 year, Bitcoin has another 120 years to go.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:20:02
yep I do this every morning.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:26:13
Most people are under the confusion that you need to own at least 1 bitcoin, I am tired of explaining it, this certainly hurts adoption. People think they need to invest close to $10k to buy bitcoin. 
I think it should be explained more clearly that its divisible. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:53:58
US Dollar is king today!
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:48:19
Not true there are plenty of people who paid and got their data back. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:33:37
thanks for holding our bags while we sell. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:55:27
you bought some gold too? haha I bet you feel stupid today. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:52:32
just keep holding it
