@_date: 2018-01-18 17:50:34
You know, most of this was just Fake news and not a "real" threat. Yet still a 50% drop happend. IF Korea would have rly banned it then we would be fucked right now. The market is more fragile than ever.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:09:44
Well we are already at 9.4.... pretty close
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:11:33
you entered your email pw?!? well it was just a matter of time when you would have lost your BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:50:00
such nostalgia
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:30:41
more free publicity for Bitcoin. EZPZ
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:00:51

i solved the puzzle, the answer is Paypal
@_date: 2019-02-01 22:08:52
so you actually worked for around 400-500$ a month with that 0.15btc salary because I bet my left nut you HODLd through all of it.
less than minimum wage, coolio
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:44:41
this

another reason why they dont accept BTC anymore
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:25:37
You can call me CryptoGod now. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:35:50
Their main complain/reason why they dropped BTC was volatility. They want to maximize profit as any company would. Why accept BTC when it could be worth 70% less 4 months later. But of course you obviously know it better than valve.
stop being so naive

Buy ARK,  vote for a delegate and get 10% of your holdings each year by doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:13:26
Yeah because it does not work the other way around. A game bought in December at 60€ is now only 25€. Rly solid currency u have there.
And Valve only gets around 30% of that since they don't own most of the games.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:23:41
no shit sherlock, and if you listened to him you could have gotten 9200$ per BTC profit and probably a nerve wrecking time as it went down to 200
On the other side you could have gotten 39200$ profit for 800$ if you would have bought a few months later
so yeah..
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:06:00
yes, and then it crashed down to 200usd... a fool not a wizard
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:57:22
shortly after it crashed and you could have gotten way more for much cheaper...
whats the point?
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:02:21
Everbody blames Wallstreet, Whales, the government, weak hands... but in the end the true evil of crypto where the memers 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:29:49
currently at 10170$ on Bitfinex
RIP beloved buy wall
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:49:46
Bitcoin not usable due to high volatility. Of course fees are also a reason but it still is unusable because the prices changes every damn few seconds. Making a 60.00€ transaction impossible.

Thats why

@_date: 2018-12-16 17:07:57
You do realise that Europe has a different way of displaying cash values compared to USA? And that this screenshot is from the german coinbase website (look at the months, December has a z)
