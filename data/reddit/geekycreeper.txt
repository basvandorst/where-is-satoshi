Yep. Bounties were in units, items were sold in units, Star Lord had to pay 30,000 units for a guy's prosthetic leg in the prison scene, only to find out it was a joke.
It's fairly impossible to sneak money into prison, but due to units being digital, Star Lord was able to transfer them inside the Kiln.

I gave him my public email and public address.
The address they included in the message *checks out*, if it is their address so I decided to go for it.
The account it was sent from has used Reddit a little and was made 18 days ago, this checks out with the title of **Anonymous** Giveaway, because I suspect that the sender wanted to remain Anonymous, so they made a new account and used it for a few weeks.
Seems legit to me, but I guess we'll see!

The modern-day bankers are basically the same as the moneychangers in the temple during Jesus's time, so this picture is pretty accurate. The only thing that could make it better is if Jesus was flipping the tables.
**Matthew 21:12-13**
"And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. And He said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN.""

I strongly promote Wikipedia. Do yourself a favor and be respectful to others. It will make you a lot less irritating.

Cybermen are the coolest. And the scariest. Daleks ain't got nothing on Cybermen.
Pardon me for using my southern accent.

That price. 12 dollars? Seriously? Is that for shipping, taxes, handling fees, and a little slush fund extra?
