I live in the same town as Mook and went to his presentation back in Nov in Christchurch. He gave a target of $10 million per Bitcoin along with the maths. 
Now it's $700,000.. hmmm  
here's the talk  
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:11:45
Are they glued to each other? 
"Cameron Winklevoss is a long-term investor in Bitcoin and other emerging technologies. In 2004, he graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. in Economics. In 2010, Mr. Winklevoss received a Masters of Business Administration from the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford. Mr. Winklevoss represented the United States at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China."

Sums it up  
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:09:55
Yup.

never boring!

Wish I had an affiliate merchant like you. 
I'm a full time affiliate with my bulk coming from ShareAsale. They don't send money to NZ so I have to get it transferred to a UK bank account and go through the whole international transfers nonsense.. Don't see the money for about 10 days. 
I asked ShareAsale if they planned to payout affiliate with BTC but they said no plans to.. 
I'm sure you'll attract more affiliates with you BTC only decision!

I got suspended while logging into PayPal while visiting Iran. They immediately blocked it and I had to go through a series of anti-terrorist checks. Thanks PayPal.

He was trying to sell mining contracts during that presentation so that might have something to do with the $10 million per BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:58:59
Not that I've seen. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:53:54
D'oh! Nevermind - I had a symbol at the end of my BIP38 key to let me know which wallet it was and I was mistakenly trying to use it as my passphrase. 
All working now! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:03:43
Thanks for explaining. I wasn't 100% sure how it exactly worked. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:22:09
One thing i don't understand about the genesis block is it's default difficulty is 96 when on the same page it says historical difficulty is 56%. Anyone know why? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:24:49
Awesome, didn't know about this service. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:17:57
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:32:25
I'm confused, Eric Lomorzo is saying hashpower basically doesn't matter so why should we be worried about a chainspilt if no one  wants it?  
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:06:05
I was using  to test the port, it just says closed and doesn't give me much info. I'll look into nmap, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:38:33
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:55:05
yup to both
@_date: 2016-01-10 02:43:00
Announcement on 2nd April. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:35:06
Thanks, all working now :) 
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:26:38
It worked! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:24:07
This was the first time using the wallet since 2013. I suspect there are files on my computer that I can't find since I've uninstalled the software many times. Any ideas on how to find these blocks and the chainstate folders?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:34:42
Thanks, I was using Mac but same applies. Full node now up and running  
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:11:44
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:57:31
haha :)
@_date: 2018-11-14 02:03:32
I remember him talking about birthday attacks on segwit. Found an old tweet - A chain of hashes is not as secure as ECDSA by a long way 
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:26:31
Thanks Greg. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:27:28
He also has the logic that if you got into Bitcoin after him you know less about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:52:43
8MB but no - it's more than that. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:25:57
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:49:52
Because it's a BTC Futures Settlement Countdown. Nothing to do with their alt coin. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:41:23
Jump has nothing to do with that tweet. This is the reason  Happens every week. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:19:46
A leader? WTF are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:04:06
So BIP 91 gets locked in and we expect a hard fork down the road? I thought core was fully against this since a 2MB increase would be 8MB blocks which makes BTC more centralised, increases the cost of running a node and only really improves the latency for miners in China. 
So are core just going to refuse to do a hard fork when the time comes? Won't this start another war?
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:39:35
If you want BTC to be successful then you won't want the core devs to leave as it will crumble. Surely you can work that out? Only today they had to step in and save the day, once again. 
Still think you're being paid to comment. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:30:06
How much are you getting paid for this? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:41:48
Of course but signing an agreement without Core to hardfork in 3 month's notice is insane, you can't blame them for saying LOL. You're talking about a $40B industry - Look how buggy the code is from the 2x people. 
If they want to keep running their businesses running successfully, which Bitcoin will eat up in due time anyway, then they HAVE to consult with core devs first. With the tech and security, this whole thing blows up. 
NYA was a show of disrespect to the core devs who are doing amazing work. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:21:51
So blocksize will be 8MB and I know a few core devs mentioned they would quit. What a mess. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:21:08
That opens the wallet but I have encryption on my actual private key which I think is causing the error. 
So I'm guessing I need to unlock my wallet using the method you mentioned above. 
Then I need to somehow unlock my passphrase in the console.. Which I don't know how to do
The finally import the private key. 
 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:56:28
Thanks, the only cost is time. :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:08
MtGox has a 37m lag time. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:53:41
Been away for a few days but does anyone know what could be causing this? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:04
Wow this makes no sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:45:09
Awesome! All working now. Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:03:02
Fuck. Have we learnt nothing. I'd rather be my own bank than with those criminal fucks. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:56:48
But it was generally good no? Or are people panic selling? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:10:47
haha, it's a reference to the ever changing world of SEO :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:00:10
Nope, I've just added another $2k a couple of days ago and would invest more if I had more. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:34:29
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:57:07
I felt like I missed the train when I paid $240 each for BTC. Then again at $400, then again at $600, then again at $800 BTC. 
Point being, if you believe BTC has a future then the train hasn't left the station yet in my opinion. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:18:52
Nice.
