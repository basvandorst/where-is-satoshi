The encoding uses an alpha numeric list of valid 58 characters. (ie it removes the visually "difficult" characters like I and 1 etc...)
I could also have speculated that 2016 (the number of blocks before difficulty changes) is also the year that the world faces a huge economic crisis : according to expected adoption rates about that time Bitcoin would have a significantly large number of users across the world - perfectly predictable given the network effect, and assuming successful adoption.

I do it the same way everyone should do. I use bitcoin. Many of the developers work in the bitcoin space, and doing things to grow the adoption is helping them.

Paper money does not represent, nor is it backed by gold anymore. 
It sounds like you are going down the road of Bitcoin discovery. This is just the start expect not to sleep much over the coming year.

Same for the Belgian Association. We are doing this because we understand the importance of what could be.

The markets will always make commentators look like idiots, so I'm not going to comment on this. We in Belgium are not interested in promoting Bitcoin as an investment opportunity in any case it may even be against a recent ruling, but I believe that nobody in the GBA is thinking in those "investment" terms either. 
For me it is very much about starting the process of giving control back to individuals, something that the blockchain does very well, money is just the first step.

Partner was just a story line I put myself in his position (I think I'm about the same age for lots of reasons) and partners can be useful to provide motivation. Without them side-projects often don't get delivered. There were so many concepts that even the best of us would struggle to manage the "thinking bit" and the workload.

good point. 58 seems to crop up everywhere. Base58 too.

Interesting. Care to share some thoughts?

I think it is more likely that he needed an incentive to leave the community - hence the idea that he would not want to be discovered inside the intelligence community.
It has been said that It could be a state sponsored project, but the code seems to indicate one writer.

Alternative to the answers below is to back-up your private key and upload it to a lightweight client like Multibit.

1. It would be pretty difficult to move all markets at the same time. Most markets follow the price because people are watching other markets and buying and selling according to what happens there. That's why all the markets appear to follow each other.
2 Ask the German Government of pre-WWII if printing money worked for them. Ask the Argentinians, Venuzuelans, Japanese... It's not working for any of them, and it won't work "forever" for us. What is meant by the Bitcoin will end all wars comment is that your government would, by default be completely open to inspection if they accepted bitcoin. No government could survive if it made war against the wishes of its citizens using bitcoin to fund it.

Yep I know at least two. But they have free electricity.

I don't see the two organisations as being in competition. GBA offers a different approach, with less formal commitment.

When you say volatility, you should also include a reference to the value is crashing by significant amounts. I don't believe that what we see today is volatile, in fact it is the opposite of volatile, it is growing on a stable footing, day after day, month on month.
Has it ever cost you *significantly* more in Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee? Never. If anything, in the last month it has cost you *significantly less*
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:27:13
Had you understood the importance of Bitcoin at the time, you may have "walked away" with significantly more for your $2k.
But walking away isn't an option for most bitcoiners here. As someone else said "Bitcoin is the exit strategy".

Hello I'm Chris D'Costa, I made the blog post, and I thought I'd write to address some of the comments here.
Firstly I am a Lifetime Member of the Bitcoin Foundation, and the founder of a Foundation Chapter in Belgium, and I will be taking part in a panel at the next Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam, and am in the (long) process or developing a stand-alone bitcoin wallet. I really would not class myself as anti-bitcoin in any way, nor am I trying to criticise the community as a whole.
However, a community without internal challenge and dialogue can only be self-serving, and the observation I make about where the development efforts are concentrated is I feel a valid one, and I am not alone in this view, nor do I believe it is too early to begin working on consumer devices for obvious reasons.
Satoshi referred to the creation of a "peer-to-peer **cash** system" in the title of his white paper and as such "bitcoin as cash" has to be obtainable and usable by everyday people as easily as fiat cash if it is to stand a chance of wider adoption. 
At the San José conference David Perry - he of codinginmysleep.com/ - referred in a panel discussion to the need for a device that your grandmother could use, similar to the Mycellium device that was then being worked on.
At Bitcoin London Shakil Khan of Coindesk made reference to the same problem, and just recently at Tech Crunch Disrupt Naval Ravikant spoke of the lack of easy to use devices for consumers on a Bitcoin panel with the Winklevoss Brothers.
There is a general sense in these comments that we are not yet dealing with something quite important indeed.
The point I wanted to make is that we as a community are in danger of living in an ivory tower, if all we do is look at trading solutions we are in my view missing the main point. 
I am not suggesting that we abandon development of these other solutions, what I am saying is that we need to focus a whole lot more on  giving consumers something useable - even if we fail at doing it, and that is what I find lacking in the community at the moment.

So is it preferable for people to have pension funds, or just spend all the money as they earn it?
This whole idea that people don't spend the money because it is guaranteed to go up is a nonsense. They do spend, but there is some delay at the beginning (just like pension savings right?).
Once that delay has passed and a savings level has been achieved, then there is no reason whatsoever to continue to hold, some can be released into the economy, and it doesn't matter that next week that money will be worth more, because it's all releative. What you have remaining will also be worth more, and next time you spend it will cost you less. 
Nobody would ever advise spending your entire pensions account in one go or even spending the majority of it, yet this is exactly the argument used against Bitcoin's utility. You can't have it both ways.
Let me give you a concrete example. When I bout some bitcoins ori
