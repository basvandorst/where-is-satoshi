The scary part is one of his posts mentions having a son — and by that, dangerous stupidity persists.

Once you see his post history, it's definitely OK to mock this asshole. He's a dick to everyone and he's racist.
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:45:04
Let's just call this racism and xenophobia then...
"Go move to Mexico then you fucking mutt..."
"I don't really give a shit about illegal immigrant's kids coming through the border"
"I don't really care if they're separated from their parents, don't really care about their wellbeing, don't really much care about whether or not they're put in cages "
" I don't care about illegals children ... Do you care about your neighbor's dog?"
"It's really hard caring about some others that aren't our own, so I just don't care at all. Not my fucking problem."
"what other logical reason is there to cast a black woman ... It's like they forget white people make up 72% of the nation."
"&lt;on Mexican woman selling tamales in NY&gt; Wow this country really is on the path to demise."
"\[you're\] posting here joining the fun with your literally enemies (people who hate you racially)"

Looked at post history and holy shit this guy is a moron.
One of his posts says, “percentages are meaningless...math means absolutely ZERO...everything is random.” 
So yeah, multiplying a number by 2 would be difficult. 
If the BTC price doubles, his worth is completely random.
(EDIT: Removed from this post but you can see some of his racist comments below.)

Yes you say you "know nothing about poker." Since you know nothing about poker, it's completely understandable that you don't know poker hands. This guy though... commonly posts what he considers poker strategy and advice... and doesn't know the first thing you learn when playing poker for the first time.
(They are both a 'full house' but 3 4s are better than 3 3s the other 2 cards are secondary. The group of 3 is what determines which hand is higher.)
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:50:08
He means 1.4% (according to recent polls of the world population.)

Waiting to see how low it goes before I buy more but then I’ll wake up to it at 12k and miss it. Or I just buy now and then it’s 8k when I wake up. I can’t win the game but still I play. Someone else flip the coins for me.
Now my ETH on the other hand...  That one can just become worthless. But I dump now and it’s too much loss. At least I only have a little bit left.
The hodling lulls are easy. The time to ...do stuff... is stressful.

Wait, what? "Attention-Important Notice: Persons that are located in or a resident of the United States of America will be unable to create an account at Binance.com."
Person who told me they buy on binance is definitely in the US... So much for that.
So, Kraken...? CashApp?
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:38:00
Definitely not connection.
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:26:50
Is anyone else having any problems buying with CashApp tonight? I don’t know if it’s a them-thing or a me-thing.
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:57:25
Maybe I will just use Coinbase Pro then. It was mostly about a personal frustration with Coinbase but it's nothing important. I was planning on using CashApp but then someone I know that's been buying forever told me they use Binance and Kraken, so I started to consider those. So I guess I should just use Coinbase Pro instead of any of them after all ha
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:40:53
I get it but — then when that happens, that "small variation" would have been $10,000. Not exactly a tiny bump. People talk about how it's going to shoot up so it doesn't matter, but that's why it *does* matter if I'm getting less bitcoin.  It's not the end of the world or I'm devastated or anything. I'm only saying it's disappointing to acquire less than I would have a couple days ago. Looking down the road is exactly what makes it disappointing; when it turns out it's many thousands less than would have been realized if my lousy fiat money cleared a couple days earlier. I'd rather technically lose value in my current bitcoin now so that I could buy more now.  ***Less bitcoin is less bitcoin and less bitcoin is bad.***

Of course he says farewell now, because once he appears to be right about 1 thing, he can’t risk another prediction and being wrong. Let some people awe in your 1 partially accurate claim instead of opening your mouth again and debunking yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:19:34
Well this could be a big issue for me too. I got this advice from someone and I don't want to put money in to Coinbase to find out I can't do this (anymore?).
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:33:38
How does it possibly sound like that...? I budget a set amount for each investment. It's dumb to not. It's simple; the same amount of money now buys less bitcoin. It doesn't matter if you put in 2 million or 2000 or 2, you're buying less. That has nothing to do with what you can afford.
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:25:31
I was thinking of using something different than Coinbase this time. I was thinking CashApp but then I was urged to use Binance or Kraken, which I know nothing about. ...Someone please help convince me which to go with.
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:30:11
Yeah I tried relaunching and I have a good connection. I’ll wait it out and hopefully the next time I try to buy there won’t be a problem.
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:19:15
I was waiting for transferred money to clear to buy more, when it was under 10, now suddenly it's over 11.5 and I don't know what to do. (Wait for it to down again and lose out if it doesn't; or buy now and be disappointed if it goes back down to where I wanted to put the money in.) \[Someone told me "wait until Tuesday" but it could also be 15k on Tuesday...\]
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:13:44
While true in principle, I'm still getting less right now; or I have to put in hundreds of dollars more just to get what I anticipated buying a couple days ago. Almost 20% less is a lot to miss out on.
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:12:28
Hm I wonder why mine is failing. That’s one thing about the simplicity of CashApp is that nothing gives any detailed information.
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:50:34
This is something that people had easily already facetiously “predicted” without pretending to be time travelers. 
The strategy is simple; if it’s wrong, no one remembers and it remains unnoticed and no one cares—you make a new account and try again. People don’t remember old wrong predictions but if they’re right, truth always rings a bell in your memory and the predictors rush to point it out. 
It’s always ambiguous or broad without including unmistakable facts. They also could give details of the scenario to make it more believable but they don’t.  Notice too how it says “before the trial ends” instead of before it begins.
“Time travelers” never leave proof that could have very low probability of accuracy (like numbers) because *it’ll destroy the future* but being very ambiguous or general guesses that anyone could make are conveniently all good.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:50:48
Saving the sarcasm that everyone here prefers... Hodl doesn’t mean for a few weeks. It’s talking about long term. Obviously no one can predict what’s going to happen in a month but no you’re not going to make a lot of money. If you’re buying and selling in a few weeks, that’s just trading it and you won’t even make $100. Hope for $50 and be happy with more (Expectation leads to disappointment.)
People would be ecstatic if BTC can reach 20,000 by the end of the year and then you’d make less than 150. That $150 hopefully turn into 1,000 down the line but that’s a far ways away and some people are skeptical it even does that (though everyone here will say there’s no doubt...) You aren’t going to be one of the people that gets rich off bitcoin with $150 of it.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:51:36
Hmm interesting. I tried increasingly smaller amounts, $100 did not work, $50 did not work, $25 worked. I have no idea why more than 25 did not work this time.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:36:10
Where did I ever say I’m uncomfortable? I already have bitcoin but I have no problem with the price going down from here to acquire more to the dollar when it’s cheap. It’s the same as missing a sale. You can be disappointed you missed the sale price on something you’re buying anyway. I’m already at large “winnings” considering when I bought everything else. It won’t go below a price that is still “winnings.” It’s all house money. There is no losing, no money I’m missing to enjoy my life. First you try to tell me that I’m investing more than I can afford to lose, then you tell me I’m not enjoying life. What’s with the projecting? Sounds like you’re the one worried.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:17:09
I get "You are unable to purchase Bitcoin at this time" a lot on CashApp. I got the error and changed nothing and tried a test later in the day and it went through fine. I've heard no one else make this complaint about CashApp so it doesn't seem like it's a common issue. I don't get it. For every person that says, "use Coinbase Pro!" there are 3 people that say avoid Coinbase. I know there are a lot of "personal" reasons with Coinbase but I don't know what to think at this point. I don't want there to be a time where I want to buy immediately and coincidentally it goes up $3000 by the time I can buy again.
EDIT: Trying smaller amounts, $25 worked but anything over it and I get that error. Well I'm definitely not staying with CashApp if I can only buy $25 wow.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:49:36
See that's what I've been told. That the instant deposit method works. I'd expect a wait and have no issues with it as it is the usual the case. Except several people have said this method works to have funds in Pro immediately. Didn't work for me and I have no idea what the variables are either. I asked Coinbase support and they said there is always a wait and there is no way to transfer funds immediately. Yet there are definitely reports of it working for people.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:46:03
Man this has been frustrating. I made a CashApp account and every buy/deposit was failing. I ended up figuring out that I can only buy/deposit $25 a day...(??) I ask support and they don't know why and say to ask my bank. My bank doesn't know why and says it must be on their end. I tell CashApp this and they say they don't know and stopped responding. Wow.
I was told I can deposit money in Coinbase and then move that money in to my Coinbase Pro wallet to buy bitcoin there and it's all instant and cheaper. I deposited money in to Coinbase. Now if I try to move it to Coinbase Pro it tells me I have no funds available for deposit, have funds "on hold," and they tell me I have to wait 10 days.....
Meanwhile I have funds tied up and I can't buy any (and of course now it's on its way up again too.) I've been trying to buy for a week and can't.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:38:29
It's not about patience. I've had the patience of trying to communicate with CashApp support for 2 weeks and having to buy only $25 at a time, and my bank, while both keep telling me they don't know. Patience isn't making it work. Again Coinbase wallet swap method was just something suggested to me as an alternative since CashApp hasn't worked for me, and I didn't want to buy via Coinbase again, and that method didn't work—while I otherwise would have bought directly had I known. What's frustrating is what doesn't work and not what I can wait for.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:53:47
I don't know why you and the person responding can do this and I can't; maybe it is indeed a tier and account history thing and after several more deposits it'll start being possible. Although support told me it's not and never will be possible... Such contradiction here between people who have actually done it, people saying it can't, as well as support telling me it's not possible. I do trust people are telling the truth so I don't get it and why support wouldn't tell me how/when/why if it becomes available at a higher tier.
Yes because of this and the simultaneous problem with CashApp I missed the dip and will now be buying at $600+ more...
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:52:19
Yeah support is just telling me they don't know. The most recent conversation today was them telling me to make a new account... Saying I have to use new information and "might" have to use a new bank account. While I do actually have another bank account, I'm saying I don't and it's ridiculous I'd have to open a new account. The response is, "Sorry, X. There must be an issue with your account and I'm unable to correct this problem." Thanks CashApp!
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:43:07
Yeah it's no connection problem and I've tried WiFi and cell data both. Their support has asked about connection too which is definitely not a problem (I can do the $25/day at the same time more fails), also told me wait 24 hours, then they told me wait 48 hours, wait for a system reset, ask your bank, etc. I don't know how their support can't help. There was someone else here who also had this 25/day problem but I don't think they ever got it figured out either.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:22:22
Yeah I figured it would be the case, but I was told the method worked—putting in Coinbase makes it available to use on Coinbase immediately and so I can then move it to Pro immediately. Obviously this ended up not being the case. I can use it on Coinbase and pay the fees but I can not move it to Pro yet. Now I have to decide whether I buy now on Coinbase or wait the 10 days to buy and which will I end up with more BTC (ie, guessing the price 10 days from now.)
It's CashApp that has me annoyed since that is clearly a problem.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:18:17
It was made with a linked and verified bank account. The funds are available immediately to buy crypto but I can't send anything out to Pro for 10 days.
When depositing directly to Pro, I have to wait for it to clear (3-5 days) before I can use it.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:17:28
It's about the issues with the platform though and not general processing time. This is obviously a problem with CashApp and no one can figure out why. $25/day limits takes a whooooole lot of patience but that's not normal. The part with Coinbase is just frustrating because I put the funds in Coinbase presuming that method works but it didn't. So money I would have used to purchase directly is now in a hold when I was told it wouldn't be.
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:56:07
"I Am A Time Traveler" is Reddit's roleplay fetish. 
Neatly suited for the way-too-bored and stoned. 
Now it's particularly attractive on bitcoin where, even while just playing along, people want to hear that in the future bitcoin will make them rich and every little thing gonna be all right.
