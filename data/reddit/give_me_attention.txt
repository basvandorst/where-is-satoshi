I'm not sure journalists that print that sort of tripe really deserve any civility. You can tell them politely the first time they print incorrect information and maybe give them a few chances. When a publication prints shite multiple times over several years despite being corrected multiple times there is not much left to do but call them a bunch of cunts, because that is all they are.

Because it is completely meaningless and your opinion of where we are on this chart is completely worthless to us. It has been posted at every single dip in the price all the way up through this rally.

As Natanael says they don't require you to download the entire blockchain. Personally I would recommend  Electrum. Firstly, it has wallet encryption as standard which is a great plus. You can view your wallet balance but will have to enter the password to send funds. Secondly, your wallet is created from a deterministic seed. This means that you just write down the 12 word seed and that is your backup. If your hard drive fails you can recreate the wallet from the seed.

Transferring to another exchange *is* withdrawing. You are withdrawing from gox and depositing on the other exchange.  Personally I would transfer to a wallet on my own computer and then deposit it onto another exchange.  The reason for this is that if you withdraw directly from gox to a site like coinbase, it is possible for coinbase to reject the deposit and they have a habit of refunding the deposit to the sending address. If you happen to be sending the coin from gox, the refunded coin will vanish up mark karpeles' butthole and be forever lost.

but the exchange doesn't care if they are stolen either. The only people who care are the ones the coins were stolen from. It's also really easy to tumble the coins, so this isn't an issue at all.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:54:21
1. paper wallets are fine.  Get the code from bitaddress.org and run it on an offline computer (preferably a clean install) to generate your paper wallets.
2.  It can't hurt to split it up a bit, so that if you want to redeem some you don't have to bring all of your coins online.  I would suggest 10 wallets each holding 10% of your coins.
3.  alt coins are pretty shitty and much more risky than bitcoin. By all means buy some as a gamble if you enjoy that sort of thing
4.  If you import a paper wallet sweep all of the funds in it to an address generated in your wallet client.  read up about change addresses before trying this.
5.  depends how much you are trying to convert.  Large amounts use an exchange, smaller amounts use localbitcoin or spend the coins directly. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:35:36
It matches you with the cheaper seller but the exchange doesn't   keep the difference.
