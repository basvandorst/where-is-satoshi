I hope for everyone that they make enough to live happily. I really just want to see people do well.

I hope this thing really takes off. The change it can bring is change I think we need. Also I need to buy some....

So is everything in the long term. People are just throwing numbers at the freakin wall to tease that number into 5 digits.

You know what I meant. That asshole at work that has no seniority over you and instead of working together starts to try  directing you like you work for him. They are super annoying. That's people that correct spelling on the internet. I know perfectly well how to spell and write with perfect diction. But I type on the internet as if I'm texting a buddy. Idgaf if I missed the comma. It sad when someone has to take the time to respond just to tell someone they fucked up. It says a lot about the person to be honest. It says I have no life or personality. If you have never met someone like that st work then my man do I envy you. It could even be some random person your working alongside from a different company. They just try to go all boss man on you. Well I'm nobodys cotton picker boy.

It's not outlandish by any means. Buying at 10k instead of 8k if this really ever exploded could mean the difference of your family being super rich for a long time or your childrens children never wanting for anything. I just found myself having thoughts of pulling the lever and if my post saved one guy in Tennessee from blowing all his savings at 10k and panic selling at 8k I'll be happy.

Look at almost any stock but the bitcoin graph shows it pretty well. Up and down. Up and down. Awesomely enough the ups get higher and higher. I just found myself having envy and wanted to remind anyone reading that it could very well go back down or may not increase like we've seen lately. If your looking to place the really big long. I would bet there is a better time. Longs are about buying at the absolute minimum you can find. In the grand scheme that extra 10 could net 1k. Most people dont have a lot to begin with. I think it's fair to say well see 8k again in the next year. If even for a day.

We all know this. Its reddit. You could not not know it  I just dont care. Dont be like that guy at work that tells you how to do your job. Nobody asked. Dont be that guy. You got better things to do.

It's not about the price it's about speculating on whether or not someone should place longs right now. I'm sorry you feel this way and that this post has bothered you. Seriously whatever you got going on I hope it gets better. It's not good to be so angry.  I'm just hear to talk to people when I'm bored. I wouldnt think to just berate people. 
I'll tell ya what. We race lambos once it hits big and if you win I guess I'll say that I'm an asshole for posting that people shouldn't go super big right now if you cant afford it just because of domo and if you lose you'll say it's not very nice to call people assholes. 
I could be a someone that is having a very hard time in life and has no love or light in my life. You just come along with your little dump truck of negativity and sprinkle a little more on. You should have listened to your mother more. 
If you don't have anything nice to say. Don't say anything at all. 
May you find true happiness and learn to exude love and positivity for your sake and others.

Who ever said stay away? Also yes I expressed an opinion on a public forum to discuss bitcoin and its price, uses etc. If that bothers you then you are not in the right place. Also I just hope my post saves one person from going all in at 10k and panic selling at 8k. Why people need to throw around insults like moron and the like to people they dont know is pretty sad. Its unfortunate you feel this way. I hope your day gets better.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:53:31
I do when it's something I care about. But I appreciate you expressing your opinion in a normal manner. That's very adult of you. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!

May have 13% on hand but we have FDIC up to something like 200k. Garunteed by the government. If they didn't stick to that then there would be mass revolts.

Thats kinda where it stops though. After 50 dollars your hitting fees you would never see on a ATM even non-B of A ATM fees mixed with the ATM fee doesnt hit that high. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:19:43
Yeah i forgot about those. Yeah it probably is omly enforced under certain circumstances.

I could see the defrauding being the primary thing they are concerned about. I was just pretty darn sure that your not supposed too. I think I learnt about it when we were crushong pennies at the railroad track.

The specific federal law at issue is 18 USC 333, which proscribes criminal penalties against anyone who “mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association,

Jesus 3200. Im so glad my bank kicked back the 500 in BTC I tried to buy at like 12k. I probably would have tried to hold untill 25k or some stupid number. Ive been waiting to see some headline on here like "Man loses all on BTC tries to fatally shoot himself and lives because he could only afford a pellet gun". Those damn Saving Private Ryan videos cant help.

Ahhh isnt that a Felony? Cool work but id be scared to post this. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:01:54
Well the law I found is the law 18 USC 333.The specific federal at issue is 18 USC 333, which proscribes criminal penalties against anyone who “mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, It literally says defacing money by making cuts is punishable. If you are not in the USA obviously they dont apply. Im not sure calling people ignorant for something a google search tells you instantly is correct is there a a us federal code that Im not aware of such as excluding artists from being prosecuted for these laws.
On the other hand I think this is creative and I dont have any issue with it. Not like the government doesnt jist snap its fingers and create billions out of thin air.
