If he's using the vehicle for Sean's Outpost and it's registered in his own name, he's scamming the insurance company.

I understand you're a little upset about the recent falls in bitcoin price, but it's really worth stepping back and calming down here.

So, how much are you putting up to start this thing?

Unemployment is the lowest it's been in like fifty years. I'm not saying you'll be CEO in a few weeks, but if it's literally the difference between being homeless or not I *guarantee* you that you can find some kind of job, though it might be shitty.

Can’t you, like... get a job?
