Good job to everyone who reported.
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:57:36
That's terrible that you didn't get paid.
It's unfortunate due to Rogers domain and publicity that this casino gets a lot of traffic.
You should try a casino that's been open for years, provably fair and has proven trust like 
Yes that's my site but even today someone won 200 Bitcoin and cashed that and their initial amount out in less than 6 hours, it would normally be shorter.
We've been open over 3.5 years, have a crowdfunded bankroll of 4300 Bitcoin and have the highest betting limits in the industry, win 215 Bitcoin in one bet.
Deposits are 1 confirm and withdrawals are instant up to 50 Bitcoin, which I manually process if more.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:19:59
There's loads of gambling sites, an industry where Bitcoin has a huge number of benefits such as instant withdrawals (no waiting 5 days on bank transfer ), provably fair play (prove that the casino didn't cheat you).
This sub seems to downvote anything to do with gambling though.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:43:53
Currently running a provably fair, instant withdrawal casino where players can feel safe when depositing and know they won't be scammed.
Been designing a content publishing platform, a wallet/exchange service and just studying the Bitcoin source code. But time is taken up a lot with BetKing for me to really work on other projects at the moment.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:18:09
Used to do but there was very little traffic except on the Open Face Chinese games. We are working on bringing new poker software by the end of the year.
@_date: 2016-08-28 15:30:21
Agreed that we need standards.
I just personally think that seeing my balance as 156364 bits is just as bad as seeing something like 0.00023434. 
Where as a mB is almost $1 so makes things pretty easy.
Saying that, I still display balances as Bitcoin with 8 decimal places :) which was due to popular demand actually.
@_date: 2016-08-28 10:57:41
I think mB is even easier. We used that on the poker tables. 
No one wants to play for 0.001/0.002 blinds but if you say 1mB/2mB it's easy.
Either way people then get confused what a bit or a mB is in terms of $/£ etc.

If you want information on the most popular Bitcoin gambling sites (dice) you can see stats on this website

Not everyone here is a programmer
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:32:10
I spoke with them last week and they said they hope to later this year
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:36:21
I spoke with RBS, LLoyds, Barclays, HSBC and Santander.
None of them will allow you to open a business account for a Bitcoin related business.
None of them will allow trading of Bitcoin on your personal account.
The traders on LocalBitcoin will not mention that they are trading Bitcoin or their accounts may get closed.
Note though that it isn't actually illegal to trade Bitcoin using your bank.
@_date: 2016-04-11 09:28:05
Thanks for creating this library. I've started moving some of my code over to using NBitcoin and it is much easier to work with.

Tipped on BetKing. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:42:12
Welcome to the 21 million club :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:35:04
I agree with that one
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:05:20
Be good to see more adoption in B&amp;M stores for sure

Welcome aboard! pm'd thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:04:32
Yeah good moment that
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:15:15
Sent you a tip on BetKing.io

pm'd. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:44:02
Yes, as mentioned in the OP we used to be named PRC. 
I re-branded last month with an easier to remember name.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:22:40
I use Armory for cold storage but looking in to mycelium to use with Trezor on phone.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:27:29
Keep the change :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:36:13
Tipped you on BetKing. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-25 11:46:37
Thanks, you too. Congrats
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:40:26
Nice prediction.
I tipped on BetKing
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:18:49
May it continue :) pm'd thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:12:26
Nice, hope you get another upswing before cashing out :) gl
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:06:44
Always wondered about this myself. Interesting to see what could develop.
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:06:03
Here's a start :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:15:54
pm'd. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:38:30
I'll have a look at others.
I might even just make my own (not in time for these payouts though)
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:05:21
Keep us posted
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:14:04
Nice investment and helping the Bitcoin economy grow.
Follow up in future with any projects you make :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:19:20
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:35:43
Hope so too :)
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:30:13
When we first started it was a poker only site. However as you may know poker sites need a lot of traffic to keep games running and when we first started we just didn't have it except for in the open face chinese games. 
Bitcoin was even less popular back then and most players stated at SwC.
Poker was removed and I focused more on the dice game since it was becoming more popular.
However poker will make a return in the new year with a new variant launched before also. More games and a betting exchange are also planned for first half of next year
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:18:34
Yeah that was great to see. pm'd thanks.

pm'd. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:42:58
I've actually been looking in to creating a Bitcoin bank to help with this type of problem. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:41:09
Yeah I agree. Merry Christmas
@_date: 2015-12-25 11:01:22
Done, gl

Here's hoping.
I tipped on BetKing.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:17:58
Let's see :) 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:15:36
Remember you can always buy smaller amounts than 1 Bitcoin. Good luck
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:40:30
Lets make it happen :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 12:17:38
Not sure why you would say that.
But yes people have got them. They could confirm here.
It was slower to pay because changetip banned my account since it was gambling related so I am having to pm everyone and arrange to pay via BetKing 
It will take time to reply to &gt;120 people though
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:21:59
Tipped on BetKing. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:43:17
The roulette game currently uses the same bankroll as dice, which is why the betting limits are high. Blackjack isn't at the moment but all casino games will be in future.
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:10:18
Yeah that would be good
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:38:23
Still the same owner.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:41:53
Always a good time to buy :)
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:40:01
Me too!
@_date: 2016-01-31 21:50:47
We have 1% house edge on our dice game at  
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:41:09
The popular CS:GO gambling sites are clones of Bitcoin gambling sites (mostly dice) and they took the same provably fair methods from the Bitcoin sites.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:12:07
Ha, at the moment you would either have to delete cookies for the site or use in private browsing or different browser.
I will add a button to replenish balance after bust.
I duplicated betking.io code and for obvious reasons there's no replenish button built in to that site :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:35:51
Yeah it's easier to mash buttons when it's not your own money :)
The site uses the exact same provably fair algorithm as BetKing.io and other dice sites so you can verify your results and see that they would have won if betting for real Bitcoin. There is no roll manipulation happening.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:28:37
Latest is 4.45 on Conor
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:20:00
Hi, the site is safe yes. It's actually a relaunch of an existing site. We've been around since 2013 and were the most popular crowdfunded Bitcoin casino from later 2014 to end of 2016.
There is no extra betting except win or loss at the moment as this is just a small promo mini-site to allow people to bet while wating for the full launch on september 4th.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:37:58
Max bet is 1 Bitcoin which is a little over $4000 at the moment
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:29:22
On the bet page you can change the odds format to American, fractional or decimal
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:38:17
Withdrawals are in Bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:30:57
Yes, if you got to  and register you will see a deposit button that will give you a Bitcoin address to send to.
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:03:39
First you need to get Bitcoin.
You can have a look at  That lets you trade with people in your own country/city with a lot of options including national bank transfer.
You can also look at buying at an exchange like Bitstamp but this will take longer and you may need to provide ID.
From LocalBitcoin or any exchange you can transfer to any Bitcoin gambling site you like. Do research and see what sites are trusted and been around longest.
Obviously I suggest  as it's mine. We've been around 3.5 years and have 6000 Bitcoin invested so pretty trustworthy.
After you are done you can send back to LocalBitcoin and trade back to your local currency.
I'd recommend that you look in to using your own wallet and storing your coins there if you don't want to trade back to FIAT.
Check out this site for a lot of information on what Bitcoin is, how to use and learn about the different wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:28:55
I sent almost $3 million with a fee of $8.54 at the weekend paying just over 5 sat/B without SegWit.
Didn't take long to confirm either.
Saying that though, we are launching SegWit support on our site on Monday now that Trezor supports it.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:30:16
It was PRC and this is Dean :)
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:30:22
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:13:39
See the other post where I said your site closed in 2014. BetKing has been the leading crowdfunded bitcoin dice site since 2014 and thats fact that is easily verified. 
Also 11k btc in june 2013 was worth a lot less $ than the BetKing bankroll. You had the advantage that there wasn't really anywhere else around either.
Then when you vouched for 2 dice sites that turned out to be scams ('cos anyone but Dean right?) a lot of people lost faith in investing in dice and you lost a lot of credibility.
Yet I still managed to keep a lot of money safe, secure and add a great ROI on top (over 100% in a lot of cases).
Your opinion doesn't matter to anyone anymore
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:55:47
Just-Dice has been closed since 2014
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:47:46
We've had 4-6000 Bitcoin of other peoples money invested in the site for over 2 years. More than any other crowdfunded gambling site. Proof via 3rd party:  
I just divested everyone 4 days ago to allow them to withdraw.
If you were in the Bitcoin gambling dice community you would probably know this.
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:31:09
It's also funny how my own thread posted here the other day announcing the ICO got downvoted instantly and my comment here does too.
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:44:18
You mean the 6000 Bitcoin I just divested and allowed everyone to withdraw? You can spread your hate all you want but no one has lost any money at BetKing. You are still complaining about a stupid decision you made to try and hold me ransom for a domain over 2 years ago.
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:25:04
I think people in this thread should first research what BetKing is and also what a scam is.
I just divested 6000 Bitcoin from current bankroll investors and only looking to raise 2000 for shares in the company.
None of that makes this remotely likely a scam. 
BetKing is the most trusted Bitcoin gambling site.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:36
I've actually been thinking of an idea for an initiative made up of Bitcoin gambling sites to try and commit resources to helping Bitcoin development. Either via their own developers spending time working on the bitcoin code or some improvement ideas or donating funds to existing projects/teams.
Would like to talk with the core team about this soon.
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:04:57
Thanks Alan, and the rest of the team.
I have used Armory for 3 years now to secure player and investor funds without any issues and always recommended it as the best wallet.
I had some very specific use cases that you helped out with a lot in the early days.
All the best on your next project.
@_date: 2016-09-24 07:56:04
You could invest in our gambling game  
We've made investors 1776 profit since Jan 2016.
4773 since Jan 2015 and a total of 5782 since we started providing the investment service in the middle of 2014.
Proof: 
We currently have almost 5000 Bitcoin invested all stored in cold storage (except 100 we keep in hot wallet for faster player withdrawals). 
@_date: 2016-09-27 21:04:38
Yeah so that would be yourself when making your own wallet or in this case me when I made the BetKing wallets. You shouldn't let someone else do this step. 
Does that make sense? Did I understand your question correctly?
@_date: 2016-09-26 10:25:10
This is one of the reasons we give you one time use addresses now at  After you use a deposit address you are assigned a new one.
@_date: 2016-09-27 21:27:41
Ah. No there's no other people involved in the parts described in the article. The seed is split up and stored in different locations. This could be like bank deposit box, safe etc just as some examples. 
It's not actually just separating the words either.
I think I will try updating the article to show some examples and pictures of the process.
But image your secret was the four words one, two, three, four.
When you encrypt this you will have something that you can't read like:
 bdsf7y8eufhndf8euue98snk (made up example)
Now this is what you use the Shamir Secret tool to split up wich if you were to split into 3 separate parts would give (again total made up) something that looked like this:
Those are the parts you print out and store in different locations.
I hope that makes sense. I need to go back and give proper examples and explain a little better.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:06:24
Hi Reddit
BetKing.io has relaunched with brand new software after a successful ICO where we raised $6.5 million.
We have a promo running at the moment for 100% deposit bonus with 0 edge on bets.
All deposits go to Trezor SegWit addresses.
We've got lots of new features and games planned over the coming months. 
p.s. looking to hire developers to work on games too.
Feel free to ask any questions
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:11:40
We launched the new site with SegWit deposits on Monday too. Didn't think of posting it here though :)
Good to see others going this route
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:37:34
We will offer sports betting soon but not sure yet if it will be with in play betting at the starts. Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-05 08:12:28
We use Trezor but you need to properly backup the seed too. You can read how we do it here 
@_date: 2016-05-10 21:48:11
Does anyone know the legality of the crowdsale?
When I was looking at similar methods of raising funds I was advised by lawyer that I could not do so anonymously like Mycelium is doing without having to prove identity and list share holders names on annual tax report, UK based. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 10:13:40
Just sent 0.01087 to the address you sent.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:30:56
The reason I say most trusted is because even if another site may have more active users or wagered amounts, no other site secures as many Bitcoin as Betking.io meaning more people trust us with their funds.
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:12:35
There may be some testimonials on Bitcointalk or if you chat with people on the site chat but some, especially large investors, remain anonymous and don't do much in terms of promotion.
I guess the best testimonial is that there's been a large amount invested for around 2 years now.
You can see daily wagered/profit/investment stats on this 3rd party site  We make everything public so they scrape the data every 5-10 minutes.
I've actually thought of adding Ethereum support but alt coins don't get much wagered so not sure if it would have a worthwhile ROI.
@_date: 2016-05-11 21:46:16
We actually have the highest stakes provably fair Bitcoin casino at 
Our dice game allows you to win 325 Bitcoin in a single roll due to the community bankroll (3538 Bitcoin) where anyone can invest their Bitcoin in the house. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:46:35
Thanks for posting the link, I should have done so.
I thought it was maybe best to not highlight the feature as it's not to do with gameplay. Maybe I should though as it can show the trust of the site to new players.
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:47:41
We offer the largest payouts of any other gambling site in a single bet, 323 Bitcoin, on our dice game.
We also have slots, roulette, blackjack and sports.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:13:59
We opened in April 2013 and have the largest crowdfunded bankroll of any Bitcoin casino, 4857 Bitcoin.
Proof of funds 
You probably haven't heard because unfortunately most Bitcoin gambling news and reviews sites are owned by competitor casinos and so we don't market on them. We've seen very poor ROI doing that in the past.
@_date: 2016-05-11 07:23:58
No I was looking to raise Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:09:06
We've never really had any withdrawal problems. At most some users might have waited 12 hours in the past if hot wallet was empty but this is rare.
There's players that have withdrew around 1000 Bitcoin multiple times in the same day (proof on blockchain)
@_date: 2016-05-08 10:38:36
It is not confirmed yet in the blockchain
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:57:09
Send me a Bitcoin address and I'll send $5 so you can get started ;)
@_date: 2016-05-08 10:05:52
Yeah just need an address to send to.
Feel free to ask any questions about Bitcoin on Reddit. There's an FAQ and search feature too.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:43:30
They actually do. At BetKing and other Bitcoin casinos that provide faucet (we don't now) you would get users sitting claiming a few satoshis every 5 minutes all day every day.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:57:34
If you go to this page  you will see a button to click invest. You need to deposit Bitcoin obviously first by clicking the deposit button at the top of the page.
There is more information on how investment works here 
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:52:39
What features would you be interested in? Most stats and information can be looked up with an API but there's not a full API published on this version.
@_date: 2016-07-16 22:40:37
There's quite a few legit Bitcoin casinos. We use provably fair methods, proof of funds and years of built trust by having instant cashouts of very large amounts.
FIAT sites with gambling licenses have scammed millions of dollars from customers in the past, see Full Tilt and Ultimate Bet along with many more.
@_date: 2016-07-17 23:41:49
When you deposit on BetKing a new address is assigned to you. You will not see your old address when you click deposit.
So this was meant as one time use addresses. 
However many people kept depositing to their old address, say depositing 4 times in an hour while playing and then they would need to manually be credited.
I don't get what you mean about manual confirmation. I need to do that otherwise players don't get their money. 
So to solve the issue of players needing to wait until I did that I made it so your old deposit addresses will still credit your account.
There is no way around this.
The good thing is that less and less players reuse addresses now.
In case you didn't know BetKing is an off-chain betting site.
People should look to use other sites to trade Bitcoin instead of Coinbase
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:55:29
Thanks for the mention.
BetKing.io investors have made a share of over 2500 Bitcoin in the past 12 months. We've been around since 2013 and have a crowdfunded bankroll of almost 5000 Bitcoin.
If anyone has any questions I'll happily answer.
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:26:14
No. You invest in the house bankroll that players bet against. Any losses from players go to investors instantly at time of bet. You can invest/divest at any time.
The games that investors back have a 1% edge in favor of the house.
There is a risk as players can win your money. You really have to think long term and only invest what you can afford to lose.
We have leveraged risk option so you can deposit a smaller amount to the site to reduce counterparty risk.
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:02:14
You mean the return of PvP poker :)
Hopefully by the end of the year on our next big update.
@_date: 2016-07-14 09:05:09
This doesn't include off chain transactions.
@_date: 2016-07-13 14:52:44
The site has been open over 3 years and has the largest amount invested of any Bitcoin casino and the biggest high rollers.
What you could do is give me your user id and I will look into the issue and resolve.
@_date: 2016-07-18 00:05:42
I have thought of sending back but sometimes the deposit comes from an address that the player doesn't control. 
I'm sure there are other things I can do to improve the system.
@_date: 2016-07-17 23:36:34
Yes it was great of PokerStars to step in and organise with the DoJ to pay back most of the players so great you got that.
