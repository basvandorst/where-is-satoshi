If you've ever done any production testing you'll see that you never know how well a server can handle a load until your app is out in the wild.

While you are right that the internet goes along with fire, projectile weapons, counting, The written word, cameras and auto (and aero)mechanics as inventions that changed our species you must admit that Reddit is not what makes the internet great and it is good to unplug from social media every once and awhile.

Sending someone your __private__ key is convincing?

Isn't it ironic?

I at least have abstract reasoning to back up my claim, your average person (your average redditor, even) doesn't buy reddit gold.  I didn't really say for a fact either I said that it's likely the overlap between those who buy reddit gold and crypto currency is higher than you give credit for, because both take a technical type of person with a particular interest.

Just move ~40-60% of your gains into stocks because stocks are a lot more stable (since you are buying a piece of a company.)

Oh yeah I too have witnessed this, there's an economics saying that goes something like, "if you want your business to succeed, spend other peoples money!" which really just means that if no one is willing to invest in your business (or you don't qualify for a business loan, I suppose) it's because it's probably going to fail and/or is a bad business idea.

This isn't bad advice investing in an associates degree or certifications is a great investment because certs can double your salary and associates can get you jobs you wouldn't be able to before (not to mention the first 2 years of college, the associates degree, has just as much to do with teaching you how to be a functioning member of society, how to network, speak to people, etc.)  Obviously if you enjoy school (or at least do well) it's even better to turn that associates into a Bachelors.
But yeah investing in a business without a solid business plan and enough capital to succeed is a bad idea (and any particularly good business idea shouldn't require much capital from you since you should be able to convince other, more successful people, to help you seed fund it.)

I'd like to see that backed up with some facts, the odds are the type of people who tend to buy reddit gold are the same type of people to be into crypto.  Not saying that most people don't pay with cash just that I'm sure the overlap of people is probably bigger than you make it out to be.

Buy yourself some good ETF's and Index Funds, once you have a decent amount of those start looking into companies doing business in your area of expertise (whatever that may be) and make your decision about stocks based on things like dividends and annual growth rate.  After that you should have a feel at least for what investing is like, begin to diversify your portfolio into other markets.
