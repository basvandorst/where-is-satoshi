Comes out to just over 5%
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:26:47
They build in just over 5% in fees.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:22:49
I agree. Over time competitors will do this for less.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:21:53
Yeah it was binance.
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:47:03
Nothing to worry about, as they were super low fee (1 sat/byte).

You hold your own keys on Compound. It's DeFi.

To be fair usually it’s 2 fingers pointed at you and the remaining 3 back at themselves.

$2340 today. Other people from reddit sent bitcoin to it before it was found/claimed. 0.3 BTC total

The review ended there as you can see.

What Bitcoin Did
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:34:37
Why $500? Why not $5,000 or $50,000? You don’t know other people’s situations or how much money they are dealing with.

This article is doing a good job explaining:
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:20:50
Yes that is exactly my point. You didn’t have the keys. The website had the keys and when the government took over the site then the government had the keys.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:25:47
You don’t understand how bitcoin and private keys work. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:22:53
Because the website had the keys, not you.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:58:23
Since you deposited your bitcoin to a wallet on that site the keys were being held by that site. If you have the keys right now, then you still have the bitcoin associated with them. That is how bitcoin works. You literally have to have the key. So where is the key?
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:27:07
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:05:41
If you transfer bitcoin to an account on a website, then you are giving your bitcoin to that website and hoping they return them someday. The point of cryptocurrency is that you hold the keys yourself and not rely on 3rd parties who are holding your keys for you to stay in business.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:44:49
Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
