People in here were shitting on their coverage of the huge gains two weeks ago. Rightfully so, their reporting was uninformed and naive. They were caught off-guard and looked a little ridiculous for it. 
However it's clear that they've started to do their homework and obviously at least Jim is on board with the idea. They probably won't completely understand the underlying tech behind it but I'm willing to bet they get a firm grasp on the Bitcoin asset and it wakes them up to other crypto-currencies.
CNBC covering the cryptos is only good for those who are hodl'ing and I think they deserve a small pat on the back for finely coming around, about half a decade late, but they got there.

It's all dependent on the start/end of bars, you can make a candlestick chart look like anything. It's still a useful tool! This one just shows a range from the past 3 days and wanting to test the highs and lows of that previous run.

Honestly in the past 5 years a lot of day trading jobs are now just computers trading with themselves. There are market makers still at the NYSE and NASDAQ but it's almost all automated except for some limited tasks. 
Don't get me wrong there are still day traders because if you're good it's a self sufficient job but on Wall Street they're not as plentiful anymore.

You only need to have 35% of the money in your account for your purchase. However if your trade starts to go against you, you have to put more money in the account to cover the losses to stay at 35% plus interest. You're basically borrowing the money from the CME.

Edit: Oh I see what happened, whoever had that huge order in at 14,000 pushed it back to 14,250.

There was a 177 bitcoin buy order that bought all the selling orders at $12,000. Then another for 100 bitcoins, and another for 72. 
This in itself isn't unusual but the speed at which they were bought/sold and all orders cleared was incredibly quick. Normally the orders are filled at a semi-consistent rate a few bitcoins at a time, sometimes large orders come in and it takes an hour for buyers/sellers to chip away at them.
Because trading is mostly psychological and humans love round numbers with lots of zeroes the $1000 increments have, for the most part, been points of resistance, where the price will bump up against the next $1000 increment then come back down, then bump up against it again before finally going above.
So a bunch of people think it's going to cap out at $12,000 or they wanted to lock in profits they already made so they set up sell orders at that level to trigger automatically. Well a bunch of other people think it's going to skyrocket beyond $12,000 so they had huge buy orders in at that price.
When that happens, in any market, it's beautiful to watch. You can just watch hundreds of millions of dollars trade hands in 2 minutes or less until finally whichever side has the most orders wins and the price breaks through or goes down again.

It would probably remain taxed. Not sure how you think they'd somehow rule against the U.S. gov't collecting taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:44:40
I found it's because people think of it like dollars. You would go get at a bank or have it given to you for selling something. Most people don't understand the stock market as is let alone a crypto-market and mining. 
When you can get 'bitcoins' at the crypto equivalent of at ATM it'll be mainstream.

I think you guys are too heavily invested in the idea of the banks coming in and trying to move the markets. 
They're interested in Bitcoin but they aren't going to come in and manipulate the market with risk levels this high. They're going to put in a few million at most and sit and wait.
They can make more money in one day on the stock market than Bitcoin going to 100k. They don't care as much as you guys think, they love the block chain more than bitcoin.

They haven't, anyone in the business, exchange software engineer, day trader, market manager, etc., would know that if you don't have market makers you *need* a price build up and matching system during any large news events or stops/starts in trading.
On the NYSE specialists get to work early, if you watch the opening market they'll start to come in around 7:30-8am and line up orders on each side of the book and slowly but surely bring the spread down until opening bell. On the Nasdaq the same thing happens but they call them market makers (same thing as a specialist) and they perform the same role but they aren't at the NYSE and are usually an investment firm or bank somewhere. The NASDAQ also has hundreds of market makers whereas the NYSE hires ~7 firms to manage the specialist activities.
GDAX doesn't have any of that shit. It's straight up bid/ask postings and free-for-all after that. It's really sad how shitty their setup is. 
The best part about it is the UI.

Selling before a level in your plan is a sure fire way to get kicked out of a good trade by your auto limits, at least in real life. I'm not sure how the market making works in bitcoin on GDAX or any other coin market. Those market makers work for other companies and know where people get in and out and will literally take you to the penny of say 5% (popular get out limit) since they can stomach the loss and you can't often times. 
In the case of bitcoin and the GDAX I'm pretty sure it's all automated so unless someone is pushing the coin market with dollars that most likely wouldn't happen. 
That bidding war happens like you said but you have to remember almost all the orders you're seeing are auto-placed. buys/stops/limits and not many people give a shit about pennies on the dollar. Like I said in my first comment we're conditioned to like really round numbers.
Good question.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:30
But Bitcoin doesn't have a stock or assets underlying it's value so there's absolutely nothing stopping it from going to 100k and being *healthy*. There is nothing to compare it to to say, "oh it shouldn't be that price because of this." 
It's just what people want to believe it's worth.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:03


No it's pretty much a currency, it's not fiat but it trades against the USD/CAD/Yen/Euro. 
Just because fiat markets have shoved it into the commodity asset class doesn't make it not a currency. They just don't want to believe it's a currency since it's not government backed. 
Which is fine. If they're wrong though they'll pay for it greatly later. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:24:13
Yeah they're supposed to but even if we head that way it'll be a really long transition time. Banks and governments aren't just going to drop fiat currencies and taxation control overnight. 
So something in between would be great. Instead of cards we can just stick a USB stick into the ATM and load $50 of bitcoin onto it.

It would mean you're placing your trust in the certificate authority (person who gives you the certificate) versus trusting the wallet/market bitcoin company.
There's no such thing as a "Bitcoin certificate" at least not one that's part of the Bitcoin blockchain so you're buying a derivative product that was created by whoever is selling it.
You'll have to investigate further and decide where you want to take the extra risk.

A Futures contract is exactly what the name stands for, a promise to buy/sell in the future. The Chicago Board of Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange are offering these contracts on their markets. 
So now someone can buy a futures contract for bitcoin that comes due on Jan 10th 2018, Feb 10th 2018, and Mar 10th 2018. 
If you have bitcoins and you think the price is going to go down then you can agree to sell someone bitcoins Jan 10th at $15,500 and someone can buy a futures contract that would enable them to buy them. Now if the price goes down you still get to sell them for $15,500 when that contract comes due. 
If the price goes up then you have to provide the bitcoins at $15,500 and the other person can sell them for whatever the new higher price is.
The CBOE/CME have set these futures as cash-settled however so all exchanges are done in cash on the market and not in bitcoins. So instead of providing the bitcoins you would provide the cash value of the bitcoins. 
This is key because it allows someone to invest in the market without owning the actual asset. Same way you and me can trade in hogs and wheat without owning a farm.

I actually think you'll be surprised. Institutional investors have already started putting their stakes down in Bitcoin quietly, I don't see them wishing the price would go down. They almost all view themselves co-existing with Bitcoin, so we'll see how that works out for them.
 The real gain is private investors that weren't about to start a mining farm but will gladly pick up options on the CME. I think they've been curious and will dip their toes in the water, with massive amounts of cash.

lol way in the past now, didn't even make it to midnight. Might go to 15k tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:27
18.8k and now it's settled around 18.4k. 
Hahaha this is so stupid, I'm going to miss work and I don't care. We're watching history.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:39:33
It's way through $16k CAD already I have a feeling we're going to see $13k today. Soooo many people dumped their shorts this morning when it hit over $12900. 
Looks like some soft support at ~$12,700 for those expecting a pullback today.

There is ALWAYS going to be a middle-man for transactions in the real marketplace. Even if the blockchain is built on not trusting anyone thus leaving it decentralized and completely open yet anonymous, PEOPLE need to trust someone. They're also willing to put their trust in someone if it opens up avenues of convenience for them.

You deal with it a lot as a day trader, "oh damn if i had only gotten in there, or got out there I'd be a millionaire right now." Could be once a day or couple be ten times a day. 
You eventually learn to create solid trading plans and stick with them without allowing your personal bias to interfere with buy/sell orders. 
It's hard but it's a trained skilled.

583 for volume on the CBOE. Not bad but not amazing.

No? It's a post on reddit man not an FEC filling. Taking it a little seriously.

10th and 17th. For CBOE and CME respectively. 
Edit: correct order now.

 If you move over 10k at a bank in Canada i have to fill out paperwork.  That's less than 1 bitcoin.

That's completely different than what everyone else is saying in here. They keep talking about the banks and hedge funds, not private investors.
I agree with you it will be private money, but I don't think it's out to do the kind of damage you guys think. They want to make money too and futures aren't always useful for just shorting something.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:06
$0.01 if you wanted. It's all about your risk tolerance and how much of a pain it is for you to do it.

You aren't trading Bitcoins on the exchange you're trading USD *for* Bitcoins or the other way around.

Exactly. I bought more at 4.5k, 6k, 7k, right up until 13k. It'll correct but I'm just betting on the futures markets pushing the prices higher in their first two weeks. I'm not invested enough to get rich or worry about losing the money I just wanted some skin in the game because it's funner this way.

You think trillions of dollars of futures are going to be sold? That is very optimistic..
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:52:38
Well the banks will, but it won't be with any sort of significance to their earnings. 
They're mostly interested in the block-chain stuff. Beyond that they think it's another commodity asset and are treating it as such.

Say I was trading the tech sector and that day I was targeting Google. GOOG
When I get to my desk in the morning I would place an order to buy 10000 shares of GOOG for $0.01, one penny and I would place a sell order for all our shares at $5,000.
Now Google's stock is about $1000 so no way someone is selling me their shares for 1 penny, and no way is someone buying my shares for $5,000 a piece. But...you never know, anyway you can give yourself a chance to make money. There are some days where the markets go banana's and in all the confusion you get some insane trades that don't end up getting reversed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:27
You say cashing in but all I see are outsiders getting into the market and getting sucked into the hype. When the futures drop it's going to get crazier.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:06
Institutional money is already in the bitcoin market. It's just mostly sitting on the sidelines though because of the apparent risk valuation is high for risk management schemes at banks. None of the banks are going to put more than &lt;10 million anywhere near a crypto-currency.
There's no underlying asset, the liquidity isn't high enough for them to dump their position straight to cash (unless you get creative with markets) if they need to get out, and their executives are more interested in the block-chain than they are crypto-currencies right now. They're trying to use the block-chain in their own businesses and use it in the Dollar economy. Which is great because they have lots of money to speed that up and I'd prefer if they stay out of the crypto-markets with their 100s of billions that shove us all out eventually.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:40:35
No they don't, you'd have to sell them through an intermediary which would essentially buy them from you straight up or sell them on the market bit-by-bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:21
I agree the patterns are nearly identical. I've been able to follow along with the 1/4 hour trends pretty steadily on the candlesticks. It even follows support level rules pretty well. 
I watched the 2008 crash at my desk and this is so similar, just in reverse.

I agree but you're not going to get the same risk profile from bonds as Bitcoin. I should have corrected myself and said they can't make the same amount of money with the same risk profile.
Also Morgan and Goldman both average over ~3B a year in bond *revenue* per quarter. Even JPMorgan (which has a horrible fixed income desk) did better than 3B last year and that was with a nearly 20% fall. 
Profit is whatever they want it to be after fancy accounting. D:

I think this one is a little more obvious in terms of risk.

The govt will know as soon as you either spent money to buy them or exchange them for dollars.

In a practical sense they show trends and levels of support. In a statistical sense they mean nothing because it's very dependent on arbitrary choosing of candlestick start/end times.
In practice you would use the 1 minute chart all the way up to the 1 day or even 1 week chart to signal trends and turn-a-rounds. It's very much a pseudo-science but has been proven to be useful as a tool in the belt of day traders.
I would never use candlesticks to buy anything I would hold longer than 1 day. They are not useful for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:03:24
Well it did dip to 15.5k but not for long.

Yup it's almost like companies will try to do everything they can to make money and someone should watch over them.
If you think the SEC does nothing I invite you to read some financial history before 1940 and then come tell me that and how you think it could be better.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:27:41
Sorry to breakup the circle jerk but the SEC does a damn good job considering the amount of corruption there could be. Trying to keep a market free and open while at the same time under strict regulation is a tightrope act they've done very well for many years.
