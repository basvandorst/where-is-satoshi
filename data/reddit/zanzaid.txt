I'm hodling but this dip is realllly hard to look at. Not sure how others did it!

It will probably rise to about $52,065 and then crash to $1.06 i'd say. 
(I'm not sure why you'd think any of us would actually know)

Can you afford to lose $250? That's the main question of them all.
Bitcoin is not some get rich quick scheme because you just want more money now. You won't be waking up tomorrow and seeing your $250 has suddenly risen to $400, because it could have easily dropped to $100 as well.
Honestly, considering it doesn't sound like you have any money that you can afford to lose, i think you're better off keeping the PS4

Just remember that the price of bitcoin is not just going to go up and up, sometimes it will go down and have dips. Don't panic sell if you bought at an amount and then the price starts dropping, because chances are it'll eventually go up again.
It's an investment, so that 4k now could easily be $40,000 in the future!

Wait for what?

Up, Down, maybe even sideways!

Buy it now. If i say said it was going to rise to $12,000 on the 16th, what would you say? It's no less reputable than anything else you've read

Depends how you look at it really.
At €600, no you're not gonna to start seeing thousands start pouring in making you rich quick (I mean who knows really to be fair). But in saying that, you still could easily be at say, €1000 in a years time. So is that worth it to you?
The other thing to consider is, lets say you took this loan and added 50 to it each week and put it in a savings account. Now on some rough calculations, what amount would you be looking it?
In the end it's an investment, you could well be up to €20,000 profit in 20 years, or be stuck down at €53 from a  crash. You need to decide what's worth it to you and where you can afford this risk.

Don't really count on any free B2X

If you're really not sure, buy bits and pieces every couple days or so, but the fact remains that no one can know what will happen to bitcoin around the fork. It could easily rise to $12,000 as it could drop to $3,000. WHO KNOWS!

Sounds like i need to wait for the fork in 2020. Thanks OP!
