So if she signs it she gets a bitcoin back, right?
I'm saying that many people would just sign it anyways not caring about Bob.

Every bit helps! :D
Some devices suffer from a lack of boot entropy, for example.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:04:01
Any chance I can hook this up to my computer to just generate useful entropy bits? :)
I like having more entropy sources.

Aren't their fees % based anyways?

The price has to go up by about 2% now, just as it did before. You're getting no worse of a deal. Sure, you can't buy 10k USD of coins instant buy anymore .. but you couldn't do that when bitcoin was cheaper anyways. If you really need to buy/sell that level of coin in less than 3 days or whatever, you should probably not be doing it on Coinbase anyways - there are much better exchanges for day trading.
Going up $17 now isn't a big deal. When bitcoin was $20, going up $17 would have been huge news.

After the transaction, presumably Bob will be willing to sign that the transaction was successful.
At this point, Alice has the option to sign and transmit the transaction, which would result in her getting her "escrow" bitcoin back. That is essentially a "Get one bitcoin back" button. Your system basically requires that she punishes Bob by not clicking it.
I know very well how multisig works.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:25:11
Not everyone, no.
But it's easier to just post somewhere public "Bob is a scammer" and take your money back. I probably would. This is why reputation systems are valuable.

A great solution is to have merchants accept a sidechain.
The sidechain can have very quick confirmations.

Please don't.
This guy's a fool for suggesting that.
If you lose your phone, you should consider the 2FA secret (aka the QR code) compromised. Whomever gave you it should have a way to request a *new* code or have some other backup system.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:27:06
Never tried this before, but I got this given to me recently:
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:40:35
I'd appreciate options to remove your 'backup code' permanently, and to not have you supply any passphrase.
I shouldn't have to trust you.
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:39:17
If Bob is a scammer, he is out one btc and Alice is out two?
So this system relies on Alice not pushing the "receive one bitcoin back" button in order to punish Bob?
I'm not sure if everyone would do that.

I'm hoping that's just a mistake. Obviously selling lower would result in it losing money.
It just means that the bot profits more and that some other investor (who was selling) gets less.
Basically, the bot is profiting in the area between the 'buy' and 'sell' price of BTC - and thereby moving these prices closer together.
You can liken this supposed bot (I see no evidence it's not a good number of them) to High Frequency Trading firms on the real market - and it seems that [they don't hurt the market, and may help it ](
Basically, this bot is providing liquidity - people can more easily buy/sell bitcoin at the market price, which is a  
good thing!
(To be fair, I probably don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't claim to be an expert.)

Really, this thread is just an exercise in people who have no idea what they're talking about (markets / exchanges) and self-reinforcing groupthink.

I've had luck with bitcoin-otc. It takes some effort to build trust, but then the rates are good.
@_date: 2011-09-23 15:36:42
sure :) just let me know what you're interested in.

Paypal is a question of trust - you can easily reverse the transation later, or even have paypal do it automatically once in a long while (bitcoin is against their terms of service).
I've used a lot of paypal, but it's all about finding people who trust you, which is tough on the internet.

Wouldn't the same arguments apply to most market participants who are in it for a profit, if just on a different time scale? A guy who buys BTC low, waits a year, then sells higher would accomplish the same thing.
Basically, your argument comes down to 'anyone who profits off of bitcoin hurts the others' - which is, inevitably, true.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:53:00
There's a calculation done that sorts transactions. If you're moving a lot of bitcoin that haven't been moved much, for example, it will go through quickly for free. If you're making a bunch of transactions or really small outputs, then it'll sloooow down.

Be careful with this suggestion.
The moves the 'trusted' party from you to whomever fills in the private key.
If you don't explicitly say this on the card, it can make you look bad - someone could receive a 'bit-card' from someone else, and later try to use it and discover that it's been emptied. They would blame bit-card, not whomever purchased it originally.

Hit refresh, new rule:
* On every transaction there is a 24.9% chance Charles Ponzi will eat your bitcoins.

Hrm. Bitcoins and Thermite.
Yup, I'm probably on a list too now.
