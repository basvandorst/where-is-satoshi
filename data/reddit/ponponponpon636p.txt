@_date: 2018-01-09 07:04:33
The developers are here to develop. You're trying to tell me all of the developers are far to busy fighting forks? How the fuck do they do that in the first place? If someone wants to fork they fork. Are you saying twitter posts and other social media posts is fighting a fork?  A terrible excuse for why it's not implanted. No one should bitch about business not supporting segwit when bitcoins developers haven't fully implanted it into their wallet.
Are you referring to the old Segwit2x fork as a threat? The one with 90%+ consensus? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:49:10


This is FUD. Please go in depth explaining how bitcoin cash is in violation 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:11:25


That will save you $0, how the fuck would that help sending $100 from one address to a segwit address


Seriously do some reading before spewing stuff like that
Even with 100% segwit adoption we would have high transaction fees and slow transaction times. Even with segwit wallets transaction fees are too high. Want to buy a coffee? Pay $10+ in segwit fees. Wtf would any company bother implanting this shit software.

@_date: 2018-01-08 22:48:00
Blocksizes increases are a short term/long term fix. Bitcoin can easily scale past 2 mb while second layer solutions are worked on. Even the lightning network developers said bitcoin would need 100mb+ blocks with the lightning network for world wide adoption. If we remain with 1mb blocks + lightning network bitcoin will still be unusable. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:34:20
lose 40$ sending to segwit wallet then another 20$ transferring from segwit to segwit. Excellent idea
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:41:43


Miners can sell or convert their btc. Which a lot do already.
There are numerous coins miners can mine with the same mining equipment as they would use for bitcoin. They can switch to bitcoin cash for example.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:57:00
Bitcoin cash doesn't need a second layer solution to function normally. Even if it had double the amount of transactions as bitcoin currently does it would still work cheaply and quickly. The developers have said  they are open to implanting the lightning network once it's developed and working.

LMFAO, not a single source mentions anything relevant to what we are arguing. Nice try pulling some bullshit sources thinking I won't check them.
I want the exact citation in which core developers claim the fork was called of due to full node users (their votes don't count in the first place). Provide the citation as well for the statistics of nodes by economic activity that supported/didn't support segwit 2x.
You won't find and sources for this because you're lying out of your ass. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:31:41
As I said not fully implanted. That's a terrible reason to give for why it's not implanted. So you're telling me the developers of bitcoin are busy picking petty fights rather then working on improving the current crippled bitcoin?

hmmm, bitcoin core wallet doesn't even have segwit fully implanted yet. Blocksize is holding back bitcoin not a company failing to implant segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:16:38
A node that's not mining doesn't do shit for bitcoin decentralization. 2mb blocks even 8mb blocks have no effect on centralization. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:55:37
except bitcoin cash will implant lightning network as well and it will operate better due to the larger blocks 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:40:08
That's like sticking to floppy disks when everyone has cds. 8mb blocks won't effect people from running nodes if they choose to do so. If someone sends one transactions on the current chain they can save those $40 and buy a 1tb hardrive which would last a couple years on the 8mb network. 
No one wants segwit as the market has shown. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:14:42
None mining Nodes have no impact over the network. They can verify the chain that's it. Miners being centralized can harm the network. A blocksize increase won't lead to miner centralization. If bitcoin upgrades to 8mb blocks a user could afford to upgrade their node storage capacity simply from the savings they would receive from the low fees on the 8mb blockchain (one transaction fee would pay for a couple years)
Current bitcoin fees (blocksize) are leading to centralization. high fees incentivizes economic centralization. If average users can't afford to use the main chain they will be pushed to centralized solutions such as the lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:05:06
I just explained to you why people aren't using segwit. 


Users are forced to pay them to use their bitcoins. Your logic is idiotic. They have no other choice, do you think a single user is happy with the current fees? 
Lets say I have $100. Are you recommending I send those $100 to a segwit address? I would lose $40 and be left with $60. Then accumulate $10-$30 in segwit fees transferring it to another segwit wallet? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:49:35
Raise it to 8mb then
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:44:40
The vast majority of people don't run their own node. The ability to run your own node ≠ decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:05:58
in it's current state bitcoin is digital trash. Digital trash for nutritional trash is a good trade. Sadly I can't even do that because I would pay 30$ in transaction fees

The LN will take care of fees on the second layer. The main chain is still open to spam attacks as you would call them. I call them everyday users trying to use bitcoin. The main chain will get overloaded even with the lightning network if adoption continues. As the lightning developers said bitcoin will need bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:39:34
The reason bitcoin cash exists was to leave a version of bitcoin untainted from segwit and blockstream. The community wants bigger blocks that's why there was such large consensus for 2mb. However that doesn't profit core (blockstream) so they stopped the upgrade.
If bitcoin hardforks to 2mb blocks the 1mb chain wouldn't survive. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:32:39
All my points are common knowledge. I didn't pull out any absurd statistics that need citation. The current fees/transaction times are enough evidence that a hardfork is required.
Your problem is you can't make a single argument against bigger blocks 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:03:35

wut, the network security has nothing to do with people cashing out their bitcoin. It's simply miners switching to mine another coin 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:52:31
Because bitcoin cash currently works. Fees under a penny and almost instant transaction times. These retards either sold of their bitcoin cash during the fork or only recently invested and are scared to lose their investment.

as you would say provide citation. I want the exact citation in which core developers claim the fork was called of due to full node users (their votes don't count in the first place). Provide the citation as well for the statistics of nodes by economic activity that supported/didn't support segwit 2x
What's your argument against bigger blocks if storage isn't an issue 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:48:40
They are paid by blockstream and other companies. The ones complaining are people posting about companies not supporting segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:43:55
If we had 8 mb blocks users would be able to afford the storage by simply not transacting one transaction a year on this clogged network. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:34:16
bitcoin needs main chain scaling as well as second layer solutions. A second layer solution will ease the pressure from the main chain temporarily. With increased adoption it will operate worse then it currently is even with the lightning network because nothing has been done to upgrade the main chain.

@_date: 2018-01-09 21:26:51
If all my points are incorrect it should be easy for you to bring up a citation for why I'm incorrect.
Here are some citations to start you off:
4tb hardrive $100 will hold years of 8mb block transactions
todays fee average roughly $30
Only mining nodes matter:
Non-mining nodes do not have any control over anything. They have no vote
Satoshi said: ‘Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes (miners). At first, most users would run network nodes (miners), but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.’

@_date: 2018-01-08 05:52:43
The chart you provided show there has been no increase in adoption. You could even say segwit use has declined.....................


Retarded logic. Most business/users don't support segwit. Why waist 40$ in fees to transfer to a segwit wallet for negligible fee savings. People aren't using segwit because it solves nothing. You seriously think people are happy with 40$ fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:13:57
LOL the lightning network won't fix shit if bitcoin remains at 1mb blocks. Great user case for bitcoin, "Just hodl it"
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:55:06
Segwit is not needed for the lightning network it can also be implanted into bitcoin cash if needed. 


However, without segwit or another malleability fix, LN channels have to deal with situations where transactions get mutated ("malleated"), which makes them get stuck at various steps. Preventing them from getting stuck permanently requires either introducing trust (which we don't want to do) or setting some annoying timeouts that limit the efficiency of channels.
LN can also take advantage of many of segwits other benefits such as:
Bitcoin cash wasn't created to solely rely on larger blocks for scaling. They were always open to second layer solutions. For bitcoin to flourish it needs blocksize increases and second layer solutions. 1mb Bitcoin with lots of second layer solutions will not work, the first layer will still be clogged. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:21:40


wut, the only reason bitcoin has value right now is because of speculation. It's needs an actual user case to maintain value 
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:08:27
that's why we need a blocksize increase 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:53:36
it doesn't make sense to an average user. Blockstream (private company that controls core) is purposely keeping bitcoin clogged to force people to use their second layer solutions.

Still paying $40+ in fees. You will save a tiny bit of money using that feature and that's if you need to send bitconi somewhere else as well. 


On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:
Even with 100% adoption it would reduce fees/transaction times by 50%. The market has spoken it doesn't want segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:52:38
lol a couple customers that frequent r/bitcoin leave coinbase that's no big deal for them. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:00:12
They would need to spam it the same amount as today. The lightning network has no effect on spam prevention of the main chain. We need main chain scaling.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:15:21
the problem is bitcoin not a company that's apparently clogging the entire network. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:09:02
You're poorly informed on the subject. Most big blockers believe in main chain scaling and second layer solutions. The lightning network will operate much better with bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:44:15
I provided citation for my arguments. You counter argued I asked for citations you can't provide any. 
Do you seriously want me to provide sources for why more transaction would fit in 2 mb block over a 1mb block? 
Arguing with you is like arguing with a potato. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:51:07


problem with bitcoin not the company 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:42:02


And the market has spoken that 40$ fees are ok apparently. So check and mate.
There was 90%+ support for 2mb blocks. This doesn't suit blockstreams (core) agenda for profiting off bitcoin so they got the fork shutdown. Businesses are dropping bitcoin left and right yet there's people like you saying the markets is ok with 40$ fees. I have switched to using bitcoin cash to pay under 1 cent fees for payments I need to make.
There's no logical counter argument for a block increase to 8mb. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:27:03

@_date: 2018-01-09 00:10:47
No point in users running their own nodes when the majority can't afford to use it. Users could afford to run 8mb blockchain the first year by simply saving $40 from the fee they would have had to pay on the 1mb blockchain. 
8 mb blocks will keep fees and transaction times low while second layer solutions are worked on
None mining node don't help with decentralization. So you're bandwidth argument isn't even valid to begin with.
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:09:26
bitcoin cash would operate the same whether it be 38,000 transaction or 400,000
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:29:33


bitcoin is more centralized right now then bitcoin cash. With the lightning network it will be even more centralized then ever before. 


Are you trying to argue Coinbase created the market for bitcoin cash? 


wut? what does this have to do with bitcoin cash in being in violation? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:56:49
Your poor knowledge regarding bitcoin doesn't make my sentences wrong. Try arguing my points.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:52:11
So you ignore all my citations...
Segwit2x had over 90% support. 
Blockstream came up with a backdoor deal with miners to call it off last minute. The only people benefiting from the blocks being small is blockstream. How does an average user benefit from 1 mb blocks over 2 mb? There are only disadvantages. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:07:41
This argument is about miners switching. If miners start supporting bitcoin cash, bitcoin will have no advantage. 
btw: bitcoin cash currently works, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin cash is open to second layer solution. Big blocks with lightning network will work. Small blocks and lightning network won't.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:29:36
LOL, these are the only type of responses I get to my comments. Explain how the current bitcoin is better then bitcoin cash...

Yes miners control consensus. The miners are the ones that decided to stop signalling the hash power not the developers. The developers coming to agreement with miners means nothing when it comes to consensus. All it means is the miners decided they don't want a fork anymore .

@_date: 2017-11-13 04:04:40
classic blockstream shill, trying to put words into my mouth. 
If we are looking at exactly why the fork got stopped: Miners decided to stop signalling. The hash power got lowered below activation threshold. When we hit block 494784 it will not activate due to miners not giving consensus to this fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:24:45

You're arguing nodes provide consensus when they have no voting power. Without miner support a fork would never happen.

You copy and pasted a massive wall in text and no where does it show that nodes provide consensus. 
Yes they are used to validate transaction. Who decides which fork is pushed forward? The miners not nodes, a node can choose to stop accepting the fork but that does not effect the miner consensus. None miner nodes can not vote or fork bitcoin

please provide an argument in that statement you made then


segwit has not fixed the backlog or high fee problem


You lost. Fuck off with your fork if that is important to you. Leave. Go. Sell. Goodbye.
You do understand nodes don't count in voting consensus? How does a blocksize increase not work? 
Statements by Nakamoto in the summer of 2010 indicate he believed Bitcoin could scale to block sizes far larger than 1 megabyte. For example, on 5 August 2010, he wrote that "[W]hatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial"
Are you even capable of making an argument?

Lmfao at the bias in this article
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:06:24
You were arguing with me this whole time over none minding nodes providing consensus
because of 6 developers reverting it by coming to an agreement with some mining pools. I'm going to ask you again, do you think some magical none mining nodes sprung up and halted the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:49:52
Why would it have value if it's unusable? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:50:40
I was being sarcastic you didn't even make an argument.. Unless you call this an argument "Prove it. Sell. Leave. Go." From speaking to you I wouldn't be supersized if you do
How has segwit been working out? It's made 0 difference on the backlog. "Schnorr, MAST, Lightning, Sidechains" The same way blockstream promised these years a go and they never came? Also it's blockstreams way of centralizing so people pay them a fee to use their services instead of the miners.
What's wrong with blocksize increase that is actually proven and works? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:44:59
Am i writing articles and posting them on blogs and claiming I'm unbiased? Bitcoin currently has the slowest/highest transaction fees out of any popular crypto currency so I wouldn't call that bias.

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:25:08
LOL, 2x was not rejected, all it did was prove how a centralized organization (blockstream) controls bitcoin. Bitcoin cash won't overtake in a single day. Wait a couple months and you will see.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:25:19
Nice, lets pull out some statistics out of your ass. Where did you get 90%?
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:00:36
The longer it takes for bitcoin to transition to faster/cheaper transaction the more likely it will become an alt itself 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:18:32
You're trying to change the subject from your original argument that none mining nodes are capable of consensus. 
Are you saying none mining nodes can initiate a fork?  
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:52:13
Let me dumb it down for you:
Can none mining nodes signal something and cause a fork? No
Can mining nodes signal something and cause a fork? Yes
Nodes can reject a fork but they can do nothing to stop it.
2x didn't activate because bitcoin is controlled by a central entity called blockstream and their developers stopped the fork. Some magic none mining nodes didn't stop the fork lmfao

Good luck getting bitcoin in everyones pocket with its current fees and transaction times 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:44:33
You're proving over and over that you don't understand how bitcoin works. The mining % needs to last until the set activation block (date) to activate which is block 494784. How do you think the fork stopped? I'm genuinely curious what's going on inside your head. The magic none mining nodes sprinkled some fairy dust and stopped the miners %?

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:56:42


Congratulations, you did not touch base on consensus in what you wrote. The node only has the ability to reject transactions after a fork took place. One can simply launch their own node or use someone else's to validate their transactions. Anyone can easily launch 1000s of nodes to fake support, however that support does not matter when it comes down whether the coin will fork or not. Satoshi said he did so voting can't be spoofed with numerous fake nodes signalling support.
let me tell you this again. NODES DO NOT OFFER ANY VOTING POWER. ONLY HASH POWER MATTERS
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:26:06
Have you tried using bitcoins for everyday transactions? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:41:49
Bitcoin worked flawlessly until they decided to stop upgrading the block size and implant segwit. Now it's barely usable

That's not what he went to prison for... Nice try

Didn't pay $100 to send $1 of bitcoin. It's your fault for being cheap... LOL 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:46:08
If you haven't noticed bitcoin is barely operating right now, it's very slow and expensive to use. Segwit2x will help fix that, the majority of users want a faster and cheaper network. 
Nodes are a terrible indicator of support. Anyone can easily set up 100s of them. You are basing user support purely off of this subreddit. The majority of exchanges and apps either support segwit 2 or the coin that will have the majority hashrate after the split. 
I love the blockstream crowd. Inventing new ways to show fake support for their coin when it all boils down to hashrate.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:09:37
you didn't provide an eta
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:36:40
Holy fuck, 
Look at the chart I sent you. Miners were signalling for s2x at around 90% consensus. The 6 developers came to an agreement with the mining pools. The MINING pools stopped signalling for s2x. The consensus dropped bellow the % needed for activation at the set activation date. 
Do you understand now?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:13:31
Miners control consensus. Only miners can cause a fork.   
Your argument was nodes control consensus which is WRONG. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:55:59

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:40:10
Holy fuck are you retarded? Seriously I feel like I'm trying to explain something to a rock. 


the fork didn't happen because the miner consensus is now 40.97% if consensus remained at 90% for when s2x was going to activate it would have
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:31:34
By the time bitcoin scales to that size storage will be much cheaper. The alternative is to pay fee's to blockstream and use their private chains.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:22:51
you're describing r/bitcoin right now. Ever wondered why r/bitcoin moderation logs are private but r/btc is public? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:07:01


Bitcoin is supposed to offer this, it's supposed to be cheaper to transact then fiat. If there was a block size upgrade it would be cheaper to transact then fiat once again. You're extremely naive to think bitcoin will be around if it keeps operating at this capacity. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:59:29
you don't pay fees to nodes. How could you compare banks to using someones node to validate a transaction? Since the start of bitcoin most people used a light client and didn't use their own node to validate their transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:36:11
you should be worried about bitcoin if your concern is corporate takeover (blockstream)

litecoin is the definition of a shit alt coin 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:26:10


They came to an agreement with mining pools to stop signalling for s2x. That's why it didn't activate. BECAUSE OF MINERS. Had they not come to an agreement with the miners s2x would have activated 
now stop changing the subject. 
Are you saying none mining nodes can initiate a fork? Are you saying none mining nodes prevented the fork?

Since price of bitcoin went up we should pay higher fees because we won't increase the blocksize. Solid logic...

Forking is normal and healthy for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:32:19
They had the hash and then they stopped signalling it. Had the hash power kept signalling for the activation it would have activated at the date it was supposed to.
As you can see here:

How the fuck do you think the fork got stopped? Where did the hash power disappear to? the developers leached it off with their none mining nodes? lmfao

Excellent indicator lmfao. You can say the same for the other 800 currencies being traded on exchanges at one point in time. Some went up 1000%. Price increase and quality of coin has no correlation in the current bubble.

Only miner nodes count for a vote when it comes to a chain split. Let me ask wtf your node counts for? Your node can signal whatever it wants and the network will not care. Anyone can setup lots of nodes for cheap to make an illusion of having lots of people on their side. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:42:06

I'm repeating over and over that miners vote with their hash power. There's no other way to vote.
Do you even know what the NYA stands for? NYA was an agreement signed by many different companies not just miners. The original agreement was:
Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
Now blockstream is trying to block the second part of the agreement.
The group of signed companies represents a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem. As of May 25, this group represents:
    58 companies located in 22 countries
    83.28% of hashing power
    5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume
    20.5 million bitcoin wallets
