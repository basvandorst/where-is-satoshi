Bitcoin price is in stasis right now hovering around 8-10k price. There is major geopolitical turmoil coming on the horizon in 2020 with US elections &amp; Brexit shakeout. This coupled with the Halving in May &amp; probable major global financial recession = bull market incoming

Looking at the data over previous years there is a proven correlation between lower Bitcoin price with higher seasonal consumer spending. For the past few years Bitcoin price has always fallen during Nov/Dec - It’s an interesting trend for accumulation tactics to know that the holidays is discount time for stacking before incoming bull run

2017 is no different - it was just delayed because of the hype of the bubble at that time. If you look back at the data- the 2017 peak hit $19,796 on Dec 17. By Dec 22 it had crashed back down to 11k and then continued to tumble through the New Year as consumers paid holiday bills etc

Here's my 2 bits.. It really depends on how bad the financial recession/collapse will be. My long term view of Bitcoin is that it is a finite commodity and therefore over the long term absolutely will keep rising in value as more people see it as such. The question will be how quickly will the price rise? Let's say for example there's a bigger global recession than 2008. For example if there's a perfect storm of financial banking instability combined with political/geopolitical turmoil then Bitcoin could skyrocket in the space of a few weeks. Imagine Deutsche Bank going bust, The NYSE and the London FTSE take a big dump in value at the same time in 2020. This could dovetail with Brexit and Hong Kong in political turmoil at the same time. In this very possible scenario people could get very nervous and start making a bankrun on their savings. We all know the banks don't have it so ATMs will dry up and banks will close up shop. Cue hyperinflation...

Bitcoin was created as a result of the economic crisis/recession in 2008. When the next major economic crisis hits- Bitcoin’s value will skyrocket.

I kind of understand what OP means about the first two relating to US government, wealth inequality &amp; the role of federal reserve bank.. but what specifically is meant by emotional surplus? How does it relate to Bitcoin?

Fascinating article. Even more interesting because of the man writing it. Ross Ulbricht is like Han Solo of the internet.
So if I understand this article correctly, Elliot Wave theory analyzes and predicts patterns in the price fluctuations of Bitcoin based on the same ratios found in fractal geometry?  If that's correct - why would fractal geometry patterns be unique to Bitcoin and not other financial markets?

This is one of the major reasons the price is dropping. Happens every year (yes even in 2017 at the ATH) the dip in price correlates with higher consumer spending during the holidays.

An interesting thing to consider is that since the early 1970s the value of the US dollar is tied to the value and usage of oil/petroleum. In this perspective the major fiat currency that upholds the global energy economy is the US dollar so it’s intrinsically linked to the source/cause of climate change. When climate disasters begin dictating global economic value (and they already are) the US dollar’s value will decrease exponentially. However another thing to consider is that Bitcoin’s value is also linked to the energy market because mining Bitcoins takes a great amount of computing/electrical resources. So the question is how does Bitcoin bridge this gap as a solution to fiat currency while being so reliant on energy?
