You’re right.  What he is referring to is actually Cole’s Law.

Been awake on GDAX for 20 of the past 24 hours.
Price has sat at every 500 and 1k marker for about 20 minutes until it breaks through the wall.
If you watch the depth chart, most of the asks and bids sit on either side of these markers, off set by about $250-500.  When it breaks through a $1k marker, the asks raise dramatically which forces it back down until it pushes through again.  
Just hang on and watch for big volume asks before buying.  You don’t want to buy too high.

What is happening to this thread?  Why are so many pro alt-coin comments and posts getting upvotes?
If I wanted to read shills jerk off the viability of Litecoin I’d go to that playground-built-on-a-toxic-waste-dump of a sub that is r/litecoin
I can’t help but feel like all these comments are engineered to destabilize confidence in the Crypto Standard that BTC is.

Does she come with the hodl?

$11.8k.  Woke up and slammed the buy button. 
Why didn’t anyone wake me up?

Debt... like my mortgage?  I shouldn’t trade in currencies or invest in stocks if I have a credit card debt or a car payment?
I sincerely have no idea why you’re implying that only those with no debt should buy?
Am I just misunderstanding your word choice?

get this alt shit out of here.

I currently use Yen at my local Spanish Bodega.  It is really easy to use a currency different than USD in America.

Exactly.  Just work your limit sells right.
