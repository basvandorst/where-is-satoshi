That wasn't the movement...that was just the founder, Peter Joseph in the first Zeitgeist movie. But he has distanced himself from his personal interpretation of 9/11 in interviews, basically saying it's not an interpretation connected in any way to the movement, which formed after the third movie.
Basically, he said you can take it or leave it and it doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of the movement.

Thanks for replying. 
I already did all that exactly as you advise last night. But my balance didn't appear. The wallet reads: 0 mBTC.

Multibit replied and said to download Electrum and test my 12 word seed. I select "I already have a seed" when setting up a new electrum wallet and am then asked to enter the 12 words. I enter the 12 words (I know they are right) but I can't click the "next" button. It stays greyed out. 
Oddly, Multibit didn't immediately suggest that I choose repair the wallet. They wanted me to delete it completely after confirming my 12 words worked and then redownload it.
I'm waiting on their reply on how to move forward.

Update: I was able to restore my wallet and its transactions on my tablet using my key words and Breadwallet.
At this point, if I want to restore my wallet on a different computer than the original one, once it's on a different computer can I delete all the wallet files on the first (original) computer without worry?
Thanks for any advice. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:29:07
Thanks for the info and help.
Not looking to save any notes or labels...the coin was the important part.

Well, I tried to use my wallet words in Electrum to see if I could restore my transactions there but it's reading zero balance. But I know these are the right words.
However, I was able to retrieve the deleted Multibit files I deleted a few days ago with a data recovery application. 
I can see the files in the program panel now but I haven't yet restored the files. I'm waiting on a reply from Multibit on how to proceed.
The good thing is the files are dated so I know which files are the ones deleted from a few days ago.
Will keep the thread posted.

Thanks...I have to admit I've always been terrible at even understanding backing up stuff...lol. Again, I do have my wallet words so....I should be okay eventually.
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:28:06
Thanks...I got past that step by going through the options as you said. It seems to have created the wallet but it says my balance is 0 mBTC.
Are I not supposed to see the transactions attached to that 12 word seed?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:41:23
By "backups" do you mean wallets on multiple devices of the same Bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:33:03
Thanks...contacted Multibit...they wanted to know exactly what files I deleted...of course, I have no idea of the exact files...still waiting on a reply..
In the meantime, I downloaded a data recovery application that might recover the files since I only deleted them a few days ago and nothing since then.
Will keep you posted on how things go....might try your idea...
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:00:49
That's actually me. How did you know?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:59:52
Edit: oh. It's sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:51:01
You know it's bs when they provide an exact figure like that.
They don't know anything.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:34:58
Ok...i understand now....but what about paying taxes on all those micro transactions? Aren't those considered earnings since you're doing something for the bitcoin? If yes, how complicated does that get to report?
@_date: 2019-09-07 11:48:56
Type in "bitcoin faucets" into a search engine.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:30:39
Wait, you're selling a system you've only used less than 48 hours?
Edit: okay...sorry.. i see.. youre not selling it.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:25:59
How many bitcoins has this system generated for you and how many hours did you put in to reach it? 
I'm pretty sure the payout of those free fountains is an extremely low percentage of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:00:36
Alright...alright..you got me...it's me.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:39:57
Thank you, Bot. That is very helpful.
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:24:22
The inventor of Bitcoin lost their keys on purpose? Why would they do that?
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:53:46
Did you try restoring your Bitcoin to another wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:41:53
Remember, you're not dealing anything seen before.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:49:59
What kind of kooky planet is this? 
@_date: 2017-05-02 10:51:13
Bitcoin is turning Japanese, I think it's turning Japanese, I really think so, think so, think so...
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:05:46
Don't feel bad. When Andreas Antonopoulos first stumbled across Bitcoin, he dismissed it as "nerd money"...or essentially "nerds playing with fantasy money."
I love that story because so did I. Nerds. What a bunch of maroons. :-)

What if Bitcoin started its own Tv channel and transactions could be conducted over the Tv using the QR and scanning, as well?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:39:38
Thanks. Is there documentation or a video showing Electrum working with Trezor?
I'm sure it does but I'd like to read or see it in action and have yet to find anything online.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:08:52
if true, that's a relief. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:33:40
Ah, wonderful ! At last a clear path I can follow! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:25:50
It's a cryptocurrency in its infancy with a lot of advantages to it over fiat. Where else is it going to go but up?
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:08:03
E-blocks?:

And you want his rig smashed? Done.

There's nothing wrong with your brain. Many people do not understand the scaling debate. 
Someone should be along soon and post something more relevant to your immediate problem.

So I don't need a software wallet? I just tried to download both MultiBit HD and Electrum on my 32 Bit Linux Mint 18.1 laptop and both failed!
What I'm trying to do is get a small amount of bitcoin off my tablet (breadwallet) onto a computer and protected with a hardware wallet. 
I want to make sure the hardware and software I chose both work with my computer before I buy the hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:31:52
Ok, I'll give it a shot...Thanks!
