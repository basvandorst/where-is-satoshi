Does keepkey make trezors? 
Edit. Nvm
Just bought a ledger. Just came in the mail today. But this is what I've been looking for! Hell yeah!
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:42:34
You come in this sub and act like your better than everyone for making a little bit more money than all of us. Your so sick bro. Your bitcoin Jesus all hail you man, your the shit 
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:55:54
They sold them toxic loans they knew the people couldn't afford and then leveraged against them to make billions. LOL
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:49:23
Yeah it's bad for exchanges, good for users 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:07:25
Is electrum an app or is it on computer?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:52:34
Just let them go man. More time for us to buy up more for the moon mission! 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:12:00
Mining isn't profitable? Wtf are you talking about? You can make 8k in one yr with one antminer l3+
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:57:37
It comes from the FED. You know, the federal bank, (that's really private) but that's for another day
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:48:44
If you don't have enough money to buy on the dips holding is the best strategy. It's not childish lol
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:54:56
The us in 2008-2009?? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:36:06
I'm relatively new to bitcoin myself but from the research I've done I see nothing wrong with the features of LN. I don't get all the doomsday-ers saying it will kill bitcoin. It's going to make it better if anything. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:54:49
From my understanding Litecoin already uses it 
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:37:30
Me too! 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:43:37
Andreas Antonopoulos says it changes everything (in a good way) and I'm inclined to believe him based on the tech behind it. Idk if it's the Satoshi purists vs practical people now or what. Its just that's what it seems to be. BTC is going to have changes. What satoshi made wasn't perfect, and will need tweaks overtime. I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:34:02
So you would gain like 200 bucks? Sick gains bro
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:38:54
So triggered bro. I own more than .5 bitcoin too so fuck off 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:55:22
I looked on the Apple App Store and couldn't find it. But I think I might just use ledger. Do you know if you can buy off their app like an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:02:17
I'm in it for the long haul old man. I got time on my side. Gonna ride this shit to the mooonnnn!! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:12:46
What pisses me off about Coinbase is the "weekly banking limit" I'm not a child let me buy more bitcoin damnit 
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:09:45
Oh shit my bad. I read that all wrong. Sorry still hungover from the fight lol. Right. I get it now 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:59:05
I will keep holding and I'll keep making money. Just like you. Your not special or cool bc you buy and sell in the dips. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:12:18
When are we gonna say it’s ok to invest in bitcoin and it’s not “crazy” to invest the majority of your savings in it? The stock market could crash at any moment and that’s what people always say about bitcoin. I️ don’t get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:19:14
I️ think I’ll be good man. But hey Idk. That’s kinda what life is about. Not knowing the future. I️ believe in the technology long term so I’m good no matter what. Idk why your on this sub if all your gonna do is talk shit about it
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:58:49
I️ had 16k in stocks that made me 2 grand in 2 months. I️ took it all out and put it in bitcoin and made 14k in 2 months. I’d say I’m doing pretty good. ����
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:17:56
I thought I was safe here in the bitcoin sub. Guess not. Take my upvote damnit. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:29:55
When you can get way bigger gains than yrs in the stock market, people tend to flip out. It’s only natural. I’m not going nuts over here and mortgaging my house to buy more 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:51:32
The core team doesn’t want to change bitcoins block size. They are equivalent to bitcoin purists or extremists. A small block size increase is good for bitcoin and yes miners.  But it will make transactions faster which is a big problem 
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:00:29
Usually when you say my comment is wrong you give evidence to support your claim that my claim is false. Do you not know how this works? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:41:55
Segwit2x is both of those things. I’m saying if they follow through with the plan of segwit2x it will benefit everyone too. I know it’s not theoretical. Idk what you’re talking about 
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:05:10
I figured it was majority miners who didn't like it
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:00:42
Ah ok ����
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:24:27
The reason socialism keeps failing is bc they turn into dictatorships or oligarchies. Socialism is a good form of governance when done right 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:26:38
I don't get the hate for segwit. Everything I've seen it sounds like a no brainer and is very good for btc overall. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:52:15
It was always a two part thing. The segwit broke the block into two parts. The 2x is the part that makes the block bigger. Not till November will this happen.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:34:38
Did they not get together and decide changes for bitcoin that benefited bitcoin? People are acting like they got together to blow it up. They aren't, fucking relax
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:28:03
When did you buy? When did you sell? If you did
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:08:32
That’s why all these countries will try and make their own coin. But people will continue to use bitcoin bc it’s not under the control of any central government. They don’t get it. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:34:05
What are you basing that off of? It has wide spread support across the platform by developers and others. Which corporations are going to have exclusive rights to bitcoin? or take it over?
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:14:50
Go ahead and point them out then? What you waiting for? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:31:32
Aljazerra (or however you spell it) isn't too bad either. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:17:12
I fucking love Max Keiser. He's funny as shit and a realist 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:33:30
Look some shit up on it dude. It’s not even bad. No one has the authority/control over it. That’s the whole point. You can’t just leave it alone and say it’s perfect in every way. We can’t just go off of what people say online either. That’s not a good way to get the consensus of the majority of bitcoin owners. Someone has to tho otherwise it will get left behind by new technologies and other coins. Have some faith in the devs, do some research on it other than what people blurt out online that have no idea what they’re talking about. I swear this place is starting to sound like the bad part of the conspiracy subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:46:28
Searches are one thing. More people need to buy bitcoin. I'm trying to tell friends about it and then it goes down. 1500 dollars and they shit on it. Its hard to get them into it. People actually somehow believe Jamie Diamond. Then I remind them he's a banker and why would you believe anything he says and they laugh and don't say anything. They don't understand BTC. Like yeah don't believe the FUD. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:04:24
Seems like he's not apposed to Segwit2x. He discussed it and didn't bad mouth it. He wants to try to stay neutral and thats his way. Coming out in favor would have the mobs after him. A lot of people are spreading fear about something they know about, but don't understand.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:32:37
This is what i've been saying but have been downvoted for 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:28:50
Why do you say that? Why do people think segwit is a corporate take over if bitcoin. It splits the block into two diff blocks. One smaller block having all the info and another block attached with it. The smaller block will allow for faster confirmation times. I don’t get how that’s a corporate take over 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:49:49
RT is just as credible as any American outlet. More so in many cases 
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:37:04
He specifically mentions segwit2x. Which is the November split
Edit: watch from 3:20. He mentions the different scaling options. Segwit2x is mentioned right at about 4:00
Edit 2: he also said in three months. August, September,October, November. Three months segwit2x
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:35:54
Fuck yeah! Feels good to be apart of something this cool so early on. Made a good amount on bitcoin already and only been in on it for 2 months! 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:42:41
That’s exactly what I did. 
I used to have a bit of both then one day it all clicked and I saw how fucking awesome bitcoin was and said fuck stocks and went all in on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:32:25
Literally what I said. Capitalism blows too. We don’t have that in America like ppl say we do 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:38:30
Segwit split the block into two sections so transactions can be done faster. The bigger block sizes allows other things to be sent on top of the block. Like smart contracts. It’s a good thing 
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:25:23
Make sure you have them all your information. You may have to send a picture of your drivers license. Once you do that the limit goes up to 2,500 or 5,000 I can’t remember which 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:23:22
Yeah it’s a dope little thing to commemorate bitcoin and represent it. It’s a conversation piece too
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:04:20
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:17:39
Which corporations are getting control?
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:07:47
I too would say this. Now what’s stopping us from voting on this verifiable blockchain? True tamper proof elections is pretty big imo 
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:24:23
if everyone hated BCH and Roger Ver as much as they say they do BCH wouldn't even be relevant bc everyone would sell and the value would plummet. But no one is selling and hence giving it value 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:09:30
I bought one too. I keep it in the plastic sleeve tho. I love mine. Cool little paper weight to keep on your desk
