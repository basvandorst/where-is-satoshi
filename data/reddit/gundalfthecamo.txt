Isn't the usual bitcoin advocates narrative that Dollar crash is imminent?

Probably not more relevant, but I'd factor it in. 
That's part of the reason why most countries have separate penalties for murder and attempted murder.

You don't travel much, do you? 
I'm soon going to one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world: Bangkok. Soo .. I'll come with Euro cash money, and you'll arrive with Bitcoin. Let's see who's first completed the following touristy things to do:
* Transport to hotel (train, bus or taxi) paid for
* Checked in and paid at least one night of hotel
* Ordered, consumed and paid a gin tonic drink 
I bet my euros got your BTC beat ;)

I'll accept the challenge for any other country. Say, Philippines, which is supposed to be a poster child for BTC adoption. Just mentioned BKK because I'm going there for Christmas and new year ... for a thing 😉

Carrying water in a bucket is not similar to a currency. Buckets purpose is not to transfer value; it's purpose is to store and carry water. A leaking bucket is not a good bucket. Any bucket, however, will allow water to evaporate, or collect extra water if left in rain. 
What does this have to do with a currency? Is the evaporation inflation? It makes no sense, but more importantly it doesn't matter.
Analogies really don't proof a point to the extent people think they do.

There are people looking at r/bitcoin's worship of Ross Ulbricht who are thinking about exact fucking opposite question. 
Why does r/bitcoin worship him?
I understand bitcoin needs a hero and that he was responsible for pushing BTC price up, but god damn .. can't you find someone who does the same function without resorting to several serious crimes?
Having said that, the sentence was way too high. There's no point keeping a young man in jail for more than 10 years. He didn't actually manage to kill anyone. I'm European so these life sentences for drug crimes just strike me as wrong.

Completely free market would also allow selling below cost of production. 
Companies with big enough market share and accumulated capital can dump and starve their competition and then re-set prices from a monopoly-like position. 
In any case physical goods will never flow freely, except within a country or an entity like EU. Having ordered stuff from China, the customs duties and taxes are really killing it.

I fail to grasp the importance of this, even if it was true. 
How does this manifest negatively in real life? Are you unable to plan your fiscal future because of this? Plenty of people have no problem using fiat regardless of whether you said is true. 
I still know what my next haircut costs, I know how much I'm getting money, I know how much mortgage is left, I know my grocery bill (approximately).
After that you should answer how BTC or any other system would alleviate that. If anything, going 100% BTC would make financial planning *more* difficult.
And as you can see, non-fiat cryptocurrencies are not immune to the death you mentioned. Where's paycoin, dogecoin now? There's nothing unique about bitcoin in that regard, except wider public acceptance.

Fiat is bad store of value. But what gold bugs and crypto enthusiasts don't understand is that that isn't it's main objective.Purpose of money is to transfer value, not store it. Small inflation is good for this purpose. Value or wealth should be stored elsewhere. Like properties, gold or stocks.It doesn't really matter how much value pound has retained over centuries. What matters is ... can you use it to buy and sell everything you want? Answer is yes.

So would deflation. Exactly stable currency is not going to exist, due to variation in resource prices, which are affected by real world problems like supply.
But it's a very minor problem in a small inflation currency anyway. Financial planning can be performed very easily while taking into account 1% inflation.

I've been there, in Pattaya Beer Garden. There, and in the whole city, there's ahem, *a bit* of competition between bars.
Coming up with a new promotion is really difficult. So while I'm not into bitcoin at the moment, I can appreciate inventive promotion.
It's more than the price of a beer in Pattaya, even.

But since production of goods (and services for the most part) is owned by the state in communism, the monetary vehicle does not matter that much. 
It would be as useful from states perspective as USD in soviet russia: good for buying foreign stuff from other countries, but internally bad because of black markets.

'Free' (well singlepayer government) healthcare already exists, and has existed for decades. Just no in the US. 
Sweden, Norway, Finland, etc... have been doing quite well. 


Singlepayer system is much more suited for regular checkups than US system where uninsured people are more likely to forgo checkups in lieu of eventual emergency visit.

Ok, you never know on this subreddit how 'far' along people see Bitcoin going. You're right of course, about the decentralization thing. Or rather the main fault in the whole Euro is that countries have a common currency but no common political system.


We'll see if it's a catastrophic failure, a diminished Eurozone or if it continues as is for the next 20 years.

Greece is in trouble because they had no control over the monetary policy of the currency they were using. 
Bitcoin would not solve this problem, but make it worse, if somehow it was used as a national currency.

Yes, Ron Paul is probably right. *Eventually*. 
People should consider the past and also follow the money. Paul is a known goldbug and has made millions through his newsletter, affiliated with gold selling companies. They used his "collapse is imminent" to sell gold ... for fiat, naturally.
Just saying ... yes, he's right. But he's been saying this for decades. Imminence of dollars eventual diminish has nothing to do with the enthusiasm Ron Paul keeps talking about it.

This analogy is thrown around a lot. That doesn't make it true. 
Inventor of Segway said it would revolutionize moving about. Who's to say Bitcoin isn't more like Segway (a nice but niche product) instead of email? 
Anyway, remittances aren't going to be the killer app for Bitcoin, since currently they require exchange into local currency. That requires a third party. If like you say the country has problem with regular banks, there's no chance in hell of actually using bitcoin without changing to local currency.

Generally poor people do not run a surplus. Which means they don't have money to depreciate in value. 
Moldovan people are paid in lei, so bitcoin is not really going to help unless they have surplus income to invest.

It's impossible to say if Bitcoin will be like internet or Segway or the space shuttle.Internet is a great success, segway goes on as a niche product (but never became as popular as the inventor thought) and space shuttle was too expensive and complex to replace single use rockets in the long term.

Sounds like men you can trust, sure. 
The point of regulations is that you don't have to go by reputation or trust that much - a sort of weaker version of Bitcoin protocols 100% trustlessness. You can be pretty sure that if you work with a regulated exchange that it's not run as a pyramid as MtGox was.
In reality what happens is that exit scams are very common in unregulated Bitcoin economy, and the kind of alternative you're saying is a joke at this point. "Who would do that, it goes against their self interest".
 I have had my credit card copied a few times (traveling the world in wrong places, I suppose), and I didn't have to beg in internet messageboards to get my money back, or rely on trust. The heavily regulated bank had no choice but to pay up.
Why *wouldn't* that be a good alternative to the oh so common Bitcoin scams? Like iGot scam thread of today, the most common advice was to contact the authorities ... um .. ok. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:25:35

During inflation wages generally go up at the same rate. In superdeflation, wages denominated in BTC will similarly go down, or the business will go bankrupt.
You do realize that 4 x deflation means that there's 1/4th of money (BTC then) coming in any company? But you think they will keep paying the normal wages?

You'll feel right at home in r/Bitcoin.
However I'd recommend limiting your exposure to Bitcoin value. While Bitcoin does have it's uses (where credit cards or cash just wont work, like DNMs or ransomware), it's not going to replace other currencies. 
But you'll never get the people outside the echochamber to switch to BTC for daily activities. It's like trying to use obscure foreign currency. You'll need to exchange to local money both ways. 
It's not as quick as debit/credit cards, there's no consumer protection (that is not a feature for customers, only for merchants), there are too many security risks. 
Credit cards are instant and basically free for customers (not merchants, though), and include a high degree of insurance and consumer protection against fraud.

The limitation with gold would not have been the need to store or move it. All the gold is already stored, and it would not be moved very often - that is the point of gold backed money. Only the cash would move, while the gold would stay in the vaults. 
The real problem with gold backed currency is that it would limit economic growth to the rate at which gold can be extracted from the ground. That makes zero sense in the information age. Basically handicapping the whole american economy.

Let's go further back then. You said every single problem in the world is either directly or indirectly caused by fiat money. You changed the goalpost to 1500s. We can go as far as you like.
Roman empire had much higher inequality than we have (both wealth and inequality based on race and family). They had actual slaves. There was war and the world was a much more violent place.
All before fiat money. Because of this, fiat money is not the cause of all the problems. Complete adoption of bitcoin wouldn't make the problems go away either.  There will always be war for ideology and resources. There will always be inequality. Heck bitcoiners are quite eager to be the new 1%.

I didn't bother watching this, but I've seen Ron Paul vids before. He's been saying the same thing for a few decades now. 
Don't get me wrong, USD might collapse, but Ron Paul is not the one to predict it, since he's been wrong for decades now. 
He's also made millions with the gold business fearmongering ... and there you got to ask why anyone who truly believes USD is on it's last throes would accept the very same USD for gold?
