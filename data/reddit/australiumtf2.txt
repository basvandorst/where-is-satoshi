The website is obviously a Ponzi, there's no doubt. However, I am still going to invest in the website. 
Here's what I'm going to die and why:
I'm going to invest a decent amount of bitcoins into the company and I will wait around 85 days to get my return on investement. After that I will stop gathering profits and instead use the profits I gain daily to increase my hash rate. According to my calculations, the hashrate can be doubled every 60 days by using this method. When I feel like the ponzi is starting to collapse, I stop upgrading the hash rate and start collecting bitcoins again on my wallet.
The reason I'm going to do this is because the chance of the ponzi collapsing within the first 85 days is small considering the website is increasing in popularity and has been up for at leasy 17 months. After that, there is no more risk of losing money and instead you have a good shot at earning a shit ton of money daily after exponentially increasing your hash rate for a few months. 
Long story short, even though this website is obviously a Ponzi, we can still profit from the website owners and the new users by using some common sense. And I mean profit a lot, especially when the website doesn't collapse any time soon.
Example: Original investment of 10 bitcoins. 10 bitcoins returned after around 85 days. Now, exponentially increasing the hash rate for a few months (I suggest 4 months). Enjoy the large daily profit of ~0.07 BTC for as long as it lasts.
