is having 25 btc a good amount to hodl and use that as your retirement and 401k? i am living paycheck to paycheck. i been buying a little a week and accumulate this much for 3 years now. Am i safe in the future? or should i sell some and actually put money in 401k and stocks?

i have a oneplus 6t. there are no sd card expansion. so my backup keys and seed is in my phones. i sent in my phone to oneplus and they said they cant revive it. so what happen to the funds? is it locked in lighting or can any merchant just take it? i dont really care about the funds in there. im pretty sure im not the only one that lost their phone and keys in a lighting wallet.
