benefits. As explained in the companion piece to this article,
digital currencies do not currently pose a material risk to
monetary or financial stability in the United Kingdom, but it is
conceivable that potential risks could develop over time. The
distributed ledger is a genuine technological innovation which
demonstrates that digital records can be held securely without
any central authority.


pose a threat to financial stability, but further increases cannot
be ruled out and it is conceivable in time that there could be
an asset price crash among free-floating digital currencies that
had the potential to affect financial stability. Potential risks to
monetary stability would only be likely to emerge once digital
currencies had achieved substantial usage across the economy.
If a subset of people transacted exclusively in a digital
currency, then the Bank’s ability to influence demand for this
group may potentially be impaired. The incentives of existing
digital currency schemes pose considerable obstacles to their
widespread adoption, however. This is discussed in more
detail in the companion article.
Ultimately every transaction involving a financial asset must
be recorded and most of these records are digital. The
structure of the broader financial system is similar to
payments in that these records are held by centralised third
parties. The application of decentralised technology to this
platform of digital information could have far-reaching
implications, other industries whose products were digitised
have been reshaped by new technology. The impact of the
distributed ledger on the financial industry could be much
wider than payments.

*An observation for further adoption of Bitcoin.*
I have an IT background and usually the one to explain technologies to family, friends, or whoever. I wanted to share, in my opinion a better way, to explain crypto-currency to non-technical audiences. I noticed after talking to my cousins from the Netherlands that when I attempted to attach the word 'coin' to any description of Bitcoin or crypto-currency at large. That it was harder for them to imagine currency that they weren't holding.
I decided on sticking to the basics of what Bitcoin is, encrypted files on a decentralized network. Even the older inlaws understood better what I was trying portray or analogize after that. Ever since then I try to refrain from using the word 'coin' in the explanation of the files and network known as Bitcoin to new users. It goes over much better when I explain they are encrypted files, referred to as Bitcoins, or Bit-files when connecting the syntax to new users.
When you use the word 'coin' in explaining something the audience can't physically hold. There is a disconnect in language in accepting these encrypted files hold a value. People accept there are encrypted files that can hold value but I think it will take some time to associate an analog idea (currency) with digital technologies.
**TLDR** Try not to use the word 'coin' in the explanation for first time users.

Two opinions on furthering the adoption of Bitcoin.
People need three things to survive. Food, clothing, and shelter. There are so many companies accepting BTC for the first two categories. People are also starting to accept BTC for land, houses, and property in general. But a lot of us don't own land. We rent on it.
I think promoters should target apartment managers to start accepting BTC as payment. Help them setup with companies that auto-convert it to the countries money. Leaving them the free choice to do business with you and whether or not to keep BTC for themselves. This is one of the last hurdles in my opinion of Bitcoin adoption.
Second, in regards to Ben Lawsky and the NY regulations. While some might think this is an absurd opinion, I can't think up a better solution for governments and states attempting to influence or regulate Bitcoin and crypto-currency systems. At least what the general public can do about it.
Give them silence.
Read over the proposed regulations. If you have any understanding of Bitcoin. You *know* full well it can't be implemented. Its like the 18/19th century is asking the 21st century of mathematics to *slow* down and put on a leash. After reading it and looking over how Lawsky used knowledge-base of users to build a draft, it felt like something else. Like Mr. Lawsky is trying to build regulations that *could possibly* be implemented. Hence the reason why *comments from the public* have been pushed further out. *They* need to hear from more informed people on how to *hypothetically* write and regulate Bitcoin. Because they have no idea how to do it and they want **free** consulting on how to.
I haven't heard anyone from the Bitcoin developer group(s) give them such answers, neither should we.
I'm not saying you can't rage at such people. I'm just saying don't give them anything constructive to build on and use against **US ALL**.
**TLDR** 1 - Promote Bitcoin use for renting apartments. 2 - Give the regulators silence.

Bronze sculptures of goblins on motorbikes, R2D2 t-shirts, one sock, imaginary products from the world of Rick and Morty, a dog, the most majestic cat… EVER. This is what users of OpenBazaar, a peer-to-peer digital mall that’s just emerged after a lengthy gestation, will see as they peruse the various stores from the comfort of their desk.
Though it’s very early stages (OpenBazaar has only just opened a test service, with full launch expected later this month), the current app, running on Apple AAPL Mac in FORBES’ test drive, is a far cry from what some hyperbolic commentators were expecting. When OpenBazaar’s operators proposed the idea of a distributed marketplace where there was no central authority to hold to account, the currency was the untraceable (but actually very traceable) Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the rules almost non-existent, it led to assumptions OpenBazaar would house next -generation narcotics markets like Silk Road, illegal weapons stores and child abuse content dealers that police could never track. But right now, OpenBazaar is shaping up to be a slicker, more secure, anarchist eBay EBAY… ON ACID.
*(Picture showing Discover tab on OB)*
*Quote for pic - "The OpenBazaar app for Apple Mac is a slick tool, with search functionality and encrypted chat for speaking with sellers."*
There are, undoubtedly, some benefits to using OpenBazaar for anonymous trading. Encryption in transit across the nodes used to host the network (see map below for the spread) helps prevent simple snooping, whilst the very nature of a peer-to-peer setup means the US government cannot target an authoritative, centralized body, whether with a subpoena or a technical taskforce looking to knock out a server. Bringing the network crumbling down, though not impossible as shown in police P2P botnet takedowns, will be considerably harder than if command and control of the network were hosted on a small number of boxes. The chat feature is also end-to-end encrypted, which should prove popular given the rise of such services in response to revelations of mass government surveillance.
*(Picture showing OB nodes globally in Google Maps)*
*Quote for pic - "The global nodes that currently handle the peer-to-peer OpenBazaar network. The lack of centralized control makes it difficult for government to censor traders."*
**Why it ain’t Silk Road [insert iteration number here]**
But there are a few key reasons OpenBazaar is unlikely to become the next Silk Road. First, IP addresses of users are viewable to those have the technical ability to look. If the user can pull data from the OpenBazaar API (the application programming interface that allows outside access to some OpenBazaar systems), it’s possible to build a crawler that maps out all participants in the P2P network. Anyone who isn’t routing their traffic through other servers and thereby masking their IP address (typically done over a Virtual Private Network or the Tor anonymizing network) can, therefore, be quickly identified and located if police have a warrant."
This is pointed out in a stark warning during registration: “OpenBazaar users are not anonymous by default. Most communications between parties are encrypted, but IP addresses are public and can be associated with activity on the network. Malicious parties could use this information against you; protecting your privacy is your own responsibility.” Even where users take extra precautions, governments have documented methods of exploiting VPNs and Tor.
Then there’s the ethos of OpenBazaar’s chief purveyors: Brian Hoffman, a former lead associate for cybersecurity at Edward Snowden’s old employer Booz Allen Hamilton , long-time Bitcoin specialist Sam Patterson and academic Dr. Washington Sanchez. After taking over the OpenBazaar project after a few emails from its original creator Amir Taaki, one of the first to promote and develop Bitcoin and the associated Dark Wallet, the trio sought to make a platform free of government control where companies could make more money by cutting out the middleman, typically the owner of the store like eBay or Amazon, who take a small percentage of each sale on their respective platforms. With Bitcoin, the middlemen, the banks and credit card companies who took a cut of traditional transactions, were already removed. But the platforms (yes, including those dark web drug and gun markets) still took their slice. With OpenBazaar, there’s only the buyer and the seller.
The creation of the network will earn them nothing directly. Hence why they founded OB1, which is looking into numerous avenues to bring big names to OpenBazaar with which it will partner on certain stores. It’ll also provide merchant support services, such as vetting legitimate businesses and arbitration, for which it may charge. “We have a list of several hundred individuals and businesses who, over the past months, have asked to be notified when we go live. So we’ll be starting with them and anyone else who wants to join,” says Patterson, talking to me over OpenBazaar’s encrypted chat.
“We won’t be targeting big players immediately. Part of this is that we want to make sure the client and network have been well tested before we push for wider adoption. The other part is that the client currently doesn’t have a lot of tools to do proper inventory management, something that will be necessary for anything larger than a small business.
“The initial roll-out is still very much through an excited and engaged community and word of mouth, and we aren’t going to be doing marketing until we’re confident we’ve really nailed down this new way of doing commerce online. Peer to peer commerce isn’t going to take over the internet overnight, and we’re in this for the long haul.”
**The beginnings of a retail revolution? Or more dark web drugs?**
It’s been an auspicious start for OpenBazaar. Since the test went live at the start of March, Hoffman tells me there have been roughly 15,000 downloads of the app for testing. Having acquired a small amount of funding in a $1 million seed round from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar, Hoffman says his company is focused on growing the site without any more outsider investment in the near future.
OpenBazaar could still become attractive to those flogging illicit gear. Hoffman and his colleagues plan to increase security on the app, providing much more effective anonymization. They believe buyers and sellers have the right to keep their identity secret; understandable in light of global surveillance, where digital stores have been infiltrated by government spies, most notably attempts by the NSA on Google’s Play store.
More privacy features are on the way too. In the coming months, as OpenBazaar tries to sell the idea of a new kind of retail to the average shopper, it’ll look to tie itself to an anonymizing network, either Tor or the lesser-known i2p. The encrypted chat is currently not as private as, say, a Jabber client like Adium or Tor Messenger. OB1 developer Chris Pacia tells me all of OpenBazaar uses NaCl, a crypto library by Daniel Bernstein. He notes that further updates could provide more privacy. “The encrypted chat is pretty basic at the moment. It’s mostly just geared towards connecting two OpenBazaar nodes do they can discuss a purchase if needed. We don’t make any explicit attempt to hide IP addresses, for example. More advanced functionality like that could be layered on later as needed,” he says.
At the time of writing, I could only find one dubious seller, who was offering NATO-grade pepperspray and a “flashlight stun gun”. One wonders whether he or she has a licence to sell those goods in America.
*(Picture of said flashlight stun gun and user selling it)*
*Quote for pic - "One of a few items for sale on OpenBazaar that might raise eyebrows, due to the possible illegality of selling such a weapon. In its early days, OpenBazaar doesn’t look like a haven for criminals."*
But even if it does become a playground for criminals, to blame the OpenBazaar creators would miss the point. The OpenBazaar protocol, explains Hoffman, is “agnostic”. Like all code, it has no explicit moral bias. “The distinction allows for sale and trade of goods legally in one jurisdiction that may actually be illegal in others but does not intentionally enable users to conduct illegal trade and encourage that,” Hoffman adds. “It’s a tool, not a business.”
For now drug, fraud and gun merchants will likely stick to Tor Hidden Services, where sites are hosted on the anonymizing network and can only be accessed when users “hop” across randomly-selected servers to reach their destination. When OpenBazaar does get somewhat more secure, there’s little reason to suspect dark web merchants will move over en masse as there’s currently no indication it’ll offer better protection from law enforcement, even if it’ll be harder to take storefronts down.
If OpenBazaar can appeal to major merchants and independent retailers who want to save money and know how to handle Bitcoin, it has the chance to shake up the market in a significant way. The early adopters might be a little kooky (expect that anarchist aspect to remain), but that’s no reason for big players not to try something different that could, in the long-term, save them considerable expense.

**TLDR: Kindly and politely inform others about what crypto-currencies and blockchains are and how they work. It is the best weapon against these schemes!**
**Thank you first for recognizing this scheme will continue to move through our environment!**
While most of us on and other subs or forums know how to recognize legitimate crypto-currencies. *I'm usually on Bitcointalk.org and another forum I mine with*. We're not the target of OneCoin (+OneLife) scammers. This scheme has been pushed out of several countries and has been given several warning about it from the local governments. This scheme now has to rely on social media platforms such as FB or other platform they can control the conversation on. So here we are...
*I will continue to report the OneCoin pages on FB and other platforms as a scam.*
Unfortunately I've found FB flagging doesn't work all the time with other scams. They often say on the return message to just ignore it.
**The best weapon against cult-coins like this is education!**
**Your friends, family, and others around you will be prompted with several ads, flyers, or promotions about the 'New Digital Currency' in the next months**. The ad might look like the one [found in Florida]( it might not. *Why is this time so important you might ask?* Well the most recent announcement from Dr Ruja Ignatova is that they will be doing two big things in October. Doubling everyone's coins (*I know right?*) and having the ability to direct sell the OneCoin to people (no idea how yet). This is why you'll see more promotions for it through the US and UK. Its also the sign of a failing ponzi, they need new capital to sustain it. They'e already limited with-drawls from the system.
I hope you all take the time to educate people on cryptos. Even if its frustrating at times. *Its not just logging into x-site to see an artificial layout like OneCoin users see*.
If you know a Onecoiner and need to start to pull them out or show them items that the OC/Onelife is lying to everyone. Please look over the links that have been compiled over the years about these people.
[Ethan Vanderbuilt]( opinion of OneCoin scam (2015).
The [Mastercard deal failure and arrest of its members]( Very few got them before they dissolved the agreement and best of luck getting your money out through them.
[Recent OneCoin email explaining they can no longer promote it as an 'investment opportunity](
The behindmlm.com site in general keeps fairly good records of a lot of ponzi schemes. Keep in mind the people you might talk to look at most devices or *'use'* as signing in to x-site with a networked device. Most don't know how real blockchains work. Be prepared for the mass-adoption of crypto-currencies and schemes like this attempting to hijack the use of them.

OneCoin to Onelife. I've watching this MLM+Ponzi scheme for several years.
A good sum up of them. [Full story of the OneCoin scheme here.](
Even after losing the Mastercard deal, **along with some of their members being arrested**, they'll still moving on to new schemes.
Edit: [Simple wiki on OneCoin.]( *You can see  Bulgaria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Latvia giving warning about this scheme.*
Most of their survival techniques are based on social media where they can heavily audit and edit all who speak on the channels. Along with doing these large, evangelical, events. They offer zero technical details on how the OneCoin blockchain (if it exists) operates. 
**They will be coming for our friends and family who barely understand cryptocurrency.**
Be sure to fully educate them on closed vs open source blockchains, wallets, and cryptocurrencies in general.
**THEY WILL STILL ATTEMPT TO HIDE BEHIND CHARITIES AS WELL.**
This is the average comment the main speaker Dr. Ruja Ignatova projects onto the faithful.
13:00 - "Bitcoin currently has almost no merchants taking it."
*Try not to punch your screen during the video and you can realize this is the average level of brainwashing these events do.*
**They're not transparent either. They're audit video is a joke and I invite plenty to go watch it.**
*They also promised monthly/quarterly audits from a year ago. They never happened!*
They speak in vague vaporware. Don't let yourself or others become a victim of their program.
**This is the evolution of opening up the ponzi to the public. They cannot survive without new capital, meaning you and your friend or family.**

**TLDR: Just click on the BCT threads ( from the AurumCoin people stating they have no affiliation with OneCoin/OneLife. Ken Labine is delusional as usual.**




So, in practise his whole video is based on this lie.


I can't see the FB post/pic. **What I did instead is just go to the source threads of AurumCoin**.
*I do suggest people look at the rest of the information in the post as well though.*
[1: AU coin old BCT thread](
In that thread. [Only one user mentioned a querry about AU coin bonus with joining OneCoin]( It was not confirmed or denied. 
[2: AU coin new BCT thread]( Same questions eventually appeared in the new thread. [User AUKING uses the same behindmlm link as Ken](
**Stating: "AurumCoin.com is not a scam like aurumcoin is not a scam.they were very genres with they offer and brought back more than 10,000 au 1/30 of all the existing coins!! they could steal but they are honest, they do not need our coin. you can see it in the blockchain thats the first proof they where here long time before our coin and have all the domains onecoin is a scam and called their coin: aurum gold coins and nor aurumcoin here is the second proof this are different companies and aurum coin inc is the owner of trademark "one world one coin" and not onecoin".**
Edit: [Second post from AUKING specifying the differences the names involved.](
*Opinion* 
At 4:29 of Ken's video we hear an ecstatic claim of why would a company out to scam people attempt to trade mark themselves? A couple have but a notable and recent example of this is GAW/Paycoin. Which is currently under a federal lawsuit for all the right reasons that OneCoin/OneLifer is attempting as well. *Trademarks do not equal legitimacy.*
**PS special thanks to not only other users locking in on this global MLM but also to (Tim) who actively engage nutcases like Ken.** *Hey Tim, after wading through other cult-coins like this. My opinion of Ken is that he knows full well of what he's doing, I've experienced people like him with the same mannerisms, scripts, and fuzzy logic. He fully ignores reality and the blatant arrest records of a lot of the OneCoine/Onelife promoters.

These people aren't going to stop. They need new capital for the ponzi to keep going, especially in October when they double the coins artificially, because the CEO 'said so'.

@_date: 2016-07-13 18:18:06
Correct. Even the *"mining"*, from what I've seen, is a looped clip of numbers to give the illusion of mining.
I mentioned it though because I've seen similar schemes with closed-source coins do the same thing.
The difference now with the evolution of this scheme is that OneCoin/OneLife has to find new capital for their ponzi. The last minutes of the rage inducing video hinted at what they'll be doing for it. Utilizing the current faithful, they will distribute the OneCoin by selling/trading it to others that just want the coin. This implies, in my opinion, they'll have to create a wallet or token/system for such a transfer. It will be closed sourced for obvious reason, they'll state its for security or some bullshit. 
*I hope I'm just giving them too much credit to devise such an elaborate hoax-coin and they keep it to private logins.* But after seeing this group buy up properties, I think they're going to try to create a new closed-source coin. Possibly a really bad premine coin.
@_date: 2016-07-21 19:12:22
Your welcome. After chasing several groups like this I know how much time it takes up and the stress one goes through. It was a collective effort in bringing Garza down, I was in the background. All I did is stick the numbers being presented and forward them along. I'm more vocal now, since it seems if your not people will believe a lot of misinformation.
I kept reading through the comments section after I spotted you and Ken go at it. Then I had to keep loading more and more comments. I figured asking you would be easier then reading through hours worth of drama. Ken and others know full well they wouldn't last a logical debate where you field actual facts.
I watched some of Ken's videos but only a couple minutes in or skipped through chunks. He uses is a lot of emotional, hand-waving, and illogical fallacies. A good example is his two hour ranting video of [Faith vs Fear]( He claims all anti-OneCoin content comes from you, even though others and nations started warning others about OC before you. *Same shit was done by Garza*.
Ken's recent video on [TRADE MARK PENDING PART 2]( is more of the same. Its odd that he keeps claiming you and others aren't worth the time to retort to but he keeps making videos about it. The people he calls out also already responded and pointed out clearly [**Ken deleted their comments that fully explained to him all of wrong information he pushing**](
He's insane and won't change no matter what logic you throw at him. I hope you don't spend all your time engaging him. :)

They'll continue to make up whatever numbers suites them. Legitimate or not. If your looking for a good resource to absorb and share about OneCoin. A couple people I found made a good timeline on this schemes progression.

Another great link to unplug people with is the [Mastercard deal failure and arrest of its members]( *which you saw the promoter in this recent FB video try to promote*. Very few got them before they dissolved the agreement and best of luck getting your money out through them.

I hope someone traced where the Bitcoins ended up. So when Shavers gets back from his protected vacation and moves them they can come back for him again.

Thanks, I started in this space around 2011. I've learned a lot and hopefully you will too!
Haven't used it yet. I read over a couple reviews like this one from [cointelegraph]( In my opinion, in its current form, its legit. 
Its the P2P-Monetary incentive social media platform. It was bound to happen since site like Reddit, FB, and Twitter found hidden ways to create a monetary incentive to post or interact with content.
Unfortunately last night it looks like it was [hacked already]( At the same time the Steemit group employed a "blockchain-based multi-factor authentication" feature in response. *Not bad for growing pains even if they didn't have 2FA on*. 
The site is back up and I will create an account to give it a test drive.
I **won't be buying** the steemit coins though. I will attempt to gain, gather, and participate in content with the basics and work from there.

I like it its clever.
Can the software be used in a different manner such as tagging pictures and obscuring them without the right key?
I've had an idea for a while on how to protect artists pictures across the internet, like many have, for some time. Even if the software/encryption didn't obscure it. Being able to prove the picture is yours with an embedded blockchain id, I can see being useful.
I look forward to the audio version of this software as well. Keep up the great work!

According to themselves and no they have a private login database (zero proof of even a blockchain). *I know right, who believes them and why?*
Yeah I want OneCoin to die out like paycoin as well. I helped dig Paycoin's grave as well with tracking Josh and Joe's artificially made paycoins (at the beginning) and some other things. The Onecoin scheme is more dangerous than paycoin because of these self-promoting people and they know people don't know how to tell what an actual blockchain is.
*I'm watching and replying at the same time. I just heard this promoter in this video use the same phrase as Josh Garza - 'The peoples money'.* That's how silly these people are.
The problem isn't when you or I hear the first ramblings of their sales-pitch or ask for better details on these schemes and scams.
*Imagine your friends and family wanting to 'catch up' to you in this digital currency race. Because that's who their targeting to make this cult-coin last another year. They've been kicked out of several countries and the Mastercard deal failure has pretty much pushed them to hide in social media and these events.*
They'll be coming around your neighborhood faster than you think before the October events.
I've already started downloading this filthy video. We need another good laugh on the Josh Garza/GAW mega thread on Bitcointalk.org 
If your looking for easy sites to download these videos. I suggest [fbdown.net]( or just typing in 'FB video downloader' into search. There are plenty out there.
**Edit: Adding in debunking links for others to share. Please educate your friends, family, and others about this scheme. Its a closed source login database. They can literally make up whatever numbers you see! The mining 'video or picture' you see in the UI is a looped picture and the numbers/values mean nothing!**

I think I found the coin your referring to, [Onecoin[ONC]](
The OneCoin scheme we're discussing here started around the same time but I think a couple months earlier. Its a different scheme though.

[My post yesterday in regards to OneCoin+OneLife]( promoting the next level of this ponzi scheme. *The hints are at the end of the video... if you can survive it.* 
The OneCoin scammers do not have an official list of events to promote this second phase. [Here is the ad]( posted inside this video linked here, that was used to lure the people you see in this video. Expect to see such ads around your area as well.
Please inform your family and friends about the OneCoin scam. It will come through the United States and other countries through individual promoters. In October my thoughts (from the promotion video) are they will allow individuals to sell/trade OneCoin directly to people without logging into the site. Most likely it will be a closed source coin as well.

Great synopsis on the details of the UI layout.
Do you have access to the current slides they "*educate*" users with? *I didn't want to create my own account and give the ponzi anymore money.*
I saw a couple months back people found the material was plagiarized from actual published books. I'm curious if they changed it or kept it the same.
