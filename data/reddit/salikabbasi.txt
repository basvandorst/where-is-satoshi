whaaaaat. danny, that you?

I bought 25 at 5 dollars a pop. Spent it before it even hit 15.

that's not the reason he gave, you're also making it sound like buying and selling discussions for any other country wouldn't be fine, which was clearly not the reason he gave. we're not talking about how it's technically right or wrong from a god's eye perspective or why you would ban such a discussion. 
he is deliberately creating a taboo to keep people from discussing trade with a specific country on the basis of 'security', and repercussions from law enforcement and the like, even though the chances of that are about as high as getting a rap for enabling several million dollars of drug trade a year. it's an amazing abuse of power for the sake of it.
this is clearly some random middle class guy with grand ideas about how the world runs projecting his own navel gazing ideas and rules where they shouldn't be. I've sold a lot of BTC here, to people genuinely interested in the currency for its sake. what happens to their investments? is he going to send them packing with a boohoo, too bad, glad i'm not you, move to another country why don't you?

duuuudddddeeee... 
i want one already. 
@_date: 2012-12-05 19:35:27
Cowboy Bebop. the venus episode i think. a lil doohicky that transfers moneys from one card to the other.

i've seen chips specially designed for SHA256 somewhere i forget where, and they were for some sort of cellular/network related thingamabob. could be along the same lines.
@_date: 2012-12-05 20:44:08
on second thought, this might be more illuminating:
@_date: 2012-11-30 16:20:05
exactly. if the dev team has such opinions and good reason to believe them, they should act on them, instead of smothering anyone who questions them.
@_date: 2012-11-30 16:50:20
no worries man i wasn't getting annoyed at you. i still don't understand the logic behind this, it took me a second look to make sense of it as well.
@_date: 2012-10-31 20:10:22
sometimes if your system clock is off, the security certificate will look to the browser as if its expired/non-existent, giving you said message. check your system clock maybe?
@_date: 2012-12-05 22:02:11
dude. so sweet. the website looks kinda sketch though.
@_date: 2012-11-30 16:53:47
openpgp is pretty much everywhere also.
@_date: 2012-12-06 10:52:52
but the coolage. 'tas potential.
@_date: 2012-11-30 17:01:49
lol is ok dude, you already told me. :P
@_date: 2012-12-05 21:48:59
:| i can has?
@_date: 2012-11-11 09:32:52
that's your problem. find that USB. you'd probably have more luck forming a search party with that money.
@_date: 2012-12-05 20:00:43
that's funny, that's what I'm doing. :D
@_date: 2012-11-30 15:34:01
wtf... why? bcuz teroristz? omg leo?1? why isn't the same said for countries with people* who use it for drugs and the like? arabic's in there as a translation, are they planning on redacting/banning that as well? (this tone isn't meant for you, obviously) since when does the dev team get to make decisions like cutting an entire country off with nothing but a cursory backhand? fuck this. they should make a statement about it, instead of exerting their passive aggressive control over a legitimate discussion. let people know where they stand and deal with it. i have scant little doubt people would be as callous as to let it slide then.
why in the hell should anyone be barred from buying or selling BTC on the basis of nationality? the dev team doesn't sell or give value to the bitcoins, any more than they actively enable places like Silk Road in running. i find all this preposterous.
EDIT: * wasn't clear what I meant
@_date: 2012-12-05 23:05:22
yea i meant the bitcoincard.org, it is pretty sparse and clunky looking. and the technical specs page seems to have a password on it, oddly. i just saw the bitinstant article, so i'm not worried about it not being legit really, wasn't in the first place either. this looks *amazingly* cool. and at 10-25 dollars a pop, i imagine it'd take off quite quickly. 
i am VERY curious about the vendor servers and the text messaging functions. i'm in Pakistan, and people are very open to passive rebelliousness like a currency not run by the state. a bunch of people are genuinely interested in it, and i've sold some btc to them as a long term investment. things like this make me very excited as a result, more potential to build a community/culture around it. i had actually thought of something remotely similar, except with simple rfid tokens, and not with any sort of standalone functionality. i hope this is pretty reasonably encrypted. it'd be nice though, to not have to download the entire blockchain to the server, especially if you have a bunch of them in say a mall. that's a lot of internet connections.
though, if the money is for all intents and purposes in the card itself, I wonder if being made to access it under duress might have been considered. i mean, this could easily scream I have access to easily anonymizable money, even if the amount relegated to the card is about as small as you would carry on you in a real wallet, which is probably the sensible thing to do.
@_date: 2012-12-05 20:35:21
it's a sort of credit card transaction device. one card to the other. from an anime called cowboy bebop.
EDIT: here: 
@_date: 2012-12-11 11:36:01
it's already a feature.
@_date: 2012-11-30 14:10:06
what active douchebaggery. 
*I* use bitcoin amongst other e-currencies and I'm in Pakistan. will he kick/ban me for suggesting the same? fuck this guy. there are PLENTY of normal people in Iran and Pakistan. the idea that bitcoin has to be 'defended' from potential terrorists to stave off the potential repercussions is patently insulting. 
@_date: 2012-11-11 09:34:34
dude, take that money and form a search party for that USB. you'd have better luck.
@_date: 2012-11-30 14:30:34
you dropped this: /s
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:03:53
well i'm not trying to be an authority on this, i was just saying maybe people would think of it like seeding. i mean, $50 is not a lot to spend somewhere along the line as a big thank you to the network.
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:30:11
that seems like a nonissue if you're doing it to contribute. just pick a pool.
@_date: 2013-02-18 16:06:20


@_date: 2013-06-28 10:42:00
uhhh... what can i use it for?
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:07:16
this seems like a decent idea, but doesn't get the ball rolling for people who're starting out.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:37:50
i'm in khi. i used wm-center when I figured I'd try my hand at trading, pretty damn broke these days unfortunately. it was cheaper than anything else, and I suspect it still would be if you got a large amount. 
but if you need a really large amount like 25000 USD's worth, you might want to consider learning how MtGox and the like work. if you couldn't be bothered and want to just buy a bunch as a nest egg, maybe find someone reputable on the bitcoin talk forums to cut you a deal.
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:03:26
well usually that's a great place, but it's a bit of a catch-22 really. there aren't any large traders, so there isn't a lot of volume, so people don't buy and sell that often. barrier to entry's too slow. again, for example, there's one guy I can find on localbitcoins, charging 10% or more, on top of whatever it costs to send it to him.
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:51:22
that's not the point that people are trying to make. if you're assuming that bitcoin will appreciate in value, it'd just be easier and more profitable to hold onto the coin. i can't see how buying something that'll be useless within a few months producing slow returns is better than disciplined trading with long term goals.
@_date: 2013-03-14 07:29:02
you seem insufferably butthurt that people are disagreeing with you. also, paypal.
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:41:40
ah jeez. probably should have written that out as converting/buying bitcoin. sending bitcoins is easy as pie, obviously.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:18:16
i'm in pakistan. paypal isn't available here. so people use liberty reserve as an intermediary. why spend money on bitcoin instead?
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:27:27
I'll take this up with you in person if you like. PM'd you.
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:06:41
these guys only sell to countries with these banks. i think these ones in particular are all either in the US or the UK.
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:04:41
i'm not trying to be an authority on this, i was just saying maybe people would think of it like seeding a torrent. i mean, $50 is not a lot to spend somewhere along the line as a big thank you to the network.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:03:02
sorry will send you a PM with the number! posted my number here by mistake thinking it was a private message.
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:53:47
... or why people even want rigs so badly now.
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:21:26
it's an investment into the speed of the network as well no? i imagine it'd be like seeding. you pay 50 bucks, sure, but if a lot of people do it it'll run better for everyone.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:37:03
well you can have my number, where are you in pakistan?
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:44:44
yeah. why go through this entire loop de loop to produce coins when you have just as much in the first place?
@_date: 2013-02-18 07:24:03
people downvoted you, because what? denial? wtf.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:57:13
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:38:54
what? buttercoin's out?
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:52:06
bitinstant isn't rolled out globally, it caters to a few countries. You can't have them process a transaction otherwise, unfortunately. I've tried.
