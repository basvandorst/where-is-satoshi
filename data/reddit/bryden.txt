That's a hardware solution and has nothing to do with software. Increasing the "block size" of an ethernet card does speed up the internet just like increasing the block size would increase Bitcoin transactions but it's temporary. Once there's enough adoption, the network gets crowded again and eventually you need a solution to the problem.
There's no physical solution to the transaction speed problem like there was for the internet. Instead, we'll need to do what they did when they scaled the internet from a single LAN to a WAN, and then globally, to the point that it is today. You're on the same internet as me, but we hop through a number of networks in order to talk to each other. I believe the same will inevitably be true for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:03:49
I haven't looked at that to say flat out no, but I'd be surprised. It would make sense to me that they have the _capacity_ to process more transactions per unit time at the current adoption rates for each coin respectively, but again, none of this matters. The problem is till there. Nothing was fixed when they increased the block size, all that happened was they alleviated some of the symptoms - *temporarily*.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:47:22
Bigger blocks doesn't resolve the issue, it just postpones it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:24:52
Care to elaborate on that? It seems like a solution to a very real problem to me.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:12:31
Not really... Just like you can still flood a network on the internet, but you'll find it nearly impossible to flood all of the networks on the internet. In the same way, it will be financially and technically possible for certain groups of people to flood a LN, but nobody will have enough $ and technical resources to flood the entire LN.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:13:04
It's currently being spammed. It's cost prohibitive to spam it enough to have a significant, long term impact to the lightning network because of my second sentence: the lightning network will change the impact of spam related fees in quite a few ways. Why do you think we're making the LN? To address high fees. So you move these transactions off chain and suddenly you'll need to spend an awful lot to get fees back to where they are now, and then you still have a long way to go because the current fees with the current spam level are resulting in fees of a TINY fraction of a penny on LN. So yeah, LN will help a shit ton. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:15:37
If it helps ease the sting at all, imagine the amount of energy consumed to keep the traditional financial system running. Plus the environmental impact of printing paper/synthetic paper money and mining/minting precious metals. The hash work also isn't just "wasted energy" since it's what keeps your money secure from a hack attack, it's layers and layers of security being added to every coin in circulation. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:38:10
Do you mean coinbase is 14.4k in this analogy because it doesn't implement segwit and is the slow one, yet it can cripple a system that supposedly supports segwit? If that's what you mean, that's because segwit (like block increases) isn't a fix to the problem, it's a temporary relief. The exact same problem will present itself down the road and eventually you need to fix the problem, or find a clever way around the problem entirely which is what the internet did with TCP/IP stack and it's what Bitcoin is doing with Lightning Network. Here's a quote from the article above:


That's why we need an off-chain, second layer technology to solve this problem. Block sizes don't fix the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:01:49
Both? That's what we did with the internet. I can't easily do this anymore because of new layers added to the internet that are strikingly similar to Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:24:16

That (roughtly) billion dollar attack would only affect people opening a channel that month. Hardly worth a billion dollars. Plus all it would do is make the fees go up. And here's how I'm looking at it: where I live, banking fees are about $20/month for a basic account. If I can open a few channels that are capable of doing all my transactions, that's a $240 value at least. So if you can afford to spam the mempool for more than a month, enough that it costs me more than $200 to get all my transactions done for the year, then hats off to you. It's not gonna happen.

@_date: 2018-01-12 17:11:11
First of all that's exactly how it still works. If I connect on 14.4k you can't send a file to me any faster than my connection.
Second of all a second layer is coming that will help mitigate the coinbase problem. Here's an excellent read for you or anyone else interested in this analogy:
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:47:01
Definitely is, but it still has risks. I bought two RX 580's with my Ethereum profits to hopefully mine back the ETH I paid and profit.
Risky thing with Ethereum mining right now is PoS is coming at some unknown time, likely this year, possibly in the next few months, which will render GPU mining obsolete for Ethereum. My personal opinion is that any crypto's other than Bitcoin/Ethereum are too risky to hodl, so I'm hoping my mining pays off in Ethereum before it goes PoS. If not, I'll either sell my gpu's to a gamer, or roll the dice and mine random profitable altcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:08:49
To the untrained eye, maybe. But look at July through October, same exact point as the fake part of the graph.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:18:59
Or compared to the internet, which has also gained value through large scale adoption and has evolved from very humble beginnings.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:19:29
It mitigates the spam-transaction attack vector enough that it's no longer a real concern. Similar to how the internet is still susceptible to DDOS attacks and flooding but nobody has ever shut the entire internet down - only a small number of networks in any one attack. They can spend as much as they want taking out single LN nodes, but there won't be enough money to do it to the entire network once it hits a critical size.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:35:45
But why male models?
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:09:00
No it's an analogy of a revolutionary technology in a state similar to Bitcoin right now that faced very similar "crippling issues" which it eventually overcame.  A strawman would be if i were to say "so we should increase the block size to one terabyte? This would make Bitcoin completely unusable."
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:05:41

@_date: 2018-01-08 18:43:10

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:19:00

It's cost prohibitive to spam enough to have a significant, long term impact. And lightning network will change the impact of spam related fee increases in quite a few ways.

Tx per unit of time are correlated to adoption. As adoption goes up, tx goes up in the same amount of time. So yes, one has a higher tx/second rate, but it doesn't matter because they're both too small. The size that you would need to increase the blocks by in order to always have low fees regardless of adoption rate, is too high for a coin to implement. It's not a solution.

Only 21 years ago (which was still long, long after the internet was created), I was able to kick users off the internet, with ease. It was so simple that I wasn't even a teenager at that time. I could single handedly, as a kid, kick you off the internet. The internet still has some of these flaws but we've found clever ways to mostly mitigate these issues and I can assure you, the internet is here to stay. So is Bitcoin.

Loling to tears right now.. thx
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:05:49
It would seem that way indeed. But they actually didn't fix it. They just gave some temporary relief, and they have way less adoption for their coin. If the other coin were to become popular, it would face the exact same issue, just a bit later in the game. The way that coin is right now, it's susceptible to the exact same problem Bitcoin is facing. That's why Bitcoin told them to fork off, so that we could find a fix to the problem, which I believe we have.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:02:26
How do you mean? I can't find a way to make that analogy work, sorry. Increasing the size or amount of packets that a computer can handle doesn't fix the problem. We still see DDOS attacks today which are similar to what I was doing back then, but it's a lot harder to pull this off for a few reasons:
The internet built new layers (new networks, much like LN does), and combined that with physical changes like using cable or fiber instead of phone lines to speed things up. Then there was a wide-spread adoption of in-home routers which helps with security.

Back then there was zero attempt by web service provider to hide users IP address. That and essentially everyone connected directly to their ISP without any kind of router/firewall and the ISPs didn't monitor their networks for DOS/DDOS attacks. There were a number of ways to do it, but a simple sudo ping -f would usually do it. Or a script that sent a ton of ICQ messages. Or MSN messages, or PMs on IRC or wherever the user was that was annoying you. Now, a lot of those issues are addressed by firewalls, network monitoring, routers, etc. Second layer technology on top of an internet that wasn't built to be rock solid from the get go.
Not only that but back then when you logged into your school computer you could read everyone's passwords, and watch everything they browsed fairly easily. I didn't know how to do this at the time, and now that I do know how to do it most data is encrypted these days - another second layer technology that runs on the internet that fixes really big problems with an insecure technology.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:46:59
This. You'd need a lot of money, but not just at one point in time, you'd need a lot of money continuously going into it. It's not a realistic concern. I'm sure it'll happen at the beginning a few times, and I'm sure certain coins will claim that's the newly prophesized date for the flippening, but over time, as the network grows and matures, this kind of attack will become completely unaffordable for all actors. This certainly isn't a "kill switch" to Bitcoin.

They won't have to dump their entire paycheck into it, don't worry. It would take too much money, for too long of a time in order for this to be a realistic attack.
Even 3 mil a day wouldn't cut it, plus you'd have channels that are open continuously so in order to impact them you'd need to be pumping in 3 mil a day for years... I mean think of how long some networks have been online, that long.
Plus, I don't know why any bank would send that large amount of money to their competition day after day after day.
I agree this kind of attack is coming, and it'll hit Bitcoin's valuation a bit, but it's not enough to end it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:34:52
I don't think that's a realistic concern. I'd imagine many channels will be open for extremely long periods of time. You'd have to spam the mempool continuously, and to an extent large enough to make the fees rise by a lot more than what we see today. It would take more than just a wealthy nation-state to continuously have the mempool spammed enough that the fees crippled LN.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:25:39
Yes way, I did it and had it done to me by friends too. Practically everyone was on dial-up. It was very easy to send a small packet to ICQ that would then make a bigger packet to send to your friend. Then you send multiple of them in succession very quickly and it doesn't just kick them off of ICQ, it would take them off the internet because their dial-up would become so backlogged that it would screech to a halt.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:06:06

Prepared to hodl for many, many years. What a lot of people don't seem to get in crypto investments is that hodling for 3 months isn't hodling. Go to stock markets and be prepared to hold for years for your best chance at good returns. If you flake back and forth between stocks you'll almost always end up losing money compared to if you held a few diversified stocks long term. If you invested money in Bitcoin that you'll need in a few weeks or months, you're a fool. HODL.
Edit: Buy
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:56:43
Agreed. I suspect lightning network will address a lot of these issues by creating a number of sub-networks that are off-chain, much like the internet works today.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:53:39
I'm just pointing out how insecure the internet was - that a child could kick someone offline easily. If I had been an adult, and had access to a server proportionately as large as Coinbase's, I probably could have wreaked significant havoc on the internet.
My point is this - in a new technology as revolutionary as the internet, or Bitcoin, you'll undoubtedly hit some big snags along the way. But anyone who HODLs knows they will come out on top because there's nothing that can't be either directly fixed, or almost entirely mitigated by second layer technologies.
Creating a new coin that claims to "fix the problem" is short-sighted at best, and intentionally fraudulent at worst.

Maybe using bitcoin as a spendable currency isn't what it will be best at in the end. I feel like it's on a trajectory to become the world's best savings account because it has a fixed number of bitcoin's and a naturally occurring interest rate based on increase in demand, and the number of coins being continuously lost.

In fact, the FAQ just trashes r/bitcoin without mentioning Bitcoin cash until a number of questions down. It's slimy. I don't know what you expect?

@_date: 2017-12-03 11:42:23
Of course. But in a crypto currency world, Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be the best at transactions, it could just be the best at gaining a steady, sustainable interest. Obviously if everyone loses interest it becomes worthless but i don't see why everyone would start changing their minds. To the contrary, i imagine more and more people will become interested.

Although you're kinda right in the sense that these are wild-ish claims, they're probably close enough to the truth regardless of proof because there are zero ethical reasons to piggy back off of a brand like bitcoin. r/btc is a weird sub to talk about anything other than Bitcoin (sans cash), BTC isn't a BCash unit. If you're convinced that you've made Bitcoin better, and you've really improved it, you would have a better chance differentiating yourself from Bitcoin than you would by trying to stand behind a cardboard cutout of it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:41:23

You can certainly sue people for selling you healing crystals if the salesman said "you just lick it twice a day and you'll be healthy" and then it turned out those healing crystals were actually something like lead, and that causes you bodily harm directly as a result of their doing.
Likewise you can sue if someone says "I'm selling you Bitcoin" and then you go to spend it but it doesn't work on the Bitcoin network, so you try to convert it back to USD and suffer a financial loss.
Whether you want to admit it or not, the market has already decided what Bitcoin is, but that's irrelevant. This is up to the courts to decide, and it's pretty clear where this is headed.

There was a quantum physicist hosting an AMA sometime around the height of Bitcoin's value and people had asked about Quantum Computers and the security of the blockchain. His answer in a nutshell was that there was an initial hurdle to translate security functions from traditional processors to quantum processors, and that this initial hurdle was almost completely mitigated by the fact that developers will see this coming a long time before it becomes accessible, and they'll have the time and resources to implement the required security fixes before anyone will be able to crack anything.
I still have a lot of questions and can't answer anyone else's questions, but I remember this being my takeaway from the AMA.

It's not p2p. You can send your BTC p2p on chain. This is just another method of spending the same bitcoin.
* quicker than on chain
* decentralized
* can be used as a "payment stream" (pay per second, pay per km, pay per word, etc)
* Not p2p
* Not as widely accepted as on-chain yet
* Node needs to stay online if you have a balance greater than when you opened your channel

I agree with all of that but when you're selling BCH, and disguising it as Bitcoin, you're no longer in the free speech territory. You're now committing fraud for financial gain.
If ver wants to tweet "Bitcoin Cash == Bitcoin", he can go ahead and be within his legal rights (despite how wrong he is). But if he tries to sell people Bitcoin Cash, claiming it's Bitcoin, with the intention to trick users into buying his coin when they intended to buy Bitcoin, that's fraud.

It discourages mindless consumerism. But at a certain point, the expectation is that bitcoin's value will level out to a fairly stable value, likely it will still be slowly increasing at a small but steady rate. Let's just pretend that rate ends up being about 2-3% per year. I believe that's the same rate as inflation in most western civs, but now it's deflation instead. You're still going to buy coffee on the regular, a car if you can afford one, clothes, all that normal stuff. But instead of having a slight incentive to spend your money immediately (the way that you are in an inflationary economy), you'll have a slight incentive to value your money more than the instant gratification of getting something you don't really need, right now. Personally, I see this as a wonderful thing for the world in terms of sustainability, and a wonderful thing for individuals on a mental health level.
edit: practical example. You're running out of underwear. Do you buy a pack for $20 today, or do you wait for them to be $19.40 a pack next year? Coffee today for $5.00, or wait until next year and pay just $4.85?

Right but the problem with USD, CAD, EUR is that they can only be used as physical tender right now in Venezuela, you can't tap to pay or transfer it to your cousin on the other side of the city/country/world.
The only way around that would be for the government of Venezuela to adopt it as a national currency. It's a race between that happening, and Bitcoin being adopted.
If you're getting paid in money that is continuously being devalued day after day will you wait for the gov to adopt USD? Or just use BTC? Assuming the power was reliable. I'm not sure what incentive you would have at that point to keep holding out (at the expense of eating, and paying for items you need) for your government to finally adopt USD.
Of course, as soon as BTC starts to gain traction, it's possible Venezuelan gov will quickly act to adopt USD, but I'm not sure why they'd prefer that over BTC, either way, they lose control at that point.

Most of the income from organized and disorganized crime is not from mugging. It's from completely different streams like drugs and firearms. The money that is made through theft is from robbing Banks (yes, this is still very, very common) and merchants. Robbing people is too unpredictable. I'm not saying people don't get robbed, they certainly do, but you're way more likely to be robbed by a friend, roommate or family member. Unless you're operating a cash register. 
Just think about it, even if you knew my home address and the fact that I said I have 1 bitcoin, and even if by some weird luck from the cosmos i happened to be within driving distance from you, you still don't know if I'm just an internet troll with zero Bitcoin or telling the truth. And you definitely don't have my Bitcoin address so you really have no clue. And then you also don't have any clue if I even keep it in my house. Maybe it's at the bank and now you're risking going to jail for nothing. Or maybe it is in my home but you need multiple signatures to access my funds so now you need to kidnap three more people. Like honestly, if anyone thinks they're going to start an underground empire by robbing people of bitcoin by tracking them online and mugging, good luck. Sounds like a horrible business idea, criminal aspects aside. 
Your Bitcoin will be stolen by organized crime through viruses spread on porn sites and downloading pirated content. So much easier, and a way broader net of people to steal from. It's also fairly easy to automate, and there are zero travel costs and better privacy/diplomatic protection than mugging people in person.

I'm not saying it never happens, but there are so many reasons why this is a horrible idea for the criminals. All I have to do is say "My bitcoin requires multi-signature" and they're fucked. Or all I have to say is "I don't know the passphrase, I keep that at my bank" and they're fucked again. Or "I was just trying to fit in, I only have 0.0000542 bitcoin here you go" and give them an old change account address and they're fucked again. Or say.... or say... or say...........
Maybe people get robbed of their bitcoin from time to time, but you'd have to be completely reckless. Telling people I own 1 bitcoin is not enough to put a target on my back, even if the value raises to a million dollars, because you still can't steal it from me. Knowing where I live and how much bitcoin I own != access to my bitcoin, and no amount of beating me up will make my passphrase magically pop into my head.

Omg this fear is so overblown. Why aren't the mafias, governments and criminal gangs beating people to a pulp for cash (I mean, I know they do it from time to time, but **main** source of income?!?). Do you know how many people are paid in cash? Robbing a farmer's market will pull in more cash per hour than researching someone's identity online, finding out where they live, praying to God that they're close enough to you or that you have connections in that area, hoping they haven't spent it yet, breaking in unnoticed, tying them up, beating them to a pulp, trying to decide if they're lying or telling the truth that they don't have access to the passphrase on their own and they need multiple keys to access the bulk of their funds, providing an old address/alternative address with a small amount of Bitcoin in it and insisting that's all they have left, waiting for the transaction to process, laundering your bitcoin... gimme a break.

@_date: 2018-06-29 11:55:55
Let me break it right down for you. I'm Joe\_hodler99, I have 50,000BTC which are worth 10 trillion USD in 5 years. Here's what you now have to do:
\- **Find out my Bitcoin address ahead of time**: nearly impossible. Like seriously almost impossible. The ledger is public, but there's nothing that ties me to it unless you know which of the exchanges I used, and you have a way to hack into those exchanges, AND assuming I haven't moved my bitcoin too many times since then otherwise it quickly becomes a game of "who-owns-it". And this is very important if you're going to consider taking a flight overseas or spend months researching me to get my real name and address. If my address/es turns out to have 0 BTC (because I lied, or because I spend it, or because it's currently invested in a new project I love and even though I own it I don't actually have control over it), what a waste of time. I'd say the likelihood of being robbed by a wrench attack is almost nil because of this one point alone, but let's go down that rabbit hole anyway...
\- **Find out my real name and physical address**: Difficult. It's totally doable for a number of people but it would take enormous effort. Bots almost certainly outnumber real people on the internet at this point, so you may already be chasing after a red herring. For most people you could get their city and likely their name or at least a nickname, but then to narrow it down to the street address you'll probably need to infect their computer with a virus first to get that info unless you get lucky.
\- **Fly out to me**: this means you're spending thousands of dollars per person involved. Either your'e doing it alone (unlikely for a heist of this complexity) or with a group of people. Let's say it's a $1,000 flight, $2,000 in expenses per week each. $3,000 x 3 people. Almost $10,000 sunk, and months of investigating someone and you haven't even made a dime out of me yet. So for every failed bitcoin heist, you're wasting $10,000. That's an enormous deterrent on its own. Also, hopefully I'm in a country that you want to risk doing this heist in. In some countries (like America) you'll get shot for entering someone's home unannounced, so that's a pretty big deterrent. In other countries like India, an address really doesn't mean much since they're often not accurate at all.
**- Hope I don't move myself or my money in the meantime:** If I invest my money or if I fly out to the Caribbean for a vacation as you arrive you'll need to follow me and my money wherever we go. What a waste of your time and money. Let's say I'm just sitting on it and I also happen to stay home, that's somewhat likely. You still need to kidnap me, unnoticed. I apparently have millions of dollars, but you've avoided the security cameras, my neighbourhood watch, and either kidnapped my wife and family or somehow avoided their detection as well.
\- **Hope I don't have good OpSec**: here's where the plan really falls apart again, not that it even has a leg to stand on in the first place. There's no way of knowing what my OpSec is ahead of time. You'll need to be prepared for all scenarios. Get ready to take more flights, perform more kidnappings, potentially dig up a box buried somewhere with part of my passphrase, likely if I have tens of millions of dollars worth you'll need to talk to my lawyer for his signature before moving a large amount... the list of scenarios go on, so you basically have to just pray that I have almost zero OpSec. And that's after all the time and money you've already invested above.
\- **Launder the money (BTC)**: it's a public ledger so you'll need to launder the money now, not a great big deal, but just one more annoying thing to do that takes time and lowers the return on investment.
Basically, you're assuming that some chump is going to have 1,000,000 BTC, brag about it on the internet, prove his bitcoin address is really his and that he's not just trolling, have left a trail of where he lives online, have absolutely terrible OpSec for millions of dollars, and not move the money into some investment and be easy to kidnap. You're also assuming that the robbers will have the time and money to invest in stalking someone for months, a year or more, so that they know not just where they live but where's a good spot to nab them, and to make sure there's no upcoming vacation planned, and that they don't plan on moving the Bitcoin any time soon. You'd need to know all of that ahead of time so seriously we're talking about months to a year or more of cyber-stalking.
I find this entire situation hilariously unlikely. Makes for a good movie though.

I don't mean that you can't do it because it's not worth enough, I mean you can't trade fractions of a Satoshi since it's the smallest unit in bitcoin. Anything smaller than 1 Satoshi won't be recorded or verified on the blockchain. With side-chains like lightning, sure it's theoretically possible, but I'm just talking about current limitations for BTC.
If there's an exchange that does sell fractions of the smallest unit of a cryptocurrency as you say with NEO or any other cryptocurrency I'd advise you to stay the hell away from that exchange.

Market cap is one of the more important data to look at when valuating a stock/currency. In the case of crypto-currency, where there's no "financial statements" where you can look at revenue, assets, debts, etc. to make better valuations, I'd say market cap is maybe the most important data on the books for valuating it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:07:05
See my previous reply why I think calculating a market cap range is the way to go. Coin not budging isn't a problem as long as they're still "in use" in the sense that someone is active holding (or hodling).
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:42
username suggests otherwise
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:39:49
Excellent point! Food for thought.
Maybe it's a personal preference thing, but I still think knowing the Market Cap gives it a value that I can understand best. Even if I'm comparing a savings account to a currency, at least I can understand the question "is a savings account worth 5x what fluid cash is worth to society? 10x? 100x?" that question makes sense to me, even if it's hard to calculate. But trying to compare how much someone uses BTC to how much they use their USD doesn't make BTC's value more clear to me.
While it's true you generally don't have a good reason to compare the market cap of a stock with the market cap of a currency, it is sometimes useful to compare the entire stock market's market cap, with things like the GDP. Similarly, I think it's useful to compare the BTC market cap with things like GDP, market cap of the stock market, market cap of currencies, etc. It puts things into perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:54
Those are very real variables that you'll need to put into your equation for valuating BTC. In my opinion it doesn't change the fact that the Market Cap is your best starting point. I'd suggest making a "realistic Market Cap range" using some common sense and news headlines. We know quite a few BTC were lost already, so we can make a good guess at how many might theoretically be lost. Some might even be lost without the user realizing it (they don't realize that they've forgotten their password, or didn't backup their wallet properly, etc.). I think a safe assumption is that at least 15% of BTC have been lost, and I find it unlikely that more than 50% have been lost. This is my wild guess without having done more digging into it. That means the market cap is between 8million * BTC-&gt;USD and 13.6million * BTC-&gt;USD. It's a large range, but it's small enough for me to valuate when I'll personally be cashing out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:11
Depends how you look at it in both cases. 
First, instead of looking at it like selling 1/4 of his current holding each time, which he could only do 4 times obviously, he could sell 25% of what's remaining in his wallet each time, and do that many times, until he had less than 4 Satoshi remaining. 
Second, in the case of the commas, perhaps they're in the right place and the numbers are just hanging out lower than they should be.

2. Break into a random house and steal some shit.
I'll tell you which one gets you way more jail time, and it's the same one that has an absurdly low chance of success.

A fairly long time ago someone posted a well thought out argument for just calling them Bitcoin, even at the Satoshi level. I don't remember all of the points for it, but I remember originally hating the idea, and then kinda coming around to it after reading their post.
The key take aways for me, 1 Satoshi is many orders of magnitude smaller than 1 Bitcoin, so by saying you need 10,300 Bitcoin for a banana isn't truly going to be confusing, because people will understand you're not charging 50M for a banana, they'll know which scale you're on. And obviously in legal documents and from a technical perspective, it will have to be documented as Satoshi, but purely from an adoption and marketing perspective, I think it makes a lot of sense to talk as though 1 Bitcoin = 1 Satoshi. If there's any interest I'll try to dig up the post where the guy lays it all out way more well thought out than this, not sure if I summed it up very well.

Where's this link you're talking about haven't seen it.
I'm really not worried about it. You should stop spreading so much fear about bitcoin. There are much easier, more profitable ways to steal guaranteed money, rather than to follow up on unfounded reddit boasts of wealth, where you have no clue how secure the funds are.
A ransom can literally happen to anyone. Bitcoin is frequently demanded as the payment because it's harder to trace, but that's very different from being robbed *of your bitcoin*. Can't wait to see your links.

The problem with security is that as you become more secure, the convenience drops. So until you have a lot, it doesn't make a lot of sense. If you have an amount you're willing to lose, just keep it on mycelium on your phone. I do that with &lt; $100 USD worth.
The problem with your question specifically is that your situation really influences the most secure way to store large amounts of BTC. Do you use a multi-sig wallet? Or do you use paper and pen and hide your (shuffled or word swapped) recovery phrase in multiple places? Store it in a hardware wallet and put it in a safe deposit box? It really depends on your situation.
The best thing you can do for the security of your BTC, is learn how to recover it, and learn how people have lost it before.
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:54:57
You linked to this thread, presumably you meant to link to proof which I would be curious to see.
Also, it's not at all the same as announcing that you keep tens of thousands of dollars in cash in your home. Your cash is in one physical spot, where you can verify the amount, without any password protection, no multi-sig required to move it, etc. BTC offers all of these protections and more.
There's **NO SECURITY RISK** to telling the entire world how much BTC you own. There is, however an enormous security risk in not knowing how to properly store your Bitcoin.
Nobody could steal my bitcoin from me, because depending on my wallet I either can't move it on my own even if I wanted to, or I don't know the passphrase and it's not realistic that a kidnapper is going to go on an Easter hunt to find it where I lead them. No amount of guns to the head, or hammers to my hand are ever going to change that.
You can set yours up like this too, very, very easily.
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:50:07
&lt; $100 USD worth is on my phone, no real backup because I don't really care all that much if I lose it or have it stolen. It won't break the bank.
&lt; $5,000 is in a device that nobody other than my wife and I know about and how to get at it, but we don't use it so the password isn't something we have memorized. In order to get access to it it would take us a few hours
\&gt; $10,000 members of my family, my wife and myself would need to authorize it. I can probably actually get to this quicker than my &lt;$5k stash in most cases, but I haven't ever needed to move funds out of it. It's essentially for long, long term savings.
I also had about $300 worth x 2 on exchanges. One was QuadrigaCX, they've gone belly up so I lost $300, and have another \~$300 in kraken still. I don't trade very much.

Even putting it on your license plate doesn't really do anything. Knowing someone has a lot of wealth in Bitcoin, Cash, USD in the bank, Gold at the Bank... it doesn't really do anything to help a thief.
Thieves are opportunistic by nature, they don't tend to target specific people since that just narrows their net. Keeping that in mind, the most difficult type of hacking there is, is targeted hacking. I could setup a profitable phishing operation today, I have that knowledge. I could even pull off a scammy ICO. I'd make a TON OF MONEY doing either of those. Way more money than I would ever make doing targeted hacking (for which I almost certainly do NOT have the skills to do) based solely on a license plate, or a reddit post. The amount of skill (and to be frank, sheer luck) it would take to hack into someone's wallet-holding-device as a specific target, and the relatively low reward compared to more conventional means... the probability of becoming a victim is laughably negligible.

I've heard of 0 verifiable claims of a victim being kidnapped and beaten for their passphrase after the victim publicly disclosed BTC wealth.
Thieves only risk jail time for assets that they figure has a high likelihood of being acquired by force. They don't kidnap people and **hope** that they'll tell the truth and **hope** that they actually have as much as they claimed and **hope** that they don't have multi-sig and **hope** that they also didn't leave their device at their cottage, and **hope** that the wallet they use is synced and ready to transfer on the network. Plus your risk of this is mitigated even further by the sheer fact that the thief would need to be in your region, **and** aware enough of bitcoin to assess the risk/reward, **and** see you personally, **and** find an opportune time to kidnap you. It's just not happening.
There are no thieves to convince. It's just you and me.
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:23:08
But cash is easy to steal. Bitcoin is not.
You couldn't steal my bitcoin with a gun to my head. Not because I'm a tough guy, but because you'd have to kidnap 3 other people and put guns to their heads too, and they don't all live in the same area code as each other.
There is ZERO RISK in telling people how much BTC you have. There's an enormous risk in not knowing how to securely store your BTC. If you need help, let me know.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:32:53
That works too but it's a bit of a mouthful. And there's not really any confusion anyway if you just call it a Bitcoin.

That's the problem with this unfounded fear of disclosing your bitcoin accumulation. Would-be-thieves need to take an internet stranger's boasts of wealth at face value. And then spend the time and resources doing the recon to find out (somehow!?) exactly where you keep your BTC. And then hope that you don't have multi-sig or a hardware wallet. And then hope for, find and have the ability to implement an exploit for your system.
You're more at risk posting a picture online that displays you have a middle class income. Thieves would be better off breaking into a home and stealing some of your shit, than to try to track down internet strangers claiming high btc wealth and hacking into their computers.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:02:37
I'm not trying to suggest that thieves don't exist, but we need to put this fear into perspective.
If you just use a bit of common sense I think you'd have to agree that you're FAR more likely to misplace your recovery key and lose your BTC that way, than you are to be the victim of targeted bitcoin cyber-theft. There are too many things that could go wrong for it to be worth a cyber criminal's time, they'd have better luck with phishing by impersonating exchanges, or creating scam ICO's. There's no money in patiently sifting through reddit posts boasting of unverifiable wealth, and then honing their skills to target a specific victim. It just makes no sense.
Maybe it's just because I'm an experienced web developer, and I'm more tech savvy than even the average Bitcoin user, but I find this irrational fear of targeted theft of your Bitcoin absurd.
I have &gt; 100BTC come and get it. Or, maybe I'm a lying sack of shit and you're about to waste months researching me and trying to find out where I keep the 100BTC that I probably don't even actually own. Who knows.

Ok so I have B1TCO1N on my license plate of my ferrari outside of my mansion. You now have me kidnapped and I inform you any one of the following:
* I sold all of my bitcoin to buy these things, I have very little left, here's my wallet with 0.000213BTC, OR
* I have multi-sig, you'll need to kidnap 3 more people, 2 of which are in other states/countries, OR
* The Bitcoin is on a hardware wallet, in my bank
For a thief to kidnap someone, they have to be more than kinda sure that they're going to be successful. Bitcoin already has enough safeguards to protect against this. Even if you're not using multi-sig, or a hardware wallet stored in your bank, all you have to do is SAY that you do, and what can the thief really do about it? There's no way to verify whether you're telling the truth or not.

I mostly agree with a lot of what you said but I don't think patents have a place in software development. You end up with enormous companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple which will literally buy companies solely for their patents, strictly to hold  them for future insurance.
If a small business becomes extremely successful in the future by creating something from scratch that they believe is original, or if one of their rivals comes out with a new product that they believe is original, the patent holding company will search through their patents to find something that has a shot at sticking in court.
It kills innovation. Things move very quickly in software development and they tend to build upon the last generation of innovation and we need to have that space in order to encourage that quick, iterative innovation. Patents are a net negative.

No, it's like going into a new, but otherwise fairly normal looking neighbourhood, signing over the papers of ownership for your car to a prominent member of the neighbourhood without asking for anything in reutrn, all just so that they can park it for you, and then asking to have them sign ownership back over to you when you want to leave. That's exactly what it's like.
To be clear, I'm not trying to hate on anyone that lost money. What happened is bullshit, I hope everyone gets their money back and the Gox situation is dealt with severely. But we **need** people to start demanding control over their money, not being laissez-faire with it.
**edit**: regarding the deposits allowed and no withdrawals:
Ideally, the way a future exchange will work is you'll put in your order for 5 BTC, at that point, 5 BTC are set aside by the exchange in a smart contract so that they no longer have access to them, you'll send in your fiat, which will release your funds to your wallet directly. Surely someone is working on this right now.

But you're operating under the assumption that the fraudulent node is 100% certain that I'm also telling the truth. Let's continue with your example in the comment above, with the only change being that I actually still do have the data:
You and I have a channel open with each other. I **pretend to lose all tx history in some hardware failure or other catastrophe**. I ask you what the current state of the channel is and you lie to me.
You almost certainly would lie in your own favour. I notice this, and now I can do one of two things: close the channel with the appropriate balances and open one elsewhere, or leave the channel open and wait for your next transaction. As soon as you make a fraudulent transaction, you'll lose your funds to me.
This deterrent is enough to prevent this kind of attack because you don't get to choose when this attack happens, you can only lie in the case where someone asks, and when they're asking, you have no way of knowing whether or not I've actually lost the data.

Because there are richer big countries with armies protecting them. And not just to protect against other countries. They protect against all forms of threat. Diseases, for example. Something I think we're kicking ass in.


I'm not in the US but if I were I'd definitely want to change the way some of the wars are decided on. But I'd also feel very safe against farmers, terrorists, and the rest of the worlds most powerful nations.


Me too, 6 foot and 140lbs. Holla.

There aren't many left, are there..? I wonder what happened to them... hmm. Anyway, checkout what's happening to the last remaining tribes in the Amazon. But when the US left Iraq there was little remaining government there... that didn't go so well. There was also Somalia for a while. Things weren't very great there either.


In brief, I want to be able to say, think, believe, read, eat and do whatever I want to do (so long as it doesn't impede on anyone else's ability to do those things) without really worrying about it.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux isn't a fork of Linux, it's a distribution of Linux. But either way, you're missing the important part. Redhat Enterprise Linux acknowledges where it gets its codebase from (from Linux). It doesn't try to *be Linux*, it's happy being *a type of Linux*. Same with OpenSSH, it's not claiming to be OSSHv2.0, or the original SSH, it's happy being its own thing.
Bcash does try to be the "real Bitcoin". It's not Bitcoin anymore than Redhat Linux is the "one true Linux" or anymore than OpenSSH is OSSH.

In my opinion if you give someone else responsibility over your money, you have to accept being paid back in Bitcoin, fiat, or neither and lose all of your funds and you have to be ok with that. That's literally the deal you're making.
You're saying "here's access to controlling my money, you can have that for absolutely nothing in return, thank you very much".
Is Mark morally wrong for paying back in fiat instead of BTC, absolutely. But I think there's a more important lesson that the community needs to learn.

You don't **need** inflation and yes, you can use a currency that is ballooning in value although for most people you'll want the rise to be slow rather than skyrocketing like current trends. Bitcoin will rise much slower after this adoption phase is over.
We're far from that point right now, which is why most countries that are adopting/considering adopting Bitcoin are countries where the alternative is a currency that inflates faster than people can earn it to the point where if they don't spend it the day they get paid, it won't be able to buy them groceries the next day.
Those same people can and are beginning to switch to Bitcoin and I promise you, they'll be happy to finally have a currency that they can spend and they will be much happier with the recent/current ballooning value over the falling value of their native currencies.
It won't always have this velocity. But it will always go up in value in the long-term.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:42:40
That all sounds very reasonable, sounds like we have a similar approach but different valuations for Bitcoin.  If it goes back up to 15k I'm assuming you'll do the same and sell? I personally think it can sustain a value well above 15k and so i didn't sell, and I'm continuing to hold until I believe it's unsustainable probably in the 100's of k. Glad you realized some gains! I'm quite confident I'll realize some too at this point, but i haven't sold so none realized as of yet. Congrats!

The entire point of bitcoin is to give the power over their money back to the people. Hodling it all on an exchange is saying "no thanks" to having control over your money.
Do NOT come crying back on r/bitcoin if you lose all of your money because somecoinexchangebase.com loses an insider trading lawsuit, then has everything seized because they uncover something else like fraud/money laundering.

Tulips were in demand. People bought tulips to continuously propagate them. More and more people "hopped on the bandwagon" in order to make money by selling them since they were in high demand, but by propagating them, they decreased demand which decreased the value.
Bitcoin is in demand. You cannot propagate it. As people "hop on the bandwagon" it goes up in value, not down, since it become less and less available. It's speculative if you don't know anything about it. Otherwise, once you understand it's the first time we've fixed the double-spending problem, and that it also just happens to fix a ton of other problems by being decentralized and secure by design, you'll stop speculating and you'll finally just get it.

It's not about fixing a problem it's about preventing a problem.

True, also I don't see a good reason not to implement segwit if you're trying to provide value to your customers. I know their reason was "not enough customers were requesting it" but I don't think that's something customers should even have to request.

The person in charge of making that switch is you. Just start using that convention. You could also put in tickets with your wallets/exchanges for them to add a feature that allows you to toggle between displaying BTC and Satoshis.

I think the key deciding factor for me is the fact that a very small percentage of the community went with BCH, and then they're pushing it as "the real Bitcoin" (colluding with bitcoin.com and  twitter handle) claiming that it follows the white paper more closely (first of all that's not what makes Bitcoin, and second of all that's BS and completely subjective).
When Satoshi gave Bitcoin to the public, he didn't mean a small faction of the public, he meant the wider public. Case closed for me on that point alone, but there are a ton of other reasons so it shouldn't be a difficult conclusion to come to.

Right. But if you read my original comment, in a graph that trends upwards (as Bitcoin does) the odds are against you on that one. It might feel like it's trending downward for a long time, but there's no safe time to sell. You think it's safe because it worked for you this time, but I can show you dips where it dropped 15%, 20%, or 30% and then started climbing again. There's no safe time to sell, because the odds of it turning around and climbing back up are higher than 50% in a graph that trend upwards like Bitcoin. So you're gambling and the odds are against you on that one.

Don't be upset if you keep sending your Bitcoin Cash to the wrong addresses and your orders don't go through.
The dollar analogy regarding Canadian dollars doesn't really hold up. The reason why nobody cares about Canadians saying 'dollar' is that it's localized. It's assumed as soon as you cross into Canada you mean a Canadian dollar, and as soon as you go to the states you mean an American dollar.
Cryptocurrency has no borders. If you say you want to pay with "bitcoin" to a merchant but actually meant Bitcoin Cash, you'll be causing a lineup behind you as you try to figure out why your client says 352 confirmations but the merchant still hasn't received anything.
- Cryptocurrency is the general term for all coins.
- Bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency.
- Bitcoin Core is a wallet that sends and receives Bitcoin (full stop).

Right now, it's not really possible AFAIK. But in the not too distant future you'd send your fiat via a special, new transfer method that your banks would need to support. That payment is held by your bank, they create a digital representation/signature of it on the smart contract (perhaps using a bank specific cryptocurrency that isn't available to the public). The exchange provides the Bitcoin. The smart contract sees that the bank has signed off saying you have authorized fiat funding and your funds are frozen. The smart contract also sees the frozen Bitcoin so it executes the trade. Bitcoin goes to you, the bank transfers the fiat to your bank, which settles the transfer.

I might get downvoted for this, but:
I don't pay a lot of attention to other cryptocurrencies. I really only give two cryptocurrencies any credibility: Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Bitcoin either already does what any crypto does but better, or it will eventually do what any crypto does but better in the not-too-distant future. The competitive advantages of these alt-coins are short-term. Eventually they have to compete with the big OG - BTC.
The only reason why I hedge a bit with Ethereum is because it's strategically aimed at being appealing for enterprises to use it as a framework for decentralized smart contracts and apps. It's basically a rat race: will enterprises adopt smart contracts/apps faster than Bitcoin matures? If so, Ethereum is a very safe investment.
Any other alt just offers "faster" "less fees" "more anonymous" "untraceable" "lower overhead"... at the cost of a combination of one or more: security, stability, market cap/adoption, brand recognition and most importantly decentralization. They won't survive long-term.

Bitcoin actually has more underlying value than fiat.

You either don't understand networking or centralization. Or both possibly. Networking the way LN is being implemented will not result in centralization since it's distributed. Even if there are large hubs, they won't be able to control the entire network (just like large internet hubs today can't control the entire internet). Bottlenecks would only occur on the outer fringes of the network ie: your personal channel to another person, perhaps, but then all you need to do is open up a better channel. Once you have a good channel you can leave it open for eternity as long as neither of you close the channel. So yeah, there'll definitely be some big hubs, but that's not a bad thing, nor is it centralization.

Try as I did, couldn't find anything in there about the Windows 10 operating system source code that you're referring to. Mostly a bunch of developer tools for creating stuff in their proprietary languages, or stuff that was already Open Source that they borrowed/improved upon.
I'm not saying they don't use or contribute Open Source tools, but Windows 10 is NOT Open Source. They've basically done a bit of work in Open Source so that they can point to something, and now want buy in from Enterprise managers that have been mandated to find Open Source solutions. It's a marketing ploy. Nothing more.
The entire Office suite and Windows (any version) will never be Open Source.

There are a ton of problems with most of the other alt coins. Centralization being the biggest and most common. Nano belongs to someone. It's no better than USD or any other already existing fiat currency, so it doesn't really solve any of the big problems in my opinion other than maybe making transactions across borders. Bitcoin belongs to everyone. Lightning network is a second layer built on top of Bitcoin, so it's still owned and operated by the people.

It would take a nearly global effort to ban it, otherwise other countries will continue to grow their economy while your country falls behind. It's not as easy to ban as you might think, there are political consequences on a global level. Imagine if the land of the free banned a currency that was created by the people, for the people, but hey, China, Russia, Canada, Australia and everyone else was using it still.

Strictly from a **technical standpoint**, as a store of value Bitcoin has already proven to be solid. There's not much more to do in that area.
By implementing LN, Bitcoin will be able to be a solid store of value, **and** have a solid protocol for instant transactions making it one of the best places, if not the best place, to hold your currency whether you want to save it or spend it.
Again, that's all from a tech standpoint.
We would still need mass user adoption so that the volatility settles for store of value, and mass market adoption of LN in order for us to actually use LN payments. Until then, it won't reach its full potential.

Quantum computers that are capable of decrypting sha256 will mean a lot of bad things for the world. The entire internet will need to make major updates, Bitcoin being the least of your problems.

True, but from a hodler perspective, this is what you want to do.

The part that's confusing you though is that you are looking for something that doesn't exist in this system. You're looking for a way to calculate how people will make up their mind about Bitcoin forks next time. This isn't a democratic organization, it's also not run by a leader, or run by anyone at all. This is what a completely organic organization looks like.
You want to know how you can vote in the upcoming fork but there are no rules, no votes, and it won't always be fair for each individual with an opinion on the direction Bitcoin should take. This is what makes it so beautiful. Nobody can stop it, because there are no strings to pull.

The point of Bitcoin was not to do away with naming conventions, and this isn't "Language" this is an organization.


WHAT!?! No. If people want to buy into "that Bitcoin thingy" there's no reason they would want BCash, why would they? It's not compatible with Bitcoin, the community doesn't recognize it as Bitcoin, it's attempting (and failing) to become Bitcoin by piggy backing off of the Bitcoin brand.
Glad you're not trying to hide your position though - straight up shill.


That's your take on it. The name belongs to the community. If 2% of the community decide to use the name to describe BCash, they're **legally** entitled to do so, but that doesn't mean the community agrees with them.


It maliciously represents itself as the real Bitcoin, even though it lacks popular consensus. Without having done any real work, it wants to just swoop in and take over. That's not ethical.


No, everyone is voting with their opinions. But at a certain point, those who are still screaming "BCash === Bitcoin" need to accept that the community has decided against them. Get over it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:01:57
1. Only as much of a gamble as any new technology is. This is like being a venture capitalist but without having to be accredited. It's not gambling in my opinion unless you didn't do your homework and research the tech, what problems it solves, what problems it still faces, and what the potential value of it could be. If you're in it just to get a lambo and put your blinders on, then it's gambling. I've done my due diligence and I believe in it more than most of my traditional investments so in that sense I'm investing. 
2. It might feel like it's consistently going one way or the other especially in hindsight, but from a statistical probability perspective, a graph that continues to trend upwards like Bitcoin, the odds of guessing it is trending downwards at any point are less than 50%, so that's a losing gamble. If you believe the graph will now trend downwards for the long term, then the odds are above 50 but there's no point buying it again at the bottom and you should just sell and walk away. Buying back in to a stock you believe is trending downwards long term is foolish. Either way, buying low and selling high with any amount of frequency is a losing strategy. You should make your buys low as i am right now, and you should sell when you believe it's overvalued, but if you believe it will continue to trend up long term, you hodl, and buy, don't sell. 
Holding is time tested. The best investor in the world not only swears by it, but practically forces his investors into it by never splitting his companies stock as the value increases. One stock of Berkshire Hathaway was a few thousand dollars to start, affordable enough for most middle class people. One stock is now 300k and has never split, never will, so that many investors are financially strong armed to either hold, or cash out and stay out since they won't be able to buy back in. 
Hodling a speculative gamble would be stupid, agreed. I'm a software developer though, and I've read and understood the white paper, parts of the code, i run a full node, i understand cryptography and how the block chain works, I've needed a currency that does what bitcoin can do that others can't, so i see a practical need for it, i understand what sets it apart from other currencies, i understand why it's volatile, so I'm not gambling. It's the most certain investment I personally have. I know more about this than i do about the companies in my mutual funds, or the stocks i hold. Those are more speculative to me in my specific case. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:09:18
You're grasping at straws. Bitcoin MUST be 100% what the whitepaper said almost 10 years ago, it's never allowed to evolve or innovate? Or as you're suggesting: it has to be it's tagline? Your desperate attempt to pidgeonhole Bitcoin is pathetic.
Bitcoin is what the community make it into. It if turns into a Blockchain only good for running apps and nobody uses it as a currency that won't make it any less Bitcoin. It won't be the Bitcoin I had in mind, but my feelings are irrelevant. As are yours.

That's like asking "what gives computers value? If the market doesn't see value in computers anymore, then nobody will buy them".
Computers are a solution to a big problem.
Bitcoin is a solution to a big problem. And as it happens, it also becomes more rare as time goes on, meaning that if adoption rates were to stay relatively the same the value will go up.
It's easy to brush over the importance of Bitcoin right now if you're in a developed country because your currency works pretty well. That's not the case in a lot of countries. The value add for those countries is very apparent, which is why we see things like the situation Venezuela is in.
Any time you have a solution to a big problem, that solution has value. Don't think of it as "money backed by nothing" think of it as "a new kind of money, that solves the problems of the old kind of money" and it will make a lot more sense. The kind of money that you're used to is almost certainly backed by nothing other than a promise from your government. I'd argue that's more like backed by nothing than Bitcoin, which is backed by the fact that you don't need to trust anyone's word in order for it to hold value.

I'm not sure what you're trying to get at but the name belongs to the software that the community run. And that's overwhelmingly Bitcoin (the non BCash one, in case there's any confusion).
**Legally speaking** the community can decide to do whatever they like with the name, including calling Bitcoin Cash "the real Bitcoin". But the way Open Source projects generally work is if you name your project the real one and try to take over your original project without the community, you'll be ridiculed, exiled by the larger, more legitimate community, and not taken seriously since this is the poorest of OSS etiquette and one of the lowest things you can do when the community builds something for free and hands it to you..
This isn't the first OSS project. It's not the first fork. We've been doing this for decades. Don't expect the community to act differently just because Roger wills it that way.

First cars. First lights. First most things are going to be worth something, if not only because of their nostalgic value, then because of the value they gain just by the virtue of the fact that they're rare and become a collectable. You don't have to buy Bitcoin if you don't believe me, but personally, even if it reaches my moon I'll always be holding on to a portion of my Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:50:48
It depends on the project and the license, there's more than one way to make an Open Source project. In the case of Bitcoin, it's the community that decides since we own it. The fork wasn't even close, it was a landslide decision by the community to stick with the original Bitcoin, which means the brand stays here.
In the case of Ethereum, the same rules apply as Bitcoin but the community made the opposite decision in their case as we did in Bitcoin: more adoption followed the hard fork so the decision was made by the community that this was the real Ethereum.
In the case of Linux, only Linus Torvalds gets to name anything Linux. He even has it trademarked, in fact, so you wouldn't just be shunned by the community you'd also have some lawsuits coming for you.

No I wouldn't because that's not what I'm getting at. You're missing everything I'm saying. I don't know that it will go back up before it goes down, and neither do you. That's what I'm saying. That's why it's a fool's game to sell "on the way down" hoping that you'll catch a better deal "at the bottom".
It's easy to look back at these charts and say when it was a good time to buy or sell, but it's much harder to say right now whether you should buy or sell. That's why I'm hodling. I'll buy here and there because I have a long term strategy, but in the short term I expect it could go down yes even as low as 4k, but I don't care. I'm in it for the long haul.

You'll never guess the bottom. Just pick a value you think is fair, buy below it, and wait long-term. This could take a year, more maybe. Or it could be back up to $16k sometime next month. But you wont guess the bottom correctly, can promise you that.

Lightning is coming making fees extremely low, transactions instant. Bitcoin is a spendable currency. It's deflationary, so until it finds its true value, the value will be going up pretty steady, before evening off and going up just slightly year over year. So right now, it's an excellent store of value/investment/whatever you want to call it. Eventually, it will just be your savings account earning a modest %.

If you believe it's going to trend downwards, it makes even less sense to buy the dip. It only makes sense to sell in a downward trending market.


I was one of those people. But I would have sold way too early. Based on where I ended up buying more, assuming we trend upwards from here, I would have lost money. There are plenty of people who still think it's trending down in the near future. Who knows?


You haven't lost anything by hodling. You've got the same as when you started. You're more likely to diminish your BTC by trading because of tax rules, and the odds being against you on the initial sell.


This is an amazing feat. In my opinion though, you're not likely to continue with this record long term. Also, in a market where you can easily make 1000's of % return, I don't see this as significant enough to warrant the risks.
Basically, I don't see how anyone can argue for trading when:
* Taxes are not in your favour.
* If you assume an upward trend long term (not just months), as BTC has gone since inception, then the odds are against you on the sell.
* If you assume a downward trend long term (not just months), then sell and stay out.
* The majority of people who start trading perform poorly at first, hodling requires no skill (but does require nerves of steel)
* The amount of time that you need to spend in trading each day is significant. That time is presumably worth something. Unless you have an enormous initial investment, you'll probably be spending hours making a few bucks.

I'm not sure if Hal Finney's death or deterioration of health dealing with ALS line up with Satoshi's disappearance or not, but that's a pretty obvious question I would ask regarding "Why Hal might be Satoshi" or "Why Hal might not be Satoshi".
Ie: If Satoshi published something after Hal's death or after he was no longer able to use a computer.... pretty obvious it wasn't him. On the flip side if Satoshi published less and less as Hal's health deteriorated, I'd say that's a pretty intriguing point.

It's the first currency to exist that doesn't require you to trust someone else that the value will be relatively the same or better tomorrow. On a short-term scale, this is more or less a given in developed nations, but all they need to do is start printing more money and your savings account will have the same number value, but much less buying power.
In countries struggling with a financial crisis, or if you take a look at the value of your developed country's currency over the last 100 years, you'll see why Bitcoin is here to stay.
Bitcoin will continue increasing in value, almost certainly, for a long, long time.

[Fees were high beginning in November]( But transaction levels in November and January were [similar to transaction levels we had already hit in May](
Clearly the low fees can't be completely related to volume either since we're doing [higher volume now than we were in November]( and at a glance the same or more volume than we were in January.


Volume and transactions are actually *really* high right now. It's not as high as in December, but I feel like critics are trying to frame this as a "*yeah fees are low cause nobody is using it anymore*" when in fact usage seems to be as high as it ever has been, barring December.

We keep going on and on about it because it's the first time in history that people have had access to a digital store of information that's immune to censorship. It will only be successful if it's decentralized, otherwise, why not just stick with the status quo? 
The blockchain doesn't offer a lot to society if it's run by the same people that run the banks/governments. It's only useful as a decentralized store of knowledge and value. The rest of them were started by private organizations which each have a large stake (sometimes 50% or more) in the coin they created, and more often than not, complete control over the code, the blockchain and the rest of it. Bitcoin is owned by the people. That's why we keep going on about Bitcoin, and blockchain. Because it's ours.
Edit: Over time, Bitcoin has continued to be in demand. A one month dip isn't enough to register as "no longer in demand", it's temporary. Keep an eye on it. Watch it go back up... yet again.

This isn't an opinion situation. The closest thing to equate it to is engineering: any engineer should be able to look at a bridge and say whether it's stable or not. Same applies here.
You might not be a software developer and so it might take you a long time to be able to understand it the same way as I do, but that doesn't mean you're stupid and it doesn't make me wrong. In software development things can be sorted into "this will work" or "this won't work" categories with a very high level of certainty. If you ask a number of competent developers that have researched it thoroughly, they should be able to give you the same answer to that question. Make sure they're developers, make sure they're competent, make sure they research the problems it's supposed to solve, and you should get the same answer.

I never said they were, I'm just keeping us on topic: discussing what the genesis block is **actually** about, since that's our best guess as to why Bitcoin was created. The article is about a shitty situation that the Chancellor was in, due to the inherent flaws of traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin couldn't have put the Chancellor in that same position.
Will banks stay relevant in a Bitcoin currency world? My guess is that they will adapt to it, yeah.

No, he's saying we've been through drops *like* this before. Not this large since I've been hodling, but large enough to know that this is normal and a good buying opportunity.
Low cost base HODL true believers haven't lost anything before.
They're still hodling, and over time it has always been profitable to hodl. Bitcoin is extremely volatile so drops of 10% - 20% don't even make me bat an eyelash, and drops like this current one are healthy, expected (although undpredictable) and just means that the value will need a bit of time to recover.
Extreme volatility for Bitcoin has been well known for years. This isn't new. This isn't the end. This needed to happen and you can be one of three people:
* Hodler (has worked well for me so far)
* Trader (the odds are against you but go for it if you want)
* Panic seller (I'll gladly buy what I can from you. You were in it for a quick buck, while I understand the true value of Bitcoin so I'll definitely buy at this price)

Then you don't ever need to. You're still thinking of it like regular fiat - it's not. It's like cash. If I go get 1 Bitcoin for $1,000 but I have to go to the tunnel, then your customer will be paying me $1,200 for it. Which they'll gladly pay because for them, they'll get $1,200 worth of merchandise from you. So you don't have to do anything other than accept it (which you would likely do since it has value and you wouldn't be declaring it in this hypothetical big brother scenario where the government bans cryptos). I'm incentivised to continue buying from the shady dude in the tunnel because I'm making 20% by doing something I consider fairly low risk since I know and trust tunnel dude, your customers are happy with the fair price, and you're just happy to be selling your goods. You might even sell your Bitcoin since you don't want to be caught with it, so you sell it for cash to a friend at a 20% markup too. You're now a shady dude in a tunnel! But it's ok, because people trust you and you're not actually doing anything unethical.

In both cases (Bitcoin vs. BCash and Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic), it's glaringly obvious at a glance where the community went. The specifics of precisely how you calculate it aren't really important in either of these cases but for the sake of entertaining a hypothetical situation (a situation that we aren't in):
The moment we need to start calculating votes on that level we will just have to wait it out a few days for the community to make an overwhelmingly obvious decision. The likelihood of the community remaining split 50/50 on an issue like branding is negligible, and that probability decreases even further as the days go on.

I first signed up for reddit to find Bitcoin conversation with others and my first landing spot was r/btc. I almost gave up on reddit because that thread didn't make much sense to me from day one, but I already had a fair bit of knowledge about Bitcoin so as confused as I was, I wasn't vulnerable to their misinformation campaign.
I posted a few things in that sub before really understanding what they were about, my posts and comments were downvoted to oblivion and people harassed me. I found this place around the same time and my posts were well received.
Fast forward a few months I posted on r/btc about how I had posted positive, Bitcoin related material in r/btc (a sub that claims to be about Bitcoin) and how it was not only confusing but also it kinda hurt to post something about Bitcoin and then have a "Bitcoin" community downvote and harass me. In reply to my comment telling them about how it made me feel, they told me to fuck off. I believe their words were "awww were your feelings hurt? Fuck off."

This is probably the one weakness of an open source, publicly owned project: it's *your* responsibility to make sure you agree with the code before you run it, and it's just as unrealistic to expect users to read and understand the code as it is to expect reviews of the code by community members to be completely impartial, honest and without any agenda. So it really is your responsibility only.
In theory, you shouldn't be running the Bitcoin code on Bitcoin.org without agreeing that you believe this is the best version of Bitcoin. If there's a better, compatible version that forked, you should run it instead. If there's a new version which you believe is worse, you should refuse to run it and continue running the old version instead. Practically, people will probably just run whatever is on Bitcoin.org unless there's a huge, public uproar about a particular commit. I hope the community keeps a close eye on this project.
So far, I think we've been pretty lucky as OP stated with some cheap imitation forks that nobody (relatively nobody) went for. One day, eventually, I'm sure there will be a better fork of Bitcoin which is truly more in line with the interests of the public and it won't come from Bitcoin.org. But that's not for a looooong time. And it sure as hell hasn't happened yet.

Agree to disagree. Everyone I know that traded has less profit than those that held.
And agree to disagree on the future of BTC. I believe it has at least 1000% return ahead of it.
There's no gamble in holding if you believe the price you paid is less than what it's worth.
And I think it's naive to think that this is the ceiling when it's still valued less than gold, still hasn't even reached mass adoption, LN is still in its infancy, you can't buy anything on Amazon yet with it.. etc. Very far from a ceiling still.

Nobody deserves to get robbed. But anyone who keeps their money (hodls it there, long term) should not be surprised if it ends up getting robbed, seized, misplaced, hacked, whatever.
My ideal future is the future that people would almost certainly be presented with if they'd just demand a bit more control over their BTC. By immediately moving it away from the exchange, exchanges will see everyone is doing this anyway, so they would provide a "direct-to-your-wallet" service since this would give them a competitive edge over exchanges that failed to provide that service.
They're not really pressured to do that if the vast majority is ok with exchanges literally holding their wallets for them.

The idea that people are being 'fooled' by Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash isn't admitting anything. It's pointing out that there's a real concern about a real scam.
If I make a site called gooogle.com, and it explains how to " do real Google searches" right on my site, and a small but significant number of people accidentally start using it instead, would you consider this ethical? Of course not. Quit being a shill.
Edit: Also, read the article OP posted, it does an excellent job exposing the scam for exactly what it is. Your comment that you link to can be summed up as "Legally anyone can call their fork Bitcoin, so let's just let them do that because this is confusing me". Be lazy, get scammed.

OMG get a grip people... We've been at this price before. Just a FEW MONTHS AGO. If you got into Bitcoin expecting a nice, smooth ride straight up then you're a moron. Welcome to volatility. Even at the current low I'm up 1,000's of %. HODL. Or don't, I don't care, sell and get out of here with your weak hands. I'd rather you give someone who knows how to HODL a better price for their coins.

So much wrong with this I'm not sure where to start... 
By NOT being a fractional reserve, bitcoin stops the banks that use Bitcoin from lending so much money that nobody will be able to pay it back. If we'd had Bitcoin, the Chancellor wouldn't have had to bail out the Banks because they'd be lending only what was actually in their reserve in the first place. That's all Bitcoin does in that situation.
Governments will still tax, and will still bail out some organizations from time to time. 100% for sure even in a Bitcoin future. It's the governments job to keep a country stable. If an organization's financial failures is pulling the Country down with it, watch for some injections/bail-outs, it'll happen.
Taxation might even eventually be easier in a world where every single transaction is on an immutable, publicly accessible ledger.

LN is to Bitcoin as Networking is to computers. As LN grows in popularity, there will be a main "internet" (in fact you can already see this). Anyone connected to this "internet" can pay anyone else.
You can also create a private network that doesn't connect to the larger internetwork if you so wish, but your average user will be connected to the largest network with even just one channel (potentially multiple channels but no requirement), making it simple to pay anyone else they need to.
edit: checkout  if you can find a way to hop from one node to another, using any nodes you want in between (and you should be able to find multiple ways for most nodes and at least one way for all nodes already) then they can pay each other.
Now scroll way, way, way out... those nodes forming a circle around the entire perimeter of the network aren't connected to the main network so they can't pay anyone in there. If they open a channel with anyone that's in that large network, they now have access to pay everyone in there.

Lightning is what will change Bitcoin from just a store of value to a store of value that is also spendable, is what I'm saying. Right now just a store of value, after lightning, both. 


I'm aware that's what they do. But that's not the only way to earn interest and it's not how Bitcoin will earn interest since nobody will be able to lend out your Bitcoin while it's just sitting in your wallet. Instead, Bitcoin value will go up because slowly people will lose it, and because presumably the economy will grow but the supply of Bitcoin compared to it will not. 
You can't use USD easily for a lot of the problems Bitcoin is going to solve. Buying something across borders (online or in person). 
Bitcoin can be cloned but only if it's also given to the people anonymously without a centralised, greedy effort to control it. Why would people switch to that come when we already have Bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-04-10 11:57:30
It's a hostile brand takeover attempt that tries to dupe cryptocurrency newcomers into buying BCH, which markets itself (in ways that are often contradictory) as the "new Bitcoin", the "future of Bitcoin", the "original Bitcoin", the "upgraded Bitcoin", as "Bitcoin Cash" and as "Bitcoin" (sans Cash, which is even confusing amongst its own supporters), the "real Bitcoin", and not "Bitcoin Core" (which isn't even a currency), etc.
They pretend they didn't fork from Bitcoin (whic is very, very frowned upon in Open Source community), they use Bitcoin.com and up until recently  twitter handle, along with a ton of other shady business practices that would be illegal in most other settings but they take advantage of the fact that...:
* Bitcoin is not a trademark brand, which makes it susceptible to brand theft
* Bitcoin is Open Source which means anyone is allowed to fork it and make it better (or worse, as the case may be)
* Bitcoin has no leader, and nobody in charge of public relations to set the record straight with authority
* Cryptocurrencies aren't intuitive (often not even to tech savvy people) which makes it easy to prey on people who just want to invest without spending the time taking courses and lectures or self teaching
* Bitcoin is owned by the public which gives everyone as much legal right as anyone else to choose the future direction of Bitcoin
* Bitcoin has a whitepaper but the term Bitcoin isn't explicitly defined anywhere, and they use this as an attack vector by pretending that Bitcoin refers to an immutable, abstract idea about a means of money transfer defined in a whitepaper, rather than the open-source community-led currency that Satoshi gave to the world.

It's not a phenomenon limited to the wealthy. As a kid I refused to run Windows on my computers and would only run Linux operating systems.

No, it's backed by the **promise** for production power and assets.
There are no production powers and assets waiting for you at a bank to convert your money into. There are production power services and asset products that you can purchase **with** your USD, but that's a circular argument if you're proposing that's what backs the USD.
Edit: in fact, if we want to get technical, it's backed by a promise for ~98% of your share of last years production powers and assets. So it's not even backed by a promise for the full amount.

The current currencies in the US and Canada are both tied to nothing other than faith (it's not a promise for gold, it's just a promise that it's worth something). I assume the same is true in most developed countries at this point. Those are devalued year over year because they're backed by belief alone, but if a currency is backed by moose antlers it will serve just as well as a currency backed by gold.

Normally I agree, but this is a pretty elaborate and well executed scam. They have a Reddit sub, the Twitter handle and the .com domain, and they do an excellent job making it seem like bch is the "real" bitcoin on their site and wallet.

I honestly don't see how anyone intelligent with a shred of integrity can think it's ok to do that.

The fact that you're trying to create this Bitcoin "Core" narrative just shows that you still don't understand what Bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is an open source project, you can fork it but then you're no longer "Bitcoin". You're a fork who shares a history with Bitcoin. A fork of Bitcoin is no more "Bitcoin" than if you were to fork literally any other project in the world. You can call it a fork of Bitcoin, but it's not "Bitcoin" or a "type of Bitcoin" unless it works with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core is a wallet. You're allowed to talk about wallets on this sub. So what's your problem? What are you specifically arguing? Discussing alt-coins doesn't belong on this sub and you know that, so what are you arguing if not that?

I suggest you follow your own advice and reread the comments in the thread leading up to your comment to understand why I say forking Bitcoin is a variant but you're still missing the point in your original comment.

I'm still concerned about any single bank banning it, especially if it's a bank that I have business with, which is a large number of them. It's none of their business where I want to move my money.

If you tell ANYONE how much bitcoin you own, thugs will spend the time researching until they can dox you, pay for a flight out to wherever you live, stalk you for a while to get your schedule, use a clairvoyant to know which device you keep your bitcoin on, intercept you at a weak point in your day while you're near that device, point a gun at your head, pray to god that you don't have multi-sig and that you actually have access to your funds personally and immediately, use a lie detector to ensure that you tell them the truth about that, use the same lie detector to make sure that you don't have multiple wallets with more hidden elsewhere, and then force you to transfer your bitcoin to their address.
edit: added the very important lie detector, I forgot that at home one time and we almost didn't secure our funds from the last guy
Edit2: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger!! And 666 satoshis, wow. �� ��

I'm just saying you're assuming a lot of things going a very specific way. There's no harm in telling people how many bitcoin you have. None at all. The harm is in not storing your bitcoin properly.
If people said "Rule  - learn how to store your bitcoin on your own device, and properly" I'd be on board. But this paranoia over telling people how many you have is just fucking hilarious.

1. 10 unverified bitcoin
2. You could probably dox me, doesn't mean I don't know wtf I'm doing, it just means I know what to be afraid of and what not to be afraid of
3. IF he uses the same username
4. Phishing might MIGHT get you into their computer or phone, but you still need the key


I call BS on those "stories", chances are their roommate stole it from them and didn't even know about their reddit posts.
