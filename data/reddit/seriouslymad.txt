well the good news is the US dollar will always and forever be the most value, used and normal king of currencies. It'll be a 100 years before a war is launched that can pry control of the Federal Reserve from the rothchilds (it's not a government owned or run operation) to bury the dollar. 
Blood in the streets before USD is gone.

We can't. It's hard to understand and makes no sense no matter how you slice it.
In the article is says $1 equals about 15,000 sats.. when? yesterday? an hour ago? How about 10 days from now? Could be 24,923 sats... could be 9,000 sats.
Price fluctuates. Never stays the same.  .25btc, .5 btc .75 btc 1.00 btc. is will be used, IF the price ever stabilizes (it won't)

Shorting. 
It's the only way to make money in crypto now. It's deceased. NSA / CIA control the blockchain, manipulate it. They've found a way with all the BTC they've stolen from cartels, MT Gox etc.. (Shut up, they can do whatever they want when they want and you cannot stop them with magical elegant sentences of logic.)
When it's all over (soon) I plan on buying Reddit with my profits and deleting Buying back in at $200 a BTC won't be an issue since it's basically free at that point with all the money I've made and as I'll be shorting again at $50 to finish the saga... 
Careful laughing. Especially when you're holding 5,000+ BTC and it's worth dogs hit. Short now or eat Ramen. (I made as shirt.)

will be $0 WELL BEFORE it's all mined. In fact it won't ever be completely mined because there won't be an incentive to even mine it. 
USD will remain king. I know this isn't the popular fantasy for those that avoid living in reality but facts are facts.  No government will allow it's slaves to become powerful and wealthy majority. That is too risky. they will rise up and overthrow. 
If BTC was going to be important it would be worth a lot more , stop crashing, stop being manipulated by CIA / NSA / MT Gox. etc.. and more people would be millionaires. It's simply not going to happen. Ever. 
You wake up, you work 80+hours a week to survive. That's the only path forward. (Or winning the lottery. hold your breath)

"shaking" "weak hands" - this is just more of the same. It will always be more of the same. Price cannot and will not go up if they're always playing these games.
BTC will never see $10k again, will never see 9K again. I know this isn't what you want to read. People prefer happy and beautiful lies over hard truths. It's sad that facts and reality no longer matter in this timeline

Without USD Bitcoin has no place in America though. What am I missing? You can't spend BTC in America, and if you don't have USD then you're not rich. 
I mean you can have a good personality and a hot wife, and great kids, that kind of rich, but they won't stick around if you're poor carrying around BTC you can't spend.

Taxation is theft. Period. If we deal in crypto, it ends in crypto and the IRS can go fuck itself every day for a 1,000 years.   
I would have recommended just paying for the house in Crypto. Have the realtor take the payment in crypto, negotiate from there. Crypto to Crypto =  No tax .

Price is all that matters. If you're already a  then leave the sub. go work on the blockchain and make yourself useful. Because currently. You're not. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:50:49
It's not. 
USD is and will remain king. 
Crypto is mostly useless now that the CiA / NSA control most of the blockchain and Mt. GoX. 
The price has been manipulated and stabilized at that 6500 mark. If they could tank it, they would, eventually they will. 
Blockchain tech belongs and is owned by the Government. The days of magic internet money is over. 
USD will be converted to blockchain and that'll be the end of it. You'll be able to pay your higher taxes, much faster. They'll be able to garnish your wages and steal your money much faster and you'll never. Ever. be able to stop them.

So far it looks like USD is still king, has stability, can be used anywhere. Crypto died in 2017.  Price continues to plummet and people \*only\* care about USD &amp; Price. NSA / CIA have control. they said "NO!"
@_date: 2019-03-01 00:30:46
I agree to a point. If they just supported the top 5, and stopped there (adjusted as MC fluctuated) and put more time into security, this stuff wouldn't happen.

People only want BTC to US dollar. 
You can downvote for being honest, and telling the truth and that's fine.
It's great that you can skip all the intermediary issues, blah blah but then there you stand, holding a useless thing (BTC) that's worth maybe $5,000 and in 10 min it's worth $5100 or less who knows.
Unless [Overstock.com]( starts a local delivery service, opens up a gas station, grocery store, DMV, Electric Company, IRS and everything else you need to live life.. 
Crypto useless guys.. it's dying 2018 killed it. US dollar still more valuable and versatile and everyone will accept it. 
That's easy. Not Bitcoin.

Everything has changed in 2018. Wallstreet is involved the CIA and NSA control crypto and it's never going to go return to the prices we saw. It's over kids.
Yes 1 BTC = 1 BTC but that literally means less than my dick on your mouf ....  who will care when 1 bTC equals  less than $1.00 US?  that's when you all are all crying and sobbing. GTFO out of crypto eat air sammiches. kiddos.

Baseless hope it what keeps the whales rich. Unfortunately crypto is dead. If you buy, you're making someone else rich because it's only getting lower. The shorts are piling up and $4500 is incoming soon.

without USD crypto fails. It's useless in America because no one accepts for anything meaningful.

The current battery tech is pitched and sold in a very misleading way.
It's important to understand you get two choices.  Neither of which allow you to remain "off grid" permanently ." unless you want to spend $30,000 and have the cells buried underground or stored somewhere in your garage.
You either get:
Battery Storage - Use when your electric rates are higher (peak usage) and instead of buying excess power from your electric company, you just pull your battery.
Battery Backup - Use when your power fails - you'll get maybe 4 breakers / outlets to choose from.
There isn't a truly "off grid" solution yet and the worst battery to date is the Tesla. SolarCity / Tesla really fucked up the Solar Industry. Don't be fooled.
Sonnen, Enphase, iDemand and LG all make better options.
Hope this helps you when the time is right.
