I'd put in a limit order to sell at around the 85-100 range. I wouldn't want to mess around with trying to get the better deal during heavy traffic.

Realistically, Bitcoin's value could look like Amazon's stock value if owners don't adapt to these attacks and sellings. I could imagine the value going up again, but what happens when we have another day like this? Is everyone going to play this game toget rich until GOVT comes in to protect the big losers?
@_date: 2013-08-06 18:36:29
My information is still under review too. Hopefully they can start sometime this week.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:10:27
I need me a BTC troll account.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:26:27
I don't understand how someone would want to buy once they're online. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:05:38
How about speculative crash topics stop being made? All this negativity keeps potential buyers on the outside and keeps owners at the edge of their seat ready to sell at the first glimpse of a drop in value.

Filing your taxes should be fun! ;)
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:46:33
Great. 
As if their slow trading site wasn't bad as it was. Anyone have good experience with BTC-e?
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:08:27
Taking a look at bitfloor's data on clarkmoody, it is full of sketchy asks and bids of small amounts that are lowering the price. It's been going on since yesterday.
Either someone is driving the price to the ground to buy more or destroy stability. Take a look for yourselves. I wouldn't be surprised to see DDoS attacks today to finish off BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:35
There's some hefty sized sell orders from MTGOX, but at the same time there are a lot of buy orders. It's going to to dip, but looks like it will recover with the influx of buyers getting the low prices they were waiting for.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:30:28
Ugh. I didn't think at all and sold my BTC instead of buying. I'm kicking myself right now!
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:50:32
The fact is a majority of people won't use BTC to purchase things. They just want to make money off the price swings. Complain about it all you want, but it is not going to change it anytime soon unless we reach a point where there are only small shifts in price.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:49:24
It can be helpful to use clark moody and look at how the prices are being manipulated (when they are) to see which way they are going.
However, some people buy in bulk amounts through regular market orders and this can cause prices to rise or drop quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:16:33
Why was it overvalued?
The amount of holders of BTC isn't even near the top. The value should get higher. The drop happened because people saw 270 and figured it couldn't higher and cashed out. 
Now that it's low again, all those that missed the first train will jump on and probably create another new high.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:42:03
The damage may be done. Even if those that are contributing to the DDOS are doing it to buy low, there may not be any big time buyers for a while because of the lack of stability. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:51:51
No one knows a single thing unless they are a billionaire lounging with other billionaires that are ready to manipulate the system one way or another. Most of us are in the same boat as you or were aware that prices were about to drop hard.
You can either: 
1.sell and suck up the losses
2.sell and buy more BTC for cheap (risky)
3.Hold and hope prices go up (risky)
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:12:02
Was waiting for a drop back to 160 all day and it never came.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:01:29
Bitfloor is also down.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:23:34
Make sure to explain to her that it's just not you that got screwed (if Bitfloor doesn't pull through). That should shave some time off the lecture.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:48
Yes, that's one way that this could tip.
However, what about those that saw BTC spike to $270 and felt that it was too late to jump in. Now prices are low, and although it does appear riskier, it can also lead to others buying in to hope for an even higher spike.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:04:03
Are you oblivious to what the exchange sites are updating about the situation? They are getting slammed with DDoS attacks. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:46:20
The only reason the 266 price was unwarranted is because of the shady trading to drive the price up. However, the price itself shouldn't be seen as a figure that BTC can't achieve naturally with an influx of new users.
It may never reach that number again because of the instability of exchanges and volatility of the value, but had exchanges been better equipped for these problems who knows what the warranted price could be. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:18:57
I see the trolls have come out from under the bridge.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:58:52
Trades aren't going through either for some. Sorry, but you will probably have to sit out for a while until this cools over for a bit. It sucks, but it is affecting everyone.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:20:01
Yeah, my limit order is gone too. I would cancel, but I'm afraid that would place my funds in some kind of limbo to never be seen again. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:07:23
That's what I understood from it.
I hope their security is in check. I'd hate to see their user base compromised because they're not allowing them to withdraw their BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:51:00


@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:30
Same exact thing happened to me about 5 minutes ago. BTC placed on hold.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:43
BTC-e and Bitfloor are also getting a heavy dose of DDoS. Whoever is behind this wants everyone to lose faith in BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:58:45
Coincidently, Bitfloor is down too. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:10:42
They claim that the funds are safe and that ACH verification is backlogged (3 days). I'd set it up ASAP.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:34:34
Crazy that this happened as the price of BTC was starting to rapidly increase from 55--&gt;70. It happened in about 5 minutes, and then they got hit with a DDoS.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:05:31
I don't want to be a sensationalist, but it looks like Bitcoin will lose the confidence of any serious investors wanting to buy in and of vendors wanting to accept it as a currency.
If the DDOS attacks are being done to drive the prices down for the culprits to buy BTCs themselves, they might have done more harm to themselves in the process.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:42:26
If you charge for services you will make a lot of day traders happy since they can claim it as a deductible in their taxes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:02:37
How can there be any debate anymore? 
Bitfloor has gone down about 3-4 times today for extended periods. Oddly enough, the latest one happened around the same time MtGox and BTC-e went down to similar attacks. Bitfloor has been dead for more than an hour.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:29:28


I can only imagine what kind of thrilling things you guys do outside of work.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:28:53
I sent mine for review/approval about 5 minutes after trading ceased. I was ready to roll 2 days later. 
I'm just waiting for the funds to hit my bank now.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:21:36
I think the majority of BTC holders are involved in order to profit. When the price appears sustained for a couple of days, I'm guessing they sell in bulks to profit and drive the price down. Then they buy in bulks at a low price. 
Avg. BitJoe sees the price steadily dropping and jumps ship to avoid losses and/or to buy in again at a cheap price as well. All while the individuals that want BTC to succeed can't help but facepalm at the volatility.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:36:21
I completely agree with you.
One Bitcoin is already beginning to look too pricey (160-165 for a single coin). For those that want to actually use the currency and are not trying to play the exchange are most likely concluding that the ceiling might be near.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:22:18
Funny thing is when it's back up it might actually spark a high volume of buys.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:08:25
Wow. I was hoping to move there from Bitfloor also.
Anyone hear anything good about bitstamp? Seems to have a lot of users trading there also.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:18:10
It looks like they took it down themselves in order to fix some issues with sales and buys.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:28:12
It's definitely gone. OP might be on to something.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:33:32
I've seen worst decisions (MTGOX) be made. If they posted this on their site, there would be no doubt that people would be selling off and taking all their money out in a hurry.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:06:35
Definitely an attack. Clarkmoody is down.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:53:15
I placed another limit order (sell) of a specific amount for a specific price to see if it would go on the market data tab. First I refreshed, and sure enough the limit order was gone. Then I went to the Market Data tab and it showed up there.
The sale of that amount processed about a minute or 2 in and it was gone from the Market Data section.
I haven't been funded cash and the BTC still shows up as being held on my overview.
