Or you could address the evidence like a grown adult. Whatever floats your boat.

The article says nothing of the sort. Either your reading comprehension skills are inadequate, or you are simply using a strawman argument to avoid dealing with the evidence presented in the article.
Either way, it is a shame.

You would be surprised. [Very surprised](
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:48:50
Nice strawman.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:37:18
Be honest: you didn't even read the article, did you?

Exactly, which is why they asked the r/bitcoin community for assistance in selecting charities to receive donations -- or, at least, they *claimed* to want that assistance.

This is bitcoin-related in the same way that [the Pineapple Fund's announcement]( is bitcoin-related.
The Pineapple Fund's largest donation so far has been to GiveDirectly. If you do some digging you will find that GiveDirectly is funded by money Google, Facebook and eBay.
And what is this money for? To spread 'microfinance' facilities (i.e. **DEBT**) to poor Africans.
What is going on here?

Oh really. Have you looked at the [overwhelming evidence]( that the Pineapple Fund is donating a large portion of its funds to organisations which are explicitly aiming to install and promote **Orwellian technology**?
I would encourage people to do a little digging before getting caught up in warm fuzzy feelings. Bitcoin was supposed to be about getting *away* from **Big Brother**, not welcoming it with open arms.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:39:22
It was [insert entity here] that made bitcoin and now bitcoin is helping make big brother.
Don't believe me? See the [evidence]( for yourself.

So basically you need help doing *everything*, those who help you will receive no money for their time/effort, and the end result will be a website which lists charities who accept bitcoin (solving a problem they don't actually have, since they would need to convert the bitcoin to dollars to use them anyway).
Good luck with that.

Speaking of Roger Ver, what do you make of his recent comments concerning Tether? Given that he has worked with Bitfinex/Tether in the past, his 'I don't know' seems rather strange to me. It seems other people are [starting to connect the dots]( as well.

Yeah but at the end he falls onto the 'up' escalator.
He is going to go back to the peak.
His balls might be sore, he might be a little embarrassed that you could see the panic on his face as he fell, but he will be okay.
Everything is going to be okay :)
(Who am I kidding, we're f'ed guys, truly f'ed. They [tried to warn us]( and we didn't listen).
