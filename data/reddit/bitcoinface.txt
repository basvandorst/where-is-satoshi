Blatant may have been a bad word choice, because I meant that it is blatant to anyone who knows anything about bitcoin. I'm not concerned with the tone or opinion of the article, just irritated that the facts (3 of the most important facts!) are incorrect.
I suppose is "Glaring" is better - "Yahoo! Finance - Glaring Misinformation about Bitcoin"

I just did it out of curiousity, and it only took me about a minute tops. You have to log into two websites... some copypasta... BOOM! Instant credit in your steam account (with gyft points as a bonus!)
+1 hapemask thanks for this

To be fair, your original post did not indicate any copies or backups were made.

"Or, Bitcoin's technology could be hacked, allowing Bitcoins to be stolen from their owners.
Or someone could make counterfeit Bitcoins.
Or the anonymous creators of Bitcoin, who reportedly still own lots of Bitcoins, could decide to create a lot more Bitcoins, thus debasing the value of each unit of the currency."
3 opposites, directly opposing some of the core foundations and strengths of Bitcoin. :S
Any thoughts about uninformed media outlets scaring the masses via likely unintentional misinformation?

[Lack of funding]( you say...
I will say that coinbase used to be the easiest, but has since become just as difficult as the others and less useful (due to BTC valued at time of bank xfer clearing.)

So definitely

You paid for the upgrade, but received an unupgraded 5GH/sec unit? If so, same here! Did you follow up on it? PM me w/details as I'm curious what happened on your side.

Only thing I can think about LTC price increase is that it provides a way for people wanting to purchase BTC with USD another way in via LTC.

I used to use mtgox via dwolla, but didn't like how many questions dwolla began asking (asked for SSN after asking for scanned DL) You can always try [coinbase]( for instant market price purchases, but many people have been having trouble buying as many coins as they want with coinbase as well. There's also [localbitcoins]( depending on how you want to buy.
If you do go the coinbase route, don't necessarily pay attention to the error message when it says the limit has been reached try again at 6AM. The error message used to say the 24h rolling limit has been reached, and is not time specific. Since this was the case, I've had better experience buying smaller BTC amounts via coinbase, even if I get the "reached the maximum 24h limit" message.

I suggest mining with a pool to immediately realize mining gains, and well.. since you're here, [Mt. Red]( of course!
As far as actually mining and what software to use- I'm assuming you're looking to mine with your GPU(s)? I'd recommend an easier GUI based miner as opposed to tweaking command line if you're looking to just get the hang of it first.
A decent guide I used is [here](
Best of luck!
