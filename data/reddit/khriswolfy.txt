Man fuck those thieves. Couldn't they have stolen the tv or your pc or some shit? I think these days it's best to hide your bitcoin related stuff in a decoy trash bin, put some jizz-filled socks over it so you're sure not even the feds will search in it.

Yeah someone fucked up and it seems that "add" is approximating everything after the comma to 0. So that 0.01 or whatever bitcoin (which is what you'd actually get) was approximated to 0 lol

A lot of people in my country (roughly 4 million out of 19 total) have moved abroad to work for better wages and send money back home to their families. Since most use Moneygram/Western Union where fees are quite high, this is at least an area where the potential could be massive.

I am very new to bitcoin. Roughly a month since I invested about as much as you lost there. One of the first things I did was heavily research everything on Electrum and about 2 weeks in I bought a Ledger just to be extra certain.

Artificially putting lost coins back into circulation thus increasing supply. Simple as that. 
But the trust in the system would plummet now that people see it worse than the Banking one. I mean, wasn't bitcoin supposed to fix the way banks emit money out of thin air? How do you think Bitcoin can hold up as a concept after a stunt like this ?

I mean this isn't wrong, is it? As long as more money is pumped into bitcoin, the price will go up.
If all the market ends to a dead stop today, the price will simply not increase as there's nobody buying anymore. If everybody starts selling, the price will go down and down until it's worthless.

By most people you probably mean the ones @ these forums. I can guarantee you most people barely know what bitcoin is and does, let alone that there are multiple other types of cryptos.
Heck I know a douzen people who invested into bitcoin the past month and don't even know current events in the crypto market nor anything about the existance of other cryptos. All they see and care is bitcoin (probably the reason why good ol Roger Ver wants his shitcoin be named Bitcoin)

Well in a civilized country that's what would happen, but that's totally opposite of what would happen in my country.

@_date: 2017-12-15 07:38:30
Yep, we even have several exchanges here that work since early 2013 and a few ATMS (it's kinda hard to open an exchange since few romanians have enough money to do so).
Now depending on how the big fish politicians here want deal with bitcoin, the regulations might come later rather than sooner. Romania isn't particularly known for adopting fast legislation, and when it does do that, it comes with a lot of (warranted) controversy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:39:19
Heard about it as early as 2012 when I was in highschool and I really wanted to buy some and even mine. Unfortunately my family was really struggling back then and we could simply not afford it. My PC was also way too crap to mine anything with it.
Now that I have a somewhat well paying job,I finally chipped in at 7900$ and then 8.5k and @ 14k. I will buy more since storing it in the bank with extremely low interest is not an option.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:23
Not in any particular danger even if I keep it on my windows 10 pc. It also has 2FA so I think it's relatively safe. I just wanted to make the transfer so I don't have to constantly worry about it, but I guess I can wait till the transactions go a bit down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:28
I mean, they were consistently getting 100k new users per day the past month or so and they already had the one of the biggest user base. I have never heard of a company dealing well with such a surge of new users in such a short ammount of time.
And there are way worse offenders like kraken or bitfinex.
Not trying to take anyone's side here, but I'd rather make an opinion of my own than anything.

What a bunch of BS. Yes each transaction is visible, but there's no way to attach it to a person unless you somehow get a hold of the device that holds the wallet. 
The silk road owner was found because he used the same username on different forums and were able to track his IP, and only after hacking into his own laptop where he held his wallets and transactions was when he was caught.
Now good luck doing the same with literally anyone outside of US.

Treat your ledger as a safe. You don't want to carry your safe with you everywhere you go....unless you're some drug lord worth billions, but even then it defeats the purpose.
Alternatively, keep a small part of your coins on a software wallet or even on an exchange (when you want to do fast transactions), and the bulk of your coins on the ledger.

ITT people using hindsight to appear clever, when they themselves would get their funds stolen just like the OP if they even got close to fucking with that kind of money.
Let's be honest here. If it's a briefcase with money, it can be stolen in only one way. From where you put it. With bitcoin you literally never know if anything is secure enough as these programs are well hidden even on machines that are scanned and re-scanned by thousands of softwares.
This is the reason people will not adopt bitcoin on a large scale. It's too technical, too complicated and it has way more ways to fuck you over for the smallest mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:23:13
So I want to send 0.12 bitcoins from Electrum to Ledger using a 200 sat/byte (roughly 15 dollars). Would it go through fast?

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:53:23
It seems that local/physical ATMS's are either scarce, or not working 24/7 like Banks do.
The truth is, It's more convenient and less expensive to just run an online exchange than bother with a physical network of ATM's that need maintenance and not get hacked/destroyed or something. 
Keep in mind that these ATM's are run by rather normal people who don't necessarily know stuff about banking and ATMS,so they might take extra precautions that can cause a lack of convenience.
In my city there's only 1 exchange that works Mon-Fri from 9-5 that has it's ATM run inside the facility, rather then outside through the wall so you can't use it outside working hours.
If bitcoin goes onto mass adoption, I think these issues will get fixed. But so far, as much as crypto and bitcoin seem to become more and more mainstream, they're still in their beginnings.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:35:06
You made a thread about bitcoin dropping in price 3 months ago and talked shit back then just as you do now. I guess in 3 more months you'll repeat the process and still be the only one who is actually butt hurt.

Really useful feature for a "currency" that aims for mass adoption....
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:27:37


According to who? You? Because that's the opposite of why bitcoin was created in the first place


Again, you're missing the point here


Plenty of folks had and have both the ability and the willingness to learn. Yet a small security flaw can mean your entire wallet can go byebye in some hackers hands.
When huge hacks happen on a daily basis with no way to ever recover the money back, that screams of a major flaw in the system itself.
You can call the environment as secure as Jesus christ, but it won't matter if handling it is not even close to that.
And this comes from someone who invested in bitcoin when it was dirt cheap, and still holding a major sum. Never had a single break-in.  But I'm not going to ever fool myself that crypto's are either safe or easy to use, no matter how much time I spend learning.
Edit: And it's ironic you call mass adoption nonsense, when it's the reason why the price goes up when it does. Every time it did, is because new blood came in.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:39:51

@_date: 2017-11-27 07:34:45
Here's the thing. If you plan to buy bitcoin from an exchange, you typically need to make a bank transfer or pay by debit card, which means through a bank.
If your "friend" has a lot of money, doing it through a bank means that the government will know and make an inquiry (since the bank is obligated to disclose this especially with large suns of money, but it depends on the country)
This leaves you with 2 options. Cash deposit at ATM's within the limit they set (like 15k euros where I am) or directly to another person who sells bitcoin (also cash).
In theory it can work as long as you don't deal with very large sums. But even so, a government/IRS inquiry (or whatever you call it in your country) can easily reveal IF they have a lead on your friend.

It's really simple. Was the bitcoin bought before or during the marriage? If it's the first, since it's a pre-marital asset it belongs solely to you. If it's the second...well, how much do you love and trust your wife? Because you might want to consult a lawyer if anything.

- manufacturing industries "slipped to other countries" obviously refers to outsourcing, which the US has been doing ever since the 1800s and through the 80's and 90's is when it went all crazy. By 95, it was already happening for at least half a decade at that point.
- technological powers in the hands of few &gt; so, how basically it always was? If anything, since then the general population has now more access to "awesome tech powers" than ever before.
- about questioning the authority &gt; if anything, America is now more political than ever. Just look at Trump, Obama, Bush and all the way back to Kenedy. There's people now in Trump's head more than ever before. That's been happening with Obama and Bush before. That's the exact opposite of "not being able to question authority". 
- AS for the rest of the statement, including the dumbing down and everything else....I mean the US went through the 70's and 80's for christ sake. I don't think it goes any lower than the coked up hippy age shit back in those days.
Not trying to bash or anything, but those comments make no sense.

Why does the crypto world insist on using these completely dumb, unprofessional terminologies? Dandelion protocol? For fucks sake and you're wondering why nobody takes this shit seriously.

There's two things wrong with this statement
1. Thinking that russians didn't invest in cryptos already (spoiler alert, they always have, it was never prohibited. Go check localethereum or localbitcoins and see how many russians there are there alone)
2. Thinking that your average russian will invest more than a few hundred dollars.....which is 1 month's worth of salary.
There's higher chance for the price to increase because people think russians will make it increase, than the russians themselves. And this will bring a slight bump at most.

Buying a car is one thing. Being left with several super cars for which you have no more cashflow to maintain, repair and use is a whole other ball game. If he sells them, he's basically at a loss because cars lose value the second you take em out the factory door..

If that's the general approach to crypto investing, then good luck having a wide reach. Hint: it will never happen. Not when wiring fucking money to buy the coins is a gamble in itself.

This was literally said from 20k all the way to 6. Bitcoin has no bottom, nor a roof. The slightest fud still tips the market for christ sake.

My bank account has 0 fees on it. Like literally, 0. The only requirement is to have 450 bucks roll through it every month (which imho is no biggy since I roll tens of thousands of dollars through it every month) Every transaction, deposit, withdrawal and transfer is free, but most important, fast and secure.
I don't have to fear having some hidden malware that steals all my stuff. I can chargeback. I have insurance on it, again guaranteed by state legislature. There's no way Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency can compete with that.
These high transfer fees I keep hearing about for regular bank accounts must really be something prevalent in countries like the US, because most of the EU even made it illegal for banks to user certain fees (like account administration)

Whenever I hear about all this self destruct thing I imagine if I were a criminal I'd randomly wake up one morning, get my coffee, completely forget about the self destruction and randomly lose all my shit.
I would not be a great criminal....

Yeah because that's what you want to do when your economy is collapsing. TO BUY SOMETHING A BIT LESS SHIT THAN WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE.
My dude, are you not realizing how dumb that sounds? YOU"RE STILL LOSING YOUR WEALTH you moron. Literally investing in peanuts would be a better for someone in the situation.
And no, bitcoin is not a good store of value. Not when it's more volatile than a fucking molotov cocktail.

Short term volatility. Check back at the end of the year and you'll see the whole market has moved up on average.

I say the fair value of bitcon is "insert my current investment x 1000".

You're missing the point. This isn't about a "race of who ends to the bottom last", but how to keep the already low amount of money to not lose it's value even more.
tldr: they are both bad choice imho

That's a third of the income. If they lost 1 mil someone would be pissed. Almost a billion is not something you lose and be fine with.

Since it costs a couple hundred bucks to get, i doubt anyone thinks of it being "free". Unless you're talking about pirating it which is a whole different thing.

When you're dealing with poverty, you don't get to afford "the long run".
