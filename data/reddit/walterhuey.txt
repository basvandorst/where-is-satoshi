I am not a fan of fiat and other state printed currencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly inflationary and based on thin air. Unbacked Fiat Assets facilitate almost all current unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....

I have it in an ETF, and the account i have Them on i pay 30% tax on 1,5% of its value. Hence it gets really cheap
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:43:43
This is my taste, Love 90' jdm, what you planing? r34? Evo? Rx7, nsx, mk4 Supra? These are real cars,
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:32:10
Well, in my country we have BTC ETF that you can buy. I do the major buying with the ETF, cuz I pay 30% tax on 1,5 percent of my portfolio. Hence the tax rate is very low.
Say you bought 10 btc for 1000 USD, then you sold it when price is 100k.
Buy: 10 000 USD
Sold: 1 000 000 USD
Profit 990 000 USD
Regular profit tax, 30% = 990 000*0,3= 297000 USD (Theft)
With my ETF it goes like this.
Total value 1 000 000 USD, 
Tax: 30% on 1,5% of total value. = 1000000*0,015*0,3 = 4500 USD in tax. 
Then a management fee for the ETF on like 1,5%
 =15000 USD
So i pay around 19500 usd in taxes and fees instead of 297000 USD in this example (not fees included).
Most countries does not have BTC ETF possibilites with these types of taxes of 30% of 1,5% of total value. Hence I can buy a lambo for what I save doing this.
But I do buy real btc aswell. Use ledger hardwallet. The time they sit on the exchange varies. When btc have reached much higher, like 500k+ i will go all in btc, to minimze bank involvement.
@_date: 2019-07-21 07:06:37

Damn, hate salt, sounds like a sweet ride

The biggest one are taxes and coporate profit in the climate field.
If you study co2 etc the claims that these global warming activists such as Greta Thunberg and Al Gore says co2 have,  you can pretty easily understand that it is much more complicated and there is no co2 work the way they say. 
It is mad how governments come up with new taxes with the co2 reason all the time. One of the most insane I've heard of is the raising of co2 tax in the Scandinavia country Sweden. So one of the powerplants in their capital resently said they shut down cuz it is to expensive. Hence the capital will have power shortage during the winter.
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:22:02
Well yes but actually no, it is not a car. No actual car have been made since 2007 with Evo 9 been the last one.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:16:29
I am, buy a some every month. When btc hit 50000 USD next year, and 1000 000 USD in a few years. The important is to buy as much as possible. I have 99% of all money in crypto. All the money that is left each month goes into btc
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:57:09
Well global warming is a scam, the science says it is not happening, but ww3 on the other hand. I beg the differ

C'mon AE86
@_date: 2019-07-25 09:01:24
Well I do,
@_date: 2019-07-25 07:31:00
I see, well the account I have it on does all the taxes automatically. I do not need to do anything. 
But If the xbt provider goes bankrupt, the money is gone. And of btc does not go up i Still need to pay 3% (not 2% i was wrong,) +2% inflation. So it goes down 5% each year, which is fine when btc goes up 1000%. But i am split, if I should go full BTC and sell the xbt or not.
@_date: 2019-07-20 14:50:05
R35 or R34?

Yeah but If no one is selling, then no one can buy it
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:12:10
I have not read everything ofcourse, the main reports are made for UN, IPCC. They are very bias and many UN scientists have quit because because of this. However doing science on the climate is hard. E.g. IPCC use 3 different methods to measure the average global temp, all 3 gets different results, the satellite measure say it have not gone up, they completely skip this. 
I can give you some quit stuff here. 
Around 1% are "Green House" gases of the atmosphere.
Around 97% of this is water vapor, around 2-3% is co2, 
96-97% of all co2 is not man made. 
Co2 makes up around 0,04% of the atmosphere.
Co2 have a higher density than the rest of the atmosphere, hence it falls down to earth.
When the earth gets warmer (e.g. because of the sun,) more co2 is release from the sea with have an ppm level of 10000. Not the other way around as activists say.
Co2 today in atmosphere is 412 ppm
600 million years records is 5000ppm
600 million average is 1000ppm.
Life want to have 2000-3000ppm (just like in tomato plant houses)
Life dies as 150-200ppm (happend around 300 million years ago)
Co2 have for around the last 200 million years had a steady decline. 
Earth is a living organism, everything changes all the time, it is naive to believe that humans can have such a big impact. This is not to say that we should abuse Earth. But today the science that (e.g. Paris agreement) is bias and run by money. The science is false. This is very wrong. Focus should be on making better science. Not rasing co2 taxes to try fix the issue. 
Btw all the taxes because of co2, is a well know method to not work to get rid of something.
@_date: 2019-07-25 07:45:09
Well it is an account type called ISK which every bank has in this country, most people stocks etc are all on this account. When you get your taxpaper it is already done, a computer did it for you.
@_date: 2019-07-25 07:08:36
Yes this in at an bank outside the US. Look up XBT provider. I think they where the first one with an btc ETF. When I bought btc ETF, they go and buy real btc so they are leveraged.  
Then I have them on a special account with 30% tax on 1,5% of total value. Plus 1,5 % to the ETF provider. 
So If i bought 10 btc for 1000 USD,
Sell it for 100 000 USD each.
Regular tax 30% is 297000 USD 
With the ETF I pay around 2%, 5% tax and 1,5 fee, of total value. Hence 20 000 USD. 
The amount saved in this example buys you a lambo.
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:03:08

I'been here for a few years here, remember the days under 1k btc. I've seen my Bitcoins drop 80% a few times. You gotta sit still. I never sell. 
If you cannot handle 80% drop you dont deserve a 1000 x gain.
@_date: 2019-11-26 08:29:00
What is it with reddit and not seeing 1m btc?
We are standing on the foot of a mountain of one of the biggest economic changes in mankind. 
Last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. 120 years from now.
There are extremely few Bitcoins. 
Bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars one day. But it doesnt matter. For when time is ready, you wont have to trade your bitcoin to fiat.

I have a few hundred USD in my bank, to buy groceries for this month. 10k in other physical "assets", more money in Bitcoin than most people ever will have.
If you had one shot, one oppotunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip? 
I am all in BTC, willing to lose it all, for the chance of winning it all. We have one shot at this, I am not missing it. People say you need to diversify your money. That is bullshit. You dont make it diversifying. You make it by laying it all one one card. You have to balls to do it?
In the future, I am not looking back at this time thinking I should have put more money at it. We live once, the worst thing that can happen is that I lose my BTC and becomes as broke as everybody else. 
Im taking this oppotunity of a lifetime, to have it all you need to risk it all. There is no way around it. In life the margin for error is so smal, one half a step to late or to early, you dont quite make it. One half a second too slown or to fast and you dont quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. I am taking every step, every second. Hunting every inch. I am not missing this. I am willing to fight and die for that inch. Because thats what living is, the six inches in front of your face. Now what are you going to do?
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:26:08

And  what else should I do?

Instead of having a time based model. S2F model, which means stock to flow. Stock is how much that is existing. Flow is how much added. For bitcoin är this is much for accurate way of predicting the future.

China is buying up entire Africa, there are living more than 1 million chinese in Africa. China is planing and locking down assets and resources to survive the rest of the century. In the meantime we in the west are focusing on identity politics and other non importants. 
Guess whos gonna win, my grandpa said 30 years ago just after China entered the market that they will dominate the world market, and take over. 
And probably they will. The entire western region will be dependent on Chinas resources. E.g. today 60% of all Cobolt is in Congo. All mined by childworkers. More or less owned by China, to make batteries to western car manufacturers.
