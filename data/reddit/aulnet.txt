It's so user friendly. I just downloaded it and I can sell stuff within a few minutes. It takes time for sellers to catch on to this, give it a year or two. 
Overall, I'm loving OB. The Devs deserve to get paid and I will definitely be donating as soon as I start selling items. I would like to thank them in advance. They stuck with it and made it happen, it'll be a great injustice if OB don't succeed.

Some say 100,000USD. While others say around 10,000USD. More recently, and with a little math behind it, 30,000USD.

Marijuana, for example, was/is banned by most of the world, but because there were always people who use marijuana, it assured the survival of the market for it.
What?! That's a terrible comparison!! That would be an extremely dishonest comparison. But we're not comparing--we're extracting the catalyst that keeps the subject of a world wide ban alive from the two. That catalyst is self-interest. 
Once a currency begin to destabilize it can destabilize through inflation. If we get to the point where Bitcoin destabilizes a currency, it has already tipped the scale. Here's where inflation come in. Since Bitcoin is gaining in value, it has to to be relevant to your question, the currency its destabilizing is inflating. Henceforth, a mass exodus to Bitcoin. Banning Bitcoin will not stop the inflation, there is nothing to replace the value vacuum left by the displacement of fiat currencies. It's all in Bitcoin now. An example is Zimbabwe, a testament to runaway inflation. Their national currency was phased out and the US dollar filled that vacuum. In the scenario that you suggest, is it probable that Bitcoin may as well fill that vacuum in our theoretical country?
Ok, you don't like that answer. Further: 
A large portion of the population are already in possession of bitcoins at this point. If you were Paul Krugmen, would you want to exclude this huge portion of your population from your economy? And if you did, do you think those with Bitcoin will resort to eating shit to survive over night? Because their wealth is now worthless? What would the self-interest of these people suggest they do? I'm sure you can think of something.
The Euro is trying to be what Bitcoin is.

I had the same thought in 2009 when I first heard about bitcoin and stayed away from it for this same line of logic. I was convinced that was the only outcome. At the time I was a young guy in my 20's who knew nothing of bitcoin and was just pulling scenario where it will fail out of my ass and absorbed it like they were facts. 
Point is, Mr. Kaspersky share the same sentiment as almost every bitcoin skeptics, it is not new or original. They're simply assumptions spoken like facts pulled out from the deeper regions of ones asshole.

@_date: 2015-12-10 17:24:57
Yes, but that issue, specifically, has been the subject of debate since forever ago on these forums. He never said bitcoin will fail, matter fact, if you watch it again, he praises the blockchain. Nobody outside of the bitcoin circle will put their reputation on the line for bitcoin if they have any kind of reputation to begin with. If you pay close attention, most are very dodgy when asked about bitcoin, nobody wants to be wrong on the record.

Lmao. That's replaciny one poison with another. Coinbase will be obsolete within 5 years if they keep shutting down accounts. The combination of them shutting down accounts  and the banks shutting down accounts that touch coinbase have built up a lot of animosity.

They can potentially be a distraction. Should an event arise where they are caught in a scandal, the ignorance of the media will claim bitcoin CEO caught in scandal.

With all the sub prime borrowers filing for bankruptcy, they couldn't loan the money out. There were actually deflation at the time so they weren't printing.

Where's that blockchain voting I've been hearing about?

Have you ever been to the hospital in pain and all they ask you is," do you have insurance?"

Implementing changes to the program, as you can see, is very dramatic and troublesome. Especially for something that does not have central planning.
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:14:23
It can be both. It can be used as a currency as is or outside of being a currency, the blockchain extend its use beyond that purpose. Therefore, it can be called a commodity. Bitcoin itself is not a commodity, it has no value outside of being a currency, but the underlying technology that allow bitcoin to do what it does have many uses. Thus, it's both a currency and a commodity.
I know that was repetitive but do you understand?

@_date: 2014-09-29 21:59:26

@_date: 2014-12-11 06:31:24
what are the fees?
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:18:42
i wish there was something i can do to help. these assholes have no respect for anyone.
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:41:53
what you just said was exactly what everyone thought at first. nothing new or interesting really.
@_date: 2014-09-24 02:46:43
does it matter what anyone say at this point? 
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:39:20
there should be a video. everyone is talking about that video and nobody is pointing people to where that video is. yourself included.
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:12:59
Jesus, they're doing everything they can to stop people from putting a meal on the table with these regulations. WTF is wrong with these people.
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:59:17
Shhhh. They are shilling for us. Look at how they worded it. I'm sure if they wanted to make bitcoin look bad they could have said "with hacker Overlords"
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:55:16
preach on brotha
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:07:08
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:11:26
so what you're saying is, when we achieve light speed, we can still do transactions? nice.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:26:40
How the fuck do these guys sleep at night running a business on that kind of ethic.
@_date: 2014-08-14 03:54:17
hehehe you should see mine /flex
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:51:51
whatever happens, its a great experience. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 02:30:34
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:07:22
lol foe reel doe
@_date: 2014-08-22 06:53:38
Just what I'm looking for. Now we need a grocery store that accept bitcoins and a used car dealership that accept bitcoins. And we set for life.
@_date: 2014-10-30 22:19:07
this is good news. why are so many people threatening to commit suicide?
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:06:36
if people would just stop using bootlegged microsoft OS, i think that would be enough.
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:50:38
it was surreal, never thought i'd see bitcoin on TV.
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:47:05
circle operate under the same regulations. they will get it eventually.
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:10:15
meh. he's just angry. people say stuff like that all the time.
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:38:56
Everything I have.

Must be tough to advocate a subject the world don't understand. Tougher to back it with your reputation. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:55:21
Vbtc charges too much.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:30:10
it takes a little effort to understand what bitcoin really is. people who are interested in bitcoin purely for making more money won't stick around. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:41:13
this is true. a lot of people still think bitcoin is "illegal."
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:32:49
Do we have enough computing power currently in the bitcoin community to destroy jp Morgans crypto currency on the first day of release if they are to succeed?
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:42:50
a lot of scams use the name of that site 
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:54:37
we better get to mining.......
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:34:21
so, how did it go? did u get it?
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:13:47
can't wait to see full documentary.
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:11:12
if they don't do this, i'm afraid there won't be a coinbase left to blame.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:28:39
Reason: phishing URL when i clicked on the link.
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:22:39
i hope NJ state gets hacked and have all their files and emails doxxed.
@_date: 2014-08-14 03:57:44
Maybe he is anticipating the growth of bitcoin users. 1 step back two step forward kinda growth.
@_date: 2014-08-24 04:33:46
so the question remain; will it be the cia or the nsa that will be the first intel agency to accept bitcoins...........
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:44:05
he doesn't like gambling so he blacklisted those addresses. am i missing something? 
if i've learned anything, when they start banning things, shits about to be runned by a tyrant.
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:45:17
enough of this nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 04:23:59
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:05:52
i have two warmachines sitting here collecting dust, the only thing not viable are his products.
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:36:08
foe reel doe, cut the crap
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:14:23
ahhh the publicity these people get from naked pics is too much to pass up i guess.
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:12:38
i dont know but i do know people have a distrust of poor people. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:27:04
You must forgive us sire
@_date: 2014-12-25 13:11:47
crypto currencies are the only sensible next step in evolution for money until we use planets and star systems as store of wealth.
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:30:48
this is nice but i can't find their address to donate....
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:54:04
he'll wake up to see his face on a bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:06:24
if bitcoin succeed, they have nothing to gain, of course they'll hate it and want it to fail. nobody wants to feel left out.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:42:01
what does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:09:45
LOL you're an asshole dude.
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:29:40
would you rather use a currency backed by the common people of the world or a fiat backed by a/1 nation?
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:46:08
this seem like an attempt to comfort. the price barely moved.
@_date: 2014-08-14 03:03:48
Sounds fair to me.
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:49:36
$327 and nobody woke me up, some community you guys are.
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:55:56

You've been lied to. Everything actually move at the speed of continental drift.
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:24:16
i love this! 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:50:02
blasphemy, that's not what i seen with my own eyes in the movies.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:11:24
do you own any bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-09 23:37:46
i like starcraft and LoL because they're exciting to bet on and it makes the game so much more interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:39:45
Mr. Robinson is incapable of being wrong and he's never been wrong. We're doom guys. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:57:58
Direct them to BTCjam, they cna make their bitcoin work for them in the comfort of their own home.
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:45:46
lol thats because bitcoin is kinda like a conspiracy. have you tried explainining it to anyone lately?
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:43:42
I think you can do that with ethereum....
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:47:42
lol it'll help bring those responsible to justice more efficiently but it won't stop currency manipulation. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:50:34
i told you it was like wow gold......
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:09:27
It may free us from economic slavery. Not complaining, I know there are hungry and dying children. Just saying it could be better.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:03:34
lol it's funny because that's how the general population react to almost everything. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 02:16:03
but can you still spend it?
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:47:53
it does help attract people, yes.
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:35:28
it should but governments. a collection of people who enforces fish and game laws while their population is starving to death.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:47:42
haha looks like someone is shitting bitcoins
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:07:44
hahaha im willing to bet ALL my bitcoin the OP works for coinbase and a few coinbase shills in here to cheer him on. don't pull this stunt, anybody with a brain can see right through it. cut the crap.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:12:24
Good job being proactive. Cheers, wish I can tip you.
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:07:17

@_date: 2014-12-14 13:38:57
i don't understand this hatred toward banks. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:49:50
well, i guess if you're going to dream, it may as well be ludicrous 
@_date: 2014-11-08 20:21:14
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:26:16
that is still to be seen.
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:22:24

@_date: 2014-08-23 17:08:22
Trust me, Coinbase can careless about what you do. They're more interested in businesses, we're small frys. I can see circle catering to private users.
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:55:21
withdraw it into the blockchain wallet you just created
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:46:52
of course i would but i still need to eat.
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:20:15
it's a good store of wealth because unlike gold and cash, you can prove you do in fact own that much wealth anywhere in the world at anytime. it can be used in space on a galactic+ scale. cannot be counterfeited. what more do you want?
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:57:01
still waiting for buttcoin link........
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:39:17

@_date: 2014-12-14 01:12:11
I think you mean miners. You do mean miners, yes?
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:48:39
will the blockchain have enough computing power to answer the question to life the universe and everything in the far future?
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:58:21
how are we so sure he took it?
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:40:02
we have a mistrust of generosity on this sub.
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:44:13
It can be a toy currency, yes. Kinda like the real life version of WoW gold. The character knows his gold is safe in his inventory, and exactly how much. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:43:58
wow that takes a lot of discipline
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:16:31
it would be nice if you could buy htings directly from changetip.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:24:11

@_date: 2014-08-16 21:28:16
I don't think they realize the magnitude of the peoples reaction to such a scam. Especially Americans.
@_date: 2014-11-02 03:10:44
i don't care what anyone says, call me a pervert. that is pure natural beauty.
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:55:24

miners are safe still.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:16:47
how would one collect a tip?
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:51:32
That is just it lol. Nobody wants to invest in bitcoins to make you rich. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:26:35
If Andreas can make a dumb schmuck like me understand bitcoin, I'm sure he'll make the Canadian senate see Jesus. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:49:35

@_date: 2014-10-10 00:54:32
so accepting it or not is optional. whats wrong with that?
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:55:55
how did you buy your coins?
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:01:20
calm down, we're just adjusting the price for newcomers.
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:56:07

@_date: 2014-08-24 04:59:11
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:37:57
i think it will. by about 50 bucks.
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:56:01
this must be the leader of the buttcoin clan. he HAS to be paid to do this, there is no other explanation. ones hatred for a currency should not lead him on a crusade against it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:50:27
I'm  miner and I demand this be fixed!!! J/k lol ill still mine regardless.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:43:17

people like that scammer give bitcoin a very bad name. assholes. i hope he gets caught and spanked by his parents.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:04:49
In sure Byrnes and his team of coders and attorneys know how and what to do. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:40:19
the email guy cant help, the chat bubble suggest i get a itune account then get the authy app then make an authy app then i can access my coinbase account. time to make a itune account and see if it work.
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:52:15
ok so they finally told me what the problem was. their 2fa partner was responsible for it. its funny cause they give everything to a 3rd party to store. if anything happens, they're not responsible pretty much. they sit back and collect the fee's from transaction. smart.
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:45:22
i don't think they brush their teeth. they work at home. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:10:41

@_date: 2014-10-06 02:55:47
there should be a btcjam app for homeless people where they transmit their cardboard sign in a 10 square mile radius. call it "hunger." if you have btc you can anonymously send them change for food if you're too shy to give with everyone looking. this way if they default, oh well.
@_date: 2014-10-13 01:06:26
it's still centralized and will inevitably fail. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:10:49
I don't know, exchanges are starting to scare people.

GAW ships their machines. but of the three i received from them, all 3 broke down after a few hour of operations. their fans stop working and it would stop hashing. GAW TRIED really hard to have good customer service, i'll givem that. their products are crap though.

@_date: 2014-11-28 04:37:18
lemme confirm this with the bitcoin CEO
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:47:45
i'm sure it'll go down quite a bit. i been waitin.
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:35:22
be nice if it didn't take so long to confirm.
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:27:03
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:21:03
That was weird. I clicked on the link, read 1-5 then asked the chat tab if it was legal to buy bitcoins from coinbase to sell on localbitcoins. I wasn't logged in but somehow they knew it was me that asked and sent me an email. How did they know it was me that asked?
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:59:02
"please pay us money" lol
hope this one gets picked up.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:18:42
so the internet didn't fail so that would mean bitcoin has to fail? in the end there can be only one?
@_date: 2014-08-26 01:51:36
lol they were anxious. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 03:16:00
I hear you man
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:16:41
have any of you ever played eve online? the bounty would get so big, whole star system went after a dude....
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:16:38
yeah I I got authy. now they're cancelling my order because the price just dropped. I googled that and it seems everytime bitcoins go down in prices, they turn on that automated order cancelling program and when you ask them why they'll just say fraudulent or whatever when you have your bank account and credit card linked to the account. they know exactly who you are and where you live. fraudulent, please.
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:48:21
still pretty unknown. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:50:38
you should ask UNICEF
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:10:47
i'm a small miner myself. after trying to sell a coin on coinbase the bank closed my account. i have no choice but to hold it until i'm SOL in which case i would have to sell it to eat. i pick up dog shit on the side for gas and electricity. i'll keep half of my miners running if bitcoin fall below 100.
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:12:08
I hated them at first, but after a week or two, you learn to like them. Especially the chat bubble.
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:19:08
no, that was just a bitcoiner shilling the buttcoiner.
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:18:05
she just googled "bitcoin is a scam" and made her decision based on that. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:22:41
and to think it used to be 5 cents per bitcoin lol
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:37:29

@_date: 2014-11-13 03:46:48

@_date: 2014-11-13 01:56:22
i just found out what a parsnip is today at the grocery store.
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:05:01
ahhh i see. you were concerned about electricity, i didn't think it would be an issue with something like a ras-pi.
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:07:26
glad it made the list
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:26:38

@_date: 2014-09-14 05:39:21
you can't ban anything from russians!!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:38:35

@_date: 2014-08-10 22:48:56
NP. Thanks for letting us know man.
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:28:42
buy a little bit at a time if you can't afford a whole bitcoin. you can buy fractions of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:33:25
i don't understand how people who are in gang rape frats, graduate to become people who tell other people what to do. it doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:51:46
you can sell on there too? lol neat
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:25:31
zero tolerance for crooked sites? sweet.
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:38:15
but changetip is so much easier. $10.00

@_date: 2014-11-09 22:55:09
usually half an hour. the transaction is there, just waiting for confirmations to make sure.
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:21:45
satoshi is like itachi, he fucks with your head using genjutsu.
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:37:08

@_date: 2014-11-09 00:26:21
what are you trying to do?
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:01:02
If this is true, and this result in them actually accepting it, could be huge. I know plenty of people of whine and cry about how they can't get their money onto the poker site. 
Right now one of the options is to buy a prepaid card, which is troublesome compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:49:20
They either start accepting it now or it'll be too late. Like ebay.
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:28:31
relax, bitcoin is very complex in its relation to the world and some comparison doesn't do it justice.
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:19:43
you lost .5 btc and your dream is crushed?
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:05:02
WHERE IS THE ADDRESS TO DONATE GODDAMNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:28:26
we need a community funded/supported data/mining center
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:19:04
With that kind of funds, they will eventually get it. WE MUST STOP THEM!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-09-09 00:11:17
so..whats the verdict?
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:18:28
wish i was there with some water balloons.
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:00:57
naturally lol
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:58:02
people think you're scamming him.
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:47:35
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:00:07
now spend it
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:00:02
we have something in common then.
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:53:06
I remember being on a field trip to one of their institution. It was nice what they did. If you're not an alcoholic or drug addict who can't quit, they'll take you in and give you a fighting chance.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:23:09
can i have your bitcoin?

@_date: 2014-07-20 23:47:51

@_date: 2014-11-28 16:42:42
corporate sabotage detected in bitcoin community. kill it before it gets bigger.
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:48:39
wtf is this nonsense, why isnt bitcoin a word yet? who do we have to hang for this to happen?
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:27:37

@_date: 2014-08-17 16:49:30
Cars, house, boats...etc...rich people stuff.
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:33:34
UNICEF. Angelina don't need our money and i feel she's doing it from the heart and not for fame. If they accepted Bitcoin, I'm sure the Bitcoin community would raise millions in the first week. It's a win-win for both community. Bitcoin gets good publicity and UNICEF will receive millions.
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:41:57
What if you include in your app a translator? you know how google have a translator? what if you integrated that into your app. this way when people go to other countries, countries like china where the gap in language is too great to distinguish. you wouldnt know how much to pay for your apples or you get price gouged. what if your app turns chinese input to english output, just like google translator but built into your app to run alongside bitcoin...
i would pay for an app like this.
@_date: 2014-08-12 06:51:40
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:16:42
this is some scandalous shit.

smart phones now smart card. makes perfect sense. i'd definitely get one.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:10:36
Be patient with them. I hated them at first too lol. But you have to understand Bitcoin is new and it takes time to fix all the bugs.
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:25:05
LMAO it's expected.
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:29:03
LOL so true
@_date: 2014-08-23 23:24:16
Did you just open a brand new account and made a lot of purchases? Red flag. Just email their support and you'll be alright.
Had the same problem.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:39:41
it's not weird, it's fucking outrageous. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:42:41
LOL he said congressman. lobbying, bribery, same shit. you can do something if you can offer your congressman more than the banks. otherwise, roll over.
@_date: 2014-10-11 21:53:41
they're already closing bank accounts affiliated with bitcoins. move to credit union.

hopefully the radio broadcast will reach aliens. and they like the idea.
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:00:36
i feel this is an attempt at defaming him. if this goes on we are sure to see fabricated emails painting satoshi as some greedy dude.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:13:57

@_date: 2014-09-23 21:38:56
I like this very much.
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:32:44
I think I speak for a lot of us when I say once you realize the potential of bitcoin, there's no going back.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:12:25
bingo. a solution for all their problems.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:26:36
I am convinced that if the Chinese can perform a 51% attack they will do so in a terrifying matter. Chinese government, not the people, love the people.

He's a smart kid, valuable to society. A tragedy to lock him up.
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:36:27
we can trust this guy, we can trust him to be wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:47:19
this dude could be satoshi trolling everyone
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:50:55
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:21:50
LOL. Until bitcoin wallets actually work without issues, and transaction do not get stuck for 3+ days, bitcoin will not see mass adoption. So many issues EVERYWHERE in the bitcoin ecosystem. Coins getting stuck and then disappearing is enough to get people shy away from bitcoin forever.
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:14:53
all in favor send .05 btc to my address.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:44:07

lol that monster is an angry guy
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:26:09
are they for real?
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:31:45
could just be the changetip transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:11:38
maybe never. there is hope.
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:28:52
Sweet! I taught myself decimals to algebra using Khan Academy. Of course I'll donate when I get home.
@_date: 2014-10-11 21:22:33
i'll be using this service for sure
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:02:20
hehe i love surveys. family feud once did a survey asking 100 people "tell me a name that starts with a K" one guy said kentucky fried chicken.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:41:14
if we want people to continue thinking bitcoin is a scam. yes, it is.
@_date: 2014-10-13 01:07:51
so much that they have decided to make their own centralized version.
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:27:21
lol gawminer
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:01:02
coinbase almost killed my love for bitcoin. the shills can say whatever they want to say.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:09:48
i'm guessing they were drawing too much power for the gauge of the main wire. that's how some electrical fire starts. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:21:58
That is actually a conservative estimate considering less even know what they're hearing--globally.
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:58:19
About 3 hours ago. For someone new to bitcoin they'll think it's witch craft and distant themselves from bitcoin as it is dangerous to use. Luckily, I'm not a complete noob and it reappeared after I rebuilt and rescan the blockchain. It was sent back into my wallet after getting stuck for days, but did not appear in my wallet until what was stated above was done. Now imagine a new user, if they do not run from anything bitcoin it'll be a miracle.
@_date: 2014-08-28 22:55:53
Wellsfargo is alright with it for now. Just don't make a coinbase account then have a ton on transaction going in and out then wonder why they terminated your account. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:34:59
verify a credit card and you get it in a few minutes.
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:36:22
hehe easy question for bitcoin user.
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:37:34
alright! no need for the insult, we're all adults here...right guys? right?
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:06:45
So they want to be a mining pool.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:49:41
Why do you complicate things? =)
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:57:55
predicting the end of bitcoin is like predicting what would happen in 2012.
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:36:48
Calm down. Lets not get divided by the oldest political trick in the book.
Remember, the elites are still them no matter where they stand.
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:49:06
You should wait for the next hack to happen. It'll definitely dip.
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:12:47
It's centralized. 
Good for bitcoin either way--it's how I imagined mass adoption will happen. People being educated and familiarizing themselves with the tech.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:39:12
We need those on every planet.
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:58:34
Yes it is, you need to sell all your bitcoins and never look back.
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:44:54
they should try south east asia
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:44:53
Quit giving credit to trump where there is none.

@_date: 2014-12-21 07:28:39
Do not lose your back up seed. Ever. I don't know how many Bitcoin you have in your wallet but if you felt the need to secure it, I am certain you wouldn't have this problem. Do not be cocky when it comes to securing/maintaining your bitcoins or this happen.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:49:23
lol regulators. you mean the ones that got recorded being scared shitless of goldman sach? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:57:20
all the people who down voted you feel the same way, they're just embarassed cause you mentioned it.
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:37:58
meh. i prefer the bitkee titanium ones.
@_date: 2014-08-10 23:22:46

@_date: 2017-02-11 06:46:11
mike hearns, is that you buddy?
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:27:53
i think people are selling now to buy it back cheaper after black friday.
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:02:34
probably an honest mistake.
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:30:42
That is pretty damn certain.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:28:47
You would be selling .9999 btc. Same shit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:18:41
Spent some. Waiting for a crash to less than 500 to rebuy. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:35:12
full node on all 13 planets and 100 probes sent into deep space in all directions transmitting transactions.

@_date: 2017-02-11 06:45:36

Shieeet costed me 15 bucks to send 300 to Florida. How and why is it cheaper (free) to send internationally. Does not compute.
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:06:33

@_date: 2014-09-11 00:58:18
he just said he's in it for the money while its there......
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:41:20
That is indeed annoying. It can be distressful. I transferred from armory to my Trezor and shits been stuck for 3 days.
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:17:55
it really is kinda like a roller coaster ride lol
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:00:24
Can you see your private keys?

you had to pick that photo lol
@_date: 2014-12-28 02:26:53
i can understand bitpay doing commercials but why do bitcoin itself need a commercial? it'll make it look like a MLM
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:53:56
Now I'm certain the government want Bitcoin to succeed so they can drop the banks that are running them. If a government is really for the people that is.
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:17:36
He's a billionaire. He pays 35 million for his breakfast.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:41:25
sorry, but if you can't figure that out, you'll just lose your coins once you buy them. take your time and do your homework.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:57:52
There he is!!
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:29:04
For Zuckerberg' with a d to happen: the winklevoss must come back and create an even better, far more spectacular regulated exchange. 
Right now, Coinbase is myspace. the facebook of regulated exchange have not been created yet.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:57:59
And then it drop to 50 dollars. I would be laughing.
@_date: 2015-01-28 06:37:41
Why are you assholes so rich. Damn time jelly.
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:37:36
i think they'll announce that they got an order for 500,000 bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:39:39
Bitcoiners like you are like a council of whining little children who throw tantrums when they don't get their way. That's all it is.
Edit: plural.
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:44:17
lol careful, you might have to use WU still.

Yeah, this is definitely a problem.
@_date: 2016-01-04 03:00:49
Ok, so because people donated 2 million to core, you are certain they will match the 2 million or better towards satellite rental--thus, that is why I should divide 18,000 by 2 million to get the number of years the project in question can live? But then you said these two projects have nothing to do with each other.....if they have no relation, how is it that you are able to draw correlation when there is none?
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:24:33
Ahhh looks like the work of economic hitman. Counter-troll is the only option.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:04:03

@_date: 2016-01-03 23:54:06
So did this project receive 18k in donation or two million?

Excuse me for my ignorance but how much "space" can we get for 18k? Would a hamster fit in it?
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:33:39
This is the way forward. Pick up the slacks the banks cannot handle to start.
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:17:41

You can clear all unconfirmed transaction with Armory. It's in one of the tab on top in "help" or "tool" or something I forget. After you do that you can resend with higher fee and maybe that will push it through.

So you're telling me a bunch of college kids sent a donut into stable orbit? What was the fuel for their launch vehicle? The methane gas produced from them farting straight for a year? 
You're living too far into the future, because in this decade--it costs about 10k USD to to put a pound (1lb) of payload into orbit. A donut and satellite rental, manufacturing, designing, or a hamster are completely different matters.

With 18k you can rent it for a little 1.5 year. Then it call behind on its rent and die. Then media will claim bitcoin CEO died. Incoming buttcoin evangelists teasing us.

A lot of these quotes indicate that he/she is, in fact, one person and not a group. Unless, of course they take turn interacting with the mass. Then again, the writing style is too consistent for that to be the case. Or, the group can have one person interact with the mass, however, the chain of thoughts says otherwise. I think it's one person.

mark thomas williams, "An academic, financial author, columnist and risk management expert. He is a faculty member in the Finance and Economics Department at Boston University...." Known in the bitcoin community as professor bitcorn, predicted the price would drop to 10 dollars in 2014. He also spoke before congress and asked for strong regulations for bitcoin. If you want to listen to this short sighted visionless author, bitcoin will eventually trade at 10 USD.

Nitrogen Sport. Best site to played at so far IMO.
I've played at betcoin and such, but it is not user friendly. You kinda have to send bitcoins all over the place. Like if you wanted to bet in sports you would have to send bitcoins to the sport betting section or if you want to play poker, you have to send it to the poker section, etc. And then there's a main wallet where your deposits go.

What mike hearn did was by far the worst. He used his position in the bitcoin community to collude with R3 in an attempt to collapse bitcoin. He planned a release of his statement to main stream media at the request of R3 saying bitcoin is a failed experiment. As a result, what he did crashed the price. Not significantly, but noticeable. mike hearn is comparable to the biblical Judah.

People need to stop sending bitcoins to random addresses.
If you have the key to that address, you are in control of those bitcoins. Just sweep that private key into another wallet. Sweeping will dump the amount of BTC contained in that private key into the wallet doing the sweeping.
And stop sending your BTC to random address. If you're not sure, do not do it.
Everyday I see someone going on here and saying," hey guys, i just sent btc to this address and I'm not sure where it is because it's just a random address and i don't know what im doing but i did it anyways, help."
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:21:20
Deny? It's been immortalized by the news, otherwise known as the media, internet, on the mind whoever wish to concern themselves with that event. Sold his coins as a testament to his conviction; bitcoin is a failed experiment. 
“From the start, I’ve always said the same thing: bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail,” Hearn said. “But despite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards.”-Newsweek, your favorite source.
That may as well be on the blockchain. It's there, until the end and that can't even be calculated...and you are comfortable denying that? Holy fuck.
You are comfortable denying what again?

You really have to admire the tenacity and conviction of the people at OpenBazaar; they kept moving forward through one of the worst slumps in bitcoins history. Most would give up on their project when 1 btc dropped to $180 USD, they didn't. I really can't see how OpenBazaar can fail with that kind of commitment and dedication.
OpenBazaar have the potential to carry bitcoin, for a time. In fact, I think the next price jump could be attributed to OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar could, and should be the format for interplanetary markets.

If bitcoin were to go down the drain, it should have happened earlier in one of the many predicament created for it by notable public figures. 
One such character is Paul Krugmen; this nobel winning economist insult bitcoin at every turn, still couldn't kill it. Who better to bring down bitcoin than one of its developer? mike hearn, the betrayer. This backstabbing, conniving character sold bitcoin out at a discount to R3. What he said should have fucked bitcoin up beyond any hope of unfucking. Yet, bitcoin is still here today, strong and as resilient as ever against those who stand to undermine it.

Give me the Lewis structure for synthetic CBD/THC and natural CBD/THC, once you do this, you would have debunked your own understanding.
CBD does not have the same effect as THC, it has the opposite effect. Where are you even getting this information? LMAO

So you took a course in macro exonomics.
Bitcoin is not against banks, its not against bankers but what it is against is centrally issued money that gets printed at will. Have you ever wonder why the plebs ( we are the plebs ) arent allowed to know who the shareholders are for the fed? You should ask your professor next time in class,” Why arent we allowed to know who the shareholders are for the fed.”
We can go into wealth inequality, and we can go into how keynesian economics use endless wars to stimulate the economy, but that would require writing a novel.

What pisses me off about this sub is that when people come in with this kind of concern, the motherfuckers who respond almost NEVER inform the poster that he/she did not lose his/her bitcoin AND explain to the OP that the coins will be returned to the sending wallet within 72 hours. Why is that? Why the fuck is it so hard to just say that and alleviate some of the worries of the OP?
OP, you didn't lose your coins, it will either get confirmed or it will be return to the sending address. Normally within 72 hours, but it will be returned

Obvious troll post. But let's see where this goes.
Imagine you paid 500 for a winning lottery ticket and then you lost it. No amount of crying and begging will make the ticket issuer accountable for your irresponsible actions that lead you to lose your ticket. The money is there for 6 months if you can find the ticket-the bitcoin is there indefinitely if you have the private key/s. You have neither. It is lost and it is your carelessness that is to blame.

Don't know how that went but MMORPG and digital currency integration could mean big bucks for some of these game makers.
If any of you ever played Battle Pirates by Kixeye, there are tons of people who spend tens of thousands on upgrade for little pixels. It is entertaining, and people pay a lot of money to make others miserable to amuse themselves by simply having the best weapons/ships. The victim in turn feels obligated to avenge his smoldering base by coining even better more devastating upgrades. Kixeye literally make a living off of pride. And why not?

Although what you say is comforting, we are talking about the most effective intelligence agency in the world. These people can topple a few nation overnight. Just look at BRICS; those are some powerful countries, and they seem to be able to walk all over them with impunity. What I'm amazed at is how they can appear completely disconnected from those coup. You have to admire their effeciency. 
With that said, somehow I doubt bitcoin can withstand their onslaught. What bitcoin have experienced thus far can be consider test runs. They're have not commited themselves to destroying it, yet.

If MMM is what I think it is, it's popular throughout Asia for centuries but on a extremely smaller scale. A group of people will have to trust a central entity. Those peoe would give/deposit said entity money. For example, member A deposited 1k, member b deposited 500, member C deposit 300. If your car broke down and you need to borrow 1500, the entity will loan that money to you. You repay the amount borrowed with interest. People whom did not need to borrow money will make their deposits plus interest at the term of the term agreed by all parties. Once that term is over, a new one starts. The losers here are the ones who need the money.
Does this sound like it?

Is this the same "journalist" that fucked up Dorian Nakamoto's life?
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:26:52
That's exactly it though. We've been through this before and he was unable to prove that he was Satoshi the first time. He's now back for round two, and he still can't prove that he is Satoshi. What else are we going to do?

Law enforcements are very suspicious of bitcoin. Matter fact, most of you here were. Exposing them to bitcoin will increase their understanding of the system and hopefully they'll realize that like cash, you can't control what everyone does with their money. 
Not everyone who's into bitcoin are criminals and we need to prove that. And the best ach to do that is to invite law enforcements over for dinner. Let them take a look around.

This problem turn A LOT of people off. I went through it, frustrating as constipation. Had whole family thinking I'm stupid (may be true). But Coinbase do not seem to care, "too bad so sad" is what you'll get.

@_date: 2015-11-04 22:50:12
That's being optimistic. The price might be driven to under 100. You saw what they can do to increase the price. I imagine it would be a lot easier to crash the price.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:34:52
That's nothing. Have you seen the Neteller thread? Includes everyone but US. It's like the US put a sanction on ourselves. No choice whatsoever.

And if the price decline to 100 next week, what will you tell her?
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:46:46
You're attributing bitcoins survival based on whether or not it was rewarding for businesses to accept bitcoin. And because it was not, you're saying it will not survive. If you're not implying it will fail, what exactly are you implying?
Bitcoin have been rising against the dollar since day one, overall.

How about a currency that process itself on the arguably most secure network on the planet? How about bypassing a broker or a bank? Or one with its own ledger? That is not all of it either. 
People use those features of the internet without knowing they're using it. You can remain ignorance, not my problem. "If you don't believe me or if you don't understand it; I don't have time to explain it to you." something to that effect. Good luck.

"Some readers find it hard to see why wages must fall faster than prices and why jobs are jeopardised as prices fall. To see why this is invariably so, compare the degree of power over price that a corporation has (e.g. Walmart or Mercedes Benz) to the degree of power over the wage of a blue collar worker. As customers are no longer prepared to pay the same prices as before, the corporation can limit the decline in the price of its wares by restricting output. Its price will still fall, but not by as much as it would have done had the corporation not had a capacity to influence price through restricting supply. In sharp contrast, the blue collar worker has no comparable power to restrict her labour supply in order to arrest the fall in her wages. The result is twofold: As corporations restrict output (to reduce the rate at which prices fall) their demand for labour falls,  the result being even greater wage reductions accompanied by layoffs which, in a never-ending recessionary circle, reduce further the demand for goods."
One hell of a straw man if I ever seen one.
No wonder these people ran their country's economy into the fucking ground. And now he has the nerve to comment on economics. Probably the same reason why they're demanding a bailout. I'm sorry but if you need a bailout you're in no position to comment on finance or demand for anything.

I say that because I have a few miners sitting around waiting for winter to come. It's just not cost effective with older hardware, which are what I have.
But, if you want to provide moar computing power to the blockchain, perhaps you might consider buying a used obsolete miner with a budget of $100. Just to play around with or get to know the hardware just in case.

I see. It wasn't purse.io that jacked you. Fedex fucked you over by hiring people who can't read and/or is blind ( not that I have anything against illiterate or blind people). I've had at least 4 items sent to the wrong address or apartment building by FedEx back to back. Some times, they deliver the package to their friends, who happen to live near you. I have not had this experience with UPS.
Amazon gave you a tracking number, meaning items have been shipped. FedEx claimed that it was delivered. You can't argue with that since they'll look at shipping and see that you have already received your item. Don't use FedEx. Ever.
You need to contact FedEx and have a police report, it'll give you leverage when talking to support. Again, you got fucked by FedEx like many others.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:01:23
