Will we have Bitcoin banks, or will it be more like a bitcoin insurance company? They will protect and guarantee your investment for a set percentage

Argue with girlfriend and walk home with a half drunk bottle of vodka?

Yeah, I get that. Now what? Will everything carry on as normal? Random guys with huge mining farms in Asia are all of a sudden amongst the 1% of richest people in the world. Some random guy nobody knows is the richest fella on the planet... if he’s not dead. Or is he a consortium of business or a group of people who can now run things?
Will wealth disparity be even worse with those who didn’t believe essentially having a currency no one wants - a greater divide between rich and poor. Emerging nations who use bitcoin instead of their own currency now being much better off? Will it lead to a more even spread of wealth or will the divide simply get bigger?

Nope, just some economists and clever types helping to drive mass adoption and get everybody and their grandma to buy $100 worth.
Truth is no one knows. It’s possible. More people buy wanting the price to go up, price goes up, more people see price going up, more people buy, price goes up, more people see price going up, more people buy... as long as the majority hodl and don’t sell everything they make 10% it will continue to grow. At that point more businesses will accept it as they want in. More business means more demand, price goes up.
The question is whether anything else better could come along in the meantime. If it does there would be a lot of catching up to do - Betamax was better than VHS.
