Lol love your downvotes- I don’t understand the BTC maximalism here. Bitcoin does have value, but their are so many other worthwhile projects that can do fifty million other valuable, efficient things- it’s either ignorance or blatant delusion to not see value in what Ethereum is accomplishing.
The irony is, Ethereum smart contracts and Solidity development are what got me interested in crypto in the first place. I now am accumulating BTC (have been past two years), as well as other crypto that I feel solves problems, like Ethereum.
I do feel BTC will hit $150,000 maybe more over next few years. But I also want a diverse portfolio,  as I believe there are even bigger returns to be made, and potential losses of course...

I only had 7x on ETH and got wiped out before I could even ladder down (system overload)...oh well, live and you learn...
