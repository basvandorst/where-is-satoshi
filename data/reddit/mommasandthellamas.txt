Moved from Long Island to Tennessee in June... LOVE IT! The cost of living is affordable, I can join more exchanges and don’t even get me started on the gun laws!!
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:37:45
Oh, not sure man. If you asked Craig Wright he’d probably say it was his idea lol
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:39:38

Safe on a ledger. Never screen shotted seed words or wrote on a phone/tablet/computer etc.. also nano purchased straight from ledger and mailed from France. BE SAFE PEOPLE!

Pretty sure robinhood still doesnt give you private keys.. aka not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:41:14
Of course dude. Look up public and private keys. If you don’t have both you don’t have access to your Btc. Robin Hood is like if you buy solid gold over the internet and some company is holding it for you, it’s not in your house. And if that company gets robbed your gold is gone. You want your gold in your house lol

Reminds me of that old Nike commercial where a bunch of people are like “...I am Tiger Woods”
@_date: 2019-08-30 04:59:16
God it’s painful watching this knowing I was an adult, had my own cash and internet access when this was recorded. But hey better to be in now than 10 years from now!!
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:51:03
This looks like some fbi computer generated suspect description photo

Definitely maybe
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:56:06
I’ve seen some people say noob and make fun of basic questions like this but I LOVE seeing this stuff. Just goes to show that more and more people are interested and want to learn!!!
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:37:45
Arbitraging.co ?

I need about tree fitty
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:09:57
Took me almost two years to get mine but that day transferring those last few satoshis to see 1.00blah blah on my ledger was such a personal achievement. Felt awesome. There were some weeks I could only put 50 bucks in but I finally made it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:21:04
i gav'em a dolla
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:59:13
Glad to hear they got back to you, I trust the blockchain but usually send a test amount just to be safe before moving a large chunk.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:59:22
Documentary called “Banking on Bitcoin” is very informative and tells a lot about how it works and the early days. It was on Netflix a while ago but pretty sure you can find it in YouTube.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:21:38
That’s like people donating to Kylie Jenner to help her get a billion dollars lol. Satoshi has enough already he needs to send me some !
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:49:31
Actually around 2140 like I said *cough* lol

Let see which one will be worth more in 12 months!
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:27:06
Won’t it happen in like 2147 or something? We’ll be loooong gone
@_date: 2019-12-12 06:49:07
Only if they have the seed words already written down for you
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:12:09
Because one day it’ll be 22k and you’ll have doubled your money!
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:14:44
Always remember you haven’t lost any money as long as you don’t sell. Focus on the sats not the usd.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:53:09
US dollars isn’t what’s important here ��

Unless you have a time machine and can go back to 2010 then mortgage everyone’s house in your family.
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:53:33
Nothing! Keep holding!!
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:50:16
I know right?! They just earned a spot on my Christmas card mailing list lol
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:47:22

@_date: 2019-04-24 01:27:25
Keep laptop on chest and peeps behind the monitor while laying down .. BOOM no blackmail for me!! Just intense facial expressions lol
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:51:24
A while ago one of my buddies said, “I bet there’s some kid that bought btc to buy drugs from Silk Road then got scared, didn’t and forgot his keys.” I’d say 100% true lol.. like some guys out there right now knowing he had 200btc he was gonna get an ounce of pot with when he was in HS
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:18:09
I remember just looking at my ledger live several times a day when I hit my goal. Just felt good to finally see something other than a zero to the left of that decimal!! Congrats
@_date: 2019-04-10 05:35:34
Well it was about that time I noticed this girl scout was about eight stories tall and crustacean from the protozoic era!!..
@_date: 2019-04-29 20:21:51
I’m doin what this guys doin but on a ledger ��
@_date: 2019-04-27 01:39:46
We may have missed the bitcoin boat in the sense of astronomical returns but the digital asset cruise line is just setting off. Btc still has room to grow and other assets have a ton of potential as well. Don’t live in hindsight just be glad we’re in this now before, what.. 90% of the world?
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:48:04
Coinbase linked to capitol one debit, zero issues for me. Had to call the bank once or twice in the past to have them ok a coinbase purchase but they let me and I haven’t had to contact them since.
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:53:10
I love my ledger, such a great piece of mind knowing it’s secure
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:35:46
I was about to say “oh that’s cool I want one”  then clicked on the link and saw they were like $9k-40k lol

@_date: 2019-05-09 00:25:18
Market caps at highest since mid November too.. CMON BULLS!!!
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:31:56
That website should have just posted a gif of Rick  Astley dancing when the clock hit zero... that would have been funny!
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:55:12
Did my part earlier!! And I’ll do it again tomorrow with my vpn on to make it look like It’s people all over the world!
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:11:23
True, good way to put it
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:55:11
I miss these days, where every time I open CMC it’s higher.. welcome back bulls!!

I heard those bitcorns are valuable these days, sorry for your loss..
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:20:49
I was new once too, sent someone on the Internet my private keys just so I have a backup. But keeping them safe ��
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:46:25
Banking on bitcoin was a really informative documentary, watch that but still do your reading .
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:25:52
I have like two shoeboxes of magic cards and the last time I bought them was around 2000... no black lotus’ but I always wonder how much they’re all worth.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:06:01
I was new at the time and just held, wasn’t even aware of corrections.. I’ve learned a lot the past year.
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:52:23
Post it on reddit and show everyone it’s on an exchange?
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:53:29
... is nothing special
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:58:22
I love my nano S. I know ledger is one of the best and super secure, not a software engineer by any means but something about Bluetooth ledger bugs me out.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:14:18
