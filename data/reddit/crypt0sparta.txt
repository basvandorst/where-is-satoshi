Has anyone tried this and what’s the process like? Thanks!

The bill may not pass (since it is proposed and the terms are so vague). Think we are all feeling a little attacked right now...

Wow. Any recommendations on first reads? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:20:34
Maybe a slight biased opinion coming from a crypto company ceo... nonetheless good read. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:15:58
Did anyone try it? Payment in btc. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:12:35
Don’t know of any in London, but Glad to see people are keen on using crypto to actually buy things rather than as a mere store of value for investments etc etc

Out of curiosity, how did your Cashapp account get banned? 
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:14:14
Lol. Yes and no everywhere. And they’re all right. We will never know and reading up on price predictions are never the answer as they sometimes get it wrong too. Worse case for investors is it’ll continue to plummet but based on the developments coming up I’m optimistic the price of bitcoin will rise in the near future.

Who proposed this? Close resemblance to $ ��

Wonder how long more coinbase will last... any guessers?

Even he has seen the light 
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:14:41
Meaning some countries won’t get it... since play store varies by region?

Hahahah valiant effort ���� imagine having this on the keyboard or having to type these in or seeing these on exchanges ����
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:21:37
And also the stability of gold vs btc as we know it 
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:15:33
Agreed, Coinbase has made blunder after blunder, it’s pretty unfortunate, hope things turn around soon ); 
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:18:10
Apparently because their previous choice of data tracking company was poor.... hope this isn’t a repeat.

It’s if they choose to want to invest in crypto and if it’s worth putting their money into something more volatile than their own currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 04:23:11
 it's cool that your office is accepting payments in btc! looking forward to updates too as the fluctuations can make price tricky! I assume it will be a usd to btc converted price rate as of the moment the client pays? good luck on sorting the legal issue!
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:50:53
holy! that's super creative kudos to you and congrats on your 0.01 btc!

I guess that’s what warren buffet thinks. He had to eat up his own words with the miscalculations of Amazon. Everyone has their own opinions but I believe in the future of decentralization not just the investment

Great use of the donation, wonder if the anonymous donor did it by accident ��
