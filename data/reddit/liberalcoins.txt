I think a peer to peer trading service might be the right choice for you, if it can take a bit longer. You can have a look at our website [Liberalcoins.com]( You might even be able to find a buyer that would like to buy your bitcoins at a premium price. Just create an ad on our website and wait for buyers to initialise a transaction with you.
A brief introduction to our service:
We are a p2p BTC, XMR, DASH and LTC trading website that focuses on user privacy by not using Google Analytics, implementing extensive privacy settings and having our servers located on the Isle of Man. 
As a trusted third party service we are aware that trust plays an essential part when deciding where to trade. Our company and owners have been validated by Symantec, the largest cybersecurity company and we are using several paid services to constantly check and monitor our website for vulnerabilities.

Hey Will, I'm sorry, but this is not fair. We do not advertise on your posts, so please do not do that on a post about us.
By the way, I believe that we have far more features than you, so why do you even want to attack us on a post about us?

Thank you langescoin. We are working on getting more and more sellers onto our exchange. We would be happy to see you there as well, slingfox!
I believe that a lower fee on the exchange might work in your favour, since LBC has gotten so competitive .

What does that have to do with my reply?

That's why bitcoin is just the beginning. It's still the most popular currency on the cryptomarket, but other currencies are overtaking by implementing the newest Technology. See LTC with SegWit
