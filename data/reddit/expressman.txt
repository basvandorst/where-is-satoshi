Yes and no. The key difference being that the left wants to advance social progress through legislation (force), and libertarians want social progress to be unimpeded by government. It's more than a small difference as it touches on the core issue of force/coercion.
Regarding fiscally conservative, again it's true in the very broadest sense, but any more and it separates quickly, as even the most conservative conservatives want a imperial crapton more government than a libertarian.
But hey, it's a start.

It's only a group insofar as it is a variety of similar philosophies branching from a shared philosophy. That is relevant to bitcoin because the societal utility of it can be within the scope of the shared philosophy or not.
Labels are not absurd when they describe something objectively. When my oven says "hot" I don't accuse it of being absurd.

Case in point. I believe people are inherently bad, but we generally look out for their own self-interest, hence I don't trust anyone with power, and I see no better co-existence than mutual benefit based on self-interest (emphasis on *mutual*).

I'm aware. I tried to refer to sociopathy as one thing and the narcissism spectrum as another... maybe I seemed to conflate them.


Well yes I was saying it's common, not good. To me that suggest DT is more of a control freak leader type than actually insane. Also a brash manipulaton of the truth around a broader tactical play and utter lack of empathy seems like some of the signature actions of sociopathy. I could go on about several of the recent presidents too.


Absolutely it's a concern. I agree with your ideal but I doubt it has anything to do with the reality of the office.

I think you're over-complicating it. Sociopaths like power, they tend to be gang leaders or CEO's. What is more power than the POTUS? I suspect many, if not most, if not all US Presidents were either sociopaths or way high on the narccist spectrum.
I also wonder how much you've been around CEO's in general. Not reading more than 9 bullet points or even three sentences into an email seems to come standard with them. Not saying it's good, just saying it's not an behavioral anomaly.

You're still stuffed to the gills with assumptions.
First of all, typically both parents are involved, so there are usually two teachers. Few parents stop there. Many (if not most) are in homeschool groups for socialization &amp; field trips, while yet many others are in homeschool co-ops where different parents teach different subjects.
Library day was like weekly. The main difference is we'd study while the busses of school kids would swarm in, make a lot of noise, and leave.
Also, while some parents have protection as a goal, most are primarily concerned about the quality of their kids education. Believe me, there were bullies in my life (I was homeschooled)!
You're just loaded with assumptions. You have no clue what you're talking about.

Nice. I carry an M&amp;P 9mm standard so I thought it looked familiar.

The problem with that is, if you buy them with your own account you can go back and get free upgrades to the theme (which, if you've ever bought a WordPress theme you know its a real issue). Also IDK how this falls into the TOS of reselling themes.
But your heart's in the right place.

Downvoted you for associating homeschooling with isolationism, which is not the case most of the time.

Yeah. They feel kind of light an plasticky, but so darn comfortable, and good build. I do regret getting the full size. It's a bit tricky to conceal.
