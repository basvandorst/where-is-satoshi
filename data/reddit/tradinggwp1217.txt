Not true. 
Bitcoin is one of the greatest invention in the blockchain technology no doubt.
But that does not mean the other cryptos won't last, there are many cryptos that are built better than bitcoin with scalability and better performance and transaction fees 
For example : ethereum

Ok , your wish if you wanna accept the fact or not 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:01:43
Ok so all the articles on internet is a lie that ethereum is faster than bitcoin with less confirmation time and fees :)
