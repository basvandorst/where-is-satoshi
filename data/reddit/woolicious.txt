Sent a tx for less than 800 sats the other day, which was nice.

Just about everything he said is wrong.  Bye Craig, enjoy your scammit coins.

What the hell is he saying about counting backwards? lol... and yeah count money "backwards" every day, it's called debt.

I sold all my gold between 2012-2013. I own a few silver pieces just because they are cool looking.  I can see the value in owning a *little* on the side, but see much more potential/use cases for cryptos and allocate my investments accordingly.  I have bought bitcoin via bitwage for nearly 15 months now.

He can just make them open source, free-use like Tesla and other entities have done recently with their patents. I'm curious to see how his scaling solution works. It's bullish and bearish. Your pick :)

It is unfortunate that people have been ripping off many peer-to-peer lending sites(not limited to bitcoin space). I learned this the hard way as well on Prosper.com. The laws are very in favor of creditors and lenders get screwed. Scammers know this and flocked to btcjam, prosper, etc.  I was on bctalk on day one warning people to steer very clear of btcjam. 
The bottom line is never lend money to anyone without proper collateral. If they can't offer collateral, let someone else deal with them.

So no known exploits yet..good to know about though, thanks.
Also Boingo Boingo, please stop calling XT and Classic "altcoin forks". Bitcoin is already confusing enough for most people without people playing unnecessary word games. Don't even bother trying to sell me. They are not altcoins.

It's really not all that scary, unless you are doing $10K+ without a valid source of income, then you never land on any radars. FinCen regularly reports the number of reports they receive, you would be shocked to find out how low the number really is.

Sounds like you need to shop around.

Glidera is not anonymous, nor does it appear to be a scam.  Sounds like a technical difficulty problem with a new-ish company.  
I've talked to the CEO, and he's is clearly on the up-and-up trying to make purchasing and selling btc smoother.

David Ripley. Glidera is registered MSB in Delaware.

Newsbtc was good for about a year.  But then, NewsBTC's orignal owner sold in November of last year and it immediately became a shill site, advertising all bitcoin scams from GAW/paycoin, neucoin, HashingSpace, and the list goes on and on. Add in the horrific reporting from "Sarah Jenn" and "Nikhil Gupta" and you have the WORST bitcoin media site of all time.  Stop going there.  Stop linking them.  Don't advertise there. Deselect them on zeroblock. If a product is advertised there, there is a 95% chance it is a scam and 5% chance they are so new they don't realize what a crappy site newsbtc.com has become. Shut your site down and go do something else, "Yashu Gola". (another fake name, I presume, like Sarah and Nikhil use). In other words, f--- off, newsbtc.

Replace Gemini with Bitfinex and you're onto something.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:29:22
Right, someone downloaded and started mining within 10 minutes of release? OK sure
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:28:34
By this rationale, we should never trust any signed message because it could just be "stolen", am I paraphrasing correctly?

118,000 euro package?? i hope someone with that much money is not stupid enough to fall for this. Why isn't Interpol raiding these clowns?

Everybody calm the fuck down. You got your $200 now, and posted your bitcoin address for the world to see in the meantime.  Coinbase has always had a bit of a delay on transactions. Does your bank do a 31 minute transaction between Saturday and Sunday? 
Jesus Christ, bitcoinland.  Can we all just settle the F down?
