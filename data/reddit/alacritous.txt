Is it possible for them to rig up some version of fractional reserve banking with bitcoin?

That's why I said what they're due.

He seems fine with imaginary 1s and 0s of the stock market though.

That's true, they did. And that would have been the swaying factor towards HD-DVD, but then Sony paid Warner Brothers 400 million dollars cash to switch to BR.

It wouldn't be fraud, they track the performance of your virtual purchase and if you request it, they'll give you what you are due. So you're not out anything.

Nice try Apple PR rep.

When you buy shares from a broker, they will quite often just take that money, track your "pretend purchase" and use the money to do other things with that will make THEM money.  You never actually own that stock, unless you claim it then they'll actually give you the shares. It's all just numbers being moved around by very large algorithms.  The last time I looked the average length of time a stock is "owned" was 22 seconds.

It's open source, yes. But if the government themselves are running a bunch of the entry/exit nodes then they can be running whatever code they want and you'd never see the source code for the changes they've made.

That is for the purposes of evaluating conflicts by the consumer protection department only. It's not a general definition.  Different departments and different laws define terms differently.

What's to stop someone from speculating on Bitcoin?  As far as I can see, it's as vulnerable to manipulation as any other commodity.

Ideally you'd pick ones to attend that you had reasons to trust. Since this one is obviously promoting a fraudster, it's not one of those. Neither are it's organizers.

That's funny, I always downvote people who say they downvote for stupid reasons.

They could be covering their costs via other means with the long view in mind to recoup their losses when the price eventually rises.

Exactly. Conferences like this aren't held for educational purposes, they're held to make money off the attendees.

One would think that money when seized would then be put on trial, if found guilty, sequestered away from the other money, and once it's sentence was completed would be returned.

Has anyone told them that crossing their fingers for luck doesn't actually do anything?

PC or "Personal Computer" was the model name of a product line put out by IBM in the early days.  and it became the standard that all other computer manufacturers have modeled their computers after since.   So saying "PC computer" is accurate. As opposed to an Apple or Macintosh Computer or Atari Computer, etc.

I applied for a job a few months ago, where one of the requirements they specifically listed was Novell networking.. I didn't even know Novell still made networking stuff.  I haven't seen Novell in a network for more than a decade.

That's how paypal started.. And we can see how that turned out. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:30:31
When paypal first started up, they weren't affiliated directly with eBay. They would do the transactions for free. They made money on what's called the float. They would accrue interest on the money while it was in their accounts in the time between taking the money from you and the time the money was withdrawn for a payment. 
That was then.

Bitcoin is not legal tender.  They can refuse to accept it. And you still have to do all the regular withholdings and reporting and other government regulations regarding payroll.  And make sure you get some evidence that you've paid them.  You don't want them coming back later saying you stiffed them and all you have is a bitcoin transaction that goes somewhere that you can't prove who it is. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:28:55
Could a government or coalition of governments just buy them all up? If they just bought all the available Bitcoins then there wouldn't be much use for them. No one would be using them.
