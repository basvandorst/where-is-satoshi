Titov was the second cosmonaut in space after Gagarin and had a very successful career.
Gref doesn't need to be first (president).  Second (prime minister) would still be very good for Bitcoin.  By the way, Gref was asked during this appearance whether it's time he did for Russia what he's done for Sberbank,
and he answered: "I've nothing against it".
