you should otherwise you risk the chain you transact on to be attacked and get orphaned if there is not enough hashrate securing it
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:22:42
if bu blocks exists in bitcoin with the uasf proposal there will be a fork because most bu blocks will be &gt;1mb that is why this does not work. sure bu blocks that are less than 1mb get accepted just like right now but that is not what will happen if users get to choose what they want with uasf. segwit blocks will occur and bu blocks &gt;1mb will occur which will still fragment the network but instead of 51% being the baseline for forking 30% and 15% are. which is very insecure and why uasf is a bad idea
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:33:33
even if i can't validate the longest chain anymore? i don't get it
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:57:26
User-Activated-Soft-Fork ie a disaster waiting to happen. it is easy to sybil nodes. basically it allows for forks with less than &lt;50% hashrate support, i have no idea why this proposal is being pushed, it is not secure
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:08:32
nodes don't signal segwit activation though, miners do.  shows there is very little consensus on anything right now
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:37:54
would it still need &gt;95% support though? i mean as long as the hashrate support is &gt;50% it is safe but the main concern is uasf allowing activations with &lt;50% support
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:16:54
bu blocks ie &gt;1mb blocks will be rejected by segwit nodes you said it yourself. resulting in a fork
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:32:42
i see. hopefully the devs figure out how to fix the &lt;50% hashrate problem because otherwise a lot of people will get left on an insecure chain that could cause problems
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:56:04
ya i guess that is true. it would be nice if asics were more prominent outside of china. like if it became broad consumerwide product like gpus it would not be to bad
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:23:16
it would be cleaner though if segwit had at least over &gt;51% hashrate to activate instead of crossing our fingers with only 30% miner hashrate though. getting the chain orphaned by attackers would be trivial. i just don't understand why this option is being pushed all of a sudden when for a long time this method is known to be insecure for users where &lt;50% hashrate is not enough consensus to activate any new consensus rules in the network
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:40:32
i dunno, fees aren't really worth very much to miners right now afaik. but node count is easy to sybil and is not necessarily indicative of support compared to hashrate where a lot of money is being invested to show support for different things right, which is why users are encouraged to mine to have a vote on things though
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:17:36
wouldn't changing pow though make the network arguably even less secure? there are millions of dollars invested in sha256 asics and we would be throwing that all away. for a new pow that does not have as much investment in the security of the network right?

fuck what the banks are doing. who cares fuck em
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:06:48
i am only objectively talking about in a longest chain example. if segwit is the longest chain then bu gets rejected. if bu is the longest chain then segwit gets rejected. it is simple. they cannot co-exist in the same chain because their consensus is different and which chain is the real chain depends on which has the most hashrate, both bu nodes and segwit nodes account for this in the code but will not agree on which blocks are valid if a) segwit blocks exist or b) blocks larger than 1mb exist.


i think it is great that users get choose which transactions they want to use but the security in the network will not be the same. currently only roughly 30% of miners support segwit so only 30% of the current security would exist. same goes for bu which has roughly 15% of miners support(?) so only 15% of the current security from hashrate. which are both not great
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:07:59


this is great and all but trying to say it is secure when &lt;50% of miner hashrate is securing it is wrong. hopefully miners would see what is wanted but having this be allowed in the network and be accepted is not secure
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:14:11
i am only talking about bu and segwit nothing else to keep it simple because those are the main options right now. non-segwit blocks ie bu blocks are not valid by segwit nodes and viceversa. bitcoins network would be fragmented with currently only 30% of the hashrate securing the segwit chain and only 15% of the hashrate securing the bu chain this is a fact. and why 51% support is needed for forking to maintain security


you have a very skewed definition of undestanding because what you recognize as 'consensus' does not exist anywhere in the node consensus code. the network will fork in this situation
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:30:30
but if there is strong support and my node can't agree with the rest of the network, i would need to upgrade to participate in the bitcoin network. if that chain is longer than what we can validate we need to upgrade so i don't get left on an insecure chain. i am not sure what you mean exactly.
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:20:04
i agree the users run the nodes that validate everything but when the longest chain boots those users off because they can't agree on block consensus then they are on the insecure chain which puts them at risk. i mean nodes follow the longest chain anyway but if they can't validate it there is a problem
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:27:03


i meant in the event there was a fork and nodes can't validate the longest chain anymore. they would need to upgrade to validate the real chain to make sure they have the security for transacting with bitcoin in the longest chain though
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:35:01
good to hear i was getting worried when people started advocating for &lt;50% being enough to secure the network
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:31:24
i understand that but bu miners will be broadcasting bu blocks &gt;1mb regardless causing a fork. the main issue is letting bu or segwit 'activate' when there is only 30% or 15% hashrate backing them. that is a recipe for disaster for users who think it may be secure with uasf
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:44:54
that proposal is easy to sybil and will create a fork anyway. i don't blame blockstream for trying to change consensus rules to make segwit enable because 95% consensus is impossible regardless. i guess we will see what happens but things will need to change if anything is going to happen in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:22:29
start mining then and have some real influence. does not matter which nodes people run if they get forked off the network onto the wrong chain. bu nodes, core nodes. does not matter. 
not sure that the condescending attitude is proving your point very well in either case
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:03:33
neither segwit or bu have very much support right now so i guess we will see. the bigger question is what exchanges, businesses etc will run
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:41:01
i do not care if a fork occurs whether segwit or bu. what i do care about is how people think uasf is safe when only 30% of miners support segwit right now. this does not set strong precedent and is not safe at all. if there is more support for segwit then it is ok but right now uasf should not be advocated 
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:17:53
this is pushing for a fork to occur though no? either this is how it is or we reject your blocks. i mean this is fine when the miner backed hashrate is &gt;50% but uasf does not care about the hashrate being &gt;50% it will let anything happen which is where low hashrate forks will occur regularly
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:43:06
but if there is little hashrate support the network is easy to attack by orphaning blocks in which case no transactions would be getting confirmations at all right? which is why more hashrate is needed to protect against these attacks.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:24:47
 shows segwit and bu support
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:29:15
who is getting forked off the network if they are now on the abandoned chain? hmm? node consensus code says the longest chain is the real chain. you are getting caught up in semantics. 
when nodes get forked off the network then nodes on both chains reject blocks from each other. the real chain lives on ignoring the shorter chain. this is basic bitcoin knowledge.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:56:11
UASF is not much different than forking. for example and simplicity if there are only bu miners and core miners and some users are broadcasting bu txs and others are broadcasting segwit txs then both txs are getting rejected by the counterpart miners which is essentially two seperate chains because there is no consensus among miners which block is valid, hence creating a fork. some miners will be adding blocks to the bu chain and segwit miners will be adding to the segwit chain. they can't both co-exist in the same chain because they don't accept eachother's blocks
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:15:16
but how is allowing activation of segwit with &lt;50% of the network hashrate ok though? obviously segwit miners will still accept &lt;1mb blocks but with uasf anything goes we will have bu blocks &gt;1mb, possibly other alternatives etc and things will get messy. this needs serious considerations
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:05:05
I know blocks &lt;1mb will still be mined whether bu or not but when it is a user-choose-world then the network will fork because segwit blocks will exist, bu &gt;1mb blocks will exist and the network will fork and both chains only currently have a fraction of miner support in the bitcoin network right now. this is not acceptable. there is a reason why &gt;51% is the standard for forking in bitcoin because that is secure.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:32:06
in a bu hardfork core nodes will be booted off the network onto the wrong chain. does not matter what would happen now till a fork actually happens
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:23:29
segwit nodes will not accept blocks &gt;1mb, this is well known. segwit's 1.7x savings are in the witness data which is not stored in the block at all. so that is false
oh i have read the code and am not a bu person, funny how you automatically cling to that. BU is crap and segwit is a malleability fix. we need more real scaling work being done not sacrificing security for it, let me know when that proposal exists.
