I  am guessing this is what you are saying: "If bitcoin is 'banned' in China then it must be a good thing for bitcoin because it shows that bitcoin is a credible innovative technology and Chinese authorities are scared of it" 
I have two masters degree and have been in bitcoin business for years now and I understand it very well that bitcoin pose a serious threat to the Central Banking systems and to the dollar's global dominance as a reserve currency. But i think this factor has been overplayed in the bitcoin community and exaggerated by certain people for profit. And now we are in a stage as if the Central Bank of China has no other business to do but only focuses on bitcoin and gives an announcement every month. This is absurd.  All I am saying is we need to start asking the right questions. And the classic solution is always to follow the money. We have to ask ourselves who benefit from these rumors.

but if you were the developer, wouldn't you think it is better to strengthen the code first and then open source it? I think it was a fair decision.

Greedy Lehman Brothers Inc. speculated with sub-prime mortgages and eventually it led to their bankruptcy and left the economy in a big mess. The exchanges run by Lee brothers are speculating with the price of bitcoin and fueling rumors and this is damaging the bitcoin economy. If these greedy bitcoin price speculations continue, it will keep the new investors away from investing in bitcoin and the existing ones will sell their bitcoins and move on to more stables commodities like  gold and silver and so on.

I watched the video but that doesn't seems like decentralized. Again video was not complete and missed many details but it gave an impression that there is still a need for some sort of trust. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:38:37
That was my impression as well :D

Yes, China is not a democracy and the regime there has unlimited power. They previously arrested influential bankers and multi-billionaire businessmen. As a bitcoin community member, I am keep asking myself these questions. Why is it that the exchange operators are walking freely and trying to introduce new ways of avoiding government bans? It would make more sense if China arrested the exchange operators and show example out of them. All these show that these bans are the figment of exchange operators' imagination. They are not only getting rich by massive transaction fees but also gonna buy up cheap coins after the upcoming price crash. This is a get quick rich scheme for them and they don't give a fuck about how damaging this is for the crypto currencies' image.

it might be because of the ECB news.

@_date: 2014-04-26 14:11:47
yes, these are very good points. The West is working on more merchant adoption, more startups and more investments. Chinese exchanges are fueling speculation and making huge profits out of it. The entire reason behind bitcoin was/is to get rid of Centralized too big to fail greedy banking system and not to replace them with centralized greedy too big to fail exchanges. People like Lee brothers are the Lehman Brothers of the bitcoin industry.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:47:44
it is open source ;) 
 
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:19:57
If that was the case then they would just arrest the exchange operators and ban all banks from interacting with exchanges and enforce it!. Not to give one announcement every month. I understand that government cannot ban bitcoin itself. But Chinese government in the past arrested and tried bank owners. How is it that Lee brothers walk freely in the country? This is bullshit! 
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:12:32
Thanks, I will post there as well.

To be honest, I am a bitcoin holder as well. but i hate to put all my eggs in one basket. No matter what everyone says I see a potential in Darkcoin. Plus getting &gt;20% ROI from a masternode is great stable cash stream. These little devils work hard for you to bring money home :) Banks in Europe pays shitty sub 1% ROI on savings. Screw that.

dude, your investment in bitcoin is gone :D Bitcoin is heading to below 100$ ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:01:26
Dude, you are not alone. Unless you need the money urgently, don't sell now! Just wait till Christmas and if price doesn't recover then cut your losses.

When the fuck wall street bough that much coin in the first place? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:27:19
I would buy it for &gt; .00000004 cents ;) 
P.S. That explains why price can never go down to 0$ because there will always be an idiot who would pay for it :D 
@_date: 2014-04-18 06:22:39
I just tried to withdraw my bitcoins and it is still pending for almost an hour. wtf? This never happened before and I have a verified account it them. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:28:06
Good point. But girls should have known that "quadrupled investment" happened because of the 'magic beans" in the first place.

Seriously folks, you all are suffering from tunnel vision. Time to wake up. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:51:19
how you gonna solve the per day transaction limit? :) At this stage, there is a very high chance that a hard fork might kill the coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:54:51
Big online exchanges are the worst things that happened to crypto-currencies. One solution would be to decentralize exchanges. If ordinary people tried to avoid big exchanges and instead bough and sold to each-other through mobile apps then it would weaken the monopoly of the too big to fail exchanges.

This is supposed to be a negative news about Darkcoin but price of Dark is skyrocketing. wtf? :D 
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:30:47
I don't have a crystal ball but i think people need to wake up about blindly worshipping to bitcoin. What we call "just an alt-coin" might be the technology of the future. There are really smart guys working on different ideas. You can ignore them as much as you want but make sure you don't find yourself still using Alavista while everyone else moved on to Google ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:26:37
dude, chilax. I am just sharing the article. It is relevant to bitcoin because Darkcoin claims to address two major issues: privacy and instant transactions. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:30:36
Tried it already a couple of days ago with a friend's account. It didn't allow me to send to a trade key either.

yes, this is a proof that ECB's measures do not work and they are doomed to go into even deeper recession. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:05:00
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:05:33
It is hard to show/prove the exact causality on bitcoin price movement but right at the same time with this ECB announcement, the price of bitcoin jumped 20$. Could be a coincident but I believe this new policy will have even greater impact on bitcoin market in the near future. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:42:16
dude, the fact that majority of Bitcoin's hash power comes from 1-2 industrial mining pools makes me doubt that bitcoin is truly decentralized. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:58:22
bitcoin cannot absorb it because it is based on masternode technology ;)

Oh no! Bitcoin price is slowly going up again. Chinese exchanges must come up with a new rumor. Hurry up! (sarcasm) 
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:55:21
Yea, but it is not only about the core team. The whole network has to accept the upgrade. That's why it is called decentralized. And with hard forks, there is always a risk of network forking into multiple direction. Anyhow, thank you for your contribution and sorry that i was rude earlier ;) 
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:21:27
Any major change bitcoin tries to implement will require a fork and we all know how risky it is. Zerocash promised to be available in October but there is still no news from them. I am guessing they will take a couple more years before producing a functioning coin.
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:24:04
This is interesting. Chinese bitcoin miners need to offer bitcoin for cash services. That way wealthy Chinese can turn their money into bitcoin without leaving a bank transfer trace. Once they have bitcoin, it should be relatively easy to move it out of China. If they are afraid of leaving Bitcoin trace then turning it into Darkcoin would solve that problem as well.  
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:53:49
I advice you to read more about Darkcoin, especially about masternode network ;) I can tell your knowledge on that sphere is limited. I am not here to convert anyone. Just sharing innovation etc.

Yes, I tried to withdraw some bitcoins and dogecoins as well but they got stuck as well. That's why now I have 7 withdrawal that are stuck. I have already opened account in mintpal and now trade there. So far works just fine and the support is very professional. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:38:14
works fine? don't kid yourself man. It takes forever for bitcoin to confirm lol 
Plus it has scalability issue..limited transactions per day..needs a hard fork blah blah 
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:38:14
Soon Europeans will have to pay extra fees to the banks. how else banks are going to cover their losses from negative interest rate? :D This will inevitably lead to people taking out their money in cash or invest in somewhere else.

You can see 251 DRK in the account and the rest is stuck in withdrawal (says pending)

I just read all the comments you made during last two days. All of them are totally arrogant and clueless. Most probably you are an American. Time to wake up. Go read about history of media and how it has been used to manipulate voters or consumers etc.  Media usually run after a sensational news or post what the highest bidder tells them to post. I have no time to explain it to you here. 
Besides, I did not say "media is posting FUD so they can buy cheap bitcoin" I said media is being used to discredit bitcoin and crash its price so that before the next bubble whoever is behind this media FUD can buy cheap coins for themselves. I have seen similar manipulations in crypto industry over and over in last 5 years. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:12:49
Bitcoin has come to a point where individuals' opinions are irrelevant. But I could not help to notice that almost all the major media outlets are posting the same thing without even bothering to change the title to something original :)  This is a classic Wall Street trap- declare something (stock or commodity) worthless and then buy it all cheap. My conclusion is that it might be a great time to buy bitcoins cheap ;)

could you please elaborate?  From your previous comments I see you are a big fan of Bitfinex? :) 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:10:17
I don't. But in the above link i shared you can see at least half a million bitcoins stuck in just a 3-4 exchanges. Clearly millions of people still using the centralized exchanges to store their coins. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:00:08
could you please elaborate what you mean by "fancy cryptography"?
Yes, i know that the ideal scenario is to do the audit via trusted auditors (or even better to use P2P exchanges) but we do not live in an ideal world. Plus i would not trust any "trusted" auditors. Good example is the so called Big 4 auditing companies- i think it is no secret that most of these companies are in bed with the banking cartel (read below link if you are in the mood) . So there is a big chance, the crypto auditors also will be corrupted. Power always corrupts, that's why we need an alternative- decentralized auditing. The whole point of Bitcoin is to give power to the people. If auditing was the solution then we all could have kept our money in the banks and trusted the banks' auditors.
But i get your point on technicality. Yes, exchanges maybe struggling with this massive demand. Perhaps then we can do it a week long event. Users submit their withdrawals and exchanges orderly execute it through a week without jeopardizing security of their holdings.
