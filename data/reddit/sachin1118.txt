Idk why I'm laughing my ass off

Thank you so much for making this, it's a great app! Couple questions, is there a way to lock it to a part of your desktop so it's always there and doesn't act like a window? And, which exchange do you use to get your prices, because they seem a little bit off from popular markets like Coinbase and Binance?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:29:13
Not only cheaper, it's free for limit trades
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:51:51
What if 5 years from now we'll be looking at this like, "lol they counted in $1000 checkpoints, we count in $1m checkpoints today"

This annoyed me so much because when I first started out, I was waiting for the transaction from my bank account so I would avoid fees, but I coyldnt wait, so I tried with $25 from my debit card. That was exactly .01 BTC and when I tried to sell it, it didn't work and I had to watch it drop all the way to $20. It was only $25 but the issue needs to be adjusted for.

Ask your parents to open an account for you? I'm sure you could just maintain the account after they open it for you.

Do you still use a bank? If so, you can deposit your paychecks into your checking account, and from there you can deposit that into any exchange (I prefer GDAX). Then, export it into any wallet you want. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:32:28
nvm, mods got it back.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:32:51
Got the money back btw
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:30:52
This just happened to me today... did you get the money back? If so, how?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:27:05
Other people leave btc addresses on some posts so i thought i'd do the same. Sorry if it came off harsh.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:05:06
Sorry, did not see that. Apologies.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:26:03
Already did. He was banned. Why report this tho?
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:04:44
I've seen it before, 25 cents here and there. No need to be a prick about it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:30:51
The original intent of the post was to find out how to get my money back on paxful. The next part was just an add-on. I've seen a lot of posts where people say "broke and need money," and people are willing to donate a few cents. I'm truly sorry if I sound like a scammer. Here's a [screenshot]( and [another]( of the chat history. I was just looking for some help, that's all. No other intentions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:06:37
Wow that's amazing. What is the price of B2x expected to be?
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:08:31
Nobody asked a question
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:29:37
My friend's dad knew about bitcoin back in 2010 and was like "This will never take off." It was worth 46 cents at the time. $100 back then would've been $1.65 million today
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:27:56
At least you made a nice profit
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:06:12
Very true, but he invested in other stocks at that time and still hasn't let go of them. They never took off like bitcoin however.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:36:51

I'd say now isn't a terrible time, but watch the market closely. Invest in short intervals, i.e. put money in the market in the morning, check prices a few times a day, and pull it at night. Leaving it overnight is risky now, because no one can really predict what will happen.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:47:04
Fuck me, it physically hurts when I see the market change...
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:37:51
Damn, this is going to take forever. With my luck, btc will be like $10k by the time I get approved
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:12:44
Thanks. I have a much better understanding now, but I still don't get what BIP148 is and what it does. Just a sentence or two is enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:44:23
They even have prices under normal sometimes
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:01:26
Thanks for the info, man I really wish it was earlier I need to invest asap
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:56:46
When did your buddy do it?
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:38:09
I'm facing the same thing as you, with a couple changes. I'm pretty obsessed with bitcoin right now as well, but I wouldn't say my life revolves around it or anything. My Gemini account is still undergoing verification for 5 days, and it annoys the living hell out of me knowing I can't buy/sell yet (and coinbase's fees are just too high for me to start there). Try investing small amounts regularly, like $10/week or $100/month, and forget about it. In the later years, prices will be much higher than it is now, and you'll be happy you invested.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:33:22
But how does that affect identity verification?
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:05:30
Honestly, this thread should probably be in r/explainlikeimfive. I barely know anything about bitcoin, so could you explain it like I don't even know what bitcoin is?
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:36:41
How long did verification take for you?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:57:54
Many people consider it an investment, just like investing in stocks.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:27:41
The 230 and 200 transactions appeared in my account and the $50 transaction just disappeared but no money was taken from my bank account so I guess it's okay. Still waiting on Gemini to approve my account. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:15:50
2 weeks and counting... emailed them 6 times so far, any tips for what I should do next. I've already gotten started with GDAX.
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:24:02
BTC will probably be 5 million by the time I get verified... looking at localbitcoins now
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:15:27
How did your friend get verified so quickly? That was right when all the btc hype was, and I signed up that same time too, but I'm still waiting for verification...
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:31:02
Which documents did you submit? From the looks of it, I think I applied before you and I'm still waiting. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:09:53
Gemini is probably the best one, but they take forever to verify your account. Crazy low fees (never exceeds .25%)
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:22:03
It's always been like this, and as soon as I get verified on Gemini I'll try it. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:18:03
4 Bitcoins omg that could've been 10k+
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:22:21
Did they respond each time with the generic "high volume of applications" response each time? If they didn't, what did you say and what did they say?
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:03:21
Can you give me a rough estimate? Also, what's the next exchange with the lowest fees after Gemini?
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:02:44
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:29:34
Alright then. This is starting to get very annoying.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:31:18
Coinbase doesn't take long, but their fees are ridiculously high. And Gemini takes forever, but their fees are ridiculously low. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:15:10
Why did Chase close you down for having too many bitcoin transactions? How does it affect them?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:18:04
Ok thanks. 
EDIT: Damn, why didn't I think of this already. Another question tho, is there any way for it to display the current price on the lock screen itself instead of swiping over. Sort of like when you receive a text.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:16:41
3 days is nothing. I've been waiting for more than 2 weeks now, and I know some people that have been waiting for more than a month.
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:35:27
Any update?
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:34:51
Try using a VPN and spoofing your location to a different country, not sure how legal this is...
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:16:00
I'd love to use it but it's been 2 weeks and the price has gone up $1000 since I was planning to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:52:26
Any update? I still haven't gotten my verification and it's been 12 days. Did you get approved on any of the other exchanges with low fees?
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:01:40
Both GDAX and Gemini cover transaction fees, but I think you have to wait for the ach transfer to go through before transferring bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:53:55
Gemini. Verification takes forever, but fees are dead cheap. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:50:22
It has insanely high fees tho. I'd have to wait for the price to jump nearly 80 bucks before selling just to break even, whereas on Gemini it's closer to 12. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:52:46
Interesting. But the savings account was just for day by day trading. I'm also depositing around $10-20/wk for long term investments. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:38:11
I've sent them a message 4 times, and each time I've gotten the same generic response. 
"Thanks for reaching out. Recently there has been a steep increase in the number of signups which has caused a delay in our manual review process. We are working through the applications as quickly as possible and hope to have you verified very shortly."
I'm not sure what to do now because every time I contact them, I'm just going to get this email again. Do they have a phone number for contact?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:07:30
Just in case. Like today, the price dropped $500
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:15:57
Ok good. It's been about 2 weeks for me and nothing yet. I'll start emailing them again. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:17:53
Widgets are the things that show up on your lock screen and are easily accessible
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:49:34
Amazing. Just amazing. Probably just going to stick with GDAX at this point, they don't have fees for limit orders either (which verified my identity in a mere 4 minutes)
