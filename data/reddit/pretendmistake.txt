You watch too much Mr. Robot.
If USD goes down (and by down I figure you mean DOWN DOWN... like massive collapse vs 2008), there will be a chain reaction that will make many other economies collapse.  Your BTC will not be very useful when all of the systems required for the Internet to work (computers, phones, electricity, etc.) become too expensive or simply unavailable due to regional infrastructure collapse.  
You may get lucky and a closed off nation like China is still self-sufficient and somewhat shielded from the global economic meltdown, but then again you would be in China and their fiat would be relatively unscathed.  But that is an unlikely possibility too.
In other words, thinking you will do substantially better than others by holding BTC when the USD collapses is pretty wishful thinking.  You should be just as worried about that risk, as remote as it is.
But USD collapse isn't a risk that's heavily considered when diversifying, for reasons mentioned.  Sure, gold and metals are purchased for this reason (and I would much rather have these during the global economic collapse than bitcoin). But business cycle downturns are certainly.

Yea, I think I am ... and that there are so many replies that are incorrect (esp the one who thinks a private key is a one to one match with a public key-&gt;address) is scary.
This would probably be better illustrated with smaller exponent values that are more readily written in decimal, which mere mortal non-mathmagicians can understand.
For example consider the private key address space of 10^3 or [000,001,002,..,101,102,..,998,999].  Let's say the public key hash formula is just to remove the first digit.  So the public key address space is 10^2 or [00,01,02,..,98,99].  And the public key to address algorithm is to just add one to the last digit so still 10^2 or [01,02,03,..,99,00].  In this scenario, while there are 10^3 or 1000 potential private keys, you only need to discover one of the 10^1 or [002,102,202,..,902] that hashes to the the same public key (02 in this example).  In this case there are 10^3 / 10^2 or 10^1 ... or ten  possible collisions for every private key to hash to the same public key (and same address).  And if you find one of those nine collisions or the original private key (ten in all) you have full control of the coins at that address.
Of course while 2^96 seems like a lot ... it is still a very very very very very very small percentage of the total address space of 2^256.  So it is still, by current technology, safe from this type of attack as a practical matter.

Around $20,000.  When it hit $18-19,000 I had decided that was my selling point.  After taxes I would have about $1.6-1.7 million.  Of which, $1.5M I'd put into less risky investments like junk bonds and oil exploration stocks (/s), and spend anything over that on things I could spend some money on right now like car, hair, teeth, a week at Caesars.  You know,  important stuff (not /s).
However I was unable to get my coins out of cold storage and into an exchange before the price went down.  I kept waiting for a little bump but it never happened, and I watched it go down to $6,000.  Still holding.
Cost basis was about $15,000.
$20,000 also has another significance to me.  When I bought five years ago, and I was looking at the value of the BTC money supply in USD (what people erroneously call the market cap), I did some napkin math compared to other financial instruments and realized if it ever hit $10,000 I'd be pretty rich, which was pie-in-the-sky then but ... fuck the math worked.  So did $20,000,  That would make it a $400 billion money supply, which is a fraction of something like Gold, or even comparable to a company like Apple at the time.  And BTC had a huge first-mover advantage.
Now that I see $20,000 was in reach and may happen again, that is my sell-out point.  Even if it goes to $40,000, I'd be happy with 'taking the money and run'.    I may also cash out sooner.  I am really close to that 'take the money and run' midset, and diversify properly.  This shit still has huge risks that need to be considered.

Criminals can't be trusted to make fraudulent purchases using other people's information, and leaving the banks and consumers at a high risk of losses.  
Not /s
Blocking use of CC and DC when it's a financial loss with some purchases is just a wise choice.  The banks don't really give a fuck what you spend on as long as it is legal and doesn't incur a loss to them.  When it incurs a loss that has to be passed on to the consumers who then have to pay more who then go to another bank who is willing to piss off the 1% of the customers in order to not piss off the other 99% with higher fees... then it makes sense.

You said, 


"We all" would include the many people who use exchanges to hold their traditional government-backed currency as well as their crypto.  Even if for a brief period in order to conduct an exchange, those exchanges have fiduciary responsibilities to their clients.
And I pointed out that the reasons there are layers and layers of bureaucracy is to safeguard against malfeasance, error, malfunction, and disaster.  All of which can happen to exchanges or private individuals.  So eliminating those layers and layers of protection by using crypto as a currency instead of other currencies that banks use does not actually provide much benefit.  Those reasons are still just as valid, both to the exchanges who have a fiduciary responsibility to their clients as well as to the individual who simply doesn't want to lose their money because a hard drive crashed.
Get it?  No, I am sure you don't.

Don't be fucking daft.  You are unaware of Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, Coincheck, Bitgrail, etc. being hacked due to shitty piss-poor security measures?  Layers and layers of security weren't needed there.  (/s)
Or that even someone like Wozniak got bamboozled for several bitcoin?
Are you really ignorant that these crimes took place?  That crypto in itself doesn't shield you from criminals?
And you know bad actors aren't the only reason there are layers and layers of people looking and checking.  Security also involves protecting against human error, system failures, etc.   And it doesn't come cheap.
I have to guess you don't know anything at all about information systems from an organizational perspective.  It is a little bit more involved than downloading whatever app you fancy and running it on your iPad.  Even with Crypto.

And if you think the risk profiles of BTC, VEF, and USD are the same then you're outright insane.  BTC is still &gt;&gt;incredibly&lt;&lt; risky, and could easily collapse to being virtually worthless overnight. And the world economy would barely notice anything happened (except for a few stores on CNBC and Fox Business).  The same is not true for USD.  Not by a longshot.  If the USD collapsed, the world would go into chaos (remember what 2008 was like?  How about 1929?).  
And if the USD were to completely collapse (or say drop to 1/3 it's value like BTC recently did) to the point of global economic meltdown, BTC would also likely follow as well.  BTC simply does not have the stability and recognition on the world stage right now that people would flock to it and quickly adopt it (despite Mr Robot portrayal).  I'd much prefer something like Gold.  So even if your into BTC to hedge yourself against the USD becoming the next VEF, it's (in my opinion) a terrible move.

If someone gained your debit card to buy $10,000 (or whatever max) for themselves and you are stuck with that charge, would you be OK with that?  
Banks are doing reasonable security.  If you want to buy, transfer funds to the exchange and then buy.  Don't force the banks to accept risky transactions that are prone to fraud.

were you unclear of dumbfuck?  
Debit cards are prone to greater fraud because people readily provide the number and pin in a variety of circumstances.  They dont, however, often give criminals access to the same information to commit ach and wire transfer fraud.
Blocking debit cards from being used for this type of purchase is reasonable security for the same reasons they blocked credit cards.

You are utterly clueless of what you speak.   Bitcoin is not a stock.  It's not even an investment. It's a speculative play that there will be greater fools in the future.  So you are comparing apples and oranges.  
Compare it with money.  Actual money.  It is a store of value.  Nothing more.  It is not an income producing asset like an equity that is priced based on future expected income (theoretically).
The M1 of the US Dollar is only $3.6 T, and that's the money supply for the currency of the strongest economic power on the planet that has ever existed.   That covers all coin, cash, demand and other checkable deposits.  You are positing that Bitcoin will the equivalent of over five times that amount.


You live in fantasyland.  
Fuck you're not even usig the right term.  Saying it is a "market cap" proves you have no idea what you are talking about.  It's the same incorrectly used term that everyone else uses.  Hint: have you ever heard of any economist ever referring to the market cap of the Euro or Yen?   Saying the value of all btc is worth $20t is a money supply in USD.  It isn't a  MARKET CAP (all caps for mocking emphasis).

So the bank won't process a wire transfer and you're surprised they won't allow debit cards which is even more prone to fraud?
You really are stupid.
Also, paying by debit card is an instant purchase, and is different from depositing money into your coinbase account via wire transfer.  But don't let **that detail** deter you from whatever dumbshit thing you have to say next.
Also, pointing out that you're mildly retarded dumbfuck isn't an ad hominem fallacy.  It directly on point that you don't know what the fuck you speak of.  If I called you a short ugly piece of shit, then THAT  would be an ad hominem fallacy, because being short or ugly is an irrelevant trait to you're also being an ignorant dumbfuck about what you speak.

It is even easier to just block the transactions all together and risk upsetting the half dozen or so people who would want to do it vs the several dozen who are just using stolen card info.
Also, you have never worked for a bank.  Nothing is "dead simple" and "very cheap".  Rebooting a single computer required at least 48 hours notice, could only happen during a specific window during the week, and needed a half-dozen plus people to authorize it.  Miss one signature on a Friday because they went home for the weekend? Its not getting done till next weekend.  
Adding a batch script or changing permissions on a file was even worse.  EVERYONE had to review it.
Don't even get me started on the complexities of trying to orchestrate OS patches.  Get one thing wrong on the exact instructions that the server team in Singapore would have to follow (who basically just blindly push keys),
 and expect to have to get a vice-president on the phone at 2am on a Sunday here in the states to authorize the changes.

Not sure if this is correct.  This is for finding a SPECIFIC key.  Except what you need is to find one of the many keys that have a collision with a specific key that map to the same public key/bitcoin address.  And there are 2^96 of them. Find one of those, and it's just as good as finding the specific key.
Am I incorrect in this understanding?  I may be.
