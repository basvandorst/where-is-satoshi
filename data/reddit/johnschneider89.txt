They quit making the Replicator 1 a couple years ago. Are you talking about the [Replicator (5th Gen)](
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:11:18
If you're in Europe, I'd go with the Ultimaker 2. It's a nice machine at a decent price. If you're in North America, go with a MakerBot. The overseas shipping ended up making the cost difference negligible, at least the last time I looked.
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:35:01
Not at the moment, no. We're operating out of MELD Workshop right now, so if there are some things you need, we can get them in and you can pick them up in person there. Just shoot me a message if you think it's something you'd like to do.

UPDATE: [we are now accepting Bitcoin]( Thanks again for all of your input and advice.
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:57:17
No, because it costs to much to get it here from Europe, just to pay to ship it somewhere again. 
Though, if you know someone from Ultimaker who really wants an American distributor, ask them to get in touch :)

UPDATE: Thanks for the suggestions, I was able to convince him! He's more of an old-school guy, so it took a fair bit of explaining what Bitcoin was. Not surprisingly, he got most excited by the low transaction fee of BitPay and that it didn't take much to set it up. He also hadn't realized how aligned the 3D printing and Bitcoin communities were until I showed him the results of this post, so thanks for that.
We're waiting for our business info to be verified so that we can accept more than $100 in daily transactions via BitPay. I'll update this post once that's been taken care of and BitPay is hooked up to our site. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:29:18
Awesome, thank-you!
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:13:40
What can I do to tempt you further? :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:40:49
I think you'd have to have a gasket to form a water tight seal between two pieces. If you'd do this, you'll need to print in ABS plastic, since PLA is biodegradable, continued exposure to water will cause it to eventually break down. 
The Replicator 2X is the only printer we carry at the moment that can print in ABS.

We're taking preorders for the [Replicator Mini]( right now which is $1,375
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:50:38
We do have international delivery, though we are currently unable to offer a wholesale discount on the printers.

Silly me, forgot to post the discount!

That depends, are you an average Joe that likes to be on the cutting edge? If you aren't interested in creating your own 3D designs to print, it may not be of much interest to you, although there is [Thingiverse]( a site where other people have made their designs available to download for free. There's some pretty neat, as well as some useful, designs on there.

As far as I know there isn't currently an open-source metal 3D printer that has quality that we'd stand behind.

Second icon from the left ;)
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:34:44
I'll see what I can do.
I'm also working on a banner image for the site, right now it's not completely obvious I accept it.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:09:49
Ha! Yeah, that'll definitely convince him.
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:55:49
To answer the number of customers question, no, hasn't increased at all. In fact, even though traffic has increased tremendously, there haven't been any Bitcoin sales. 
Our online sales volume overall is low enough that I can see 35 people, referred by Bitcoin-related articles and this post, who added an item to the shopping cart, began the checkout process, but then abandoned it.
I'm trying to figure out what the bottleneck is.

Yep. I'm the founder of [MELD Workshop]( and co-founder of Fargo 3D Printing. We're currently operating out of the MELD Workshop space.

There is an option to add a second extruder and we are currently working on a design for an enclosure :)

Oh gosh no, we accept PayPal and all the major credit cards too!

Hey! I'm the owner of Fargo 3D Printing! Thanks for the shoutout :)
We also carry 3D Systems [Cube]( and [CubePro]( line and are looking at carrying the Ultimaker line. 
On top of that, we're getting into the filament manufacturing game this winter!

Sounds good to me! Sorry about not being an Ultimaker reseller, just doesn't make business sense at the moment :/
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:23:56
OK, that's definitely something I'll look into. I've been pretty impressed by the build quality of the new Printrbots
@_date: 2014-04-27 05:33:42
Yeah, I don't think highlighting this post to him will really help the cause either. . 
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:26:36
That article is certainly correct, those are two of the biggest hassles with desktop 3D printers in the sub-$5,000 range.
The MakerBot machine we use most right now, the [Replicator 2]( has to be manually leveled by sliding a piece of paper between the nozzle and build platform and making sure that the friction between the two are the same in all areas of the build plate. There's a software script that guides you through this, and adjustment is done via three knobs on the bottom.
On the new [Replicator 5th Gen]( it has a hardware feature in the extruder that will detect and set the height automatically. It will detect if the bed isn't level and tell you what direction to turn one of the two knobs on the bottom until it is level.
Usually after leveling the build platform, we only have to relevel if we move the 3D printer (which we end up doing every week or two when we attend tradeshows).
As for the filament jamming, this can come down to dirty filament or cheap quality filament. The MakerBot stuff is pretty good. There's other stuff out there that is equally good or better, but it's tough to sort the good stuff from the bad; there are dozens of different filament suppliers.
The extruder on the new 5th Gen will detect jams and pause the print so that it can be cleared and the print resumed. On the older machines, like the Replicator 2, jams are rare, but when they do happen your print is essentially scrap, as there is no way to pick up where you left off.
I hope that cleared some things up! If I didn't answer something, or caused you to think of new questions, please let me know.
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:13:24
First, just added the discount, completely forgot it in the initial post: BITCOIN5 will get you 5% off your total order.
The additional features are mainly convenience to make it easier to print. There are ways to make a Replicator 2 do most of the things of the 5th Gen, it's just much "hackier".
The leveling assistance is by far the most useful of the new features.
There is a gauge in the extruder, it takes a measurement at two points of the print bed, then displays on the screen which direction to turn the adjustment know to make it level. It does this for both the x and y-axes. It will indicate both on-screen and via a light on the extruder when it's level.
The built in camera is nice, since you can check how a print is doing via a mobile or desktop app, or via the direct IP address in your browser.
This printer is network capable, so you can send prints via the network, instead of only via USB or SD card.
The new extruder will detect when there's a filament jam, or when it runs out, and will pause the print and push a notification to the app. That allows you to fix the issue and pick up where the print left off. Very handy for 20-hour prints.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:42:07
It IS nice to have the dual extruders so that you can print with soluble filament for the support structure. ABS, well, I don't like the hassle of worrying about warping, but the heated bed is nice.
PLA needs to have an active cooling fan directing air on it so that it cools down quickly and doesn't get all goopy and distorted. The 2X doesn't have the cooling fan to do that, since it was designed to print only with ABS (which has the opposite problem, it need to cool down slowly and evenly).
It's fairly easy to add an active cooling fan duct, thanks to the awesome folks on [Thingiverse]( who have already designed one. It's just a matter of printing it, installing it, and hooking it up electrically.

Wow, well, I'm glad I decided to have Shopify handle the retail side of the makerspace I run. We're just an upstart and one of the things that we're doing to generate some early revenue is doing custom laser engraving. One of the items on the store right now is a custom laser engraved mugs. Soon we'll be distributing products from sparkfun, so it should start to be pretty exciting. We're at 
Very cool to see Bitcoin used more and more practically!
