Are you really heaving problems comprehending this?
Even so-called "limited edition" chips can be trivially printed in millions
if only their owner wishes so (e.g. while lying there is limited number),
and/or easily falsified / counterfeited.
With Bitcoin this is of course impossible, someone needs to spend over ~8,000 USD per 1 Bitcoin in electricity and in mining hardware amortization.

mr. Trump was talking that about Jeffrey Epstein the now-convicted child sex pimp , before Epstein was convicted or before it was well known to public what he does.
Trump could had just said "watch out guys, he's facilitating underage woman prostitution and pimping them and buying their services himself" - aaaand he would get sued into ground by the very wealthy Epstein who has many top-tire politicians from Clinton let's say "good connection with" (or we could guess - he might be black mailing them after they took on his offer of underage sex).
So instead he said as much as he could without being sued - " many of them are on the younger side." 
Good that he did at least that.

Yes, this really annoys me, that we seem to be somewhat brainwashed by current powers that be, to look at best possible scenarios about demoracy  and assume everyone wants the same thing (bulllshit), no one does corruption and such (b.s.).
But when we look at freedom - like sale-reliance, self-independence, no or low taxation, private roads etc then it's the opposite: people can not organize anything, no investors will appear for anything, etc.
Bitcoin, and overall [somewhat] free market capitalism, shown me that things can work.
Bitcoin is most unregulated thing ever, and it deals very well with it's problems, despite lack of gov. or "anti monopoly laws" and such.

When Amaury Séchet ( ) copied the Schnorr signatures from Bitcoin's developers - from Bitcoin Core then it was wrongly attributed:
It came to my attention today that bcash developer Amaury SECHET (deadalnix) wholesale copied the migration to the per-txout UTXO database from the Bitcoin Core project ( 611284f ) while affixing his name and stripping off the name of the change's author. This commit is more or less a 1:1 copy from Bitcoin Core, down to copying grammatical oddities in comments.
Beyond being fraudulent and sleazy behavior, this action is a violation of the very minimal requirements of the MIT license.
And not only does it not provide the required attribution information, Amaury is running around in public claiming to have fixed the issue faster than Bitcoin Core when his fix was copied from our project (which is what brought my attention to this issue in the first place). [E.g. his interview with "trustnodes" states: The vulnerability has not been patched in Bitcoin Core. The reason for their failure to do so remains unclear. [...] Sachets took two days to implement the patch, he says, while Bitcoin Core still hasn’t at the time of writing.]
Amaury SECHET has a well known history of these copyright violating false attribution events: e.g.  and  to give a few other examples. I also understand that he is advocating in your private issue tracker to remove all attribution to Bitcoin Core in the codebase from your repository.
Please discontinue the copyright infringement, correct your repository to credit the actual authors of the changes, and avoid similar unprofessional conduct in the future.

Not everyone will agree with "taxation is theft" (even though that is true), but at least we can certainly agree on this facts:
* choice to work at a factory (for a low wage) instead in village (even lower wage), or doing own business (even lower since it will flop since you do not have the skill and talent) - is voluntary
* being taxed - is not voluntary. Escaping to other country is rather hard sadly. Escaping to other factory is much easier.

Be careful with Samourai, they request users to do crazy things, like to open RPC access to own full node to get the "trusted node" mode.
A sane thing would be instead for the wallet to talk via P2P to your node.
RPC is very bad used like that (e.g. not encrypted - zero privacy).   [edit: well maybe some privacy, depending what exactly commands are sent there... if it's just querying blocks same as it would via P2P then today it is similar to P2P, just silly, and a security risk if your mobile wallet is compromised.  And if it would do things like RPC to sendrawtransaction, then it would be harmful to privacy too, somewhat if used with coinjoin, or total unmasking if done normally]

0-conf is not secure AT ALL, no matter how well tx is propagated, miner ALWAYS can just include opposing/hostile version of the TX, even for 1 cent more in fees.
Your economical defence of "but to just steal few bucks, people will be afraid *to go on cameeraaaaa*" is
1) cryptographlicaly nonsesne
2) naive, as it does not take into account attacks can be batched, and not all things are brick-and-store IRL shops
To summarize, 0-conf is totally NOT secured by cryptography, it is secured only by your ability to catch the payer if his 0-conf would not go in in next block but would be invalidated.

Instead of YOU feeling good about forcing everyone to be ROBBED out of their money and be given to some lazy bastards **no matter do they work, or do they drink in home all day, or are they serial rapists - all get the same amount of money, taken from people who actually work**.
Communism with a new name.

So what, what I written above is correct: from neurosurgeon to drug addict hobo, everyone gets 1000$.
Yes, sure, in addition neurosurgeon will get additional 50,000$. Of which most will be taken away for taxes to fund that 1000$ for other people.
It's a robbery, but it is ok since part of that money (after paying off politicians, tax police etc) goes to everyone including undeserving.
It's just a new name for communism, it already was tried many times and always failed.
Thanks, I would rather keep using Bitcoin, where no such shit economical mechanisms exist.


Blah blah, **you just want to feel good about yourself, while taking my money to do it**.

confidence function of CRYPTOGRAPHIC security for bitcoin 0 conf is reaaaly easy:
f( time , propagated_nodes_counts , block_height , hashpower_of_bribable_miners ) = 1.0 - hashpower_of_bribable_miners

As for some "business / IRL security", well ok whatever, but just remember it is NOT secured by crypto.

This is not UBI. UBI is the communistic idea to give money to every man no matter what that man does, same money to teacher, same to a neuro-surgeon, same to a drunk sitting in home all day, same to a narcoman wondering the streets at night trying to steal some cash, same to convicted serial rapist.
Every one of them gets say 1000$ a month. For nothing.
Taken by force from people who actually bother to work and be productive.
Please do not push this nonsense here.
The idea of giving something to 1 specific man, as a return for specific work he is doing - is just voluntarism, and is a good idea imo.

yeap and we can think about them whatever, as I just do.
Also, since they ARE a publisher house, not a neutral platform, they give up safe habour etc, and are under newspapers etc laws.
I could agree with idea to have ABSOLUTE free speech, including freedom to lie as a major publisher - but then let's have that rule applying to everyone, currently some portals pretend to be neutral platforms while doing opposite to avoid laws that apply to other publishers.

(edit) Well for easy argument: were there not a terrorist attack, in Paris? Where like 100 people where shot? And another one or few, in last years?
Try in Poland - Warsaw.
You know about topic of the "no-go zones"? For example Sweeden has many - where the police flat out refuses to drive into (and yet still some people think it's not a real problem). There are no such areas anywhere in Poland.
In France, of course the Calais is a big no-go zone. About Paris, aren't there districts where women are shunned for walking there e.g. into shops? Watched interview about this problem.
In addition, isn't there an army on the streets in France and in Paris?
Is there not a partial martial-law (or "emergency" or how ever they call it)?
This is not normal for 1-st world country with civilization to have army on streets (to need for that). Check out also Hungary, or Czech Republic - like Prague.

Nice point. That bakery should have that right, of course. But:


That is not about "providing service", that is about being a PRESS OUTLET that avoid press-outlet laws by claiming they do no moderation. That is a lie.
Press outlets in fact can REFUSE to publish stuff. Good for them. But then they fall under laws against libel and such.
Again, if someone proposes a world (or country) where there is absolute freedom of speech, including libel and everything, then it can be considered, if that law (or lack thereof) applies to everyone.  Currently we DO have anti-libel and few other publisher laws, and they apply to all major publishers, except to twitter because it lies that it remains neutral.

Ver can play on market how ever he wants, in financial terms (buying/selling etc).
It is a problem when he starts doing frauds, like with this BTC1/segwit2x being presented as "bitcoin + segwit", or when he picks tickers and names that are taken or confuse users.  (though still, we should sort this out on our own - in decentralized, nonviolent way)
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:04:03


Either that, or they ARE responsible for content. 
It's a binary choice
1) you're a neutral platform - safe harbor style and all - not responsible for what users post on the platform
2) you're a publisher - you pick do to censors what you LIKE - ok fine, but then you ARE responsobile for content being posted.
Automated tor portals like "onion.to" - 100% automated - they censor 0% of things - they are 0% responsible for the darknet sites that are displayed through  - even if that would be CP or not, it is not their problem, they are not a publisher.
Reddit as entire platform - afaik claims neutrality, besides cases required by law
Subreddits - YES, they ARE LIABLE on various levels.
And twitter: it tries to not be liable,  and yet it censors.
By the way the discussion was about is Twitter a PLATFORM to talk to others. No it is not, it is a publisher, your right might be easily revoked, just for pure political reasons. So it's crap in that regard.


There are platforms/tools with absolute free speech. Personally I like that this exists.

No, they can sell it for 1$.
Also you do not need to succeed each time, just to be profitable overall.
You know why exchanges do not allow 0-conf even for small payments? That's exactly why - people would automate it and do 1,000 of 50 USD payments, pay total 1,000 USD in bribes, if it doesn't work then no big problem, and when it DOES work then boom, free 50,000 USD, minus costs, around 40,000 USD in hand.

Double spend [edit: on 0-conf, as we are discussing here] does not cost 1 block reorg. it costs ABSOLUTELLY NOTHING.


You seem to imply that this confidence rises in time as it gets propagated. That is not true, when 30% of hashpower would be accepting doublespend 0-confs, then confidence quickly goes from 0% to 70%, but stays at that 70% even for an hour or how long it takes to mine a blok. Only when block is mined it jumps to high level, only then it would actually COST to do the reorg.
0 reorgs for 0 conf are needed.

The altcoin created by Roger Ver, with wildly oscillating diff rate adjustment mechanism, is each few days more profitable to mine, so it "steals" some hashpower.
It will adjust in Bitcoin in around a month or so, then blocks will be back at normal speed, now they are somewhat slower.

I was speaking about Bitcoin itself, not about Bitcoin development process.
Indeed decision to tax, or give that money away to people for doing nothing, is a government level idea. Though we all know how an communist-coin or BUI-coin would do (besides initial pump possibly), no one would use that bs.
As for **voluntary** payments to developers, or some bounties, something could be organized.
The problem is always imo with transition to being paid, what then about people who are working for free - they might want to be paid as well.
A system similar to "kick starter" for reaching milestones in Bitcoin development maybe would be a way. Some things to watch out for could be:
1) who pays for the boring parts of maintenance, that neither public "wants" to pay for (it's no new future), nor people want to do for fun (it is very NOT fun). 
2) what about choosing on what to work, always some bounties can be kind of "strings attached".
As for 1, perhaps if developers would be paid for "cool features" and then among themselves attribute some % of money into boring-tasks related to maintaining, bugfixing, documentation and all such day to day work.

We don't get such mess in most of streets in Europe, also attacks and sexual harassment on streets are rare. Your observation about race of perpetrators is correct but not needed, what matters is a culture and civilization (e.g. one hostile to western values, like e.g. NOT setting cars on fire and not beating up woman who are "not properly dressed").
Paris is just not so safe place to visit this days, not as it used to be.
For me this is actually the reason to not go there. Had it been a more civilized place where walking streets is no problem, it would be better - and there are other conferences that do not have this problem. Just giving an idea, that a more accessible location could be considered in future.

Yes, once services, wallets, by default use SegWit (around a month), then new transactions will start taking less "space" (weight) and will allow more such transactions per block.
* So in around 2 months SegWit use will increase tx/block, by around 75% afair
* Also, in around 1 month bitcoin diff adjustment will retarget to compensate for altcoin "stealing" our hashpower, that will increase blocks/hour by around 50% more (back to normal 6 blocks/hour)
* In addition, payment channels are being used and lighting network tests are being run, once that works, for some uses users will do 1 onchain transaction and then for following months they can do millions of transactions without taking ANY onchain space. Once this becomes prominent over next months, more and more space onchain in blocks is freed up
Overall in next months fees should lower, and in a half-year they should be quite low.
Next people will probably prefer to use LN themselves and it will be rare to pay any txfee onchain at all. (LN fees can be from 0 to few cents per tx, we will see what free market comes up with, but there is almost no limit to how low it can go, technically it can be 0 even for trillions of transactions per day across the network).

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:28:43


It doesn't work like that, imo it can be much better.
If users who wish to pay 50 s/B are needing 120% of the capacity, then the excess 10% is fighting for the space in blocks, driving it up from 50 s/B to even 500 s/B.
If that is the case, as soon as the chain moves to 121% of capacity (and after the 1% clears the backlog) then capacity is bigger then the demand for 50 s/B and fees drop from 500 to 50.

What? Bitcoin block size is NOT limited to 1 MB.

The limit is calculated in other way, that allows something around 1.7 MB, perhaps more, depending on the type of transactions (using segwit transactions allows to get to bigger block size).

The main benefit is that you can send easily thousands of transactions, for obscenely low fee, usually far below 1 cent.
In addition you can get some small fees back yourself, I would think about it as a way to end up with totally free transactions.
Edit: but if you are in fact a big node (many channels, high liquidity) then indeed fees might become a constant source of small but visible additional income.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:58:05






It would be like living in some poor shanty town nowdays, there police doesn't help you either.  (they do, on paper, and IRL you know).




All people make rules for themsleves, what "oliarchy"? You make up rules in own home. And home is your castle.
Of course this bounded by rules of city (e.g. city might ban access to firearms), and certain rights are quite universal - attacking others (murder, rape) are of course bad.
Reconsider this questions yourself for a moment.  We are doing all this for billions of USD, in Bitcoin. We secure our and each-other property. We even won the attempted revolt by part of police that turned on us (the mines with BCH, B2X) - we handled it well.  
Just take back own freedom and independence, with a reasonable way (most of above questions can be figured out just by using common sense - think what you would like to happen in given situation with respect to freedom of self and of others).
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:10:08


Defending borders from external enemies is one of few services central gov should do imo.
And we do not need income tax nor incorporate tax for that.
All we need is an opt-in, corruption free and easy tax - like land renting tax. You rent land from state in public auction (fair price) for 1, 5, 10, 15 years - you then pay, and that goes to army that will defend that land. Seems very fair.

Unjust laws like "it's ok to murder and soap' the Jews" should not be applied even if democratically elected leader (Hitler) elects officials (dr. Mangele) who **legally** do this.
Even if 99% of population would agree to this law directly, it's just a bad law.
Same as current law where vast majority of Arabs in deep islamic countries support death penalty for acts of gayness.
Do you propose to obey such laws "since majority wants it"?
Or perhaps every person should focus on following obvious moral code
- do not murder
- try to go on separate ways instead attacking people with opposing views
and other such reasonable ideas?
I think everyone should follow such moral code, even if law is stupid. And for example taxation of work, that is not opt-in at all, is a robbery, and therefore is morally wrong.

And yet we all every day enforce property rights. With our validating bitcoin nodes.
Same with physical property IRL. First thing I would do in no-central-gov place would be to organize a local private police.
That would protect us from robbery, murder etc, and would NOT enforce any bullshit like "war on drugs".  Wouldn't that be nice?
Ofcourse if another city or mansion decides they do not want druggies there, then no problem, they warn about it on entry signs, that this is no-drugs zone, and they pay for police to enforce that.
Much like we have no-smoking zones. Or like supermarkets have local policies like say "no running with icecream", and if you do not behave then you're asked to leave, or possibly to pay for any damage you did.

I like, and therefore I would pay for a ticket to use them. I do not want to pay for them in other city. And other city can happily require a small fee to enter it for a day - though most will not do that and instead earn on tourism and such.
This in fact does work already if you think about it.
Paid highways. Trucks pay for roads.
Paid parking spaces (even on public streets in many places).


If everyone would be Buddah or Jesus then ok, we would not have corruption. But even then there is no just way to distribute this money, since people just want different things.
I will pay for parking/streets in MY city,  someone else will pay in his city. Really easy.

Most regulations and laws are bad for people, including countless victim-less "crimes".

The same way I pay now for my private security at e.g. my work place. With money. Preferably Bitcoins.
 


Carry him out.
Do you think police man are some super humans or angels?
The same humans that now can become police, will then become private police/security.
With the difference that 
* they are **not** paid to enforce bullshit laws that no citizens of given LOCAL AREA (e.g. the city) want
* they are fired for enforcing bullshit in fact
* every place can have other rules, so there is a place for every person basically where he fits with his [anti]drugs, [anti]guns, [anti]copyrights, views.
 


This happens now, and the bigger town is e.g. New York - enforcing people to use some license to trade in Bitcoins. Or when you have bad luck it's entire government, arresting you for being gay (e.g. UK in last century) or for using drugs (most of USA), or for using alcohol (entire USA, previous century).
It's much easier to deal with rogue LOCAL police force, when people understand they are hiring them,  then to deal with gov when people have this mentality - they are my masters,I am their slave/servant.

You need some kind of wallet - never leave Bitcoins or long on exchanges, or they very likely be hacked one day and you lose it all (like mt gox and countless others).
Hardware wallet like breadwallet, Trezor, Nano S - are very secure.
I think Trezor is very good, but Nano is nice too.

Fees for the Bitcoin network to accept your message, currently if you pay typically around 10 cents then transaction will be confirmed withing 1 day,
often 10 cents are enough to get it in 1 hour or faster.
But some wallets choose to pay few USD which is usually over-paying, and do not allow user to manually set low fee if he wants to "risk" waiting a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:20:43


This is wrong, you forgot that such miners are taking as long or even longer to mine a block now.
They will be mining still at same difficulty as they mine now, mining is not harder or anything for given such miner. He is as-profitable as now, in numbers of BTC per day of his work (at his given hashpower).

BCash had almost half of Bitcoin's hashpower for a time, and yet it price was no where near 50% (was falling 15% - 10% then). So buying hashpower is not so important.

BCash needs EDA because they think if they lack support (miners) then they must quickly rush to inviting miners by lowering diff.

both processes happen.

Also, it could be that they have too broad definition of rape.

Validating transactions on your wallet that is the full bitcoin node is guarantee that you are getting real Bitcoins.
If you use just SPV, especially some shitty SPV wallet, you could unknowingly be left with useless B2X tokens istead Bitcoin if you do any transactions between the B2X fork start and time when it dies.

His dreaded shapeshift for ever stalling the use of SegWit and of batching (is he even now finally using both)? How many years till he supports native segwit?
He is an enemy of Bitcoin, do not forget his sins just because he does one good gesture now.

This is interesting b/c LN nodes CAN lose customer funds. A little-known secret is that the HTLCs that make LN routing "trustless" only work for larger payments. HTLCs don't work for micropayments below the on-chain dust threshold. Does this fact change your opinion  ?"
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:47:58


there is nothing fundamentally stopping LN funds being stored in cold wallet like a Trezor, once that would be implemented in future.
0-conf can be trivially spent until the 10-60 MINUTES pass to get 1-st conf. Even then you are at risk for few more confs.

yes, this is trivial for miners that already have that hashpower.


both. can mine, and in addition do some sneaky business.
look - it ALREADY WAS DONE.  with the 50% miner pool cheating in the "honest random" casino, remember?
They were mining in special way (maybe even reorging blocks but not 100% sure about this part) so that the crypto system who made too weak assumptions about security was cheated, to earn a bit extra buck on the betting website.
Of course miners will exploit every possibility.
Especially that they are operating at like 1-10% profit margins usually (race to bottom) so any extra 1% is a big improvement.
And especially now when they have another sha256 chain to switch to if anything, so they even less care for "doing the right thing" even though they never did in the first place.


Then idiots will get cheated as it ALREADY HAPPENED. It's not only stupid and without forward thinking, it is already proven miners do any lengths to cheat even a little extra money.

Interesting facts:
+ no ID, no phone, no email - no nothing to buy there.  Just put in fiat bills, then QR scan (or enter or keyboard in worst case) the BTC address. You get out a small printout confirmation that you got paid.
+ no ID, no phone, no email - no nothing to sell there. You press button to sell, you get a printout with QR code. You send to that code. You come back when it is confirmed, scan same paper (do not lose it!!) and get fiat cash.
- sometimes printer is out of order
- sometimes the entire machine is off or in service
Still, a really nice thing.
In theory Polish laws say to not trade over around 8,000 PLN in cash, so better use it with such amounts (so like 3,000 USD).

wut? both things are instant.

@_date: 2019-05-13 15:11:34


Wrong, you need only minimal hash power to sometimes succeed in executing OTHER spending then the one that you seen as unconfirmed.
Even 1% miner will (on average 1 per 100 tries) succeed.


No, what ever signature you want to be placed by LN wallet, you can prepare it, take it to offline computer, sign it there, move it back and broadcast - if the timeouts are very high to allow such slow execution of it.
Although LN is for now intended as the fast payments, so what you probably need more is just to have a hardware wallet sign it to avoid too easy attacks.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:06:58


There is also 0% cost to try to doublespend, and if you are a bigger miner then with 30% of discount of the things you buy from idiots accepting 0-conf.
All while your mining operation itself works at around 10% profit or something low or lower.


No. Simply broadcast to the naive miner the 0-conf, and send secretly the doublespend to your friendly miner.
Each time when the next block is mined by your friend, you got your goods for free.
Each time when it's not then you simply paid the normal price for goods.

I like him. He is only one who wants to remove income tax.
Or allow citizens to have handguns.


Is this your whistle trained reaction, you hear Hitler and ignore context?
He correctly observed that current taxation is so bad, that it is even worse then it was when Poland was occupied by Hitler. Which is correct.
We pay around 50% of income (especially the low wage people) to health insurance that is one of worst in Europe and have zero choice, state has absolute monopoly.
Also, we have worst tax code that no one understands, and for example with Bitcoin government wanted 1% of each trade EACH TIME (making it possible to pay over 100% of tax if you are day trader) in addition to demanding VAT tax and income tax, while often not accepting initial Bitcoin buy price as the cost.
Our government is indeed like an occupant to our people on topics like taxation.


This statement is not absurd, many scientists confirm this, and currently it's a topic of disagreement
But you are right he has no problem with being frank and ignoring sissies who care about being politically correct and such.
Either way, he is supportive of Bitcoin (becuse of it's free market aspects), which I find nice (and ontopic).

Border ID checks exist for a reason. Passport, and entry permits exist for a reason too, same as say tourist visa.
Do not let random strangers into your country. Do not lure them with promise of giving them money for doing nothing. Do not let them get away with violent crimes when they commit them.
If you do neither of this things, you end up like Calais or Paris.
