Think its just because its getting easier to spend. An earlier adopter can spend more easily without replacing. Things that have make it easier to buy such as circle are less than the greater acceptance. Question: how easy is it to spend in China?

I can't see the confirmation time but I doubt they have exposure to volatility. I would guess that the publicity from accepting coin and enabling people to pay will generate far more than the discount

Harder in practice. There's a fear of electronics at pumps after phones have caused a few rare massive explosions. The vapour has to meet an electronic device and that device has to malfunction with a spark short circuit or static. 
This is why you don't use your phone at the pump and why your phone shouldn't be in your pocket when filling. 
Its not a likely risk but the risk is big so the rules are strict in this area. 
Now... 
The RFID chip NFC side is not powered and if encased then that bypasses the rules.  But what about the powered side? That's when it gets a little harder. Filling stations don't want it in the nozzle as that's too risky. Putting it in the car side is than a design challenge for cars and even though its low voltage and its away from the rules of the forecourt... There could be safety laws for cars in this area too. 
The closest point is the sealed junction box displaying the price of the fuel at the pump.

What would be a position sizing example of this, shorting on an exchange... Bearing in mind even no stoploss you need to think about margin call
