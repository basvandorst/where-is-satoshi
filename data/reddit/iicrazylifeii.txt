I get the same feeling bro, like you know you should sell, but theres something deep inside you that makes u want to hodl. 
Ive tried to analyze this feeling in my self to understand, but its whats driving the btc craze.

Thats the beauty of your brain, you can think what ever you like, but reality will always be there.
However it is bitcoin, its been jumping all over the place lately

I dont believe giving wealth to those who do nothing in society and just be a burden to every one and cause damage and issues in society is fair at all. Alot of people earn there wealth the hard way, some get it unfairly and easy and some just inherit it. Its not always fair but if you work hard and do the right thing wealth should come.
But there is a big difference to those in third world countries living in war torn areas and dont have a chance or oppertunities compaired to 1st world welfare people fat and lazy dont want to work and just want free hand outs

No its not fraud, and just because something doesn't go your way 1 time does not mean there is some sort of class action lawsuit.
Remember your using some one else platform to trade, don't like the rules, theirs the door.
Don't use it if you don't agree.

Straight from the website...
The website looks like it was written by a angsty teen, and its plastering its active since 2014 so hard I dont believe it.
Maybe im ignorent of such websites, has any one else heard of this site over the years?
Just looking at the site doesn't give me much faith.

Tell me how bitcoin has really changed your life,
Still breath the same air? Still bleed like any other human? Still got to put up with the rest of humanity?
You still have to eat by the sounds of it..
Seems like bitcoin was just another way to purchase things to fill that empty void..
Just because something is different, doesn't mean in the grand scheme anything has really changed.

Although i haven't lost anything in bitcoin, I'm a broken man, i see the world as a cruel and shitty place where most people only care about them selves instead of helping others to build a better society. Theres alot of cruelty and suffering in this world and as the population goes up it only gets worse :(
@_date: 2019-01-18 02:37:43
Pal, I don't know your circumstances etc.. but alot of free information online, it would be good for you to learn some sort of skills, metal work, wood work, horticulture etc.. or even learn some financial skill sets, even if you got hold of bitcoin or any money if your not smart ablut it you will soon be departed.
No matter your circumstances, as long as your mind is reasonably sound and there's air in your lungs there's always the ability to learn new skills. The only thing that stops people is there own mind and thinking

They both existed before they were exchanged and they still do after, how ever existing gets wierd when talking about digital assets.
Either way fiat doesn't transform into cryto or crypto to fiat. I'm sure some one is using that fiat that u traded for crypto ;)

For most western countries the current fiat system even with its flaws is easy and it generally just works.
Until using crypto gets to that level or more businesses adopt it as payment method, unless some big financial collapse happens crypto will be a slow and steady up hill push, but once it gets to the top it will be a easy fast ride down the other side ;)

If you can't understand why there needs to be a tax, go live in another country that doesn't tax its people or enforce it, pls update me on how that goes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:29:00
Taxes are 'miner fees' that make society work, pay for the hospitals, roads and infrastructure so we can even have the ability for bitcoin to exist and trade in it ;)
To live the relatively good and safe life compared to many countries taxes are a necessary pain we all must bare, however its what makes society function.
Like we are all working to help each other, just sucks when that money goes to people who refuse to work or  benefit any one but them selves. ie fake injuries to get a free ride while those with real injuries suffer.
Or companys that can afford to pay with there millions and billions of profits find loop holes to avoid paying tax while the little guys get hammered.
Greed has a high probability of being our demise

Sweet you don't want to pay tax i get it, your money fuk the gov for stealing it.
Just don't use the roads or hospitals or anything else society needs thats paid for by tax payers in order to push forward with society.
With out taxes i dont think anybody could reasonably come to geather to build there own infrastructures that allow us to get about and comuincate how we do today.
You wouldnt be able to go to the local shops to buy your food because the transport infrastructure to get it there or the power grid to light it up. You wouldnt be able to post on reddit for the infrastructure wouldnt be there.
Unfortunatley taxes need to be paid for the benifit of all.

I personally don't know your circumstances, but for the sake of my reasoning imagine you had family.
But that family all died whilst traveling on vacation because a drug fueled idiot thought it was a great idea to go for a drive to the bottle-o.
People do the wrong thing all the time that does have devastating impacts on real people, you want the cops to just ignore it and allow everyone to freely do what activity they want? Protection comes at a cost, may not save every one but when you have so many people things are hard to make perfect. I'm sure you have nothing to hide and yes we are entitled to our privacy, but I'd rather they catch people doing the wrong thing before there actions are realised.
If you don't feel safe or secure in your current circumstances and don't want to be monitored then do move to another geographical location with out such protection, but please update me on your experience living there I genuinely would like to know for my own sake!

Yeah, all that will come from a movement like that is chaos, as soon as every one wants something one way and another does not, then fear and doubt over how they will provide for there familys, who will run the stores? Ship the products? Who will protect peoples rights or organise people to do it and ensure its done fairly.
Not saying what there is now is perfect far from it.
But if no ones governing it to some standard best of luck to all of us.

That's the price difference for 1 bitcoin, your amounts do not equal 1 bitcoin, so you will not see the 200 increase, but proportional to the smaller ammount of btc your trading minus what ever fees.
If u were trading 3800 usd in bitcoin you would see a closer figure to that 200
