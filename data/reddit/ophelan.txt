Since the purpose of moving funds to Lightning will be commerce, the funds won't be "locked up" per se, but available for your spending use.
I expect many will maintain a Bitcoin "savings account", Lightning "checking account" that funds will flow into and out of on a regular basis, and another Lightning mobile wallet for spending on the go.

It's an interesting question, for sure. Like you say, the channels need funds to function. Some of that funding may be of further utility, but a functional network likely requires more than the bare minimum - if I open a channel to you, but only I commit funds, we have a uni-directional channel for the time being...not so great.
That said, I wonder if there's enough "idle" funds floating around to handle this burden without economic impact. For instance, if I need to tie up some BTC to maintain my Lightning node, I'm just going to use some coins that are sitting idle; it won't impact the amount I'm trading or transacting with. For bigger entities, it's unclear what the impact will be.

The channel needs to be backed by real BTC onchain. This was the channel funding both you and your channel partner needed to provide to open the channel. Receiving/sending funds in a transaction changes the balance between you and your partner. If your channel becomes too unbalanced in one direction, it may only be able to handle transactions in one direction until it rebalances. It may be possible for clients to proactively balance themselves between open channels.

There are absolutely careers that don't require or benefit from a college degree, but there are also those where it is essential. I'm sure none of us (OP or his children included) can definitively say what career the children wish to pursue.

Correct. Normal income at the market value on the day it was mined. If for some reason he can't identify that, using a $0 cost basis would be next best. Then capital gains for selling it.

It's a lending platform, designed initially to provide secured USD loans, backed by crypto collateral.

Taking a page from the Bitfinex playbook, eh?

For what it's worth, there is a thing called a 'fee-only financial planner', who is paid only by you (and their other customers). These individuals have no incentive to sell you products.

2.5 is nowhere near fuck you money in my opinion , but agree each individual needs to choose that value, and perhaps not cash out then, but at least start gradually spending it however one has planned to.

Ha, I totally missed that! He definitely raises a compelling argument in that scene:

It's true. At the end of the day, one has a finite amount of wealth at a given moment, and you can choose to spend or store it however you'd like. Every choice has some amount of risk associated, including USD.
You don't even get the option of *not* making a choice; leaving it where it is, itself is a decision.

From a fiscal standpoint, it doesn't matter that much. Long-term value is predicted to increase. From a psychological perspective though, doing it incrementally can protect someone from buying immediately before a drop, which might give them the idea to second guess their decision.
That said, if one is confident in the market, and their own patience, I agree.

2.4% safe withdrawal rate? That's hella conservative; 4% is usually the number tossed around. Your point still stands, $2.5M isn't really going to fuel a luxurious lifestyle.

There's a lot of psychological basis on "significant" (to people, not in reality) numbers being resistance/support points on markets. We all know 2400 isn't really that different from 2399, yet here we are in a thread celebrating it. Funny how it works, eh?

You forgot to add 'spaceship' to the list.

It's easy enough to pull historical data into a spreadsheet. In Google Sheets, for example, the [GOOGLEFINANCE]( formula can do this:
    =GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:BTCUSD" , "price", DATE(2017,1,1), TODAY(), "DAILY")

No, the keys are generated and stored internal to the device and never leave the secure element. This protects the keys from exposure, even if the computer is compromised in some way. A USB key with a wallet would not yield this protection.

The hardware wallets don't use batteries, they're USB powered. That said, I wouldn't rely on one without backing up the seed in some other manner.
