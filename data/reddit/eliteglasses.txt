1) bitcoin offers no speed advantage over a credit card
2) bitcoin costs more to use than a credit card because it has no reward schemes and most stores don't offer a discount to use it
3) Most do not consider spending the best performing asset class in the world for five straight years, instead of using a credit card, to be the best move

I understand what you're saying, and yes Bitcoin can be a little bit faster if the merchant and customer have everything set up perfectly.  I've also sat at a restaurant with a dozen Bitcoiners who somehow take 15 minutes to pay the bill.  I should have said that bitcoin offers no SIGNIFICANT speed advantage.  Going from a ten second payment to a five second payment, or a five second payment to a one second payment is not significant.  Going from a three day payment to a one second payment is quite significant, and that's where the value of Bitcoin becomes more apparent.

If the BTC price dropped to $4000, yes you're right.  You seem to think that the split tokens will total up to the original value of the BTC before the split, which is not correct.  The split coin just creates a ton of value all of a sudden.  In the Bcash split, the BTC price didn't drop but you would have owed money for the Bcash coin which was valued at something like $600.  Given that segwit2x futures are trading at .25 of a BTC, BTC price would have to drop from 4k to 3k just for you to break even because you will owe 1k for the seg2x coin.  Sure there is some chance it might do that, but shorting something that has to drop 25% in order for you to break even, and drop even more for you to profit, is crazy.

@_date: 2018-02-27 19:53:27
The whitepaper indicates that if someone tried to spam lightning transactions, the fees would become negative on the reverse path, so you could make money off the spammer.
 "The time-value of fees pays for consuming time (e.g. 3 days) and is conceptually equivalent to a gold lease rate without custodial risk; it is the time-value for using up the access to money for a very short duration. Since certain paths may become very profitable in one direction, it is possible for fees to be negative to encourage the channel to be available for those profitable paths."
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:56:40
Sorry, missed this reply.  No I do not disagree.  You've just got a built in disadvantage on making that trade.  A useful thought experiment might be to think about the price 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the fork, and if you think the combined price will drop in that time period.  You might decide you'll do better by exiting your short just before the fork, then reentering your short position just after the fork shorting one or both forks.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:04:53
The way shorts usually work is you borrow a bitcoin and sell it hoping it goes down.  So you owe a bitcoin, not $4300 worth of bitcoin.  After the split you'll also owe a B2x, which is trading at over $1000.  So it would be very stupid to be short on the fork date.

I had a couple problems setting it up.  First, the wallet wouldn't send without something like $50 to open a channel due to whatever storage service it uses to back up the channel.  Second, I had to open a channel to Acinq node.  Their node has a path to every lightning service I've tried.  After that, I could just scan lightning QR codes anywhere and it works

I can receive lightning payouts from LightningSpin using "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" for android, which was just was released on the Play store on May 31st and allows receiving payments.  It uses some kind of online backup service in case the phone is offline.  I just can't receive a payment in excess of deposits, which is probably something fundamental in how lightning works that I don't understand.

Electrum and Bitcoin Wallet by Bitcoin Wallet developers support sending transactions with a fee under 25 cents, and then raising the fees with RBF if it doesn't go through quickly.  Bitcoin Wallet only has 3 fee levels, so it has much less control over exactly how much to pay.

A quick comparison shows that AgoraCommodities is by far the new low price leader in the bitcoin metals world.  They are barely more expensive than the cheapest dealers on comparegoldprices.com or goldmart, but they have a large advantage of accepting instant payments instead of waiting for paper checks and bank wires.  The crown was previously held by amagimetals.
agoracommodities price for 1oz gold eagle:
$1,358.31 (gold spot $1292)
Priority Mail Flat Rate®: $5.60
Order Total: $1,363.91
    
Shipping &amp; Handling USPS (Insured) $11.95
Bitcoin Processing Fee $13.99
 Grand Total: $1,383.77
JM Bullion was the cheapest merchant on comparegoldprices.com, and while their price was cheaper at $1358.78, the ONLY payment method was paper check.  Paying with a credit card brought the price up to $1412.89.  Bank wires were available for orders over $2500.

Most of the mining is done by ASICs that have very low power cost.  If the price of bitcoin dropped to $10, the network hash power would decrease very little.  The few miners whose power costs would be higher than the coins they mine would just sell their miners to people with cheap or free electricity.  All the existing mining equipment will never sit idle.  And if bitcoin is still successful in 10 years, mining will be done by people with ASICs in water heaters and other devices that need to generate heat.  People will never shut them off.

Alt-coins have been around for years, almost all of them are dead, and none of them have more than 25 merchants. They have almost no active development. Merchants will never accept them; they just tell people to convert to bitcoin. Alt-coins are all incredibly insecure compared to bitcoin and vulnerable to double-spending and 51% attacks by botnets, supercomputers, and mining pools. Litecoin already has 18m coins mined and in the hands of very few people btw. Only people who don't understand the network effect invest in it, and if it was easy for them, they would probably also put money into WeBidz thinking that because it has lower fees, it is superior and will overtake ebay or be "silver to ebay's gold".  Bitcoin will outperform alt-coins because its rate of growth is so much higher.

The conversion fee is about .5% each way for major currency pairs.  Everyone in the world should be using bitstamp, not just euros.

It is usually much better to convert funds to USD at bitstamp.  you can examine their bank's conversion rates here:

Many bitcoiners believe that banks make their money from fees, so therefore bitcoin means the end of banks.  This belief is mistaken and I think Jaron should have made this more clear.  The majority of bank profits come from loaning out customer deposits, not charging fees.  If bitcoin grows large and stable enough to challenge major national currencies, governments could start to have a problem with it, but banks will always be happy to take deposits in any currency if they can loan it out for a profit and meet AML requirements.

Btckan.com/price lists BTC100 as having a volume of 28,835 the last 24hr and BTCCNY at 3,909.  What is going on?  I've noticed every once in a while they list that exchange as having absurdly high volume.

Redo the first video to immediately jump in.  Don't apologize; your accent is fine.  The second video is terrible.  Just walk people through how history went from gold&gt;paper&gt;bitcoin as money, and why each form was superior to the last.  Also, at least make powerpoints to follow along with what you are saying.

Coinabul has been ripping people off for a while.  A quick comparison shows that AgoraCommodities is by far the new low price leader in the bitcoin metals world. They are barely more expensive than the cheapest dealers on comparegoldprices.com or goldmart, but they have a large advantage of accepting instant payments instead of waiting for paper checks and bank wires. The crown was previously held by amagimetals.
agoracommodities price for 1oz gold eagle: $1,358.31 (gold spot $1292) Priority Mail Flat Rate®: $5.60 Order Total: $1,363.91
Amagimetals: $1,357.83 Shipping &amp; Handling USPS (Insured) $11.95 Bitcoin Processing Fee $13.99 Grand Total: $1,383.77
JM Bullion was the cheapest merchant on comparegoldprices.com, and while their price was cheaper at $1358.78, the ONLY payment method was paper check. Paying with a credit card brought the price up to $1412.89. Bank wires were available for orders over $2500. Coinabul is always a complete ripoff at $1417 listed on the front page with no free shipping.

You need to proceed to checkout to see the real prices.  Amagi charges higher shipping and a "bitcoin processing fee" of 1%.

Mtgox takes 6-8 weeks to withdraw, and up to 20 days to deposit via wire transfer.  Use Bitstamp.net instead.  They have .5% currency conversion rates, Verification in &lt;12hr, CurrencyFair support (no TransferWise), Only 3 confirms to deposit bitcoins instead of 6 at mtgox.  Mtgox also lists orders at 2.5% less in currency markets besides the one the account is in.

Use Oanda and it will cost you less than $500 in conversion fees.  Bitcoin sucks for doing transfers this large because the market isn't deep enough.
