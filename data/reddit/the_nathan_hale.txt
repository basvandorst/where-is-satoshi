When I said "dont need any backups" I was refering to like a file backup.. Yes, you still need to backup the seed (or dictionary words).
And actually, storing them outside your house is pretty awesome... Example... take some metal stamps or an envraver and stamp your bytes into a piece of metal. Stash or attach your piece of metal somewhere out in the wild where it it is unlikely to get disturbed. Use some type of encoding to protect the data if it is found... (example, reverse the order, or scramble it up in an easily rememberable method)
Lots of fun steganography tricks can be used to hide your actual byte keys or dictionary words in plain sight.

Due to the way intelligence agencies work, I guarantee there are multiple lists. Each project is compartmentalized and most likely not sharing with other projects unless there is a 'need to know'. The one they managed to FOIA just happened to not have "Bitcoin". It's entirely possible that it is on one of any number of other lists.
The usefulness of such lists depend on the complexity of the system using them. simple keyword matches isn't going to do shit. But combine that with social networking databases, contextual heuristics, etc, they would be very useful.

Every 2000 blocks, the network adjusts the difficulty of the problem. 
Add more hashing, blocks get solved faster than once every 10 minutes on average. Difficulty increases.
Miners leave the network, taking their hashrate with them and blocks take longer to solve. Network responds by making the problem easier.
Net result is an overall steady rate rewards every 10 minutes, on average.
Now, divide reward in half every 210,000 blocks, and you have the whole inflation picture.

Thank you. My point of this is to plant that very seed in people's mind. Bitcoin is innocuous. The government, however, is not. What will you do when they come for you and your bitcoins?

I'm still at risk with the few Bitcoins I keep on my computer and smart phone - at the ready for instant spending.. Kinda like the same risk I take in keeping Bitcoins in my wallet safe from robbery and pickpocketing... I need to keep some "spending money" on me, so I accept the risk. I just keep my money diversified in varying amounts in different locations. (not all my eggs in one basket).
But the Bitcoins I keep off-line, im my opinion, are secure enough from any hacker. Now I'm only counting on the security of the Bitcoin protocol and faith that people will continue to value Bitcoins over the period of time I keep them.
BTW, my off-line bitcoins are kept on encrytped QR codes, stored on multiple copies of paper in multiple locations. Anyone can do this with things like bitaddress.org and/or the electrum client. It takes some toying around, but once you test it and understand the process with a few bitcents, it's easy to trust the security.

Number one, it is important to understand that if the cryptography of bitcoin falls, existing financial systems will be affected just as much.
Number two, if sha256 gets cracked, and it becomes easier to guess hashes, we are still protected by the difficulty factor that adjusts  every 2,000 blocks. There isn't much of a down side to this and it should be enough time for developers to implement a new hashing algorithm and everyone adopt it.

Addresses are continually being generated within the wallet due to "change" transactions. If new addresses are generated without a backup, you stand a significant chance of losing Bitcoins. In QT the addresses are pregenerated 100 at a time if I recall, so you need to backup your wallet file at least every 100 transactions (IIRC).
Another thing you might try is the 'rescan' option.
@_date: 2012-06-01 05:07:18
The price would be way more than double if someone tried to purchase $25M.

You still have to maintain the seed data, but that is much simpler than maintaining a regular backup system and securing copies. For example, use PGP or AES to encrypt the seed, send it to a QR code, print it out a bunch of times and store them in different places. 
@_date: 2012-06-06 22:39:07
The thing that reduces my fear about Bitcoin being replaced is it adaptability. The protocol has already been changed to add new features, fix vulnerabilities, etc.
Even the properties of inflation could be changed at any time with a 51% vote (updating to a different client that honors the new rules). Even then, that's 50% of the people still be using the old currency.

There is no indication that there is an emanate failure going to happen in Bitcoin and bring the value to zero. There is, however, plenty of evidence that information about Bitcoin will spread to more and more people over time who see a value in being able to backup your money, transfer it freely, etc. The resultant demand of said limited resource creates higher value. We've been to $30 with less than 300,000 people already. We could easily get back there with the other 7 billion people on the planet once the information and experience reaches them.

InstaWallet is just an online wallet to store and send bitcoins from. Coinapult is a service that BitInstant uses to easily get bitcoins into your hands.. BitInstant doesn't actually sell Bitcoins.. they just let you pay for them, basically. When you deposit money through BitInstant, they have money sitting at their partner sites and make the money available to you there, quickly. A service like coinapult then does the dollar/bitcoin exchange and sends you an email to claim your Bitcoins through their electronic wallet. From there, you spend the bitcoins from the coinapult wallet to your own wallet. It all happens in less that 2 minutes once you drop the cash at the cashier.
And if you're using bitcoins for legitimate purposes, then no, you need not be concerned about anonymity.

An example of an air gapped computer would be to boot from a live linux CD, run the electrum client to generate a deterministic sequence of bitcoin keys, record the seed that created those keys. This seed allows you to regenerate the wallet keys at a later time.
shut down/reboot the computer back to your normal OS and spend some bitcoins to the offline keys.
The reason this is so secure is because any malware installed on your OS hard drive never has a chance to see your keys or record your keystrokes while you're accessing your offline wallet.

I think it's safe to say, given an infinite amount of time and lack of a catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin protocol, it is entirely a safe bet that Bitcoin will eventually go beyond $30. There simply is not enough Bitcoin to "go around" after global demand.
And there is no reason to believe there won't be global demand. If there are 300,000 technically adept nerds confident enough in Bitcoin to maintain a 30-50 million dolalr market cap, it's just a matter of time before the rest of the world establishes their trust in the system too.

Spend your bitcoins to a single address. The spend them to easywallet.org and instawallet.org in X chunks. Open a blockchain view of the address you sent to to monitor for additional transactions. Immediately start pulling out 1/X chunks to various wallet addresses until the insta/easy wallet is depleted. If you see a spend from that view address, you've tainted yourself and you'll need to spend it again at a later date.
Basically, you're depositing your coins and withdrawing other people's coins. You can check for taint at the end by searching your new/final addresses from the single address you spend everything to in the first step.
Tell your friends when you do this so they can join and add to the pool. As long as those wallet systems are not tracking user's wallets and activity, you should be good to go.

Yes, the same inputs are rejected, but I'm refering to the subsequent transactions from the first's output - a chain of unconfirmed TXs. That is, if I send you bitcoins and they dont confirm, your client might select those inputs to put in a TX, but your transaction will now be held up based on whether mine confirms or not.

Anonymity comes from the fact that people are able to generate bitcoin addresses at will with no requirement to make any association between their real world identity and the addresses.
You must tell at least one person that address to receive payment, and thus your anonymity begins to weaken. It's a very small leak, but the more people you tell, or the more important the transaction, the more eyes will be on it investigating it. 
Each transaction between bitcoin addresses is publicly known. That is, you can infinitely see the accounts from where bitcoins come and where they go. 
The strength of your anonymity is in how well you separate your real world ID from your bitcoin accounts.

You are not responsible enough to handle 100 btc. Try experimenting with some bitcents first until you understand how things work.

It will only go up over time. Governments will not stop printing their fiat.

Tim, Bitcoin is not something you look at for 5 minutes and understand -at all-. It is a complex system. I do not fault you, nor anyone else trashing it for it is mostly out of sheer lack of context. None of us that grow up through public education are taught anything about money, short of using a checkbook ledger and counting your change back (if that even).
But once you get over the natural human instinct to distrust something you dont understand and attempt to actually use bitcoin and participate in the community, the lightbulb begins to turn on and one will inevitable begin to learn what has been going on "behind the curtain" and how bitcoin just might be able to grant humanity a freedom of global commerce and human rights it has never known.
I welcome you this far in your journey and look forward to seeing more articles from you as you come to understand this technology better.

That's not my point... Pre-bitcoin, the attacker had to somehow make an anonymous pickup without getting caught - leave unmarked bills under the park bench, and then have to go retrieve them. Post-Bitcoin, they can receive the money anonymously, but my point is they still have to affect an attack in meatspace if demands are not meant, which means they have the same pre-bitcoin problem of risking anonymity and exposure.

Your 1 BTC in your wallet is just an amount in a ledger. When you spend any bitcoins, it effectively creates a negative ledger entry to subtract from what you have available. Each bitcoin is "divisible" to 8 decimal places. So you really have 100 million Satoshi to spend, which equals one bitcoin.

In the event of global no electricity, the blockchain is still maintained on physical disks that will eventually turn back on.

I have the BTC to cover my purchase right now. I just expect that the BTC will value WAY more over the life of the loan.

@_date: 2013-03-06 18:17:51

Can you confirm that you have let the blockchain resync entirely? this process has taken quite a long time in the past. If you do not let it sync fully, then the transactions that bestowed your accounts with bitcoin will not have been processed and the client will show you a zero balance for those accounts.
If you have not destroyed your wallet.dat file by any means, then you're most assuredly still capable of spending the bitcoins you think you have but simply cannot see.
Please confirm for step 2.

There is no way to account for the network effect and growth of the user base. For me, I can only look at the market cap and potential take it will have on other global markets: ecommerce, gambling, drugs, international import/export payments, remittance, etc. If bitcoin is successful for capturing even a fraction of these, it will be worth thousands of dollars. How soon we get there is anyone guess, but the speed at which information spreads on the internet is ridiculously fast.

If those are the only inputs you have left in your client, then you have a problem - and one client might not *prefer* to select those inputs, but there is nothing invalid about doing so. And this is the whole point of the Second Chance Mining Company - if for whatever reason you have unconfirmed transactions, and need access to those bitcoins again, sooner rather than later, you can pay SCMC an *extra* fee to try and push it along.

This is the signature:
Take those three pieces of information and run it through the "verify message" function of your client. If you change any piece of my statement, the signature will fail. This is the equivalent of signing a contract, except that its highly improbably that anyone can forge my signature.

The problem you're having is understanding the scope of bitcoin's scarcity. This really is the driving force of extremely rapid valuation. The potential number of people that can learn about bitcoin in a short amount of time, who may quickly learn they want bitcoins like you do now for all the same reasons, all desiring a little sliver of the bitcoins in the market at one time could potentially skyrocket the price over night.
And for bitcoin to be successful and ubiquitous, there really is no way around this skyrocketing price. The monetary units are fixed, or at least well known. The market capitalization, which is currently ~$300 million dollars is *NOTHING*, and will need to be Billions before it will be considered mainstream. The only thing we have to fluctuate from now until then is the market price - which will need to be THOUSANDS of dollars to make that market capitalization.
In short, the rate with which we get to $1000/btc doesn't really matter but  it is more likely to happen faster than slower and  it is simply required, and actually more of a symptom than a requirement, that bitcoin be worth $1000 as a mainstream currency.
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:53:49
as bitcoin takes over more percentages of existing markets, the price can only go up. Right now, it's at 444 million dollars. That's nothing compared to global markets that bitcoin can compete in... Consider what the price of bitcoin is going to be when it takes pieces of these markets like porn, blackmarket, gambling, ecommerce.. there is no other option but for bitcoin to be worth thousands of dollars - this because of their limited scarcity.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:23:30
The problem is the reversibility of traditional payment systems against bitcoin, which does not support that function.
LocalBitcoins.com is probably quickest, painless way to do it. Face-to-face, cash for bitcoins is the safest for both parties.

Bitcoins coming into existence is not related to bitcoins being added to the volume at an exchange. There is no way to know how much bitcoin being mined is making it directly to an exchange. NONE of the bitcoins I mined, even a couple years ago, have ever made it to an exchange.
The exchange rate is an immediate indication of supply/demand in that particular exchange. If I am buying, I dont care how many bitcoins there are in existence - only what is on the market at that time because it is the only thing that factors into the price.

Yea, sorry, i corrected myself above. ASICs only do sha256 (not anything related to ECDSA). ASICs don't work for vanity addresses because bitcoin addresses are a whirlpool (IIRC) hash of the public key.

What do you base this "speculation" on?
Example, from my POV, bitcoin has a real potential to fill a percentage of any of those markets I mentioned and many more. But to do so, the market cap must increase. Since the amount of bitcoins is scarce and known growth rate, the only other option is to increase the price of the bitcoins to match whatever market cap the free market will try and fill with bitcoin.
Given this and the fact that bitcoin adoption (~500k current users?) is increasing, there is only one direction for bitcoin to go, on average, over the long term: up.

What points are you specifically talking about?
He was absolutely correct when he said "The first 10 times you understand bitcoin, you don't".
