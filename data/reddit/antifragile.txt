After a major hack where every bitcoin stored in an online wallet was stolen; diehard supportors of the cryptocurrency who securely stored their bitcoin on the TREZOR hardware wallet are reviving the currency by brining their bitcoins out of The Bitcoin Safe and moving them back into circulation. In this new post-apocalyptic economy bitcoin experts are advising that all coins should be securely stored on the TREZOR devices. Get yours today, before it’s too late!

Slush Pool is giving away transaction fees as well &amp; on top of that allows to vote; does not force anyone to vote for particular implementation

Slush actually invented current Stratum protocol with following advantages over Getwork: 
1. No more "Pool is not providing work fast enough" messages in mining software
2. Extremely low stale rate (less than 0.1%, that means below 1 stale per 1000 accepted shares)
3. Very low network bandwidth usage (~10kB/minute)

Server is UP and running ;) 
Feel free to invite more friends from Asia/Pacific region.

You can connect to US server right now
Developers are working already on Singaporean server deployment which should be available tomorrow at the latest.

There is new server for Asia/Pacific region located in Singapore:

I like BIP 101 and Slush pool which already supports BIP 101 on following URLs:

She is really cool. I like her. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:37:37

Another advantage of mining with Slush is that it is the most profitable pool out there:

Ever wondered what is the Worker Management for? It makes your work with your miners easier. View and stats about every single worker just one click away. Set your filters and browse through your workers! Now you can manage thousands of miners from your Slush Pool account easily.

"We have a problem."
"Remember, there are no such things as problems, only opportunities."
"Well then, we have a DDoS opportunity"

Contrats ! looks like TREZOR should be useful ;)

looks like quick hack and they are going to experience the same problem with other pools as well.
I would rather recommend they fix the bug by putting following string as an identification of Slush pool : /slush/ since Slush is using it in their coinbase transactions
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:18:23
Blockchain explorers like Blockchain.info and chain.btc.com are
incorrect about identification of the mining pool which relayed block
no. 378943 today.
This block was actually mined by AntPool and contained message "Slush's pool is the BEST" in its coinbase transaction.
This is probably the root cause of incorrect identification which is
still visible here:
Therefore if anyone wants to check the correct pool which mined the
block he has to check Coinbase transaction related to this block which
is following:
CoinBase section at the bottom of the page clearly states: "Mined by

hi, really interesting project indeed. I would love to use my Trezor for sing-up process.  ;)
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:39:20
it is actually 4-5% , but current numbers are severely affected by recent period of really bad luck
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:53:18
Great work indeed ! SatoshiLabs announced recently competition for Trezor home screen custom designs. If you join it I think your chances to win a Trezor are pretty good ;)
