Expect it's super expensive to even purchase. The business takes a major cut... Currently, if I put in 11645uah ($495) per 1 BTC, I receive 9877.74uah ($419). Fuck them. I'll just find someone local instead - no Ukrainian I know has ever bought BTC from these machines.

Holy shit, thank you! Wasn't aware this existed.

Definitely. This will be a large deciding factor for allowing BTC ATMs in the United States in general.

Feel like it's going to be a while before anyone can actually use it

Do you know if BIPS has any trouble handling US merchants?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:03:02
Oh my god yes. As long as the merchant wouldn't have a large transaction fee for when a customer buys something in BTC, I would be very interested.

Since you inherited the property, there would be nothing to declare since there would be no gain (until after you exchanged it to fiat, if you plan on doing so). You could hire an attorney to be your 'escrow', trade the Bitcoin through them, while they also do the title and title insurance for you. Probably want an attorney that's savvy in Bitcoin, just to make it easier on both parties.

How about on android?

Definitely noticed the emotional side of watching charts, and was given the same advice to 'buy and hold' from my father. Thanks!

Ah, yes! Nunya. Lots of culture there. How's the homeless problem?
I'm from Bend, though I grew up in Portland.

Hell yes, you guys rock. I live in Burlington, and was really excited to hear you're doing this. If you can convince Fiddlehead to take BTC for growler fills, you'll take over the world.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:36:17
Beat me too it! Now I'm even more excited.

Hey, I'm from Oregon, living in Vermont! Whereabouts?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:34:20
Oh sweet baby Jesus. I'll be in tomorrow. Do I need to say a secret password?

Links to some bitcoin address. Thought it would at least link to bitcoin.org or some informational video about bitcoin. Shame.
