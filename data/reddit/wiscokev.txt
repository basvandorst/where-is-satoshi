was about to say, guess ill stick to 100% atms and just pay the fee
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:20:58
everyone keeps saying that - and i get it - i will too - but i have several transactions on hold @ coinbase; it seems some checking accounts take far longer than others to get off hold. i'm at over 2 wks now : (    so i hodl what i can in my samouri wallet but 150 bucks or so is stuck on cb 
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:33:42
i'm a bit north and the couple in keno/pp haven't been working lately either : (
@_date: 2018-12-28 00:02:33
i'm in OP , make it $20.19 for me 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:30:32
where's your loicense for that joke m8
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:37:21
i'm pretty new here and believe yes you can, coinbase now even allows you to exchange it to paypal 
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:29:42
what if i bought today, and it takes like 17 days to be moved off coinbase? the rest of my btc is in a samouri wallet off the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:49:32
i just learned what boofing is on an entirely different sub, can confirm  coins will be secure
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:17:56
well i was doing mturks on my free time soo
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:12:14
yea if i use checking, debit is quick but the fees are much higher. it doesn't seem quite right.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:10:37
i see these posts often, and i never have these issues with my credit union. i own bitcoin, but am not down with the 'we don't need banks' logic.  OP - what happened? they locked the account and end of story? are you trying to spend money you don't have? this doesn't add up imo
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:13:05
i have been wondering about that, it's a pretty standard account though
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:05:42
ah, maybe this is why i have better luck with the place. to be fair i have only gone there and its a local credit union with only a few locations. i have never gone to a 'big' bank, so my opinions on banks may be a bit skewed to say the least. 
a lot of the complaints against banks i see here i have never, ever experienced after nearly 20 years at the CU. also bought another small amount of btc today, unrelated but i'll be hodling
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:40:47
yea i got RIPPED on fees on one here in southeast WI. now i know better and have alternate methods, but made that costly mistake a few times 
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:12:35
like the 'pro' version? i'll try that
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:41:27
yes, the one near me is complete anon as long as your under 750$
however the fees are thru the roof and higher than other nearby atms that require ID
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:05:16
i am now on coinbase, but we have one of these machines in my town. you put in 100 dollars usd cash - and get around 40$ in btc. i'm a total noob to all this, but that seems *too* steep.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:39:51
my point is its not an anomaly in America, I am 34 and used banks since I first had a job at 15 and never once paid these fees or other silly stuff. however some banks do, but you are free to just find a bank that doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:10:29
thanks for clearing this up, everyone who buys in on this meme should try a local credit union or find a better god damn bank. i never dealt with any of these fees whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:23:30
well i don't go to a big bank, go to a small local place and never had these issues. but i could see this at a big chain type bank yes. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:57:27
makes sense, thanks
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:54:56
cash or gtfo with used car sales
@_date: 2019-03-18 13:45:11
thanks Op, i upgraded tails and my mouse/touchpad stopped working which is great, but if i ever get back into my persistent data again i will need this upgrade info for electrum
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:17:23
as a bitcoin holding packers fan idk what to even think here
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:13:32
awesome, appreciate the  information 
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:11:54
going to dl Wasabi this weekend on laptop and start combining use with Samouri on mobile
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:41:38
i don't leave money on coinbase
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:23:50
Well that is somewhat unrelated to what I am asking, but, I am in the process of setting up Zelle and going to attempt using Bisq for future buys; and I use a few local ATMs but the fees are astronomical. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:30:27
i have not made any buys or sells on bisq but have it up and running and learning, going to try a purchase soon
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:42:41
Cool, thanks. Is the one you mentioned for USA buyers/users? Just noticed the 'eu' and wondering. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:18:36
thanks for the info, still learning a bit. i may send you a pm about it if you don't mind
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:03:41
Well, I can tell you with no doubt at all I have two options and two accepted accounts; both thru the same CU. But one is tied to my checking account and the other a debit card (same account in reality). 
If I pick checking/bank it is cheaper fees, way higher purchase limit - but it takes 2 weeks. If I use debit there is a much lower purchase amount which is fine for me anyway, and the fees are higher BUT you can send the coin off to another wallet five mins later. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:43:01
That is what I was thinking, thanks.
@_date: 2019-03-05 02:47:39
mine is about 14 days but if i do debit its instant, just higher fees and lower limits, but it is instant
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:16:13
that is weird. if i use checking it takes 14 days, but debit is instant. i had to set up both separately if that helps. it could be different each bank/CU, i am not sure. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:24:45
what do you recommend for a new purchasing source? i do hope bisq works out for me
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:58:36
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:26:03
good info good point, i use tails and windows both - but every single send/receive i am double checking every freaking digit no matter what. guess i thought that was just standard protocol for everyone.
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:01:25
very nice, as an active Samourai user I enjoyed this
@_date: 2018-10-23 12:52:20
ELI5 sorry but just for me to clarify - I have some coin nothing crazy 100$ or so on coinbase that I decided to hold (hodl) - I also have a Samouri wallet on a phone with no coins in it - should I move everything off Coinbase into Samouri?? Thanks
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:38:49
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:19:09
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:10:49
i had a btc purchase put on hold - was able to get it fixed within a matter of minutes and now the credit union allows me to purchase crypto free n easy with no limits
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:00:29
ah. yea i only have 200 bucks and that is highly unlikely to change. somewhat familiar with Trezor, but idk if that is necessary for my holding.  i own the home, i mean it's not paid off but is mine. if that burns down will have far bigger issues then the 200 in btc; but dont' take me wrong again appreciate the advice and tips. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:28:31
i agree that is pretty weak
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:45:54
 not sure if that is what you are looking for though
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:45:34
seed? lol sorry to put out another eli5 question...i have the keys/pw and code words or whatever all wrote down and stashed away. but what is the seed? appreciate the help
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:16:59
i got killed on fees using one here in wisconsin
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:30:15
i go to a credit union that is insured. don't banks have insurance to cover this type of thing? i have some bitcoin but see this 'you can lose your money in a bank' said here a lot.
i have had money in this same credit union since i was 15, currently 34. same place never had ONE issue in over 15 yrs with any of my accounts, balances, withdrawals, or otherwise. 
am i really just lucky? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:57:04
good coinboi
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:58:13
awesome, good to know
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:24:27
thanks, will do
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:19:57
i don't know anyone outside of Wisconsin to send money to
@_date: 2018-10-25 19:06:43
i don't have any overseas money
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:12:07
thanks! yes i have all that written down and stashed away in a desk drawer and i live alone. still getting the hang of all of it so really appreciate the help. its on a old phone that is no longer activated but works fine. it never leaves my house though. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:33:16
thanks, i will do so this evening
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:03:28
this is true. i should been more clear i'm in usa and may have better/safer opportunity for functioning banking. 
but i do still have some bitcoin, understand some needs, and it is an interest.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:32:41
i bought 100 worth a month ago and its a forever hold, AMA in one year
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:49:13
no idea what your talking about. maybe i'm just ignorant. 
my credit union sure doesn't mention any of that.  does this affect america? 
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:41:19
there is one of these in my town and the fees are hidden! there are a few other atms in towns nearby where they are not hidden - and steep. but at least not hidden.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:51:34
i'll upvote this though 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:35:47
yep, i use a small local credit union that was just a few people and a teeny tiny office. 20 yrs later they have idk like maybe 15 locations now and in nearby towns, but they won't ever be  'big bank' . and if it does become one, im out. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 19:52:44
use local credit unions
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:52:32
simple - don't use Wells Fargo. My credit union system has been fine for over 15 years.  
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:53:43
i've used the btc atm several times, even a few different ones and never ever was asked for SS.  stay away from that OP
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:58:10
rofl yes
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:14:31
i will look into that
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:17:57
i can picture ronnie screaming HOOOOOODLL
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:56:30
localbtc or bisq
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:25:25
bisq, local btc
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:04:36
thanks, yes of course hoping it becomes more, one way or another lol. i have it written down only on a piece of paper stashed away in a drawer.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:35:56
listen, i'm all for btc too and own a small share - but my 401k , ira, and savings account is going to just go away??
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:16:15
newb here, would Samouri cover my bases in node regards?
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:09:17
a few have said that i might have to, just strange as i don't use the phone for any questionable sites and have virtually no apps. i will run it thru my a/v on pc if possible n see. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:41:38
for sure, thanks
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:57:03
and everywhere takes cc
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:29:53
I have been using it for a good six months but am pretty much a newb here trying to learn, no issues with it i'm aware of. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:18:31
makes me want to purchase my own btc atm
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:46:56
find a local atm @ coinradar
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:02:21
not who you are replying to but this is one thing i need to nail down, have dabbled in pro and sent to my samouri from there, but i don't know how to do the limit orders
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:44:52
hey its me your friend, make an account on coinbase and you can send me btc
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:43:41
cool. i have samouri myself, and have noticed your coins show up (after a transaction) when you are back on wifi. still don't see how you can install an app without a connection, but perhaps i am misunderstanding. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:12:12
what is the documentary? i was aware of all this but only recently have read more on it, the whole thing sounds pretty fucked. is it on netflix or something ?
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:50:33
i actually just called there on my break and nope, they are 'aware' of btc but no they do not accept or convert. it's a pretty small local c.u. and they are behind the times on some other tech as it is though i actually kind of prefer that in an odd way. 
i know some folks here claim to pay 100% everything in btc but i'm not sure how, plus the price changes would be tough to deal with if you really have zero fiat/usd.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:30:29
sooooooo has anyone used this? asking for a friend
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:05:55
from a friend that was holding from the early days, sold his coins for online pizza around 2014 and wanted to kill himself  a few years later.   he tried to tell me to get some around 2012 but i didn't listen. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:37:51
lol i was explaining bitcoin to some friends recently who have only heard of the term itself, and my buddies gf first thing she says "sounds like its a good way for guys to pay whores" i had to laugh but then was like damn...your onto something. but assuming this is already well known and established in least somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:11:52
can you pls eli5 on this debt bubble? none of my investments have ever taken much of a hit; been adding into the 401, ira, and savings for 15 yrs.  again - i have btc outside of this, not trying to diss crypto but i cannot grasp the logic here my other savings will go away. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:24:27
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:32:36
any suggestions? or would a hardware wallet be the answer? worth noting i'm only holding around 100$ usd in btc, and unlikely to be holding much more anytime soon
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:16:20
that is badass man 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:30:47
how would you install a wallet without a connection?
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:11:17
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:25:46
that does seem odd though i guess in major cities maybe
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:26:52
they have em in southeast wi too and its highway robbery but if you need bitcoin and have no other way it's a pricey option
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:47:39
yea there are a few in my town and the limits do vary, i had to shop around. only one can i get by such limits though i'm not putting thousands in either.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:17:58
good, bad, or total cringe i really need to hear this bitcoin track lol
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:07:28
does bisq take credit card or how do you pay (in usa)? thanks
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:16:20
i did on coinbase, but am no longer. i pay the fees and use atms. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:24:36
you cannot, at least where i live. i think possibly my credit union for my home mortgage actually does take it now though not 100% sure. the utilities, misc debt, grocery stores def do not. 
i also support and hodl a bit
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:41:24
i keep my phone on silent at work and now occasionally when i get a text msg an ad will play with sound, even when the phone is locked. its like ads can override the android system. i don't even have many apps just spotify, a police scanner, and a dominos app. maybe it's more google related
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:00:07
i meant like, the price went up to use it which sucks. we have 3 btc atms and i'm in a town of 100k people, not a major city. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:47:59
planning on WI?
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:46:47
yes, but how do all of you get funds off exchanges so quickly? i feel like i'm the only one that gets put on hold. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:29:48
i'd like a moment with that qr code
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:18:53
:( the one i often use just went up
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:53:56
i definitely did not but ty
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:04:01
awesome, never heard of hodl hodl. i checked localbitcoins and nearest seller was 50 miles away unfortunately.
