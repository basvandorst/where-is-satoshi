If bitstamp is a better option for you, then you should continue to use them.  I suspect the merchants that want a nice payment integration that will drop funds straight into their bank account are going to need Coinbase instead of bitstamp.  But of course it's not for everyone.

I've been a few times to this place, and used bitcoin there to buy coffee.  Speaking with the staff there, they don't want to exchange back to USD because that defeats the purpose of using bitcoin.  More power to them.

Nobody is being a crypto-snob.  Questioning security practices of companies that hold personal information and also control financial instruments is healthy and should be encouraged.

Please learn to read. I said Google will likely by a feed from a company like ours. It's a discussion of technicalities, not one that indicates anyone backing anything. It's the same as discussing where Google buys the ice cream for the cafe. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:39:08
I gave an hour long session at work recently. My audience was a mix from all areas of our office.  Some people with enough technical knowledge to invent their own digital currency, and others with just enough skill to use a colouring book.
I stuck to the basics:
*  What is bitcoin?
*  How does it work?
*  Who is using it?
For the second part, I found it very helpful to read the short original white-paper on bitcoin.  I simply described a transaction from start to finish, including the role of private keys, addresses, the blockchain, and 'mining'.  This generated many intelligent questions and led interaction for most of the hour.  My initial talk lasted about 15 minutes - then it was open discussion for 45 minutes.
I stuck to a style I'm comfortable with - I didn't use a projector or slides.  I drew on a whiteboard, made jokes, and essentially led a group discussion after kicking things off.  People stay interested this way!
Great to hear news of people giving these talks - keep relating your experiences.
Oh, and I gave this talk the day after the bubble popped - so everyone knew at least one thing about bitcoin that day!

Last week I bought a graphics card from   The price was cheaper than Amazon.com or newegg.com and it's being shipped via fedex for free.  Can't ask for much better than that.
Before that I had only used bitcoins for playing poker on Clubs with Seals.  
I would likely use them more with increased liquidity that was affordable.  For example keeping a float of bitcoins on hand for purchases is expensive because of the exchange fees, and impractical because of the delays getting cash into mtgox.com.  Now, if only my employer would offer part payment in bitcoins, then we'd be rollin'!
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:17:10
True.  Fred Wilson has a lot of influence when it comes to patterns of tech investing.  There will be a lot of people looking pretty closely at Coinbase now.  All the big players are now aware of bitcoin. We should all agree that bitcoin is here for a while, and the next two or three years will show us where its place in society will be.

There are nuances within that too.  Merchants need to start using bitcoin for B2B transactions.  At that point it may also make sense to start paying employees in part bitcoin.  Once there is a circle that doesn't require conversion to dollars, we are good to go.

I hate to be a buzzkill, but this is an unsafe application.  All the bitcoins used by this app are stored centrally in one wallet.  That's bad, very bad!
You send your bitcoins to one guy.  And he sends your friend an email saying "hey you own some coins now".  That's all this guy is doing, while storing your coins in his wallet the whole time.
It may not be a scam, but the implementation is so insecure, it might as well be.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:54:08
This is an incredibly poor-practice way of implementing this.  Please everyone, don't put your coins into this app while it is all being stored in this guys single wallet.

You're probably right.  At this point Theymos should be confirming that passwords will now be stored in salted hashes.  Hopefully people are learning a little about computer security through this.
* Don't have duplicate passwords.  Every security breach of a list of passwords has reinforced this rule.
* Don't have duplicate usernames.  It is trivial to profile someone across the internet if they consistently use the same username.
* Use something like Lastpass to make the previous two behaviours practical.

In early 2009 I first heard about it online somewhere and tried mining on my laptop.  I have changed jobs in technology over the years and always read the tech news.  Seeing that I would have to wait a few days just to get 50 bitcoins, I uninstalled and continued to watch from the side-lines.  As bitcoin matured over the years my interest waxed and waned and eventually I was moving bank accounts and before I closed my account I sent the remaining balance to Mt.Gox.  Been spending a little lately as services appear that I find useful.  Not into it for anonymity, I think bitcoin makes transactions easy, that's what I like about it. No middle-man necessary.

Colour me sceptical; I haven't seen a single piece of evidence presented to suggest or support that recent events in Cyprus had any influence on bitcoin adoption.  All I've heard is media frenzy about Cyprus suddenly in the same sentences as media frenzy about bitcoin.

Good article.  However; people need to stop treating kickstarter as a store, and remember that you are simply giving money to some unknown entity to do with as they wish.  It's free funding with no strings attached.  Asking for a refund from kickstarter is naive.

I don't think it's laziness or malice that people don't understand bitcoin mining.  The jargon terms in bitcoin are very confusing to most people.  Mining isn't a tern that even hints at the true process of confirming transactions in the blockchain.  It should have been called 'auditing' or something that indicates its purpose.  The same goes for bitcoin wallets... the should not be called that.  Keys makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:13:36
Official symbol? Whose office issued the edict that btc was official? I would judge it 'popularly used' but nothing close to official. When Bloomberg and Reuters and Telekurs etc etc start using XBT then that is what bankers and traders, both institutional and retail, are going to use too. There are companies that specialise in reference databases of these symbols... The mainstream has chosen XBT and probably because BTC is taken by something else.

Converting money back and forth from fiat to bitcoin and back to fiat is sub-optimal. Figure out if your family in Mexico can use bitcoin where they live for expenses.  For example - you send them bitcoins (easy) and they spend the bitcoins (also easy).  You could even use services that are a kind of workaround like gyft.  Do they have gyft in Mexico?
The act of sending 40btc is trivial.  It's the converting back and forth that is a painful experience.

It is a good question.  Consensus here is to provide many, and let the user select.  Every 'exchange rate' for currency is the same, you have to decide which source of data is most relevant to your audience.  MTGOX is the obvious choice right now because they do the most volume.

I think you missed his point.  He is saying that Spotify and Pandora and similar companies are the ones making successful business models out of a new technological paradigm.  And he's correct.  When file sharing became the norm, it took a while for businesses to embrace the new way of doing things and find a way to monetize it.
Bitcoin is a new disruptive technology, a whole new idea.  Businesses with models that don't fit bitcoin will resist it, but eventually enough big players will figure out how to work with it and what seems obvious to some of us now will become the new normal.

There would have to be 11 million bitcoins for sale, which there are not.   So the answer is that the price would go up, but only to wherever the ask orders are at the moment on the exchanges.  Then it would stop, and the other 10.5 million bitcoins would not be bought/sold.
