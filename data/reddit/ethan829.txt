Why would the government's ability to enforce laws cease to exist on private property? You still can't murder someone and expect not to be punished just because it occurred in the home you own. Did you explicitly agree not to murder anyone in your home?
Owning a home is not akin to owning a pair of shoes, either. Your continued use of the shoes does not require the existence of the government (or Nike) and therefore they cannot tax you. Your continued ownership of property requires either the threat of government force, or a personal threat of force on your part. In order to avoid having to worry about your property being stolen by the guy with the bigger stick, government is given a monopoly on force.

Funded by higher capital gains taxes. I'm in.

Yeah, the US federal reserve didn't exist until 1913. Central banks have been around for centuries, though.
And who gives a shit if central banks were supported by Marx? Hitler favored animal rights and disapproved of smoking. The fact that an idea was supported by a particular person doesn't make the idea itself good or bad.

I understand that individual threats of violence may have worked in colonial America, or in cases of government failure, but I would argue that a centralized, government monopoly on violence provides greater security and order. In order to avoid government failure which would necessitate individual violence to defend property rights, the government needs to be adequately funded and able to operate effectively. This is done via taxes. 
Detroit is an interesting example. Detroit lacks the funds to operate effectively. What little population remains is spread out too far for the under-funded police force to manage. In short, there aren't enough taxpayers anymore. If anything, I'd argue that the lack of police presence (due to falling tax revenues) is the cause of the increase in violence. The government no longer has a monopoly on violence, and chaos ensues.

Yeah that was a bit reactionary on my part. Sorry for my use of the "dumbass" word.
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:31:10
And which "well established facts" are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:30:21
No, it [didn't]( at all. If you honestly believe that, you're deluded.
The dollar has lost 97% of it's purchasing power since **1774**, not since 1913.

And the government is chosen to do what? Govern the country. Set rules for its continued operation and survival. Continuing the metaphor, the country is the government's "house," and by staying in it you agree to pay for the privilege. Even if you never leave your home, you are benefiting from infrastructure that wouldn't exist without the government.
Revoking someone's citizenship and deporting them for not paying taxes would, in my opinion, be a better punishment, but prison seems far less severe. In my opinion the government is being lenient by "locking you in the basement" rather than kicking you out entirely.

I didn't say the house you own belongs to the government. I said that the country in which you reside is the government's metaphorical "house," and you're choosing to stay in it. As such, you are bound by its rules. 
I am also not saying that the infrastructure *couldn't* exist without the government, I'm saying that in this case, it does exist because of the government. You are using it, and you have to pay for the privilege. 
The government has the right to deport you because, again, you may own your home but it exists within the country ruled by the government.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:34:41
Then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the government. And again, your continued residence in a country that you're free to leave is equivalent to consenting to abide by its rules. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:36:47
Sure, your drastically oversimplified and politicized cartoon with a clear agenda is an accurate representation of how the US financial system operates.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:47:26
It does, dumbass. No one is preventing you from leaving for a country with no income tax. By staying in the country, you're agreeing to abide by its rules.
@_date: 2014-04-18 04:33:25
Yes, the threat of violence is the only thing really holding society together. Yes, government is a social construct. These are not revelations. These are PoliSci 101 concepts. 
The nature of politics is that people choose to give their government the monopoly on violence. The majority of people believe that this is far preferable to the alternative. When you reside in a country where the majority of people feel this way, you are bound by this agreement whether you explicitly agree with it or not. I see no moral issue with this, as long as there are no real barriers preventing your leaving the country.
Unrelated: You have written a truly impressive number of replies to me and many others, and I commend you for your level-headedness. Most people (myself included) tend to react badly when their views are challenged.
@_date: 2014-04-18 03:16:18
Your property rights are also a mental construct that most people implicitly agree to. What if I choose not to recognize that?

I don't claim that the United States is a paragon of just governance. Far from it, really. But that doesn't mean it's entirely useless and impossible to fix. US foreign policy aside (which I strongly disagree with), US citizens residing in the country enjoy one of the highest standards of living on earth. Not first, but close. From the perspective of the average citizen, life in the US is incredibly secure.
I also never implied that *any* government is better than no government. Obviously there exist cases where anarchy would be preferable to the current regime. That doesn't mean all government is bad, though. Somalia may be better under anarchy than it was under its previous government, but I'd argue that it would be better still under a functional democracy (I don't realistically expect this to occur).
Going back to Detroit, [this page]( has plenty of interesting details.:




Detroit was too heavily reliant on the automotive industry. The decline of that industry (which was guaranteed to happen eventually) caused a massive exodus. No one was left to pay taxes. The city was still responsible for policing the same amount of land area. They couldn't afford to do so.

More so than spouting off bullshit about the evil communist central bank.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:49:00
You're right, the situation is far from ideal. I do not support a large number of things that my tax money is used to fund. I cannot clearly identify a point at which I think it's justifiable to stop paying taxes based on the government's actions, but I don't believe the US is anywhere close to that point. As long as the standards of living remain roughly where they are, I believe anyone who benefits from them has a duty to pay taxes, regardless of any moral position on other government activities. As long as the total benefit (Not the personal benefit that you directly receive, but the total societal benefit) of the government's actions outweighs the costs for the citizens of a country, I believe that the obligation to pay taxes exists. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:15:16
Oh, okay. So you're a crazy person, then. I withdraw myself from this debate.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:46:46
No, it's because of dipshit conspiracy theorists like you. The central bank isn't out to get you, dumbass.
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:14:26
No, the agenda is the painfully heavy-handed message that the Federal Reserve and all banks in general are corrupt and evil and only exist to take advantage of the consumer.

How about I build and maintain a house for you to live in, the only stipulation being that once a month I will take a small portion of your income. If you refuse to pay you will be forced to leave. 
It's literally impossible to live in this country without benefiting from/taking advantage of services paid for by taxes. By your continued residence in this country, you are using these services, and thus are required to pay for them via taxes.
