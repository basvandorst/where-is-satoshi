I can't tell if you're trolling or not, but I'll go ahead and bite anyways. 
Inflation and deflation don't have much of an effect on financial institutions' willingness to lend; rather, changes in purchasing power effect the interest rate lenders are willing to offer (and the rates borrowers are willing to accept). For example, if lenders expect 2% annual inflation, then they will probably not lend money for anything less than a 2% interest rate. If the lender made 1% loan, he'd obviously be losing 1% in real terms every year.
The same is true for deflation, except that it effects people's willingness to *spend money.* This is what has been going on in Japan for almost **25 years.** Source:
Anyhow, absent extreme inflation or extreme deflation, an institutions' willingness to lend to a creditworthy borrower is determined by whether the institution can charge interest which exceeds their cost of funds (in this oversimplified example, the amount of inflation/deflation). 
Using numbers: imagine that a more-stable bitcoin is worth $100/btc today, and most people expect that it will be worth $110/btc next year. This would mean the market expects 10% deflation in a world where goods are priced in dollars. An intelligent lender would accept a very low interest rate to lend to a creditworthy borrower, perhaps 1%. That lender would lend 1 btc today for a repayment of 1.01 btc in a year, with the understanding that next year's 1.01 btc would be worth substantially more than 1 btc now.
You don't have to take my word for it: this is how Japanese banks have been operating in yen-denominated markets for decades now.

Luckily, no consumer records have been exposed in any of the bitcoin fiascos, amirite?

Quit spamming out-of-date links to every subreddit you can find. 
Thank you in advance.

That's a Euro thing, not an American problem. In the USA, nobody really cares much about selling offensive materials. 
In France/Germany, selling anything even loosely Nazi-related can be a crime, and Yahoo got in some major litigation for allowing the sale of Nazi memorabilia on their French portal several years ago.
Also, most continental European countries still have criminal libel and group libel laws which don't exist in the USA. This means that saying something like "all [insert minority group] smell bad" could be a criminal act. The paypal and ebay terms of service merely mirror actual European libel laws, which are very vague and subjective (as you said).

100% for it. TotalBiscuit is entertaining, the online gaming community certainly has a lot of overlap with the bitcoin community, and it's pretty cheap advertising.

Or they think that Mt. Gox reflects the bitcoin community at large.

Experian isn't a bank, it's a credit reporting agency. 
Are you suggesting that in your hypothetical bitcoin-oriented future, companies won't attempt to gauge the credit worthiness of prospective borrowers?
