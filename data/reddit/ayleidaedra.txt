Or lines of credit apparently, you gonna take us for a trip flyboy?

I mean, I might go to the gas station with my 10 bucks in Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:12:44
I wanna work for Bitcoins, doing what?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:26
You're blind to the fact Bitcoin is failing.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:41:58
Do they care about Ethereum over there?
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:52:42
Shared! Hope everything works out for you man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:33
No we don't. That's indicative of a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:28:31
You poor man :/ And here I am worrying about my $100ish dollars on GDAX, I'd be in shreds! We're with you buddy, this is unacceptable at this stage in the game, that's a lot of capital tied up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:11:21
I disagree. Coinbase/GDAX has long verifications and such, but at least they're site is up; Kraken has been down for like a month.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:37:07
If I was to buy like 0.001 BTC it almost seems dumb. Haha
Honestly, are we expecting that to be enough to buy more than like a moderately priced meal some day? I mean, of course we all hope it goes to $1M apiece, but do YOU personally think we're at the top of a bubble?
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:30:06
I didn't mean to sound demeaning. Haha- But I agree, that's what I mean about taking it to local businesses, as a sales pitch, try to make them see the value in them! The more backers, the more stable it is.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:24:07
I am a little salty because of my verification issues, and it appears a lot of other people over at r/coinbase are as well
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:36:53
Always buy now.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:24:04
This is the correct answer.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:43:26
Speculatively, yes, I believe Ethereum and Litecoin will go further. But this is no guarantee, and Ethereum is in a slump the last few days; But this is how it goes, up and down, by the week, by the month.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:23:03
And feel free to donate Ethereum in MY wallet, since that is what will prevail.
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:40:11
We used to use gold way back when, before there was a currency established by the government. Right now Bitcoin is the most legitimate cryptocurrency out there, I just feel like it's better spent more regularly than hoarded by nerds in their basement. Haha
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:37:54
Well hell yeah. If you can invent a popular coin and keep a bunch of them for yourself in the beginning, who wouldn't pull that one over? Haha
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:35:55
You buy them on an online exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, or GDAX. And yes.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:16:38
Good on ya cunt! I would drop into Ethereum as well.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:18:38
Can I be your Facebook friend? :D
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:39:20
There's always Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero, plus thousands of other coins! But I'm just trying to earn Bitcoins wherever I can find them, I'm hoping to make enough to fund a business venture and settle some bills!
