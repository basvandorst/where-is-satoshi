Social Security isn't an *investment* though. People pay into Social Security because the law says they must, not because they expect their investment to produce some future returns. So I'm not sure it makes sense to call it a Ponzi scheme.

I'm not sure why you'd expect money supply growth to be equal to population growth.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:42:49
Ponzi schemes are part of free markets, so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.

Or perhaps lots of market participants have bitcoins with MtGox, and want to hedge against the possibility that those coins *aren't* found. Market bet rates do not automatically comprise a probability assessment.

No, Austrian economists define inflation as an increase in the money *supply*. That isn't the same as the number of currency units in existence.

More importantly IMO, lending 1:1 is incredibly classist. If you're poor, you don't personally know the kind of people who will give you good terms.

This just isn't true. If I accidentally transfer $500,000 to the wrong person, the standard financial system *will* save me from my own ignorance. It might cost me some money and time, but I will not irreversibly lose the entire amount.

To be clear here: *broadcasting* a transaction has no associated fee. But there's no guarantee that all broadcasted transactions will be included in the blockchain. If you don't offer enough of a fee, miners may simply ignore you.

You have no guarantee about what is or is not recorded on a public library computer.

If businesses raise costs to account for the probability of lost or fraudulent transactions, then it starts being worth it for *me* to pay for the service. Like many middle class white people, I make a lot of POS purchases; if I paid 40 dollars a month for a rating service that saved me 5% at every cash register, I'd come out ahead. (And I doubt I'd need to be paying anywhere near 40 dollars a month.)

In that case, your webpage has a link to a document describing what you need to do. (To answer your question, you need to *have* written documentation of the amount of your loss, but you don't need to report it as a crime or submit proof unless audited.)

Income is income, whether it comes in the form of dollars or other assets.

Even given the complete set of input variables, and that they are correlated, there are an infinite number of functions.

What *specific* deduction are you trying to claim? Getting scammed is not generally tax deductible.

There is a law, but like many old laws, it's never enforced. It would almost certainly be found unconstitutional if someone tried to enforce it; the full text is


which is much too vague.

Nobody defines inflation as the rate of increase in the monetary base, though...
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:45:34
Again, not in general.
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:11:08
Which is why, in the modern world, many people avoid using cash or wire transfers unless absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:58:02
The old silk road was proof that many people are willing to conduct transactions in a negative trust environment *when necessary*. Nobody is going to provide escrow for drug transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:55:08
The problem is that the US government simply did not have enough gold to support the gold standard. If they wanted to stay on any kind of gold standard, they *had* to make private citizens sell them gold.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:48:49
When a match between buyer and seller is found, rather than doing anything itself, the exchange just notifies the two parties. They are responsible for executing the transaction however they mutually agree is best.

You can *in theory* do the things you're describing. In practice, a claim of ownership based entirely on colored coins is almost certainly not going to be enforced by any modern court, and thus a colored coin IPO would be meaningless.

Wal-Mart's argument is that transaction fees ought to be tightly regulated. I'm not sure how you think this squares with the unregulated transaction fees Bitcoin requires?
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:01:00
That sounds like a good thing. Fiscally responsible people can get faster confirmation times, but you don't run into the largest problem with the current credit rating system, where people who make credit mistakes start paying more for everything and getting fewer jobs.
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:09:06


No. One of the cool things about the modern world is that we don't *have* to know our producers and service providers; I can buy video games from Iceland and tea from Canada and shirts from China, without meeting the people I'm doing business with or even leaving my room. Why would the world be better if this weren't possible?
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:32:00
The problem is that, at the current level of block reward, mining is still not usually profitable. So when block rewards go down again, transaction fees will *have* to rise drastically.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:19:49
That literally doesn't mean anything. There are an infinite number of functions that can be extrapolated from past behavior; there is not a purely mathematical way to determine which will accurately describe future behavior.
@_date: 2014-07-29 09:42:43
No. Taxes have to be paid in US dollars, even if the income being taxed was not paid in that form.
@_date: 2014-04-04 11:25:17
It should be noted, however, that this policy was in place only because of the monetary stresses caused by the gold standard. When dollars are defined to be a certain amount of gold, the government must heavily regulate the gold market in order to protect dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:14:23


I mean... yes, good question! The only difference I see is that consumers bear 100% of the costs of fraud, which I think most people would agree is a serious problem.

Profits paid out to the owners are (of course) not retained by the company, and thus are not subject to this regulation.

Bitcoin currently provides a $12,500 mining reward every ten minutes. This will not be the case forever, so how are you so sure the Bitcoin network will continue to be powerful?
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:17:07
That's true, but it's not clear that Bitcoin transactions are common enough to mitigate the static fees.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:24:21
I don't know. When fiat bankers are charged with breaking laws, nobody says "well they paid a fine so it's not a big deal anymore".
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:00:01
Why should we care what you think the "point" of Bitcoin is?
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:19:43
People already complain that the tax code is too complicated. Can you imagine what it would be like if we started making new asset categories for everything that doesn't *quite* fit in the old ones?
