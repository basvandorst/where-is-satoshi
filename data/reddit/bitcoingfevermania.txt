Why does this company gets all the attention when Circle does everything they do FASTER and CHEAPER! 
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:53:35
Coinbase started as a great startup infused with a sense of freedom, and turned into a dragon worse than paypal! 
@_date: 2016-04-16 07:03:41
They are worse than any Bank, worst than Paypal, worse than any other offline or online service when it comes to demanding your private info! They literally asked me where did I send my BTC to. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:57:18
Coinbase never EVER had the intention of being a cute and free startup. Their biz plan was to abolish Paypal! They don't give a flying @ about you!! They are after the big money - being what Paypal was never able to be.

Is there an option to automatically refill your coinbase when using shift? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:40:57
What did you guys think about his comment about miners losing incentive to mine?
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:52:16
Thanks again. I would use this card if Coinbase would auto-fill my purchases. 
Maybe it's just me, but I want to know that at the end of the month, if let's say I made purchases equal to 3K, then it's 3K! 
I think they used to (or still?) do that when paying online to merchants? 
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:10:14
This bank is in the states? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:47:20
How's their volume? I sometimes wonder if I should sell on Gemini or Coinbase and I tend to eventually lean towards Coinbase because of their higher volume. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:29:02
Can anyone give an example of a real use of such a system? 
I am reading this thinking - wow. But I can't come up with an example use case. 
Anyone? 
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:10:25
What about Circle? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:27:29
what? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:09:08
are we talking about when selling???
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:53:59
No coders here to comment? 
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:50:11
I thought Circle doesn't have a price API...
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:26:41
USE CIRCLE AND SAVE THAT 1% COINBASE CHARGES! 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:21:59

@_date: 2015-12-09 15:48:18
Thanks for that. So by the time I get home I might find out that I payed $5 for a latte, instead of, let's say, $4. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:19:29
(Already posted though).
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:30:53
but if it is used only for clearing payments (Newegg, overstock, and so many others), does it have any value? 
It can still be used as a clearing payment (and a great one) even if it is worth only 0.01 dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:40:39

Are u joking? Maybe became I COULDNT!!!! 
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:00:11
BTW - someone referred me to bitrated.com which I will use if I find a seller. But where will I find a seller?
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:59:57
So... Don't know much about this. Is this now better than the highly recommended **breadwallet**? Are they different? Wish I knew more on these things but I don't. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 06:37:08
I agree. They are awesome and very quick to respond. They are also very fair, but I don't have time to go into details here and now. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:11:52
maybe that's a good thing? in the sense that it gives big companies the security they are after? if Coinbase is the face of bitcoin, perhaps it's a good thing for the general adoption. Slowly slowly merchants might decide that there is no urgent need to convert to fiat....
@_date: 2014-07-16 12:27:12
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:06:04
It's a jungle! I went over Cryptothrift, which seems the most developed, and it's bad. Can't trust a single seller. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:52:40
These two comments shows just how revolutionary bitcoin really is! 
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:13:38
EVERYONE IS GIVING the new people SHITTY advice! Stop thinking electrum is a good starter wallet!
Listen here Lexua, go to **Circle.com**, open an account, deposit some money via your bank account, and start from there. 
If you'll start messing with sophisticated wallets, you'll get desperate very fast.

creating a mathematical formula for this can be hard (psychology, game theory, percentage, statistics and so on - all need to be taken into account) - but it's possible and can refine itself with time.   
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:20:20
I doubt it's a scam. They are putting hard work into this. I attended a talk about it yesterday. Impressed. It's in the oven, about to fully bake. It will exist. The question is.... Well..... is Ether the next big thing?!

With Authy I trust the makers of the app....(didn't know that).... and this is also true to Google Auth.? 
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:28:29
coinbase is 1% (-: 
so if nothing beets Circle (which I assume no one does), then this makes them the best place as of now. But you never know, which is why I asked. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:00:56
Won't Bitcoin be "tamed" if it will become too threatening to the Government?

That's amazing!
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:30:43
Now you are talking! Thanks for that. So let me get this (finance to me is like......)... So instead of (circle/coinbase) holding coins and selling them or buying them, Buttercoin is a middle man between sellers and buyers? Am I getting this right? Thanks
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:26:18
Simple are awesome! 
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:42:48
Used it today. Solid! (but not if you are in a rush)
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:49:36
Also (thanks for the reply), how are they making it through Arbitrage? Can you break it down? 
* if i initiated a sell when market price is 380....
* and i am getting 380 for my btc...
* where is the gap?
* does it occur between the time of sell and the actual receiving of the money in my bank? that won't make sense I think, since the price might go down (not up) and they will lose. and there's no way they will expose themselves to this as a business practice. 
* so what arbitrage?
i do appreciate the discussion. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:52:43
look for the clues on the code box, then, simply stare. that out'a do it for you mate.

Thx for that! But what I am suggesting is not keeping my bitcoin on the iPhone at all! I will just write down the phrase. Is that a good idea? This way, even if my iPhone is stolen, rooted, there are no bitcoins on it. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:17:18
Coinbase charges fees (1%) for selling and buying. Circle is all FREE!

I thought they don't have the keys!!!
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:05:50
Lots of what you are saying is true and right for business! No rent, great exposure and so on. But remember that we are all already connected, and they supply a platform. For private occasional sellers, the fee is pretty high. Even if it's not, still it would be great to find a way to interact without a 3rd party and keep the full value.  
@_date: 2014-10-12 11:40:21
God willing it'll leave you broke! 
@_date: 2014-07-29 09:59:27
How are they able to do that? they take the hit if the price tanks? if the price goes up they are fine since they keep the difference? 
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:26:32
This is a joke??? I use Square Cash. It costs me nothing. As in zero. 0.

@_date: 2014-12-14 11:51:06
It's in the essence of what they are gambling with that's the point of it all. We can't avoid bailing them out because they will bring the entire economy to its knees. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:21:41
Min 24 is where the word bitcoin gets mentioned. And in a big way.
You should really watch the entire thing though. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:33:32
Thx. So U R saying I need to download this BitXpay software (which is a hassle) and once installed I will find sellers connected? Cause I have a feeling no one even tried this. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:36:21
sorry - noob here: what do you mean dwnld it? doesn't it have to be online to create the wallet?

how will this be done in OpenBazzar? Where will the buyer deposit his fiat? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:27:04
No, coinbase has WORSE price than Circle! So not only does Coinbase will give you LESS for your bits, they will also fee you 1% (which is a lot). 
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:56:43
I spend quite a lot of time thinking about this. I can't see why there should be a direct correlation between the price of bitcoin and the adoption of bitcoin. IDK. This stuff is confusing as hell to a non-financial, non-techie. Why can't it be that 1BTC=1USD and still be as widespread as hell?! 
Then again, I think Bitcoin will eventually only be used as a payment mechanism (sadly, because there's no way the USD and the US Government will let their legal bills decay), people will be willing to pay any price in order to buy Bitcoin and convert it to USD (or make a transaction by coinbase). Since the buyer doesn't mind what the price is (since he's converting back to USD anyways), the price of bitcoin can be as high as the demand for such services. 
IDK. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:20:23
thx for that! 
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:28:13
embarrassing! This teaches us a lesson: they sometimes pretend to know what they are talking about when it comes to Bitcoin. Most of them have no clue!  
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:05:19
Can anyone explain this? I mean - the feedback part at least. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:07:02
You clearly need to learn some basics of economy (not saying this in a bad way by any means).

oh i see. we r just talking reliability here? 
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:49:04
what do they do exactly? sorry, are they like coinbase/circle? US-based? 
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:39:21
I do have a linked bank account at Circle. No fees? That's amazing! That's a huge saving over Coinbase when selling a lot. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:09:20
Easiest thing you can do: open an account with Circle.com, and start from there. You will slowly get the idea. Link your bank to Circle and buy $10 worth of bitcoins. This will be your wallet. Safe, secure, insured. Want to move it? Start learning from there. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 11:26:07
So... this will kill bitcoin. I don't get what's hard here. If big banks will create their own crypto, and other big banks will follow, who will be left using bitcoin? What am i missing here?
Just please don't tell me that you think people will actually ditch their banking system for a decentralized one. Please - don't say that.

* I love Circle. They offer better rates for seller, no fees (at least that I can see), and their interface is rock solid (as well as gorgeous). 
* That being said, I had some issues with their availability of support: most of the time they are offline, and when sending them message, they take their time to respond. Maybe they are swamped right now, but still - i am waiting to resolve an issue for the last week now. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:11:43
What do you mean? You hacked into my account, now you are trying to move my coins. You need the second sig (Let's just make it easy and say I have only one additional key). Isn't the likelihood of you being able to breach another account slim at best (not to say - barely existing)?

@_date: 2014-12-14 09:27:43
Yes! 
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:49:24
But theoretically they can open a wallet, hold your bits and then send them to you (seller) after buyer confirms.

So if I have 1 Bitcoin now, lock it ($360), and tomorrow the price jumps to $1,000, and I want to unlock, Coinapult will need to buy 1 btc (which will cost them way more), and deposit that btc into my wallet???
Or what this means is that I will have only .3 btc (which are now worth $360)?

But are you not forgetting that the state - by those elected to represent the people - will see this as a traumatic condition which needs to be dealt with (and avoided - if it poses risks). 
Since the state has power (this is what makes it in charge - the ability to execute power), it will act towards the elimination of a ~~form of currency~~ technology which proposes people hold their own money.

PS - who do you suppose are the earners? Gift card holders? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:42:33
Sorry guys, but what does it mean? Short explanation will do. Thanks
@_date: 2016-01-04 09:20:02
Sure. I mean - as an "earner", you want to get something from Amazon but at the same time would like to keep the same amount of bitcoin. So you want to re-buy in the amount you sent/spent. The question is, when would be a good time to buy (you would want to rebuy as soon as possible to avoid a rate change that can go agains you)? 
A good time to buy would be when you can be sure the item will be delivered to you. 
So I was asking here, because based on experience of users, this might be as soon as order was places (but I already learned that this is not the case - as I see many orders are being dropped for some unknown reason). If not when places, then perhaps when confirmed for shipping. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:02:38

How does Bitcoin restrict/inhibits this? 
What you are suggesting by posting this, is that by eliminating the banks' ability to create money The People are actually taking control into their own hands. Politics have failed to do this. 
If I understand correctly. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:33:42
Wow. Thanks so much!!! Do you work for Purse? Very informative answer. In my case it is very important that I know the amount I actually paid for the item (in USD), so at some point I need to put a price on it. 
As of now I notice that there are multiple steps involved. Question is - at which step is the transaction non-reversible? 
1. Shoper (me) creates a desired item. 
2. Earner goes for it. 
--- I take it at this point this can still be cancelled. 
3. Earner submits an order number (can this be reversed?)
4. Earner submits shipping info (if previous step is reversible, what about this step)? 
5. Item is delivered (can item be wrong/defective)? 
Thanks again

@_date: 2016-01-14 20:10:10
Interesting. But I am not sure if this takes the account the nature of the laws of the land. Indeed, governments won't have control over the network, but does this mean - I wonder - that they can't execute other means to completely dismantle it? 
Isn't it enough that by dismissing it (this digital form of money) as a valid way to pay taxes strips it from a lot of it's power? 
But even if we don't go the route of looking for ways the government can inhibit it, and just focus on the fact that at no point will the government allow for it to be considered currency. There is enough in this act alone to maintain the current system. Wouldn't you say? 
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:51:27

@_date: 2016-01-03 13:18:45
Let me ask: 
if one wishes to replenish the same amount of bitcoins, when will be the best time to do so? 
- If you do this immediately at time of earner confirmed, you risk a cancellation. 
So perhaps when shipping occurs?

Wow. Joined. But isn't safe to assume that the more of us join the lesser the discounts are going to get? More bitcoin holders competing for "Earners". Till slowly it will probably decline to perhaps 5% discount. If enough bitcoin holders join, actually, one can see a point where the discounts slowly reduce to even lower than that. I think.

Doesn't this mean that wall street's entry into the arena will have little to no effect on the price of bitcoin? So even if they do use bitcoin's blockchain, this kind of use will not be meaningful to the price of bitcoin. I think. No? 
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:58:53
That's a phenomenal answer! Thank you for that!
However, to be honest, this makes the process a bit too complicated. 
Also, you mentioned that the seller is the one making the hedge, and that's an issue, because the seller usually is already stretching it when it comes to doing this in bitcoin. So there's no way that as a buyer I can so much as mention the word "hedge" (: He will run for the hills. 
Thanks for that reply tough, I have learned something awesome! 
@_date: 2015-09-22 07:37:15
If someone sends me "money", now I'm actually holding bitcoin in my app and I'm subjected to bitcoin's volatility, no? 
Or is it immediately cashed out?
@_date: 2015-09-16 07:37:27
Thanks for that! 
What does *"he can open a hedge"* mean? I am assuming one would opt in to this? But how does this help exactly? I must be retarded. 
So if I have 1 million dollars worth of bitcoin in escrow, and now I create (?) a hedge (ot opt for one? what's the right term?) for the same amount (so I hedge 1million worth of bitcoin), this protects me from the volatility of bitcoin? 
Sorry - i get that this is easy to some of you guys - but how? 
Does this mean that if the price of bitcoin slashes by half, than I actually gained that half based on my hedge? 
If so - again I have to ask - how does this happen? 
I guess this helps: 
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:17:53

@_date: 2015-09-27 20:01:42

@_date: 2015-09-13 20:29:41
Thank you. I am truly trying to follow. 
Here's what I don't get: why is higher demand = higher price? This is a natural law of economics, but does it apply here? 
Even if the entire world will use the blockchain, can't the price of bitcoin still be just, let's say, 1 dollar? Why not? 
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:36:31
Circle. 
* Regarding Coinbase, I still don't get how they can allow themselves to charge 1% in withdrawal fee (which quckly becomes more expensive than ACH back fees!!!) when their competition (Circle) charges %0! 
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:54:59
Not that I know of
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:26:38
Thanks for that. This is outside the scope of my original question, but what is the meaning of "bitcoin becoming a settlement layer"? 
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:48:37
That's interesting! Thanks
Hedging means they are unaffected by the price movement regardless if it goes up or down?
@_date: 2015-09-14 07:57:53
Wow! Thank you so much for that elaborated answer. Still digesting this. Thanks! 
This is what struck me the most in your answer: 
* *"Adoption absolutely doesn't need to drive price up. Only adoption of Bitcoin as a means of store of value does, not as a payment channel."*
What is amazing about this is that **one can imagine a scenario where bitcoin is a highly dominated payment platform, yet it's value is very low?** 
You see - the guys above seems to suggest that **usage is inherently linked to the demand, therefor to the price. But your statement (quoted above) suggests otherwise**.
Am I following correctly? 
Thanks again! This is very enlightening.

Agreed but I think unless you are planning on keeping your USD under the mattress, you must store it somewhere. The question or discussion I am raising here is - should you move it from a bank to one of these. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:22:09
**“I’ll be surprised if bitcoin is here in five years,”** he has told Fortune. **“The value of bitcoin isn’t the currency, but the technology**. I think once the world becomes more accustomed and attuned to the platform of bitcoin, the noise will go away, and the currency will go away too. The real transformation is the idea of taking all barriers down . . . Whatever currency or commodity you want to transact in, you can, and you can do it for free.”
Minor, too, predicts that bitcoin as a currency “will get destroyed.” He likens the coin’s current market cap—about $3.7 billion—to “an accounting mistake or rounding error that Bank of America makes.” He says that finding staffers with business bona fides, not just bitcoin veterans, was an intentional move. “I did what most companies in fintech haven’t done, I went and got people with solid, serious banking credentials,” Minor says. “I got the CISO of MasterCard, the CIO of Barclays. And **the reason they came is they were going to a digital currency company, not a bitcoin company**.”
I never fully got this. Can the tech (blockchain) stand without the currency (bitcoin)?

Hi ldrapeau. 
What about using Circle as a way to transfer money from one currency to another while skipping the bank? For example, instead of making an international wire via the bank (which costs a lot), one might buy btc at local currency, then issue a sell-order at Circle for the same amount. 
Is this considered a violation of their terms? 
Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:01:59
This is going to be amazing! Can't wait to ask every seller I deal with (many) if they are on OB. They will surely go and check it out. Question is if it's gonna be easy for non-bitcoiners.

May I also ask - can you explain why you believe this to be the case? 
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:37:18
Thanks again! Very interesting! 
So... what is stopping Circle (let's say) from going after businesses and telling them - hey, look, we can do this for you without (or very little) fees. 
This sounds like a good deal for any business owner (since their margins are highly important - any fraction counts). 
What do you think? 
I am asking this since it seems that Circle are already holding the power to transfer money for free. 
Sorry, this is confusing. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:56:57

For a real ownership of $1 on my part they will allow me to gamble with $100? 
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:00:22
Thanks so much for that informative answer. I get it now. 
When you say Coinbase and Bitpay want to get there... you mean to the point where they issue a debit card... and then.... since they hold your fiat.... they can make this happen more smoothly? Am I getting this?

*"This technology will be hardcoded into the device apparently making it hard to jailbreak or opt out of mining for crypto"*
*"electronic devices with mining circuitry may be grouped to form a pool"*
*"a percentage of the new currency such as 50% (or any desired percentage) may be assigned to the predetermined wallets."*
@_date: 2015-10-18 08:18:32
So it's kind of like this (i am really asking here): 
* we have X amount of bitcoin, here's a prove of that. Now, based on amount X of bitcoin, we lend out Y amount of USD. So here, we are solvent.

You should be happy. If this is what got you into knowing about bitcoin, this might be the best thing that ever happened to you (exaggerating here). I am being serious. Start researching and go to Circle.com and buy yourself a $100 worth of bitcoin. You won't regret it.

Questions: 
1. is it possible to now color these coins and therefore mark them as non-usable (at least to some extent). To my understanding US-based licensed companies like Coinbase, Gemini and Circle are already limiting coins which they consider to be of illegal source. 
2. Is it not possible to trace the holder of these coins?

Which company raised the money?

Nothing. But found these:

I have a feeling the plot will thicken and what we now think we know will end up being very far from the truth. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:04:30
But here's what I don't get: coibase are more expensive! 
PS - I have been using circle from day 1. They are great.

Thank you. So one can imagine a future in which the banking system has its own blockchain. Correct? 
Can bitcoin compete with such a collaboration of titans? 
*mind you, these titans overreach politics, academia, and so on.

Anyone can explain to a human what this does? Use case?
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:39:19
Thanks so much!!!
Regarding coinbase exchange, does this help?
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:31:52
I wonder if this is new blood coming into bitcoin for the first time...
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:27:30
Here's what I don't get. Where did JVP got this message from??? Who is controlling these coins?
*I also have a message for Dr. Wright from the trustee of the Tulip trust that is controlling the coins that he wants to move. Not yet announced:*

I personally don't think they were fooled by CW. This story is far from over. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:39:45
Delusions of grandeur?

An example use case for humans?

She's a powerhouse. I wonder how this going to evolve in the longer run. 
The thought of a closed private blockchain is appealing when you are a bank. The first major company to offer such a service is going to win - banks are going to adopt it. It's just going to improve their own systems though. So only time will tell how this will effect the bitcoin universe.

So let me understand this: if I sell bitcoins on the exchange, there's no fee? And then, if I want to move the USD to my bank account, no fee?
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:37:37
ELI5 anyone? 
Basically instant moving of coins across the blockchain? (instead of the dreaded wait for confirmations)?
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:59:35
So it was all staged. The entire thing. But for what purpose? What reason? Who is CW working for? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:33:58
Sorry - where are these pics? 
@_date: 2015-10-30 08:37:46
Circle is the best for this. 
If you are selling, never take paypal!!! 
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:34:14
Anyone knows what's with the name? What's "Gemini"?

New yorkers won't be able to use it, US citizens will be required to file tax returns on profits, and so are you. 
The legal jurisdiction isn't territorial, it's personal. 
EDIT: this is for the best of my knowledge.

Thank you coiner2013!!!

Hi there. Care to explain this to a 5-year-old like myself in terms of trying to figure out what's going on here? Thanks. Don't mean to bother by the way. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:34:00
Research it. Too much info, and it's very cool if you like mystery and drama. It's actually quite unbelievable. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:30:48
Who? Link? 
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:43:29
I don't get it - were you using the exchange or the regular way (non-exchange)? Exchange is immediate is it not? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:03:34
Thanks for the answer, but sorry - I don't follow. You are saying this was meant to be a publicity stunt for the sake of bitcoin as a whole? 
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:28:58
This statement is of enormous importance. Can't stress this enough. Bitcoin as a safe-heaven asset is a somewhat new narrative with very meaningful implications. IMHO.
@_date: 2015-10-13 11:41:56
I love them too

Does it cloud? I mean - sync across devices?
