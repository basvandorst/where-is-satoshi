Bitcoiner's dream: worldwide adoption.
Only 21 million coins in the world.
Real wealth is generated by farmers, researchers and other technological advancements.
Suply of crops increase, but drop in price because can't create more then 21 million coins.
Instead of farmers, researchers, receiving the benefits of their innovation, the early adopters simply get richer because they bought their coins early.
This is bad because the increase in relative wealth should go to the innovators of wealth creation. That is their whole incentive for innovation.
This rudimentary example is just highlighting one example why inflation is not necessarily just an evil way for reserve bankers to steal your money.

Do you not see the irony? Even one bit?

Okay so the farmers become more efficient thus creating wealth.
Their wealth should increase relative to farmers who have not achieved this efficiency.
What you're suggesting by a decrease in prices is that everyone who holds money should benefit from the new wealth.
The farmers should increase higher RELATIVE wealth due to THEIR creation of REAL wealth.
You can call this following statment an Ad Hominem all you want. I'm simply addressing the greed which I personally observe in this forum:
Bitcoin investors want the non-inflationary amount of 21 million coins to be adopted by the whole world. They want to be the early adapters. They want to hold all the currency in the world (which is stagnant) while growth continues (thus creating deflation).
Therefore they want to become wealthy off the creation of real wealth - WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING other than simply invested while it's cheep coinz.
Anyway that's my opinion on why some bitcoiners promote a stance on deflationary currency rather than inflationary currency.
It's not because it's the theory that makes more sense. It's the one that justifies their investment into Bitcoin. 
And the irony to top it all off is that you call the bankers the greedy 1%, when that is what you all hope to become if bitcoin becomes adopted worldwide.

No I'd much rather post on reddit:
 "boohoo my coins got stoled, please return out of the kindness of your heart"

You're not surprised to see it because you lack the critical thinking abilities to realise it's a bullshit statement
