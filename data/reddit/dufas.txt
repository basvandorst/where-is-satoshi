I don't know how to get around verifying people's identities/voter qualification without using something like a SS database, but you're right in saying that defeats some of the purpose of decentralization.
As for this all being academic, what we're talking about is a *huge* endeavor that would require a lot of hardware and extremely talented computer scientists, but I don't think that a reddit discussion couldn't help bringing some of those people/concepts together.

Great point, and probably the greatest reason something like this is necessary. The "government" doesn't have to institute something like this, we the people can just start doing it, it's up to us. 
I didn't forget we lost democracy, I am reminding us we need to bring it back. Let's be optimistic and overlook the powers we're up against and brainstorm how a system like this might work

Votes could be distributed just like transaction history is distributed with bitcoin. Every voter would have the entire history of votes and every voter would tabulate on their own

wow. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CASH OUT 1.5 MILLION BITCOINS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IT IS ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. IF YOU TRIED, YOU WOULD GET NO MONEY FOR YOUR BITCOINS. IF HE WANTED TO CASH OUT HE WOULD *HAVE* TO DO IT OVER A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. Do you understand?

I mean he could do that but if he sold 1.5 million at once and got one cent for each, that is 15 thousand dollars... why would he sell them for so cheap? if he sells them little by little he could get 100 dollars for each one and make a lot of money

you could redeem your social security number for a vote. I guess the government or whatever could have a lot of fake social security numbers for sockpuppets.

Representative democracy isn't a bad thing so long as everyone votes knowledgeably on representatives. 
I'm imagining a digital voting system that would allow less corruption in this process, so that only legitimately popular reps would get voted into office. Then, regarding your problem 4, when something came up, we would have representatives we voted for and trust working hard to mitigate any faulty/dangerous/poor decisions.
Regarding  and  we need an improved voting system so that we can vote on better budgets for education, so that we can have more educated voters in the future! Kind of a catch 22, but there is hope!
Really great input, thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:36:55
Both very good points. 
It would be very complicated, but maybe by localizing the system (not one big national registry/ledger, but city/statewide vote registration (not voter registration) that would then be later pooled with other state/city vote registries, it could make the system more manageable and, while still being complicated, would add transparency and trust. I'm not sure exactly how this would work, but most people are using the internet now to order products, which involves typing in long, highly specific/unique number combinations (credit cards) and logging on, and sending encrypted information ,etc, etc, so I think it is not overly complicated. Making it not fallible is the really big thing here and I think we can make headway by thinking about how to avoid fallibility.
The conspiracy thing also is a very good point, but now we have actual digital voting booths (closed source) and proven, verifiable conspiracies involving vote fraud by using them, so we have already made the step into this imaginary digital world of voting. Now, I think, we must improve it and make it more secure and decentralized and fair. 
Your points are valid, but I don't think something being complicated/involved is a reason it won't work.
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:00:10
I agree. Email has virtually (hehe) replaced snail mail, why can't we replace analog voting methods with secure digital ones?
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:54:22
I don't think people vote enough, especially lower income voters ( who might benefit the most from getting officials that represent them well into office. I think a solution to this, and the registration question, would be mandatory voting or tax break or something. This is a really good point though, because even if we created a better way to vote, plenty of people still would not register. How do you think we could make registering easier?
If your login was your name your password could be your social security number, and the government already has these "passwords" registered. I think we could afford to hire people to be in charge of this. Authentication though is a really big issue, because if we are trying to lessen government-side fraud, but we are basing our registration on a government-based SS registry, I see the possibility of made up SS being used to fake votes. I don't know how we could decentralize our votes AND the registry, but both would be important to keep entities from manipulating entries.
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:15:10
You're right, if we are trying to curb government corruption we can't rely on a government index of voters.
Being able to check your vote would be a step in the right direction, but like you said everyone could check their vote, and there could still be a bunch of fake votes.
Is there a way we could issue votes in a similar way that there are a finite amount of bitcoins? How could we verify that only real people had votes?
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:06:58
Great ideas! With the amount of time saved by voting online (you don't have to drive to the polling location, and sit in traffic, etc, etc) mandatory informative videos could be instituted! No one would be able to complain, because it would *still* be faster than normal voting, AND would lead to more informed voters. Vote from home mail-away ballots work just like this already.
Right now there is too little accountability, I think you are definitely on to something with the idea of "political karma"
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:10:22
Representative government helps to mitigate this, but I think that, percentage wise, not enough people vote, so the representatives in office do not represent the majority of the population.
Most of the power should be left to the states, and remain in the states ,because that means smaller, less complicated processes all around.
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:24:54
Excellent point. said above that the same system could be used in all sorts of environments. for example, the same network used by cities could be used by congressmen, and because it would be an open source, common voting system, there would be more transparency. This would make politics easier to understand, and eventually move us toward direct democracy.

very very obvious basis of common sense... if he tries to cash out all at once, it won't work, everything will crash, he will get no money. if he does it little by little he can get money for his coins.
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:23:20
I put direct democracy in the title to offer inspiration, but I really want to talk about instituting a digital voting system using our representative government. I agree that a direct democracy is dangerous, but we need more people to vote and there to be no fraud involved in the election of representative officials.
@_date: 2013-06-27 21:00:53
Wow! This is amazing work! The last point about inducting new voters is really great. I am still reading over and thinking about all your points. In the mean time, how would a system like this be implemented? It would have to be simple enough that a grandma could do it.

by -------------
    Here's my version, copy-pasted and edited from other places where I've written it before:
     
    ---
     
    The process, summarized:
     
    Every voter has their a **personal keypair**, using asymmetric key cryptography. This can be arranged by for example using ID cards as smart cards. While the issuer can have a copy of the private key that it's made with, you generate a new keypair instantly, signs a "keypair swap note" with the existing key and the public key of the new keypair, and send that note to the issuer. They now store your new public key. Now you have an ID card with a secure keypair!
     
    A number of different organizations participate in the voting process, several with **conflicting interests**, very intentionally. We use **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC)** between them to ensure security. EFF + ACLU + NSA + FBI + White House + those running the election + [whoever]. Using SMPC protocols, they run certain algorithms in a way that **NOBODY can know what they aren't supposed to know!** The know nothing other than what they put in and what they are supposed to get as output from it - and because they *don't* want to work together to spy on or alter the result, it's safe!
     
    When they begin, they all create a random "seed" each (a *large* random number) so that the virtual SMPC machine can generate secure cryptographic keys (the SMPC protocol simulates a trusted 3rd party computer). First of all, when the SMPC machine has the random seeds, it XOR them all together to ensure it's random (XOR anything with a random string and the output is random - this means that only *one* participant needs to be honest and use a true random number).
     
    The participants also **provide a list of voters and their public keys**. All participants must provide IDENTICAL lists, or the SMPC algorithm's logic will detect it and just stop with an error. This means that all SMPC participants have an equal chance to verify the list of voters in advance, because the list can't be altered after they all have decided together which to use.
     
    Now, the SMPC machine runs the first round, the **SMPC key generation** and **voter list compilation** round. All the participants enter their random seeds and the list of voters. Now the SMPC machine **generates a keypair for itself**. Then it signs the entire list of voters and inludes it's public key in the output. Then it **splits it's own SMPC keypair** between the SMPC participants using **Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS)**, so that the participants together can use SMPC again later to do the counting with the same keypair, and yet not be able to spy on anything.
     
    (Edit: I removed special voting keypairs frmo the system.)
     
    Time for voting.
     
    **The public SMPC key is now distributed EVERYWHERE**. On every advertisement about the voting, the key is there (maybe in Qr code form). This ensures that everybody knows what it is, and thus we prevent Man-in-the-middle attacks against voters (which would be somebody swapping out the SMPC key to find out what people voted for).
     
    Now, **the voter** makes his vote. He **generate a nonce** (unique number used once), **makes his vote**, signs it with his keypair, and **encrypts this with the public SMPC key**. This vote is now sent to the voting management organization (maybe this is done on-the-spot). Since the vote wasn't encrypted with *the voter's* key, he can't decrypt it which means that nobody can prove what he voted for using the encrypted message.
     
    The next SMPC protocol runs, the **vote counting round**. The encrypted votes and the signed list of public voting keys is given to it. The SMPC key is reassembled inside the virtual SMPC machine using SSSS. It decrypts the votes, **verifies all votes**, checks that no voter's key is used more than once, checks that the votes follow the given format, and **counts them**. When it's done, it **generates the voting statistics** as output, where each vote is listed together with all vote nonces listed next to it, and the SMPC then signs this output. Expect for the vote result itself, the statistics could also include things like the number of possible voters (how many there was in the voting list), the number of votes, how many parties there were, how many votes each party got, etc...
     
    So now **you search for your nonce** in the output and checks that the vote is correct. **The nonce CAN NOT be tied to you**, it's just some random number. You can lie that it belongs to somebody else, you can pretend to have another one. The number of votes can be verified.
     
    However, done in this way we're vulnerable to a so called "birthday attack". The thing is that if there's been 20 000 votes for political party X and their followers threaten 5 000 people, chances are that more than one voter will claim the same nonce voting for party X is theirs (roughly 22% risk per-voter). So how do we solve this? Simple: Let the voter make both *one real* vote and several *fake* votes ("decoy votes"). Then the voter has several false nonces that he can give, including one that says that he voted for party X. Only the voter himself can know which nonce belongs to the real vote! To prevent the adversary that threaten him from figuring out if and how many false votes the voter made, the size of the encrypted voting messages should be static with enough margin for a number of "decoy votes" (if there's several possible adversaries that could threaten you based on your vote). Now these guys could threaten 30 000 people, but even if there's just 20 000 voters for their party, they can't say which 10 000 it was that voted for somebody else or prove anybody wrong.
     
    The best part? **We can use ANY type of voting**, such as preferential, approval, wheighted, ranked, etc! It's just a piece of text anyway, and you can "encode" ANY kind of vote in it! You can use a simple most-number-of-votes, or score from 1-10, etc...
     
    In the end, you know that your vote has been counted correctly, everybody knows no fake votes have been added, that none has been removed, it's anonymous, and the only way to force individual voters to vote as you wish is to physically watch them vote.
     
    If you trust that these maybe +10 agencies won't all conspire against the voters (including EFF &amp; ACLU?), you can be pretty sure the voting has been anonymous AND secure. The only way to alter the counting or other computational parts on the side of the voting management requires nearly full cooperation between people in ALL participating organizations that have full access to the machines running the Secure Multiparty Computation protocol - and they MUST avoid ALL suspiscion while at it!
     
    ---
     
    **Advantages**
     
    * If you can distribute personal keypairs securely to the voters, nobody can alter/fake votes outside the Secure Multiparty Computation system.
     
    * A majority of the Secure Multiparty Computation participants have to collude and be in (near) full agreement to break the security of the system. If their interests are conflicting, it just won't happen.
     
    * The security of the system relies on the cryptographic security + the low risk of collusion among enough SMPC participants. If you accept both of these points as strong, this system is strong enough for you.
     
    * It's anonymous
     
    * You can verify your vote
     
    * You can't be blackmailed/forced to reveal your vote, because you can fake *any* vote
     
    **Potential weaknesses**
     
    * The public won't fully understand it
     
    * The ID smartcards with the personal keypairs must be protected, the new personal keys must be generated securely
     
    Edit: I've changed the scheme a bit now. It should be entirely secure against all "plausible" attacks except for hacking all the SMPC participants at once or against an attacker that can watch you physically while you make the vote. The latter should not be an issue in most places and can probably not be defended against with *any* cryptographic scheme, while the first is all about infrastructure security, and also not cryptographic security.

this is *really* beautiful. A thought of mine would be that along side the ACLU and the FBI and whoever is tabulating votes, every state, or every major city, or every major university, could also get on board. This would make it even more difficult for corruption to happen (I'm thinking spies or what not could infiltrate even the aclu and turn all 10 organizations into totally biased tabulators). Companies would get tax breaks for providing hashing power/tabulating votes, so that even big banks and what not could be part of the tabulators (although we would have to vote on who gets these responsibilities, and they should change often)
