If you use for example bitstamp to buy the bitcoin and you use the buy now feature, you will receive the bitcoin in full to your bitstamp account very quickly. So by your example you now have 1 btc on your account, which you can transfer to your own wallet whenever you like. The problem is getting Euros or whatever to bitstamp in the first place, it may take a couple of days during which the price will change.

Some do pay regular dividends, however their value might fall more than all previous dividends you received, thus being a net loss. But they might also appreciate, who knows?

Yeap same message I got... But still, if enough suggest it maybe it'll happen!

Look into Electrum, which uses deterministic wallets meaning that they can be restored from a strong pass phrase generated at creation. So you only need to store that pass phrase securely and at any time in the future you can restore your wallet with all funds intact. So no need for multiple backups and all that hassle.

You could do it with number of atoms in the earth, solar system, a galaxy and so on to find a good match. Wolfram alpha will give you estimates on those.

Well this is regarding the odds of someone else randomly choosing the same number as your wallet, thus gaining control of your funds and that happens whether you have encrypted your wallet or not. Encryption/password protects you from someone actually stealing the file on your computer by hacking.

Sure, but like all security through obscurity, you're vulnerable when someone finds your trick. For example by having a bot that tries to QR scan all images on your hard drive.

Interesting! Would it be possible to design a "handcalc-coin" for use in say the 1900th century with hand calculations that are feasible? Or maybe using a mechanical hashing tool of some sort? Communication by snail mail and telegraphy.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:16:38


I suggest you use a truecrypt volume to encrypt files. Or an encrypted wallet using Electrum or similair.

My understanding is that each miner gets a "work unit" with a bunch of numbers to test. The pool distributes those, so no number is tried twice within the pool.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:06:52
But the mass distribution of the printed numbers must also be the same! Not just center of gravity but also moment of inertia in all directions.

I love how Bitcoin is exactly like "credits" in sci-fi movies. I mean have you ever seen a futuristic movie with multiple currencies, slow transfer speeds and so on? Hmm, wonder how long until we see a sci-fi movie where Bitcoin has taken over everything and people buys sodas for µSatoshis?

Actually, if you use gaussian blur in PS, many layers of blur=one layer of stronger blur, they add together. However if you blur it enough it is unrecoverable. It only works with gaussian blur. Anyhow just a little nugget of info :)

Electrum is really easy to use though. I think it's possible for parents to use it :P

Litecoin creates a new block every 2min compared to Bitcoins 10min, which makes confirmations faster. 
Also it is designed to be ASIC resistant, which means that it is hard to make specialized hardware for mining, so GPU mining LTC is still effective. This is with the hope that mining remains more decentralized without big actors taking large a large piece of the mining market.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:32:03
But not in practice.

Arbitrage is hardly risk free, especially in Bitcoin where your $10 difference could vanish in the blink of an eye. Moving Fiat between exchanges isn't instant either.
But yeah I do agree that OP does not know what arbitrage is. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:31:07
Why then, go ahead... But please read up on fiat transfers to and from those exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:08:33
Why the distinction?
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:05:55
Wow, 100% positive and they even said "digital" currency rather than "virtual".

You can mine Litecoins somewhat profitably on a gpu, and exchange them for Bitcoins. Look over at [r/litecoinmining]( for more info and help. You need a powerful gpu, cheap electricity and some time to set it up. Note that the computer is basically locked up while mining. Good luck!

I disagree with Ms. Calvery, there will always be countries with less regulation if America chooses to regulate heavily. She says that all other countries will follow with regulation, but do you think China really would do that, if they see an opportunity to move innovation over to them by having less regulation? Also as noted in the hearing, where are the majority of digital currency exchanges located? Well, not America, and why is that do you think?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:09:43
I use bitstamp.com, which works well!
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:34:40
It will always (or at least in theory) be profitable for SOME people, those with efficient enough mining equipment. Every one else will pay too much for electricity and other costs for any profitability.

What you say is true, but the number of possibilities with 128bits is so enormous that by my humble calculations it'll still take 10 trillion years to find one wallet. That's with 10 billion users and checking 1billion hashes/sec (something like 1 gpu can do).
Math: 
     (10000000000/2^128)*100000000*60*60*24*365*10000000000000=93% 
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:50:16
I use Electrum, no sync time and deterministic wallets!

Indeed, you can leave feedback on there with a suggestion to add btc. It's worth a shot!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:24:33
To be fair, I'd never use a system without a password, so that's an extra step.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:36:35
Use the feedback button on WA to suggest a change!
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:14:14
Yeah there's a reason, it's not so much about fees, but more like lots of hoops to pass through and time for transfers to complete. Getting fiat into btc-e is hard/expensive/slow and getting fiat out of gox is -very- slow. But yes you could probably earn money doing it, just not risk free and not as much as the price difference might suggest.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:54:58
You could check out  might be able to help you, but I don't know if he can since you have it on blockchain...
Anyway he seems reputable, just search this subreddit for some good feedback.

Nah, I use 0 confirmation mode on my sound system. A bit lower sound security though..
