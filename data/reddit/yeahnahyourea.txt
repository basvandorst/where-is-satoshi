Very true. I did not imply that the risk was the same in 2011 as it is now.

"Sir, this $800 TV will be 1 BTC."
"B-b-b-but I paid $900 for 1 BTC on Gox!"

Now *that* would be good news ;)

You are lucky in the sense that other people share the same appetite for risk as you do, only now they are paying $800 a coin as opposed to your $5 a coin three years ago. If I were you, I wouldn't bother talking to people about it. They will always try to justify themselves not being wrong, by saying you got lucky it took off. They will probably be the same people who out of nowhere want to be best friends now.

First few comments. This is as good of news as an Amish store accepting credit cards

Somewhere in the world, the guy that did the opposite of what you did is crying at the cubical, and the lady there doesn't know about the drop (the opposite of your situation rite). Poor fella

Blue pill for your USD wallet, redpill for the btc wallet :D

This is where BTC could make huge headway.

Great time for them to release this statement. Where do we go from here?

So this is overly-hyped news? I think most people will take it as a reversal of China when it in fact was never reversed to begin with.
