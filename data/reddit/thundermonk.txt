Your spam makes me sick. You are a grown man and you spam us like a child would with their first website link. Get it together. Scum.

One mines Bitcoin and the other doesn't.

Because you stole the idea from bitcoinjobs.com and the address you supplied for donations has gone through a taint analysis which revealed you are using your BitCoin on SilkRoad (as well as other, more shady websites).
You should be shamed.

I think it is actually to do with the block reward halving every 4 years (starting with 50BTC, currently 25 BTC). If it keeps halving, then eventually it has to run out and 21 million is just a rounded version of that number and 2140 is the year it will happen.

You don't.
Maybe that's a reason for the government to keep bItcOiN around, it would make tracking terrorist money a lot easier to automate.

They don't have that much computing power. Take the largest super computer the world has ever known, now multiply it by 4 and that is slightly comparable with BitCoin on a bad day.
Also, people who build super computers build them for specific purposes or general purposes. At this point a general purpose one couldn't catch up to the speeds of the specialist GPU and ASIC mining (in parallel), and a a specific purpose one, well, has a specific purpose.
Each day that passes is another day the BitCoin network is stronger and safer, 51% attack isn't as easy as you think. One of the fallacies of distributed computing was motivation, and BitCoin solved that quite nicely so if the NSA wants to attack it, it would be a very costly matter and once they were done, they couldn't repurpose the hardware.
Intelligence agencies benefit from BitCoin, because it allows them to collect intelligence.

Yeah, I mentioned that, the bit where I am talking about not being able to repurpose hardware? That would be an ASIC.

You choose your fee, it just so happens you choose to you the default which is 0.0005. As BTC is worth more, the default changes in the software but if you choose to pay a lower fee, then that is up to you (and maybe some charitable miner will take your transaction for free).
Check the settings in your favourite client.

The way arbitrage is usually done is you keep funds on both exchanges to take advantage of movements.
