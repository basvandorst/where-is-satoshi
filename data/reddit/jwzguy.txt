It doesn't bother us because you don't just have to offer a slightly better alternative to Bitcoin to overcome the existing network effect. You have to offer something EXTREMELY superior. And when that thing comes, yes, if it's compatible with Bitcoin's ideals, it's possible to hard-fork Bitcoin to incorporate whatever it offers. It's also possible for us to switch to it after it gets moderate success...you don't have to "predict" whether it will get adoption or not. Finally, the sidechain/treechain models apparently offer a way for Bitcoin holders to temporarily take advantage of an important feature in an alt-coin which isn't available in Bitcoin (disclaimer: I haven't had time to become fully educated on this topic yet.)
All in all - we have nothing to worry about from competition, in fact, the existence of anything superior to Bitcoin will make the world a much better place whether you're in on day zero or not, the same way Bitcoin already is. Productive people don't have to worry about making the perfect investments at the perfect times, they only need to worry about whether the world they live in will allow them the freedom to be successful through their own efforts.

The web interface is very powerful, actually, it has a lot more features than the QT client. And because you re-download your encrypted backup from any browser, it is functionally as convenient as a traditional web-wallet with whom you are trusting your keys (unlike BC.i). They have done a fairly good job of giving people the best of both worlds.

If Keepass doesn't offer automatic online backups, you are introducing a different kind of risk to your solution. Thanks for being an asshole about it, though, I can tell you are really trying hard for a constructive conversation here.
And I have access to my BC.i wallets, so I guess "you clearly have no clue what you're talking about." Expecting their servers to be online every second of every day and never having a single error, FOR FREE, is unreasonable to me. But then again, I didn't tell you how to set your own standards, if they don't meet them, then you are welcome to not use them.

I wouldn't trust whatever random guy is doing setups at Guitar Center unless you already know him and are happy with him.
There's a big problem with outsourcing your guitar setup. The most important part requires a lot of personal input from you. 
As said, it's really something that any even half-serious guitarist should be doing themselves. If you're a beginner though, it's understandable you'd want a "professional" to take care of it. But just know that your mileage will vary a LOT with someone setting up a guitar without you actually being present the entire time, unless you can at least give them another guitar you own that's been set up to your liking. You should at the very least know everything they are going to do so you can make sure they're doing it.
Not to be presumptuous, but are you sure you actually want to buy a guitar at Guitar Center? The guitar market is ALWAYS a buyer's market. When the recession dipped I actually lost a little self control and ended up with 6 or 7 guitars I didn't really need. Now that so many pawn shops are selling on ebay (they already scalped someone and are apparently willing to let shit go for under half the street value, which is more like 25% of the guitar center "new" price) I can't imagine ever paying full price unless it was a custom shop job. 
Also, don't let Guitar center prices fool you into thinking you're getting a deal. The MSRP on guitars is ridiculous compared to what they actually sell for.

1. Credit card payments do -not- confirm in seconds, it takes months. You can get better assurance that a 0-conf payment from the Bitcoin network will not be reversed in seconds with a little transaction analysis than you will in hours from a credit card processor. These types of improvements can be made at client-level, and are indeed being worked on as we speak.
1. This is certainly true, and not a Bitcoin-specific problem. There are solutions and constant progress. Until the risk/reward ratio is high enough for you, you are completely justified in being cautious.
1. You don't get consumer protection from the Fed when using dollars, so there's no reason you should write off Bitcoin for not providing it. If anything, Bitcoin has much more low-level "protection" than any other payment network in the world. If you want escrow and arbitration, you have to go through a 3rd-party service that provides it - there will likely be an additional cost. At least with Bitcoin you have more choices.
I think you just need to be a little patient. Nothing pops into existence fully-formed and problem-free.

Paypal to paypal transfers cost .30 + 2.9% + currency conversion fees of at least 2.5% to someone using a different currency, which in the context being discussed (Western Union's market), is the likely scenario.
If you want to discuss "gift" transfers, those are very limited and if you try to use more than a few per year, or for large sums, there is a significant risk that Paypal will freeze your account.
There are many ways to get Bitcoin, some of them require zero ID, some brokers like Coinbase have tiers which require much much less than a bank. But every bank account I've opened has required a SSN. No exchanges ask for this. 
Regardless, I wasn't saying Bitcoin is the most fungible and perfect system on earth. The longer it's around, the more fungible and frictionless it gets. I was directly responding to your comment that "Paypal is free." Paypal is only free in very limited and specific circumstances. For most use cases Paypal is not remotely free. That doesn't mean it's not the best choice in many of those use cases. It just means there is room for a lot of competition.

Besides the block reward halving,  there have been several times in the past where the price fell more than 50%, and people were sure that a large % of miners would be mining at a loss, and the difficulty would fall. 
It didn't, because the assumptions made then and the assumptions made now are incorrect. If you want me to re-argue a point that's already been argued to death, sorry, I am not going to do that. Divest until the block reward halving is past if you're unconvinced, it's as simple as that.

To add to this, their operators have remained anonymous. However, they've been around longer than anyone else still operating.

Again, instead of trying to argue with an analogy, just make your points. In reality, no one brings gold OR silver to a supermarket, but comparing Bitcoin and Litecoin in this way just obfuscates your argument. For exactly what reason do you think it's better to bring Litecoin vs Bitcoin to a supermarket? What assumptions are you making?
And the choice between spending LTC or BTC is a totally false dichotomy. The reality is that no one has to make a choice between those two options alone, you can easily choose to just have nothing but BTC or LTC. If you are assuming someone has both, what are you basing that assumption on?

My "rambling" was because I was just trying to clarify my viewpoint, at your request. As expected, despite your request, you weren't really interested, and probably still don't get it, so I won't bother trying again.
FYI: Not everything is "about you." If you didn't insult him, then obviously my remark was not aimed at you (I was specific). And if you're a professional designer, and this work doesn't appeal to you, maybe it's just not for you. Seems pretty arrogant of you to take the position that you get to dictate whether or not it's for others.

If it makes you feel any better, some of us watched our investment go slowly and painfully down, not 2% or 20%, but 80-90%, and it took almost a year and a half before we were in the green again. Most of us that stuck around through all of that did it because we were betting on other people to see the value that we see - not as a speculative instrument but as a tool for freedom. For the same reason, I've never moved any back into fiat. It's all or nothing, and even if it ends up being nothing, I still feel like it was worth a shot.

Ignore the trolls, most of them do not even believe what they are saying, they just want a reaction. I understand your heart is in the right place.

But if you're the first tipper, I wouldn't bother doing something like this unless you're willing to throw in at least a couple dollars worth. Just my opinion.

If you believe in Bitcoin's future and are holding, that's a reason to discount the use all by itself. Increased adoption translates directly to increased value. If you are worried about volatility, let Bitpay take 100% of that risk and discount the fees you'd be paying to a credit card company.

You're not tipping someone for service, so the waitress comparison doesn't really fit. 
I think the biggest consideration, considering the way changeTip works, is whether the person has ever been tipped before. If you tip me a penny for something, it requires zero effort on my part once the account is already linked to reddit. 
Tipping outside the subreddit to someone who is totally new though, whatever you think makes it worth their while to go through that process for the first time (not knowing ahead of time how easy it is.)
@_date: 2014-11-08 18:38:04
**If you're actually interested, as you claim:**
 
You're a member of so it's reasonable to expect you're using Bitcoin (regardless of how much you post.) Jeff (to my knowledge) has never been compensated by the foundation (they currently pay 3 people, and that's a new thing.) Even if he was, that money was donated by people - are you one of them? He has spent a lot of time and effort that you get the benefit of for free. No one forced him to do this, so you're not obligated to him. Just like he is not forcing anyone to participate in his "contest" as you call it. 
I get the impression you guys really like to crusade on this topic and took any opportunity to jump on it. He wasn't actually asking for that much, and my hope would be that people who are a little more grateful than yourself would be happy to help him out a little in return, if they are in the position to do so. The "bounty" can be considered a nice bonus, not wages. 
AGAIN, I am NOT arguing that you have any obligation. But the least you could do is be a little goddamn respectful and not insult one of the guys who has brought us to where we are today when he needs a little help. Help, I might add, to make reddit a better place for everyone. 
One more thing: I didn't call anyone an idiot for "disagreeing with design contests." I used the word idiot very specifically to refer to people who called Jeff "cheap." I think that's pretty fair considering the circumstances.

I would never try to time the market. You should make your determination based on whether you want to support this system or not, and that requires that you educate yourself thoroughly.
If you're in the US, Coinbase and Circle offer the most convenient avenues (in some respects, anyway.)
Buying directly from people on Localbitcoins.com and Mycellium wallet's local trader network may suit your needs better, though, if privacy is more important to you. However, I would definitely not try and make a single 10k purchase that way.

The company doesn't offer any discounts. They just let other people sell their amazon credit. If you're wondering who would sell amazon credit for 20% off, there are apparently a lot of people on their affiliate programs worldwide who get stuck with amazon credit they can't easily spend or withdraw (eg, if you're in Canada, and your advertising results in UK residents buying, you get Amazon UK credit.) Until now a lot of advertising payments were rotting in accounts of people who couldn't easily withdraw or use it. From the market rates, it looks like it's worth about 20% to them to be able to convert it into Bitcoin.

Do you think just putting bullet points next to things makes them true, or even relevant?
* Being paid as a technical advisor does not make you responsible for a company's actions, and is not an endorsement, regardless of what people decide to do. 
* You have presented no evidence that the company is bankrupt. If they are bankrupt (certainly possible), you have presented no evidence that it was a technical problem, or in any way related to Andreas. Most likely, their problems are business/management related.
* People can cite Andreas's "involvement" as a reason for killing someone, that doesn't mean jack shit. He is not responsible for their actions. 
By the way - again, not relevant, but since you seem to be so well-informed, how much was Andreas paid to be a technical advisor? Or is this more "undeniable truth" that is actually just baseless speculation?

This exact same bullshit happened to me. A payment was put on hold over 3 months after the sale, the buyer wasn't even claiming I didn't send the item, but apparently their funding method was reversed months down the road. I called and emailed paypal and they could not have been less helpful. 
I had some amazing luck, though - although 90% of the time I had been throwing the labels out a few weeks after shipping, for that particular item I had done the packaging in the garage, and I found the old label, so I was able to enter the shipping info as "proof." (What a bullet-proof process they have there.) 
The real problem is that you have zero recourse if paypal feels like they might not get their money. A friend of mine sold an amp on ebay (very expensive shipping) and the customer tried to scam him out of a 50% discount because they said it was broken. Of course they wouldn't ship it back, and paypal ruled in my friend's favor, but because the thief reversed the payment method at the bank, paypal took his money ANYWAY.
I have since scaled back to only selling smaller items via paypal. It's just too risky for anything you can't afford to lose.

Arbitrage has plenty of risk. Besides the very significant risk of holding large amounts of funds on several different exchanges, there's risk of one side of your trade not being executed - that can be caused by someone else taking the order faster than you, but slower than the data feed, problems with the exchange API, erroneous ticker data, etc. It's very easy to get burned.

I am not here to advertise for Purse.io, I have been quite skeptical of their business model and ability to avoid fraud problems. However, it's not an impossible problem to deal with. I don't think the people are lying about the problems moving amazon credit around. What is much more implausible is that Purse.io can survive "mainly on credit card fraud."

Well, it didn't. But if you mean "was there another time that Bitcoin's price was lower exactly one year later", then yes, there was.
But hey, don't let me get in the way of your sour grapes party. Please enjoy yourself. 
Edit: I see someone is confused. Bitcoin did not lose value "across an entire year." The price went up and down significantly many times over the year. 
However, that doesn't change the fact that the longest period the price has been down versus a specific date in the past is MUCH longer than a year. Hilariously longer. I guess the people who used to try and take joy in their fantasy of other people being miserable from back then have all left (hard to mock people for buying at $3 these days) and so all we are left with is you new guys. Well, I'm sure one day you will be gone too. Maybe it will help you grow up a little.

@_date: 2014-11-06 17:40:10
That still doesn't make any sense. The only reason we have so many people interested in Bitcoin in the first place is because we've all agreed on a fixed and decentralized distribution mechanism. If you change that in the middle because you think miners are being paid for more security than necessary, you undermine the entire idea behind the project. 
Coin distribution at a slow, steady rate is clearly drawing more people than these other schemes, and it's really not "inflation" - not in the sense of price inflation, for sure, but mined coins are not "inflating" the money supply. The supply is fixed at 21m. You're just distributing it. 
It really doesn't matter if miners selling pushes the price down in the short term. You have to think about the long term. Why would you want them all to hold on to the coins? In order for us to have a large distribution they need to be selling to all the people who can't mine.  
Edit: Furthermore - you said it was a "waste" to pay this much for the current mining output. If other people agree with you the price will go down to reflect that, and the "waste" will be removed. As it goes below a certain point, the "massive security" may also be reduced by removing the least efficient miners until it hits a balance. This is a really well-balanced and elegant design, and no offense, but from your points it doesn't look like you've thought it through.
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:52:13

@_date: 2014-11-13 22:27:50
"Promotes?" :P
I was always concerned about this potential problem but purse.io has apparently done a pretty good job dealing with it.
I couldn't believe people would take a 20% hit just to buy bitcoin, until I heard some people on a podcast (sorry can't remember if it was LTB or something else) about what's really going on. There are a LOT of people out there paid in Amazon credit that they can't use. For example, if you're an affiliate advertising something that's bought by someone in the UK, you can't spend that credit earned anywhere except Amazon UK, and if you don't have a UK bank account, it might cost too much to make it worth withdrawing. However, if you can convert it to Bitcoin you have many ways to spend it - *including* buying amazon credit with Gyft that you could actually use.
If any of this is incorrect info, please correct me - I have never been paid in Amazon credit, but to my best recollection, this is how it was explained by people who are.

The awesome thing about Bitcoin is that it's never going to be too late. Even when we hit a saturation point in adoption that makes it unlikely the purchasing power will increase like it has in the past, it will still be a valuable alternative to government controlled (and inevitably destroyed) currency. It is already a great tool for financial freedom. We are nowhere near that saturation point, but we are clearly much farther than we were 2 years ago when it felt like there was a decent chance Bitcoin might actually fade away if there was a lack of interest or some severe technical problem. I no longer worry about that kind of thing.

Changetip is great stuff, fun and good for demonstrating how two people can send each other value instantly over the internet without knowing anything about each other (or trusting a 3rd party with their IDs/SSN/whatever.) 
That being said, if you want to know why the price is going up, you'd have to ask the Chinese guys who have been buying so heavily at each of these spikes. I doubt they were doing it because of Changetip.

You seem to be confused about some terminology. Blocks are orphaned when they are valid but not submitted to the majority of the network fast enough to beat other competing blocks (which must also be valid.)

No one who hasn't already used Bitcoin-otc is going to go there to sell a few dollars of Amazon credit. It's a lot of hassle for the target audience I heard described, whereas Purse.io has made it easy.
Credit card fraud is a significant problem with significant costs, but come on, impossible? People pay the costs and manage to do business with credit cards every day. In this situation, one way they could deal with it would be extending trust only to sellers with a solid history. They could be (and must be) holding Bitcoin payments for untrusted accounts long enough to make sure there was no fraud. In your case Amazon didn't even ship. The fraud was detected quickly. The scammer got nothing.
I definitely don't like the idea of someone shipping stuff to my house with a stolen credit card, either. Once it's happened I wouldn't expect you to try again. That being said, if someone has bought off your wishlist, Amazon can't hold you responsible. Otherwise, anyone pissed at you could ruin your life by shipping things you didn't order to your house. And eventually the odds of this should be pretty low if there is no actual reward for scammers. 
Can you explain what you mean by "Amazon's clever order API", and how the fraud is "Amazon's problem?"

If you're going to use a brainwallet, a great way to increase the security to hash the phrase with a memory-hard algorithm (like scrypt) before the SHA256 hashing. This site does it in javascript, as always, you should be generating brainwallets on a safe/offline machine.

We just want you have a good time...in reality the danger might be low if you're already being careful about malware etc. But control over Bitcoin is like cash, most people aren't used to this paradigm.
Blockchain.info has some good security options, and Coinbase with 2FA should be pretty safe. But if you put serious money in, I would generate a wallet offline to send to. This ensures that there is no chance it can be stolen electronically. 
There are a few options for this. I boot from an old distro of an ubuntu live CD and use a usb drive that has the bitaddress.org page saved on it. But you should watch some video tutorials to see what is easiest for you, there are a ton on youtube:

I can't speak from experience with Kraken directly, but when orders for below the minimum possible appear, they are often "change orders", ie, if you post a limit sell order for 1btc and someone places a market buy for 0.999btc there will still be .001btc of your original limit sell sitting out there.

Hey btcchin, I don't think he was trying to troll you. From what I read, Coinbase is using a 2-of-3 multi-sig scheme where you have two of the keys. That way you can keep one of the keys in a highly secure place and only retrieve it if Coinbase was unavailable. In a normal situation you'd use your other key together with Coinbase to make a transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:09:15
Sorry for your loss. Exchanges are beginning to roll out innovations like multi-sig holding addresses and proof-of-reserves to reduce the risks that using an exchange introduces.

Sometimes localbitcoins is much more convenient than trying to set up a bank account for the first time, much faster than an ACH transfer, and much cheaper than a wire transfer to an international merchant. Additionally, those options are simply unavailable to billions of people on this planet.
But regardless, no one said you "have" to use an online exchange OR localbitcoins. Average Joe can certainly choose the convenience of Circle and Coinbase. I was simply pointing out that the image of "dark alleys" is completely inaccurate. 
Edit: Also, multi-sig does *not* require 3rd party trust, please read more about it. And proof-of-reserve is not done by the customer, it's posted by the exchange.

That wouldn't require any fabrication, just omission, which we have confirmation of already. He made it clear that she heard what she wanted to hear, and he didn't understand what she was asking him about. 
Don't take this as an attack, I'm just trying to explain how crazy this sounds to me. She is saying that the mastermind behind Bitcoin was incredibly careful not to reveal personal details about himself, but uses his real name. When some reporter harasses him, he makes a vague dismissal that is supposed to be a confession? And then he goes to another reporter and explains that she misunderstood him, but apparently this is part of his long game? This sounds absurd to me.

I can go to Whole Foods, buy a gift card using Bitcoin 5 seconds before I have to pay from Gyft, and be done. When Whole Foods wants to stop losing that giftcard margin they are currently giving Gyft, they can easily do exactly the same thing. There is plenty of theoretical debate about 0-confirmation transactions and the relative security of Bitcoin vs Litecoin confirmtions but the cold hard fact is that they are being done, at the supermarket, by some of us right now, with zero problems.
Just to clarify, at no point have I really taken a stance -against- Litecoin. I see no value in it for myself, but I don't feel any need to argue against it. I was commenting about the argument this guy was making in his article, and now I've ended up in a debate I don't really want. If you like Litecoin and see value in it, by all means, invest, use it, etc. Everyone should use and support whatever they like.

Changetip doesn't use a separate address for every tip that gets moved around. The other $20 was in one of the addresses they are using to hold everyone's tips together. Basically, they are holding all the pooled funds and keeping track until someone wants to withdraw. This is called "offchain" activity as it is not actually happening on the Bitcoin network.
A little trivia - the original BitcoinTip bot actually did use a separate addresses and on-chain transactions. This was using a lot of Bitcoin for network fees, but at the time the price was much lower. Now it's 100 times higher, it makes a lot more fiscal sense to do micro-transactions offchain, for the time being anyway.

I have no idea what you're trying to say here. "coin-distribution like bitcoin" - the mining rewards **are** the coin distribution. With 0% "inflation" (very poor choice of terms, IMO, since it's not inflation in the traditional sense) you have 0% distribution. What would that accomplish?

Awesome! Hopefully you have fun. There are tens of thousands of different places to use Bitcoin, but some things I would try:
1) Buy something in person from the bookstore that's reportedly accepting BTC on campus
2) Buy a giftcard via the Gyft app. 
3) Buy something from newegg.com
4) check out the list of online sellers that accept/hold bitcoin for their homemade products like WhollyHemp or BeesBrothers.
5) Open a changetip account and give someone you know 5$ through the interwebs.
6) Donate a few bucks to your favorite internet cause - like Mozilla, wikipedia, the EFF, or FEE.
Those different purchasing/gifting avenues should give you some insight into how easy (or hard) it is to spend bitcoin...you may hit some snags but it should be fun. Congrats on the free dough!

I think it was Stephanie Murphy on one of the many podcasts she's been on (sorry, not sure if it was LTB or not) that discussed at length how people who are paid for advertising credit get paid in the country where the purchase was made. So if you are advertising Amazon links from China but the purchase is made in the UK, you get AmazonUK credit, which may be difficult/costly for you to withdraw. For these people it makes a lot of sense, and advertising could easily explain all the Bitcoin bought on purse.io.

So I don't know what he's expecting. It's like the situation as Peter Schiff: he trashes Bitcoin and then accepts it on his site as way for you to exit Bitcoin via someone who doesn't even want it. And then he's like "Yeah, see, no one is using this shit, our customers want to use dollars." No kidding Peter, any of your potential customers are going to use Amagi metals or someone else who doesn't constantly bash Bitcoin. It just means you're terrible at selling gold for Bitcoin, not that no one is using Bitcoin.

I haven't personally used Circle, but many of the new Bitcoin people I know who've tried both them and Coinbase are thrilled with Circle. Super easy to use, can buy with a credit card, and no "sorry we canceled your buy" emails. People happy about that aren't shills.
I'm not bashing Coinbase either, they're doing an incredible job on many fronts and they were the first place to let people hook up a checking account and buy. They probably need more staff to help with reviewing the auto-canceled buys - I'm fairly sure they aren't canceling buys just screw people over, but I know that must feel infuriating when it happens to you.

It bugs me too, but I can understand the frustration, especially since it happens on fully verified accounts that have been making regular modest purchases, and out of the blue one gets flagged when it's indistinguishable from the rest. It's happened to family members, so I know the public complaints are likely true. 
Most of the people I know were able to get them to review their case and honor the purchases, as recently as last week.
But this is why I'm glad Circle is around - competition means Coinbase will have to step up their game and do a better job or lose customers. Maybe they would be better off separating the merchant services and wallet sides of their company.

"Hoarding" is saving. Saving is good.
To answer your question, yes. There is even a coin with built in demurrage (Freicoin) as dskloet just mentioned. With the exception of a little daytrading action no one bought it and the volume and price are now basically nothing. It demonstrates pretty clearly the flaw in the assumption that you need to discourage savings - no one wants to buy and hold your coin. They didn't have a government with guns to force anyone to use it, and so no one did.
Furthermore, we have pretty good evidence that "deflation" economics are nonsense from Bitcoin use alone. The Bitcoin payment processors have said many times that their volume goes UP when the price is rising and goes down when the price is dropping.

Thanks for posting, so I don't have to repeat this for 100th time. I was watching China grow all year from basically 1 exchange to 16+, volume getting to be a larger and larger part of the market. Yes, some of the exchanges were "0 fee" - that's how competition usually goes in China, they are all battling for market share to last the longest. But even if some of that volume wouldn't have existed on the exchanges with fees, it was that volume that was moving the price. It was abundantly clear from watching their charts. Their prices moved first, fastest and highest (over $1400 at the peak IIRC.) China was clearly the reason for the move above $1000 and it was also the reason for the price to come down to current price levels.

You've been around for a while ferret, so I'm surprised to hear you say that. 100% of the early adopters I have known since 2011 still have almost all of their holdings. I can't speak for all of them, but a lot of them agree with me that it's the best thing to use to save money, regardless of whether the future holds us steady against the devaluation of the dollar at the current adoption rate or we have another 10000% increase the userbase in store.

Wrong, scammer. First of all, you used MY picture, which I own the copyright on. Second, I designed this logo. There is no public domain bitcoin logo that appears on this shirt. There are similar looking ones, sure, but this one is my design.

I don't need to file any paperwork to own the copyright to my designs. I have posted proof at the earliest date, which would make a court case very easy to win. Thanks for displaying your ignorance of copyright law. 
If you want to sell shirts, more power to you. I created this because I wanted to wear a Bitcoin shirt, not start a shirt company, and there was nothing out there. Just make an original shirt, not a ripoff of mine.

This is a somewhat risky proposition depending on your relationship with the people. I did the same thing for a friend of mine I knew would not take it the wrong way, and it worked out very well. One thing I made sure to put in the instructions was a link to Gyft, and a list of some of the places they could use it to buy gift credit at. I also made sure to mention that although I think the bitcoin price is going up in the long term, the price is volatile, and that if they wanted to buy a giftcard (as intended), to do it as soon as it was convenient to do so. I also gave them more than I normally would have in case the price dipped some. 
I made sure to couch it as a way to give them a lot of options for buying Gyft credit, which I personally think is a great wedding gift. Wedding gifts are mostly boring (but practical) and giving money and gift cards is totally fine. You just have to know the people well enough to make sure they won't get frustrated with the extra steps involved. Make sure the instructions are clear and simple. I would leave out all the other stuff about accepting music donations. They will see the value in that after they see that it's easy to transfer and accept.

Calling it "Gavincoin" is extremely disingenuous. The change Gavin is proposing, in general, was outlined by Satoshi as a given milestone in the future. So "non-crippled Bitcoin" or "non-training-wheel Bitcoin" would be more honest.

Plenty of prices are over double what they were in 2000. A few I've noticed are some common groceries I've bought since then, like milk, ground beef, etc. And there's some other less common things I've bought regularly and kept track of prices for that are between 200-300% of the ~2000 price. The only things that haven't gotten significantly more expensive are things that have become cheaper to produce. 
That being said, there are definitely some prices that haven't been fully hit by the current level of dollar devaluation yet. Devaluation never causes price inflation instantly, there's always some lag time. Eventually though, those chickens come home to roost.
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:28:25

There's no point in doing this. 
As Bitcoin users we can already spend btc on Amazon gift cards via Gyft. Using Gyft guarantees we are dealing with someone with experience in the bitcoin space and one dedicated to excellent customer service. AND we get reward points in the process. 
Unlike Overstock (and Gyft, btw) Amazon would not keep any % of the payment in Bitcoin. Maybe one day they'll see the light and embrace Bitcoin fully like Overstock, but it wouldn't happen because of people "pestering" them. So there's no benefit to us as customers. 
So it wouldn't help us spend. It wouldn't get us the reward points like Gyft. The customer service experience wouldn't be as good. The only remaining upside might be name recognition of another large company. But honestly at this stage of the game, I don't really care about that. We've got Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Expedia, Dish. Adding another merchant to the list isn't going to make as big of a difference as adding more actual users. So I'd say a much better use of your time would be talking to friends who would support the things Bitcoin makes possible.

Either that or incredibly ignorant. You can't get blood from a rock. While the exchange was operating, he was giving 100% of fees to the people owed BTC by the exchange. (About double that, actually.) If people take legal action to force him into liquidation, they a) get nothing, because the company's holdings are basically 0, and b) guarantee no one else gets paid back, because no more fees are being generated.
It would have been a very shitty thing to do.

Holding coins is an investment and endorsement of the system. You've put your value into it. 
The people I've known the longest have a certain % of their income/savings they've put into Bitcoin and they have bought at regular intervals all the way up to the current price. They spend it on occasion and buy more. Not one of them is waiting for a certain price to cash out.

The smartest thing you can do atm is to take whatever money you are thinking about spending on mining hardware and spend it on BTC.
The hardware available right now is extremely unlikely to ever break even vs buying BTC, and the pre-order hardware is a huge gamble.

How about retroactively changing your TOS? How about telling people once a transaction has gone from "pending" to "credited" that it cannot and will not be reversed, and then reversing and eventually deleting the transaction?

Don't buy from any company that hasn't shown proof of a working product. You probably won't make your money back vs buying coins outright, however, if you do buy coins outright, putting a small amount of $ into an ASIC miner will help distribute the mining power in the network and secure your other investment.

Bitcoin itself is a protocol that incorporates decentralization. It doesn't demand it. Not everyone will have the same goals/needs, and payment processors with online wallets serve a very important purpose. Once you have significant holdings to risk, I agree, it's better to manage your own keys. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using Coinbase/Bitpay to make your sales experience smoother.

OK, you may have misunderstood me. I didn't say everyone on Earth accepted Bitcoin. I said everything that I personally want to buy with Bitcoin, I can, either directly from people who want it, businesses that keep it (Bitcoinstore) , or via middlemen who sell it back to the market.
This includes electronics, but also anything on Amazon, hundreds of retail chains, anything on ebay or anywhere else with an online checkout ( 
There are even several houses in the area I want to move for sale (directly) for BTC and many more for rent. The specific make/model of car I'd like to eventually buy is available directly for BTC, and beyond that, I already know some salesmen that have said they will work with a payment processor if I ever wanted to splurge and buy a car in cash (I don't really.)
I can grocery shop at Target and Wholefoods. I can use Fandango to go to the movies. I can pay the local farmer I buy from directly.
Really all that's left is utilities and taxes. And I don't want to give the utility companies or the government Bitcoin. So this doesn't distress me.

BTCChina's CNY volume may not have passed MtGox's total volume, but the total CNY volume is probably more important. It has been above 50% of the market for most of the last month, even excluding BTC100 volume on the days when BTC100 had crazy spikes due to their rebate program. CNY exchange prices have also lead the market price movements for the last 2 days, and passed Bitstamp by a significant margin. (Currently 130.xx vs 126.xx)
This is very atypical - historically they follow large MtGox moves and settle at or below Bitstamp average prices. They may be making their own way now.

We're into the land of hypotheticals, so I'd avoid making absolute statements. If Bitcoin became banned in one country it could very well make it much more valuable world-wide.

Transactions that are never confirmed will drop out of the memory pool eventually. It wouldn't be reversing them. However, I agree, we don't want it to be easy to cancel a pending payment...this would slow down small POS transactions, which can currently take unconfirmed transactions fairly safely. The easiest thing to do would be retroactively adding to the fee.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:08:44
Surprised that he said the confirmations were "faster" and that that was an advantage. 4x "faster" confirmations = 1/4the security given the same network power. Exchanges can accept Bitcoin with less confirmations and still be much more certain that they will not be the victim of double-spending.
This is basic stuff, guys.

Not true. I've bought them as a currency AND as in investment. Using them as a currency helps my investment. There's many reasons for merchants to accept them - by using Bitpay they are at no risk, pay less fees, and have 0 chance of chargebacks.

Not true. I've been watching the ticker for 2 years straight now, all day, every day, while I am slowing killing myself in an attempt to finish my thesis. I have extra monitors that do nothing but display trades on MtGox and other exchanges. This is not an unusual amount of traffic, and I've seen worse. 
Of course, it's ridiculous to even debate, because as I said, four other exchanges were knocked offline without any real increase in trading, during the same time. Please don't try and tell me that was a coincidence.

Stable price (which we don't currently have) means adoption stagnation. I've used it many times as a currency without this so-called "necessity." The price will settle down when adoption has hit a saturation point. If it looks stable until then, either it's an indication of some kind of bottleneck, or we are losing people as fast as we are gaining them...not a good sign. As I'm fairly confident we are nowhere near to any type of saturation point, so, "boring" prices are not what I want to see.

Well, you're completely wrong, but I doubt I will be able to convince you. Luckily I don't have to. Thanks to an app called BridgeWalker (bridgewalkerapp.com) you can use Bitcoin while holding dollars. That's right, you're **totally insulated** from volatility. You deposit bitcoins and your account is credited in USD. That amount of USD is available for withdrawal in BTC. 
So, POOF! All of the volatility problems are now GONE. Just use this helpful tool. But here's the thing - I think no one will. Because I have a feeling most of the complaints are coming from people who are just looking for whatever problems they can find, and have no intentions of using Bitcoin regardless. The rest of us believe that Bitcoin is an extremely valuable technology and want to invest in it long-term as well as spend it short-term.

It adds up. I've saved about 20% on my purchases from BitcoinStore. And chargebacks aren't necessary if you're dealing with any company that wants to stay in business. I have resolved many problems without ever needing a chargeback system. Regardless, this is not a counterpoint to the fact that prices will be lower. That's a benefit for consumers, period.
Not all purchases require a shipping address. Like a VPN subscription, for example. Or a donation to wikileaks. So no, not moot.
That's great for you, doesn't change the fact that using Bitcoin avoids the risk of having your CC information stolen.

The underlying value of Bitcoin is the ability for people to come to a secure, global consensus without trust. It's not just "a possible future as a global currency." It's very useful as money because of the guarantees the network provides us.

I have a hard time seeing a better option for chain-store integration. Obviously I would prefer that any place I spent BTC would hold/spend them, not cash out.

Using their existing giftcard infrastructure is the simplest solution at the moment.

The core of bitcoin is a distributed (p2p) ledger. Think of it like a p2p vault of safety deposit boxes. All you need to access your box is a private key and software which can interact with the ledger. 
The default client provides both a keyring and a copy of the ledger, with software to access it.
So you can use someone else's software, like the browser based client hosted via blockchain.info, keep track of your own private key (keep it encrypted on a USB key, perhaps) and access the distributed ledger completely outside of your own computer, yes.

If feasible, maybe consider setting up another company to sell off your incoming BTC directly, the way FastCash4BTC does.

This shows how hard it is to compete with Amazon. However, there are a -lot- of items that are cheaper than Amazon. I could list some, but it's beside the point - if what you want to buy is cheaper on Amazon and you don't think that the success of this venture benefits you, then don't buy. 
My purchases were significantly cheaper on BitcoinStore, but even if they had been a little more, I would have supported them, because I've invested in Bitcoin and having this store is a big deal right now. When people say "you can't buy anything except drugs with it!" I can say, "you can buy at least 500,000 things other than drugs with it...check out BitcoinStore.com."

It's actually significantly lower than this. I've been watching the Chinese markets for the last week here:
Although BTCChina is by far the largest and oldest, because there are so many other Chinese exchanges, it usually represents less than half of the total Chinese volume, sometimes as little as 20%. There were several days when MtGox was reported as close to 50% of the market when it was in reality closer to 35%.
So, MtGox. Your position as the price-setting market giant is quickly crumbling. Are you finally going to listen to your customers about your horrible customer service and unacceptable practices? A powerful new trading engine is going to be useless without anyone to left to trade on it.

It's not ok. Dwolla has defrauded several companies out of 100k+ and tried to cover it up. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw their collective Bitcoin hating asses, definitely not with my SSN. 
Dwolla also has random and seemingly arbitrary delays of days to weeks. 
The fastest thing you can do is use a wire transfer. Another option would be signing up for a CapitalOne360 (formery ING direct) checking account (free and also 25-50$ signup bonus.) This allows you to send directly to Bitfloor and Campbx and avoid the wire fees. It has a 2-3 day delay (faster side of ACH.) Finally, if you are near a Bank of America you can do a cash deposit through LocalTill to Bitfloor. They charge a fee that's hard to nail down...people have reported anywhere from 1-4%. However, it's fast and anonymous. And if 4% fees don't bother you don't forget about Bitinstant.com - you can directly buy through them and deposit cash at any walmart or CVS.

Well, this is the first "official" month of sales, prior to this it was a limited beta. And they didn't set the target, the distributor did.

The blockchain actually has several non-currency uses that have been demonstrated however, that's kind of beside the point. 
Value as a currency isn't arbitrary, and Bitcoin isn't "meaningless numbers." The numbers you're referring to are what guarantees that it's **scarce, fungible, well protected from counterfeiting&amp; double spending, and can't be taken by force or shutdown by an oppressive authority.**
You say "other than currency" as if these things aren't valuable. These things -are- what gives it intrinsic value. They are the reason oak leaves would fail miserable as a currency, while Bitcoin is getting more and more valuable.

There is currently 0% profit on purchases. You're getting them at the wholesale price for this distributor. 
If you hold BTC, supporting this store does benefit all of us.

They went from having 90% of the CNY volume 3 months ago to having 10% today. They are only the 3rd largest CNY exchange now, competition is stiff. 
It would be nice if more of our chart sites would acknowledge that there are 11 CNY exchanges and CNY volume is normally higher than MtGox, occasionally over 50% of the market.

Demand for ASIC hardware is astronomically higher than the supply. Couple that with the fact that the  supplier right now (ASICMINER) is not selling half their supply for any amount of $ - they are selling shares and controlling the hardware themselves. As such, gaining 51% network power through them is not going to happen.
Overall, it is not practically possible to obtain hardware from any vendor as the author is suggesting. There are already far more than 1.2M in existing preorders...at the very least you'll be in line behind them. By the time they ship your 1.2M worth of hardware the network power will be several orders of magnitude higher.
Remember that these hardware manufacturers are people who are also invested in BTC. All of them have taken steps to make sure an attack with their hardware is not feasible.

I can understand why you'd think that if you don't yet understand what motivated people who bought in years ago. But regardless, you're flat out wrong about this.
Edit: Peter Schiff did the same thing yesterday talking to Erik. He's sitting there making (totally incorrect) assumptions about the mental processes of early Bitcoin adopters and then telling Erik "Well I think blah blah blah" - when if he really wanted to know what they were thinking he would just ASK the guy he had on the phone. 
I guess you view Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme or even a get-rich-slow scheme. To "true believers", it's not. Anyone who would have cashed out for a massive profit already did so, the first time it went up 10x (to 5 cents) or 1000x (to 5 dollars.) People who have held through 100000% gains don't have a magic number in their head to suddenly ditch out of the system. They want this system to become the status quo.
Also, you have no idea if someone who owns one of those 10,000btc addresses has spent or sold btc. They may (and probably do) own thousands of other addresses which had moving balances.

I would try using Bitfloor. Sign up for a CapitalOne360 (formerly ING Direct) checking account and you directly transfer to Bitfloor with 0 fee. You can also use LocalTill via Bank Of America to deposit cash to Bitfloor if one is near you, but that has a fee. This is the easiest route for US customers at the moment, from what I can see. Coinbase is great but they are overwhelmed with customers right now.

I don't think denomination has really changed this phenomenon. People who aren't idealists always use this logic to justify not buying, whether the price is at an all time high and they "missed out" or has gone down 20% and they claim Bitcoin is dead.

It's never too late, but we are still early adopters if that's what you mean. Bitcoin has barely scratched the surface of the total possible adoption.
The current price of those USB miners is unfortunately higher than the amount of bitcoin they will ever create (vs the amount you could buy directly at today's prices with the same amount of USD.) IE, they will never break even against a direct investment. The best return for your money is to buy BTC directly and wait for the ASIC market to calm down before trying to get in on that game.

Definitely a valid concern, however, if I may make a small addendum: In the future, we may choose to trust services like Coinbase with (small amounts at least) of BTC that they control, so that they can perform internal transactions between customers without adding them all to the blockchain. This way we can avoid unnecessary bloat and transaction fees on microtransactions - exactly the way the tip bot works, I think?

A "bubble" is an asset with a price not supported by underlying value, instead, the price has been artificially inflated by some kind of shenanigans (like giving credit to people who are high risk.)
When you see people calling Bitcoin prices a bubble, it means they don't understand the process of bootstrapping a currency and the true value of Bitcoin. Or maybe they're bitter because they think they missed out (not yet, guys) and want to discredit a rise in price. In any case, volatility during a long-term price rise doesn't equal "bubble."

MtGox never froze trading. They just got overwhelmed with buy and sell orders, and things got laggy. The trading never stopped at any point. Personally, I think it's ridiculous that they haven't upgraded their servers at this stage, but if what you were suggesting was true, we wouldn't be at $46.

Tough shit. We can't start at the adoption saturation point and rise in adoption is going to cause volatility as the price has to be constantly rediscovered.

Yes, but do you understand what that "design" change was? All they did change the difficulty adjustment so that it would target 4 blocks every ten minutes instead of 1. That means, all other things being equal, you need 24 blocks processed to have the same assurance you are safe from a double spend instead of 6. 
Of course, all other things are not equal. Bitcoin's network power dwarfs all altcoins combined. So I'm much more confident in 1 confirmation on Bitcoin than 100 on the altcoin of the week.

Sorry for any confusion -  Bitfloor doesn't charge any fees for using ACH or cash deposits. Whatever accepting ACH costs him, he pays out of pocket. ING p2p transfers are free and effectively allows you to ACH to any outside account for free as well. However, LocalTill charges a fee for accepting the cash deposit and sending it to Bitfloor...so the fee comes from them. Not from Bitfloor.

Bitcoin is a protocol. It doesn't do "right or wrong." I didn't imply otherwise.
And you've admitted that you arbitrarily misinterpreted a statement in order to argue about it, instead of just asking for clarification. So, yes, it was pretty needless. You've done it again by implying that I equated the total Bitcoin transaction volume with the total amount of goods sold for Bitcoin. I didn't. I just pointed out that the total amount of goods sold for Bitcoin is greater than the total amount of sales reported by Bitpay, another statement that's easily provable.

OK, I'm just confused by the previous comment and your reply. Do you feel like the fact your article led to the grocery store accepting Bitcoin somehow makes their decision less meaningful? To me, it shows how easy and low-risk it is for a merchant to accept Bitcoin. All they needed was a little interest from one party. 
Brick and mortar is actually the last place I expect to see Bitcoin accepted. It's the least advantageous space at the moment. Bitcoin is digital cash, and anywhere that accepts actual cash in person doesn't really "need" it as much as places like Amazon.
That being said, it still does have advantages, and once people find out about it, it's not surprising they would jump on board.

@_date: 2013-10-04 21:08:52
Yes. They had books, food, art, clothing. Obviously not the majority of trades, but having funds there was not proof you were going to do anything illegal. Some people had funds there just to use the tumbler. Some people lived in countries where having some goddamn plant matter isn't illegal. But of course they laugh at the idea they would give back seized funds. Ugh.

You misinterpreted it in order to argue with me for something I didn't actually say. I am the authority on what I said, and you were incorrect. Not sure why you are still contradicting me after I made this clear. Just because you wanted it to represent something that it didn't, doesn't make it so, and definitely doesn't make your argument constructive.
What bothers me a lot more than this so called "group-think" are the people who are constantly railing against it, to no real end. We're individuals and we have individual beliefs. You can perhaps persuade an individual, but incorrectly trying to warp someone's statement into something more convenient just so you can get on a soapbox is utterly pointless. As I think this thread has demonstrated. (Sorry if that sounds harsh.) Peace.

Best is a subjective term - you need to qualify it with what your needs and wants are.
I can answer given my opinions on the wallets out there:
Best full node power user desktop wallet - Armory wallet. 
For desktop users who also want to contribute to the network by relaying transactions and validating work. 
Otherwise you may want to check out multibit or electrum for a pure desktop wallet that doesn't require a full blockchain download.
Best "online" wallet - Blockchain.info. This assumes you want to access your wallet from a webbrowser and are willing to deal with the risks that go along with that. Because Blockchain is not an "online" wallet in the sense that you have to trust someone to hold and manage your keys (it is client-side JS and holds your keys in an encrypted form only) you get a lot of the flexibility of having a traditional hosted wallet without so much trust. There are some risks of vulnerabilities and security you can limit by using 2FA and double encryption, etc. Blockchain has a ton of options and you should make sure you educate yourself on all of them. They also have an excellent Android client.
Coinbase is the best online wallet for people not yet ready to take on the responsibilty of key management, but the flip side of that is that you have to trust them with your Bitcoin. I would plan to migrate most of your funds out of Coinbase as soon as you understand how to secure them properly. Coinbase makes it very easy to buy bitcoin via ACH transfer from your checking account - this is a good reason for most people to start here. Of course, this also potentially exposes your identity in case someone confiscates Coinbase's customer records. 
Another advantage to keeping a balance on Coinbase is that you can instantly transfer it to other Coinbase users in an "offchain" transaction. Coinbase makes it easy to sign up other people and can be tied to Gli.ph accounts so that you can literally instant message one of your friends with Bitcoin attached.
Hope that helps, all absolute sounding statements are my opinion only.

Thanks for admitting your only argument was semantics.
When Bitcoin has been around for as long as Visa it will make sense to compare transaction volumes. Doing it at this early stage is asinine. 
Of course, "plenty of people" is not relative to another well-established, market-saturated payment system's volume. It's relative to the amount of customers needed to do business. 
By pretending that the amount of business referenced in this article is not significant (in any way I may have meant it) you've given yourself away. I'm sorry you want Bitcoin to be a failure, for whatever reason, but it's growing more successful every day, with or without you.

I talked to several of the companies (I was a volume customer.) Tradehill is currently suing them for removing credited amounts - not just reversing them and taking the money back but actually erasing them from already issued account statements. Straight up fraud. They did this to several other exchanges too, before they were caught. They stalled, lied about it, then tried to cover their asses by removing the statements about "no chargebacks" from their website and "retroactively" updating their TOS. They are scum.
Just to clarify, I doubt you as a customer would be in any danger. I just refuse to support Dwolla for 1) being thieves,  and 2)  openly mocking Bitcoin, even though without Bitcoin they never would have gotten off the ground.

@_date: 2013-03-09 20:52:41
Not true. Many people who wanted out got out, just not at the price they wanted, because the trading engine was lagged. More people wanted in, which kept things laggy. I know this is true, because the less lag there was, the more the price recovered. I watched the trades in real time - at no time was trading "frozen." Add to this the fact that the price did -not- plummet on other exchanges - yes it dipped a little as MtGox's trading restabilized, but if overall market sentiment was to sell, the other exchanges would have shown much lower prices than Gox - instead they showed much higher prices. If anything, the lagginess stopped people from getting IN fast enough to slow the price drop.

It's going to be very very difficult to get enough time with Ron Paul to explain Bitcoin. He has been pretty clear that he has a vague understanding and supports private competing currencies, but not enough to endorse it. We are all pretty sure that he would based on his prior statements and his tireless fight for freedom, but someone's going to have to sit down with him and explain everything - good luck. 
The best thing I think everyone can do is offer to pay for a subscription to his new site in Bitcoin. If enough offers come in, that may get someone over there's attention to do a proper investigation. Other than that, we will just have to hope he takes more notice as adoption reaches higher and higher levels.

Coinbase is doing their best to scale up, as are all the BTC sellers/exchanges, but demand is insane right now. If you are worried about the price going up more, you should use an avenue that lets you buy instantly. Coinbase used to allow this, but last I heard it wasn't really available. 
Bitinstant.com allows cash deposit at Walmart/CVS and will directly sell to you. 
Bitfloor.com allows cash deposit via LocalTill at Bank of America and will immediately credit your account so that you can trade on their exchange.

Because you can't "stabilize" the value until we've hit a saturation point. Also, it doesn't matter if the value is "stable" to anyone who sees the big picture because we know it's going to be much higher in the long run.

Um, no. They still have more trading than all other exchanges combined. They're not "dead."
Their bank limited the *number* of withdrawals, they didn't stop them. This actually just creates a secondary market for pulling money off mtgox in large amounts. It will be filled.

I am in the exact same boat. I have switched to BitcoinStore.com, and will happily switch back to Newegg (I know that was half the goal of BitcoinStore to begin with) if they start accepting Bitcoin.
Besides getting support from our community, the number 1 selling point should be the fact you're completely eliminating chargebacks (via BTC payment). Any merchant should jump at that. The fee savings are cool, too, but I think merchants should pass those savings to customers to encourage BTC spending.
