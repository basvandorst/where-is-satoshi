I wouldn't be surprised if the government attempted to undermine bitcoin to maintain control over the masses...   I think we should inspect how the gov could attack and what could be done to hold btc together or thwart them.

bitcoin is like gold,  that can be sent online, that is better then gold for trading because It can be split as many times as you need it and its still just as easy to use.
its value comes from the fact that other people want it and will accept it as money, its useful, people paid good "money" for it thus giving it more value,  and its a independent uncontrolled backup store of value in case the usd goes into crisis.
how can something not real and made up be valuable like gold?  while it is real, but its just a digital number... and it can be valuable people just like gold people see it as valuable

you know, I felt the same way for awhile... then I realized, this isn't some tycoon video game I played... its real life, and things tend to take awhile to get going.
something like bitcoin, I'm not surprised people are approaching this on the cautious side... I am also not surprised the market cap is somewhat stagnate (or "stable")... bitcoin seems to be in a recovery period from all the hits it took, such as mt gox going dark.
things like this are often cyclic to begin with, are you really surprised it is taking time for the market cap to rise?... in my view all this is expected.

*Then why not just buy stuff with existing currency?*
For example I have freelance writers who write articles with me... why pay them in btc over cash?   because its soooo much more easy that way.... and no need for all these "systems" and fees that websites often need to make it happen....   With bitcoin its easy to ask around in a public message if any one wants to do some writing for btc (people see this as money or at least a medium of value for exchange, often aka money).. sending them btc is a snap.  fee?  .06 cents... average fee per deal on many websites is like 5 bucks just for 1 party, not including the writers fees.
buying things and putting money into accounts is so much more convenient with bitcoin.. I tried to buy a video game online due to all the summer sales?  blocked... between the company's systems and the banks getting a small 20 usd transction right is just too hard for ourt outdated system.
want to put money on your trading account online to buy some hot stock at a good price?   wait 3 days at least or hope your broker fronts you the cash.
look at buying bitcoin on coinbase... takes days for the money to come in via wire.
paypal?   days for the money to transfer to paypal... days for it to transfer from paypal to your friends bank.
doing transactionsin Bitcoin is not just a novelty.. it may very well be a main currency of the future, or set the tone for systems we need to adopt  
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:30:20
your interpretation makes no sense and is invalid.
stop comparing stocks and currency as if they are the same thing..  they are different.
stocks and company's valuation's give us an idea of how much a new currency such as bitcoin can or will be worth.  its not rocket science dude, its childishly simple... if a large scale company has 250 billion in market cap.. this can be used to project the value of bitcoin during wide spread usage.  a child could look at it and see that.
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:20:15
blah.. will you stop acting pathetic please?
allow me to copy and paste.... 
Your observation:   your use of the word "incressesly", inability to use correct versions of "your", terrible apostrophe use, and rambling incoherent sentence structure lead me to believe 
Your reasoning:   lead me to believe you might be a bad judge of market valuations. 
so... you think...  bad spelling = bad market valuations.
despite the fact....that... that.... that... your talking to a person with a fantastic track record at valuations.
im sorry sir.. but I no longer believe there is a point In debating with you.
I do not feel you have the intelligence needed to have a fulfilling debate, that may lead to any type of consensus.
what can you do with a person who logic goes something like....
"that guy cant snow board without falling down?  well then.. im never hiring Him to pilot my submarine! "
you don't even bother to try to make sense, or you just cant... so I wont bother paying any more attention to you.
(also your just so pathetic its hard to stand you.. its like you try to be)

what are you going on about man?  (pretends to not know what your talking about, as to not give your comment any respect)
No.. the total economy money supply is a tad larger then I realized... since I assume bitcoin ha a strong chance at becoming a major player currency, and seeing there is more money out there then previously expected.. id assume we would need more bitcoin to use in trade... so I assume bitcoin will rise in value further them may have been expected... thus id like to have some more.

Well gold would suck as an investment... no good for being a currency in a big world ... of course they don't want to invest in it. .. bitcoin has much different property however.
Who cares what company I use as an example?... just look how much money is flowing through them... look how much investment they have... look how much they are worth.. what they are doing to have that worth.... look at there marke cap.... now think about how much more bitcoins market cap will be worth then that, if its adopted as a world currency's, considering its aspects.. that's what I am pointing out as a comparison.

did gold suffer from those issues such as ever changing prices compared to other currency's ? one day this much money gets you this much gold,  next day its different.
isn't it like that with many currency's to date?
do we want it to be pegged to the dollar?
im less concerned about the technical limitations due to its flexibility of use and concept, it seems like the big issues people bring up are all solvable.
perhaps another altcoin will rise up.. or perhaps simply become a visa to a mastercard.

your view on spelling leads to think your not all that smart.  (people who care about spelling.... *looks at you*)
and of course a privet company has great relevance in a valuation of a currency, because that is one of the many things that will TELL us how much value bitcoin will have.. its childishly simple... we only need to look at one large company to tell us how much bitcoin may be worth.. im sorry if you lack the ability to realize that.. my niece could likely get it.

i spend btc all the time... i just keep a reverse of it when the price to usd dips low i restock for if it goes up.
you hold on to your btc and never spend it.. eventually the price may go up but it will crash just as fast and u likely would miss out.
i spend btc knowing ill just have more of it.... not worried about the price swings as it averages out often times....  the price goes up , down, up... but i spend it any ways knowing that it tends to average out and in the long run btc will rise
you may not buy pizza with btc... knowing it will rise.. but again that is wrong... if everyone did that there would be no demand it ill not rise.
plenty of people do business with bitcoin and that's why its gained value... hang on to your btc... and watch as your investment rises more slowly... or use some extra usd to get more btc, or do some work for btc, that is not priced in usd... then you wont care.
you keep getting stuck in this "i live in one country mode"
you completely fail to take into account the way the money in the world works,  and only look at it from your micro envirment .. a fallacy and why everyone keeps pointing out it seems you don't know what your going on about.

We compare the market cap of bitcoin to both that of company's, and that of other currency's , to get an idea of what to expect with the valuation of bitcoin.
by looking at the market cap of company's, as well as how other currency's work , it gives us an idea of how bitcoin will work and the potential value it has.
amateur?  perhaps I am.. but I am correct when I say that observing and comparing a company such as Berkshire Hathaway, McDonalds, or any other big chip stock and company... can give us great insight on the value of bitcoin..... 
McDonalds is a chain of food places, think about everything it encompasses, look at its market cap... look at its value.
bitcoin is a currency or is trying to be... look at its current situation and value...   now think about its potential value and corresponding market cap.
you are incorrect when you say the value of bitcoin is pegged to its utility as a store of value and for transaction processing, this is one of multiple factors, but they do not stand alone.

@_date: 2014-06-21 00:50:03
all currency's fluctuate...  people commonly "gamble" on this in the Exact same way they do with bitcoin... check out the forex.
if bitcoins become used for products commonly,  most people wont even check the exchange rates eventually .. just like usd, 
do you check the price of the euro every time you buy milk in usd?  no.. because you don't care... if you earn money in bitcoins and the price from btc to usd changes, you may very well not care at all, and it may have no real effect on your purchasing power... "may"
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:25:30

@_date: 2014-06-21 10:29:05
.......   that's what we do with ALL current money!... we do pay for coffee with stocks.. $ USD $... you just don't notice its like  stocks because you don't deal with other money types... as I said ..   dat forex!...   you better believe almost all money,, usd,, euro,, what ever,, is used as both investments and currency... I believe this may also apply to gold and silver.
if you commonly did business in any of the multiple types of currency pairs +, you will be looking at it much more like Bitcoin

@_date: 2014-07-05 16:04:32
I think a better measure of its value is the economy at large and how much value going through it.. we need something to represent that.  we had gold. fait, now bitcoin.
that is why I say.. look to the big company's  ... look at there value, the market caps, there investment, what they do, why they do it.
it will give you an idea of how much value bitcoin will represent.
@_date: 2014-07-05 12:42:16

yes a 16 year old can do some writing if they wish... 
I put the age limit there because in the future I may have larger scale offers that would likely require the person be 18, and maybe even identify discloser.
also its a low pay job, at least if they are 18 I can say I know for a "fact" (sarcasm)  that they know were they are getting them selves into. (or at least I can claim they are old enough to accept responsibility for there actions)
but ya... if your 16 and you want to earn your self some btc... sure ill take you on with some writing.

@_date: 2014-06-21 20:39:23
yes its not expected,, Unless its a new or destabilized currency's, like bitcoin is ... but it has happened with all money.
so.. yes.. I would say this was very much expected...and just like all money... I expect this to stabilize eventually to a steady but mild deflationary pace.   
soon bitcoin wont be held long nearly as often for gains.. but by day traders will take aims at the mild pip by pip price swings.
but as this is brand new.. the expected massive deflation is happening.
i strongly disagree with your ideas that bitcoin is different from fait money in the manner you have described.... everything you have said that bitcoin is different from USD is exactly what we deal or expect with usd or any money type.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:36:59
It would be nice if multi bit didn't fucking SAVE your previously input info and auto removed it... so I would not come close to doing this too many times....  if it hasent been updated I may need to find a wallet that has a basic and effective confirmation option, with over all details displayed .. and an auto erase when your done.
