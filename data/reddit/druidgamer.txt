doh, I just asked the same question. I don't understand the answer, the video doesn't show how to send BTC from a mycilleium account to a counaplut account. Need more info.
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:09:21
So, how do I "lock" money? Does the mean just send btc to the coinapult account? Also, how do I do that... when I try to send from my primary HD account and chose "my addresses" the coinaplut account isn't listed? I also don't see an address for the coinapult account and pressing the receive button does nothing. Color me confused.
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:50:51
Yep, that worked thanks (after also reloading the app). Sent $15 to it... hope I wins!
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:41:50
I suppose. But, by the time someone has done that, you should have noticed your phone was stolen and moved the BTC to a new wallet.
Also, they would have to crack your iOS password as well... and you can use a complex one there.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:26:14


I disagree with that. With blockchain you control you bitcoin as well. Also, block chain has the advantage of a browser based and chrome extension versions as well. So, it is more flexible.
The big advantage's are:
1. It is an HD wallet recoverable with a seed.
2. It is fast, much faster than the blockchain wallet which can sometimes take a few minutes to d/l, verify, decrypt your wallet.
3. It forces you to use best practices such as unique recieve address and change addresses for every transaction. (Blockchain as far as I know still your first created address for all change unless you do advanced send).

It's not an alternative. 1 Bit = 1 microBit = 1,000,000 sat = .00000100 BTC.
Alas, I see no way to change it, because I pre-fer B right now. Perhaps once BTC is $10,000USD then I would prefer the Bits display. Would be nice to see this as a setting. Also, the number of decimals to show if you do display bitcoin rather than bits.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:30:16


Do you think someone can guess your pin within 6 tries which takes 24 hours to enter and then if the 6th time is wrong the seed is wiped?

BTC to USD exchange rate is too volatile right now to price your services in bitcoin. I suggest getting yourself set up with a Coinbase merchant account and you can send an invoice from there. Coinbase will collect the bitcoin based on the exchange rate at the time the payment is made. You can tell coinbase to convert it all or some to USD. 
There are also other service like Bitpay, etc.
Or, just trust the payer to pay using the USD entry of their wallet, which most have, that use the current exchange rate. If you trust your customers this might be the easiest (and cheapest) method.

I mean, your LN wallet shouldn't have more than petty cash type balance. So, meh!
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:36:38
There's a difference between "not caring about it" and the amount not being "financial ruin" level money. 
Do I keep cash in me physical wallet? Sure... probably not more than a $100 or so at a time. So, in case you lose it, or it is stolen, you won't have trouble making the mortgage and car payment.

Two things.
1.Many gift cards start charging a service fee if you don't use them withing X months (3-6 depending on the store/card). So, the face value of the card could be lower if you try to use it later.
2.The value of bitcoin will stabilize as it becomes more mainstream. 
Even still, the idea of having that Bitcoin gift "card" that you have to go to a store to buy is just silly. Any one can create a bit coin gift card (it's called a paper wallet) and give it to someone. 
I think perhaps the underlying point here is, make it easy to buy bitcoin with cash. I expect there are places that will make this happen. 
I expect Amscot or some similar business would add this. But they'll still have to follow KYC stuff. I mean, they required my wife to provide her finger print to buy money orders. Don't even get me started on that.

How do you do this? I d/l-ed it a while ago just to play with. Didn't plan to use it, so didn't remember my passcode. There is no way to just wipe and start again without knowing the old recovery seed or erasing the whole phone?
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:16:12
This was answered above. When you first run it, if there is no wallet.dat file it will generate it and create an address (actually I think it creates a bunch of them to use as change addresses).
I would recommend Electrum. The wallet is secure by default, in that, it requires you to encrypt you wallet on creation. Use a password generate by lastpass or keypass or something. Also, it is deterministic so it gives you a seed when you start it up. You write this down and save it in a safe place. If you ever loose your wallet file you can use the to recover your wallet. 
Finally, you don't need to d/l the block chain.. which face it, bitcoin users don't really need to do that, only full nodes and miners do.

How cool is the bitcoin community?
@_date: 2015-04-15 19:58:53


Actually with breadwallets requirement on a pin and it's wiping of the wallets after 5 (or 8 or whatever) misentered pins, which takes almost 24 hours to do is actually pretty good protection against a lost phone.


Oh, well never mind. If your not even locking your phone you're just asking for trouble. You want to be using iOS 8 with at least a 4 digit pin so all your data is encrypted. Even better is using iPhone 5S or better with a non-simple passcode and then using touch id. touchid makes it drop dead simple to unlock the phone. 
Do you lock your doors when you leave home?
The nice thing about bitcoin is it allows you to have pocket cash without having to worry about it being easily lost or stolen. It's like cash with a padlock.

There's this little thing called Apple Pay that is changing that rather quickly.
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:47:52


Other than the one flawed update that was fixed and only affected users who generated keys during that small window where these losses due to some insecurity in the blockchain wallet? Or due to user error? Please point me to a thread where it was due to the blockchain wallet and not user error.
Secondly, I have also seen threads were people lost coins using the Bitcoin Core wallet.
Finally, as I said, this is like my checking account. The bulk is held in paper wallets generated using an air gaped computer. While I have considered getting a trezor I'm not sure it is really needed for an individual.

I hope one day that Bitcoin will replace the US Dollar as the worlds reserve currency. Every major commodity like oil, gold, platnium is pretty much bought and sold with US Dollars.
There was talk when the US's credit rating was dropped from AAA to AA that the Euro would become the new world currency, but Euro's having it's on problems. 
Once again, I hope the day comes, of course, I hope to have acquired quite a lot of BTC by the time it does. 10-15 years would be fine with me.
Sure bitcoin could fail. Although, what does "failure" look like. The US Govn't has already rung in quite a bit. 
1. The IRS has published how they will tax bitcoin (as an asset)
2. The Federal Marshal has both seized and re-sold bitcoin.
3. Bitcoin is allowed to be used to contribute to political candidates.
All those things legitimize bitcoin more and more every day in the US. That said, the US is like 5% of the world population. bitcoin is world wide and soon to be in space. (Although it is getting a bit too centralized recently).

I've installed and looked at breadwallet, it looks great, but I have yet to use it.
I use blockchain.info wallet as my primary checking account wallet so I use the blockchain app as well. I also have the Circle and Coinbase apps installed, but I only use those services/wallets when I buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:43:48


How long did that take? Don't you need a PIN for MyCelium too? CC tx are pretty damn fast. ALthough, it seems they take a bit longer with EMV chips. 
Don't get me wrong, I support bitcoin and hope it becomes more mainstream, but speed at the checkout is probably a tie.  
Now sending money to anyone with no middle man, bitcoin is pretty sweet. Although PayPal and Google wallet can do this too without that pesky exchange rate issue.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:03:26
Once you have some large player market makers it won't be as much of an issue because the value will smooth out. 
So far, BTC is a great way to "transfer value" but as a store of value depending on when you bought in, it has been a loss leader.
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:50:12


Really, and so? This is why bitcoin isn't main stream. Because everyone wants to "hide" what they are doing which makes bitcoin look shady.
By at circle... send to a brand new address in your wallet, send that another new address in your wallet through a mixed. 
Is the problem 
"It's too hard to buy bitcoin."
"It's to hard to buy bitcoin anonymously?"
let's be honest with ourselves.

@_date: 2015-04-16 04:38:53
Ah, so the issue isn't the paper wallet, it is sweeping/importing it into an insecure wallet. So, basically, it is the wallet you are importing it into where the issue lies, correct?
I think the only time I can see spending $120 for a hardware wallet like the trezor (or the ledger wallet) is if I was transacting bitcoin over unknown devices.
I expect sweeping a paper wallet with breadwallet is extremely secure. Given breadwallet is actually as secure as it seems to be.

Yes, the proves someone embedded a hash in the blockchain, exactly.


Of course not. If you can create a document that hashes to some random hash that you created then you sir are a wizard.
If you understand the math of a hash you know that to create a document that hashes to some random hash is pretty much impossible.
If you don't believe and trust the math of SHA256 and other crypto then you probably shouldn't be using Bitcoin, or SSL, or even the internet.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:05:35
I'm not sure how that is relevant. 
If you win more than a certain amount (not sure what it is these days, $5000 I think) they will withhold 25% (30% for non-US citizens) and issue you a W-2G.
Also, this generally only happens on a slot, keno, etc win where they know how much you bet. For example, table games have no way to know what you're "gain" is so there is generally no reporting there. 
I very much doubt the form of payment, cash, check, wire, bitcoin will change that.
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:22:46
Embedding the hash of the file/document in the block chain proves it existed on that date. Seems like semantics.
Actually, while "proof of existence" is interesting using that service doesn't have any "proof of ownership". Clearing house has what's called a Notary Document, which is pretty similar to what proofofexistence does but you create the notary document in your own address. 
This allows for the ability to have ownership documents such as for an automobile or a piece of art or whatever. Since the Notary Document is in your address you can transfer it (spend it) to another address to transfer ownership.
Actually, don't most governments already accept digital signatures? I don't think it a stretch to think such a document registrations would be accepted as well, without even needing a petition.
