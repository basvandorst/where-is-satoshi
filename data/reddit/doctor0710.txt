Do you remember any part of the passphrase? Maybe it is possible to bruteforce the passphrase, if there were only a few unknown words, or only the words order were unknown. For recovering the clipboard history, I don't think there is any solution. There is a good chance that wallet is lost.

My Alias is Doctor0710 - The thing that I like about SatoshiCircle is that it gets pretty useful combined with mining. I mean, I withdraw my mining balance to SatoshiCircle, I double or triple the coins, and it's like I've mined for 2 or 3 days instead of 1.

Nope, my phone died before I could make a backup, and no, my MTGox account is not verified. Thanks for your response, I think they're lost for good now.
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:03:43
Thanks! I can confirm that my account was founded. I'am very happy with it, I almost doubled it already!

1,152 spins of those are mine! Congrats for the second million!

Try satoshicircle or satoshidice. With my GPU I have about 150-200MHash/s, that makes me about 0.01BTC a day on 50btc. Today I tried satoshicircle with just 0.01BTC, then after 5 minutes of clicking, I got 0.0216BTC. Then I've put another 0.01 on 50% at satoshice, got back 0.0196. Now I almost made 3 days worth of mining in under an hour.

I did, forgot to mention it. But then again, there isn't much lost, couple of bucks at most. Thanks again!

Actually I thought making a backup of the seed in plain text is insecure, and I'm not really sure about the security of my computers (I have antivirus softwares and firewalls, but also know how fast trojans and viruses evolve).
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:31:02
Thanks, I didn't see this one 'till now. Looks like they're doing something.

It took me exactly 3 days, 18 hours and 32 minutes. That, and a bunch of luck, selling at it's best point on Cryptsy for BTC, then BTC to USD. Be prepared for long withdraw and transaction times, as altcoins are nowhere as fast as Bitcoin, thus making confirmation times a lot longer.
FYI: I did not calculate with electricity, since I get it almost for free where I'm living right now.
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:18:11
Well, with fiat money, transactions can take days to process, unlike bitcoin. I recommend you just to wait for now.

Online wallets could have downtimes or disappear completely (just lile instawallet did in the near past), but are available anytime anywhere 'til you can access the internet. 
Offline wallets are stored on your computer, so they can't disappear from one day to another, unless you have some malicious software or you damage your hard drive. Since they are on your computer, you need it to sync to the network, and download the full blockchain. That takes time and space on your hard drive.

How long ago did you withdraw your money?
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:40:52
Yaaay :)

I just noticed it. Sorry if it is a repost, I did not find any articles about putlocker in @_date: 2013-06-19 13:58:37
 this.

Well, I really just found it on reddit, but it does seem to me, that it can be true. How much time would it take to change a single bit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0? Is the time consumed by changing a bit multiplied by 2^256 longer than a lifetime of a star?
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:00:14
Thanks for the reply. Actually the reason I asked here is because I heard about their support being slow, and not very helpful.

I'm using a single 5770 for mining altcoins (Dogecoin in particular), and made about $12USD worth of Bitcoins. However, altcoins are not very stable, be sure to choose a relatively stable one (use coinwarz.com for that). Mining Bitcoins directly with this card is very inefficient. It was great in January, though.
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:03:08
Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:28:04
Looks like they did. I've found screenshots of them on google, one of their addresses is: 14ZwfLwn7H43ejCph4Q3UN4sErk5qBRVNq
They did send a lot of their coins to satoshidice.
@_date: 2013-07-06 01:43:56
I think you might have a trojan on your computer, that replaces the clipboard contents, or changes bitcoin addresses in your clipboard. The address you sent the coins to is now empty.
Someone owns that address, and had the ability to move those coins to this address: 12WixNnoBCJsjsE4VUTNTf44AURU3XityL
Sorry, but those are lost.
