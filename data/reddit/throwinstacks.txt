I'm waiting for a more complete solution like Safenet. It's easy to build on and doesn't require a volunteer network.

Bitcoin is still in the adoption phase, so I think it's unfair to make such harsh accusations. Try speaking with your local NPR station and you might be surprised how they will react.

I specifically said I wasn't, so my post was meant to be taken with a grain of salt. However, using social engineering and false identities to obtain his information, and any false information in the article could potentially be grounds for a civil suit.
Also, even if Newsweek is innocent, they might choose a settlement instead.
As I stated in my first post, I am not an expert; how about we just [see what happens?](

Thank you for your responses and professionalism. Skeptics tend to ignore the hard work that many people do behind the scenes to make bitcoin usable.
The site looks great by the way! I'll definitely try this out.

I was on coinmap.org and was really surprised to find someone that accepts bitcoin in my area. I just made my first bitcoin purchase IRL.

How so? I was never told it was tied to autopay. Threaten to cancel your service if they do and they'll back off.

According to the comments any young white male that has taken a risk in innovation is a gullible entitled asshole, completely ignoring the many thousands of smart investors that made an incredible profit from bitcoin and still use it today. There isn't a single word in the article about the benefits of bitcoin, and the community and businesses that support it and want regulation. Absolutely terrible journalism and even worse comments.
90% of the people commenting on the article have absolutely no understanding of cryptocurrencies, but yet they feel entitled to bash it. Hmmmmm?
Edit: I did what I can to fix some of the idiocracy that was occurring as WilshireCM without coming across as arrogant or hateful as they have.

It's only $30 for the first year and goes to $55 the second, averaging $43 for two years of HD &amp; DVR in two rooms. Not bad, and a shitload cheaper than DirectTV. You can also use the Dish Anywhere app to watch live or recorded shows on any computer, phone, or tablet. If you want to join I have a referral code that saves you $50 on your first bills.
Sorry if that souded like a paid advert. You can cancel after the 2 years. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:15:43
I said there potentially may be one, but we don't know all the facts yet. Do you even read my comments or do just like to argue?
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:43:19
Sick reference bro, but I don't think we'll see that growth ever again.

There is more news and professional journalism in 30 minutes of NPR than 24 hours of cable news. I don't know about your local NPR station, but the national and local NPR in my area is top notch and very unbiased.

I don't think they broke any criminal laws, but they can still be sued for civil damages if the prosecution can prove that Newsweek was neglectful by posting his real identity and home, and those actions caused him and emotional or physical damages. They can also be sued over how they obtained the information.

In the future do you think that blockchain technology will coalesce into one crpytocurrency, or stay a mixed crpyto market with each crypto serving different functions as it does best?

I've been using Seagate externals since 2009 with only one issue (One external's enclosure died but the drive was ok). Almost every year I go up one terabyte, then keep the previous drive as a backup. 
I can't complain.

Surely Circle must let users enter the amount in BTC, because If they don't that's pretty fucking dumb.

That's a good argument. I disagree about micro-transactions on the blockchain, but thank you for discussing it without calling me a shill/liar/etc. I was just trying to vent my frustration this morning.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:36:59
Sorry, I didn't know if you were sarcastically calling me a shill or not. I was just trying to show you that I really am having problems with bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:50:50
The scalability problem is Bitcoin, not Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:46:24
I used Coinbase. I can't change the fee.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:16:05
Or just transfer with an an altcoin (which I can't name without being called a shill) and save my money.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:46:39


@_date: 2015-11-10 16:16:44
It's cheaper and faster for me to just sell it and transfer it with an altcoin right now. Seconds vs hours.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:19:03
I've divested a lot of my BTC lately into an altcoin because I'm tired of it.

I agree, but what about microtransactions?
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:16:16
This is a great idea to raise attention and build the bitcoin community. Bitcoin users are very stereotyped, especially on Reddit. Unfortunately it seems like everybody on the internet has an axe to grind with bitcoin. Also the brigading by and is partly the reason why your idea was so heavily attacked.
