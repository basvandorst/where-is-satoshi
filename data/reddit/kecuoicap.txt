That's one way to go or just get a hardware wallet. As simple as that. Your private keys are never exposed to the computer. An encrypted pin protects the hardware wallet and to top it all of you have to verify the transaction with your hardware wallet which no one other than you can verify until and unless they get hold of your wallet.

They changed the rates again? Oh no..

I agree. I would categorize that as one of the drawbacks of QE. But having said all that, it has to be done methodically and very cautiously.

Good catch. Hadn't noticed that at all.

I think it's a long term solution because the economy builds itself upon the same foundation we create by implementing QE. 
 Also I wouldn't call it a solution because there are chances it may lead to other problems within the financial system that  weren't a cause for concern before the QE implementation. I would term it as an 'approach' implemented by the Central Bank in situations where the economy has turned down.

Aren't we all? Good work mate.

I think you are missing the context here. The centralized banks use an approach known as Quantitative easing. It is a method that allows the  central banks to purchase government assets(keep in mind these are worth a lot of money) so as to affect the economy. This is practiced in economies that have taken a hit. They further sell these assets to increase the supply of money which reduces the 'COST' of money in turn reducing the interest rates. Reducing the interest rates eases the flow of cash in the general public which leads to a slightly better equilibrium.

This a really good point you made here. With all the drama surrounding the Coinbase incident, more and more people are looking to conduct their transactions over a more secure exchange and Bisq is certainly one of the best out there. 
One of the main selling points for Bisq is the manual selection of the person you want to trade with. The transaction does not include any sort of involvement of the Bisq application and to put it in simple words, its a platform made solely for the purpose of providing an interface for the people to safely trade with.
Given that the trading volume of Bitcoins slumped below [One Billion]( last month, this will result in people moving to better exchange options.
