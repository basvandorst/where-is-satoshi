How difficult would it be for you to cash out to USD at this point? Just curious.

Assistant *to* the regional manager.

In theory *maybe* but in practice cash is not nearly as trackable unless it is changing hands through organizations that are reporting or tracking the serial numbers. There's a good reason the IRS has a tax gap in the billions of dollars. You can bet that would not be the case in a system with a public ledger for *all* transactions.

Windows is also far from the only vector of attack.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:42:29
Yeahhh, it sure is.

I always wonder if in 30 years people will look at these bitcoin tips in the internet archive and say things like 'holy crap, that could buy a house at today's prices'.

It's slow though, and for some reason that nobody can rightly answer, the computer keeps bankers hours.

I think this would be very bad for Bitcoin, it would encourage speculation, but do nothing to boost the utility of Bitcoin as a method of exchange. What we need is to see more increase in terms of being Bitcoin accepted as a method of payment between customers and businesses.

Eh, you'd be surprised how much new code is written in 2

No problem man! Sales on the web are all about optimizing conversion rates percent by percent, so every little thing helps. 
I'd also suggest having the price and product info right on the landing page - you lose a percentage of visitors each link deeper they need to click in your sales funnel.

The problem is, 99% of the conversation about Bitcoin recently has been about the value of the currency as an investment.
The focus needs to be on the value of Bitcoin as a service. In the end, the true value of Bitcoin is tied to it's utility.

I would take the bitcoin price gadget out of your sidebar - it is the only visible 'price' on your site unless you click in to read the story and it makes it seem like your product is really expensive at first glance. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:31:28
Do they honor the original price, or the price at the time the order clears?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:48:09
I think it's pretty clear that when the best corollary we can find is some fad about tulips - we are in uncharted territory. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:10:22
Uh, no, it would be far worse than what we have with the dollar. Cash isn't very trackable.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:59:01
Over the long term, I think it is very possible. Long term being many years.

Right there with ya man! I put in an order for .10 of bitcoin a week ago on coinbase as it is all I can afford. It hasn't come through yet, but I am excited to become a part of this. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:54:27
Hmm, that's interesting I wonder what the reasoning is behind that for them.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:30:50
Good old ACH...the only computer system that works on banker's hours. 
So does validating a credit card speed things up then?
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:12:09
Oh, ok thank you so much. I was confused because it SAYS I should be able to buy 10 Btc/day right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:31:22
Feel like some kind of solar powered dongle with an E-ink display would be pretty spiffy for BTc
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:50:22
No major roadblock. I didn't say it was impossible for it to hit that price point earlier.

I've noticed that since tablets have become a thing, more people are getting online. A tablet represents a huge usability boost when compared to a PC for casual users who want to see their grand kid on Skype. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:53:47
How many of those people have internet? (serious question, I don't actually know). 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:01:12
I don't think this would be a good association to make in the minds of the public right as we are hoping to bring Bitcoin mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:48:33

More than when we went off the gold standard?

I'll take "Racist Rhymes" for 400, Alex. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:27:47
Forgive me because I'm not familiar enough with the BTC ATM's but if you spend a partial amount of your bitcoin from the paper wallet, does the rest of the balance still exist in the paper wallet or is it now stored electronically with a different key?
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:42:09
Interesting, thank you for the info. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:22:03
Yep - noticed that. Just curious why it would take 7 days. If it's normal behavior, I won't worry about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:48:58
Game theory! If everyone chooses to taint their coins then nobody will lose out, and coin tainting will be useless. If a significant amount of people choose not to do that, then those who do taint coins will lose a significant amount.

You probably aren't far wrong. What looks better on paper, shutting down a tiny, illegal website that just started up, or a huge marketplace for illegal activity? If for no other reason than career advancement, it seems like there are plenty of motivating factors for not closing SR right away. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:34:35
That's part of my concern - I have a very specific amount of money set aside for this and don't want to spend more than that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:47:54
What is the more trustworthy alternative?
