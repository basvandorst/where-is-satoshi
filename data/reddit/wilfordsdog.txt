Nothing that exciting. Just sign up for the tip bot, and hold on to them or tip them out to others. You can get the coins by using the tip bot.

Agreed! Thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-15 08:29:55
You base this on?
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:05:38
The price is falling because of fear. It hit 120, so people who got in for less figured they made some money time to get out. People in for more then 120 are thinking, "Fuck it's falling! I'll sell now and buy back when it's cheaper."
And that's whats going on right now. Everyone is trying to dump, and no one wants to buy.
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:58:45
I think some of it is fear, but greed is playing a large role.
@_date: 2013-06-09 09:45:43
Na. You got into this market. You must have some smarts.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:50:21
I like this site. Something simple like [PREEV]( would be great.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:55:52
Still a good question.

I hope so. I don't mean that in a mean way at all, but if most of the public loses confidence in the coin then that will make a better entry point for myself. Thanks to sites like the Silk Road, and other black markets I do have a confidence in the market.

If you go to a good school. It's hard to make that choice sometimes though.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:47:13
Is it worth getting into at this point?
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:54:25
I think it will be pretty stable over the weekend. Monday might be busy. I am thinking the price will rise a bit on Monday, and start a general increase over the next few weeks.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:27:22
Seems like someone big is cashing in and it just caused a panic.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:46:54
Other then 11 cents from the bot I have never owned any bitcoins myself. I don't really have a lot of money to spare on trading, but if it drops around 70 dollars its going to be very tempting.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:59:50
I am using CampBX. I transfer cash in via dwolla. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 08:52:18
Thank you for the tip! Do you think I can do the online MoneyGram with them. Seems like it would be the best method without having to wait along time.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:53:07
what about me? I gave solid advice.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:14:17
To do nothing is a gamble. To sell is a gamble. My personal thought. Hold on to what you have. If it drops below what you got it for say to where I want it to be around 60 dollars. Buy more! Sounds like an off idea, but if you have made the choice to buy into this market now is not the time to sell. I would say wait and watch.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:51:07
Accepted. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:46:30
I would be interested. I love tips, and picking up small amounts around the internet. Bitcoin tips make the internet funner.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:26:57
Np. Thanks to the online black market I think bitcoin will be in demand for a long time. Also people, like me, want in. It will go back up. Someone is just cashing in right now. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:58:46
Thank you good sir.
