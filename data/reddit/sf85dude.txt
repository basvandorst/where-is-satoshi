Geez.. what's with all the negativity here?  This guy is trying to do something epic, and he's actually making progress.  We should be supporting him.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:55:55
Please be honest... had we increased the block size to 2MB and fees were in the $0.10 range, would you still have disabled Bitcoin payments?

That's called structuring.  The IRS criminalizes this.

Sure... assuming it never goes online again.  
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:41:01
True. But this could be fixed with some aggressive maker/taker pricing.  Additional coins and a lending platform would also help.
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:27:08
This is significant.

You may be right, but I bet he was doing a lot of the grind work.  It just doesn't feel right that he would depart right before the decision. I hope I'm wrong.

Exactly.  If you want to thank someone, thank someone that devotes a lot of time to the space without financial gain.  Meetup organizers, devs, artists, etc.

If the decision comes in as a rejection on the 13th, there is no way Bitmex would give it to the longs on their misunderstanding of the deadline.
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:30:54
The intent is clear.  Stop being a pud.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:40:55
It's not going to happen. The people with the most knowledge around the situation are giving it a below 30% probability.  Also, they fired the lawyer that was working on it in the 11th hour.  It doesn't mean Bitcoin is doomed.  There are other avenues for managed money being created, family offices are getting involved, and coinbase alone is still signing up 10k+ new users every day.  The next few years are going to be a fun ride no matter what.
edit: they fired their general counsel, but I bet he was helping.

Don't think he was talking about putting a minimum size constraint, just the ability to make blocks larger should the economic incentive be there.  Seems like this type of system would benefit even more as the mining reward dwindles.

This case, even after a ruling, will be appealed forever. If CW is ordered to pay (which he won't/can't), the estate taxes will be on BTC valued at $130.

This pop has been telegraphed for the last couple weeks as the alts began to turn bullish.  It just spilled over into BTC and squeezed the shorts.  No exchange manipulation needed.

I don't think people will pay to read and contribute content no matter how small.  Why not just have a mechanism for advertisers to bid on ad space?  The funds would go to nodes, mods, and maybe content creators. You can even have checks and balances to cancel poor ads via some public consensus.

We don't have Rootstock, and let's be honest.  The banks and corporate enterprise don't hate Ethereum like they do Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:12:48
Which is probably the best thing.  B/C lets be honest, they are dead in the water with bitcoin alone as a funding source if it happens immediately.  It's better to drag it out. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:57:17
Theoretically, but we don't know because it is not released and by the time it is, Ethereum will be way ahead.  Much like the network effect for Bitcoin for currency, Ethereum has the network effect for smart contracts.  ETH has a huge thing going for it... that's the ability for any non-dev to write and deploy contracts.  
Not to worry-- BTC is a better/safer currency.  I suspect 5 years from now BTC and ETH will have similar marketcaps.

Ridiculous to see your 2fa disabled by admin.  I guess this means bitstamp was socially engineered by someone pretending to be you with your spoofed phone number. They should have frozen your funds for at least of couple of weeks if they are going to take 2fa off of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:49:10
I'm all for a fee market, but much later. The block reward is intended to compensate and allow close to free transactions until much later adoption.  Specifically, merchants need to push consumers to use BTC.  They won't do that unless fees are cheaper and they can offer incentives beyond what kickbacks CC's give consumers.  It is way too early for a real fee marketplace.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:45:23
If that is the case, then Bitcoin is broken because we will never have enough room in blocks to compensate miners with just segwit as the block reward dwindles.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:21:59
We can raise the block size at anytime if devs and miners agree, but that is not happening.  Clearly miners are blocking segwit because they are concerned devs wont on-chain scale after it is passed.

The miners or a few of the toxic devs?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:44:33
You are not listening to what I'm saying.  I'm not against SW. I'm saying that miners want assurances of future on-chain scaling to compensate them for the $100 million investments.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:14:30


Specifically, who decided this?  
@_date: 2016-05-05 03:12:22
Yeah.  He may be not Satoshi, but a guy with his knowledge/involvement and tens of millions isn't dickin' around with just a few coins.

I've come to notice that often when speaks, he should apply the same criticisms to himself.
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:00:29
But the one thing most people want (and one line of code) can't get done.  There is also a fundamental disagreement about the timing of a fee marketplace.  Most would argue to keep transactions free and create the fee market much later.  This is the whole point of the scaling block reward.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:25:10
It's just software.  No one is forcing anyone to run it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:10:23

The bear whale referred to a huge amount of BTC someone was selling in one block.  This is different, in that it [is a short that borrowed many thousands of BTC]( (at least 10k on bitfinex alone) and sold them into the market.  In this case, they must buy the BTC back.  I hope they get squeezed.
