fair enough, I don't know much about the hong kong protests, maybe the author is selective or biased in that regard
@_date: 2019-12-24 07:19:54
I didn't really get the "hong kong protests are good for bitcoin" part, it seemed more like they were stating that the hong kong protests have caused tigher  restrictions on bitcoin

Why would you do that? Did I not warn you guys to sell as soon as it hit 800? Oh wait, the moderators deleted that topic. I wonder why. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:10:21
I said "starting over the weekend". And when the dips first started 2 days ago I called it literally 1 hour in advance, when all other stories, news outlets and reddit topics were saying "it's rising!". I'm starting to notice veterans and "economy analyst" have no fucking clue what is going on with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:04:22
A happy dick considering how much the price just keeps dropping, like I said it would. Lol.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:41:26
Do you think it would hurt bitcoin more rapidly? Even if it were just to occur for a 1 hour window for example?

Perhaps you are projecting yourself. My name is an inside joke for another subreddit, it's not that deep to me. I haven't predicted these markets as accurately as some of you folks also actually, I just so happen to have a bit more information and the eye to know what I am looking at.
Don't take my word for it, let the calendar to the talking.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:19:34
I deleted the topic 10 minutes after I posted it cause I was trolled -- and at the time coinbase and all the others were too busy trying to pump the coin with hype articles and tweets. (Very shady practices going on over there) It didn't drop because of me, it dropped because the coin sites and this subreddit were too busy hyping and pumping instead of reading the news and the politics that have gotten heavily involved in bitcoin in the past 2 weeks. Stay woke
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:45:55
I deleted it before the price even started dropping because it was getting downvoted to bits.

2 months is way too far I just don't have enough data (starting from 2010 charts), but up to 2 weeks has seemed pretty on the money. I predicted the price drops from 2800 to 2000 1 hour before it occured using this same tech + other info I read in the news.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:05:25
it's getting highly politicized - I mean that literally.

this is not a shit post, but downvote if you must. On the bright side those that didn't want to buy in at this price can rejoice :)

I very much agree with this, but most people do not have this level of discipline or money to let incubate. If you are in fact holding and you can affoard to - I agree 100% it's the best thing to do. Doesn't matter how much it drops and dips, it's guaranteed to hit 24,000 a coin in the next 4 years. But if you don't have the money to spare.. if you are using bitcoin as a hedge... just saying
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:01:46
More like 25k next. As soon as bitcoin is worth just 5% of the worlds gold it will have no choice but to hit this price, it's law

is a 900$ increase really that unhealthy? Percentage wise bitcoin has done this many times over, some without backtrack. Were those times unhealthy as well? Or did you just get here?

Zero Hedge reports:
As Bloomberg notes, the S&amp;P 500 climbed for the third consecutive session as President Donald Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia netted deals that lifted defense shares. The euro remains firm having pared gains from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s comment referring to the single currency as “too weak.” The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 2.25% while gold rose and crude climbed to the highest in a month as Saudi Arabia said all producers agree on extending output cuts. Brazil’s real trimmed losses after the top court suspended its ruling on President Temer, while Mexico’s peso gained as interest rate differentials temporarily overshadow NAFTA concerns.

This would make sense if it consitently  happened every night. Again, a lot of guessing and no research. Take a look at what's happening with gold, Kik (the messaging app) and Ethereum currency and then look at what Asia is doing and you know exactly what is about to happen. It's all tied into one
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:22:30
Monday evening, but it will not get any lower after wednesday. I guess what I'm saying is wait till Wednesday to see it's lowest price it will be all year 2017 (until it rises again in october, possivly past the 6k mark, you heard it here first)

I think you are reading too much into my name. True I have no real intentions of helping people, I post this information to help myself. When I share info I am actually hoping someone will add and or confirm/disprove some of what I said. What I've found is that a lot of you here are the type to get on your knees and pray that something works out, instead of going out and fixing it to work. And none of you know what you are talking about. Just a bunch of guesses. Well keep guessing,  hope it works out for you.

@_date: 2017-05-25 19:47:51
It's actually due to bitcoin rapidly moving towards a politicized tool and the news about the hard forking. China also plans to restrict the currency which is going to cause a huge panic.

@_date: 2017-05-27 13:55:54
I say it again because it seems it goes over your head. Don't feel bad though, we only have to wait until October until your value reaches 2800 again. Buy ethereum and dash for now, buy bitcoin when it completes the drops on wednesday and live good the rest of your life. Or ignore this comment and be salty and bitter come Oct.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:12:37
Only for the next 31 hours. After that you can expect to lose 20% of where we were 30 days ago. You heard it here first (you guys always hear it from me first, remember that.)
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:00:09
I warned you guys to sell when it hit 2800 just a day and a half ago. I posted all of the pertaining information. But I was called a troll and crazy. Now those same folks are down 800 per coin, lol feels good man. Now is NOT the time to buy. You should wait until it hits 800-900 in a few days (which 100% it will).

how much are coins worth since this post now? :) should of listened.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:40:52
I don't argue that at all, I think NEM has another 4 years to go before it's considered viable but it's certainly getting there. I think DASH coin is much more promising. ETHER looks on the up as well but it's only a matter of time before someone reinvents that wheel and presents it better.

Why did all the veterens spam "HOLD" then? Strange. If any veterans can show proof of them selling out at 2800 like me, I'd take this answer. But I doubt that's the case. I don't want a hand job, I'm just laughing my ass off becauce I was called a troll and an idiot, and those same people that called me that are now in the hole several thousand dollars with no chance to recover it until october LOL!
