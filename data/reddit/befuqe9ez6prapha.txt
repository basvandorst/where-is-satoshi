There is inflation and there is currency debasement/devaluation (through increasing money supply). They both have a similar effect on asset prices, labor/wages, debt/interest and purchasing power

from the article: 
"Satoshi Nakamoto himself believed it was best to stick to only one Bitcoin implementation. He thought alternative implementations might process data differently, thus posing a significant risk that they would run out of sync with each other. Satoshi warned this would undermine a key property of Bitcoin: the ability of all users to reach consensus over the state of the blockchain ledger.
In 2010, debating Gavin Andresen on Bitcointalk, Satoshi argued,
“I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.”

There are alot of nice videos, cartoons, whiteboard animations that sum up a complex monetary history. They are fun to watch yourself but I do not recommend sharing with others as they appear like tin-foil-hat conspiracy ravings. 
Learn about the historical facts in these videos and share those facts with others.

yes this is one of the appeals of bitcoin. Loaning would be voluntary, peer-to-peer, auditable, transparent, non-refundable.

arent slack and discord both proprietary, centralized services?
What about open-source, free-software, decentralized alternatives?
I see a few good threads about bitcoin come up on zeronet

good comments on this.
Does anyone know where I can find a chart/graph showing federal reserve remittances to treasury? I find articles with amounts and I found some amounts in fed reports but Id like to see a chart with annual amounts going back at least a decade, ideally since the creation of federal reserve.

you can make your own if you feel comfortable flashing bios. It needs to be a computer pre 2008 with NO intel management engine (IME). 
Software wise only enable open/free sources.

agreed but for sake of argument:
If the pi is offline (via hardware, no wifi capability whatsoever), whats the worst that it could do, plant some malware on the usb theoretically, then get onto the online machine when user plugs in usb and send you priv key to attacker?
