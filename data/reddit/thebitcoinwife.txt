Fantastic! I'm a long time Coastal customer &amp; have emailed them several times in the past asking about accepting Bitcoin. They were never dismissive but very vague about their interest, however they never said they weren't aware of it.
They are the best place to buy Rx glasses online, hands down.

For many of us, spending Bitcoin is not a novelty, it's a necessity and a preference. And I prefer to spend Bitcoin directly with a merchant as I need to rather than cash out of an exchange in bulk. It is also MUCH easier to process payment than dealing with credit cards. I believe Bitcoin's value is derived from actualized purposes, not hopes and dreams. So rather than sit &amp; wait on what might be, I'll continue to use it as it is now for my real-world needs. I believe in Bitcoin enough not to clutch them in fear.

Sorry to hear that GSpot. Phraust and I have been Simple customers doing BTC to fiat with them for over a year now and have loved their service. I know Simple themselves are very neutral on their stance with Bitcoin, its been a pleasant middle ground for those of us who still have to deal in fiat for some things. I really hope they resolve this for you. I don't know where else we will bank if they turn on Bitcoin. Have 1 beer on me man, take care. @_date: 2014-01-13 03:46:24

I agree! I find the more you share your enthusiasm and the more you talk about your own experiences, the more interest you generate from others. Passion easily rubs off on others when it's sincere. I would connect with the Women in Bitcoin group in San Fran to see what their plans are for 2014.

Have fun! The Austin meetup peeps are a great bunch.
@_date: 2013-08-03 00:18:03
Wow, this IS huge. Perhaps the LDS church will be next? I asked Becky and Austin when they launched their "Life on Bitcoin" kickstarter if they would be attempting to pay for their tithing with Bitcoin, and they said they would try to get the Mormon church on board. Religious orgs adopting Bitcoin would be a pretty big deal.
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:20:17
I don't think its irrelevant at all. From a consumer standpoint, men and women are completely different types of shoppers. For example, my husband Phraust has bought all kinds of hardware, cables, 3-D printing accessories, etc. with BTC. I, on the other hand, have bought cosmetics and chocolate. And that is a very good thing for Bitcoin, there needs to be a more diverse consumer base.

I agree it is difficult to quantify a concept within a language that has no cultural reference point, as is the case with most technological terms. Phonetically, most Polynesian languages would interpret Bitcoin as "pitikoni" or "pikikoni". 
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:05:47
I'm assuming you two are Mormon. If so, are you planning on petitioning the LDS church to accept Bitcoin for your tithing?
@_date: 2013-09-04 16:42:45
Congrats man. Going full-Bitcoin was the best decision we ever made. For me, its the small things we never got to enjoy in our previous corporate rat-race life, like getting coffee together in the morning or being able to attend our kids school functions with no PTO approval hoops to jump through.

There are a good handful of us around, some more vocal than others. I met about a dozen women at Bitcoin2013, involved with Bitcoin on various levels, but all very passionate about it nonetheless. I started a few months back, but haven't put much elbow grease into it. I also run  where I muse about Bitcoin and review products that are available for Bitcoin. My husband and I got into Bitcoin over 2 years ago and now completely live off our investments and mining efforts.

I'll take that. And as I said before, I'm just being myself, and I created the site because I wanted to start the dialogue with other women and have some fun with it, tongue-in-cheek and all. At the end of the day, I want to show what is out there in the Bitcoin market, things that will appeal to men and women alike, things that my husband and I have purchased or that I'd like to buy. This is for the consumers, not for the investors.

A few meetups do this already. The Utah Meetup group seems to be pretty successful with their model, organizing 1-2 BitMobs per month. I think it's a great way to promote Bitcoin and create awareness.

I love using Simple. They have by far been the most neutral &amp; hassle-free option for banking as a Bitcoiner. And their newly launched free instant transfers between accounts is pretty spiffy. I honestly don't see where the competition lies, as the article states, between Simple and Bitcoin. They each serve a purpose &amp; until a company (perhaps Coinbase) begins to offer "bank-like" services for the Bitcoin balance I maintain with them, I'll continue to exist in both worlds. It is short-sighted of Simple to look at Bitcoin as a threat to their business model, it's comparing apples and oranges.
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:48:09
Isn't that interesting? We got the same silent treatment. They were given our contact information and I was open to talking with them about how we live, and what we've learned, and any advice they may want, but never heard a peep from them.
And whatever their opinion is on Vegas, they shouldn't let that interfere with the experiment, and reject an opportunity to engage the Bitcoin community.
It is a shame that there are a handful of decent documentaries being made on Bitcoin that are being completely overshadowed by this beast of a marketing campaign.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:08:39

Me too, Im anxiously awaiting Target. Costco would be awesome too
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:41:44
Yeah, I can attest that was no fun getting my card declined at Costco :/ Moneypaks have been the fastest and most convenient way for us to liquidate BTC, and we have been using their service exactly how it is set up to be used. Bank transfers from exchanges are fine for large amounts of USD if we don't need it right away, but who knows how long that will last either.
This is just another testament to the immediate need to make Bitcoin more usable as a form of payment. We wouldn't liquidate into USD if we didn't have to, but that is the current state of affairs for those of us who are using our BTC.
Time to get some Gyft cards!

Yes, the industry is, and I am glad I left it behind. But my site has nothing to do with the technology side of Bitcoin. There is enough sound and eloquently written material on the development/programming/mining side of Bitcoin that shows how cool it works. The other side of the coin (pun intended), is the KEYSTONE to making Bitcoin work, and that is purchasing power. The consumer market of a virtual currency has nothing to with technology, and everything to do with the cool shit you can buy with it. What good is cryptocurrency if you can't use it? Gender stereotyping is really just a bunch of B.S. in my mind. I like being a woman who buys girly stuff with Bitcoin and wanted to have fun with the site. This is all great discussion, and I super stoked to talk to other women about Bitcoin, so I really appreciate the conversation.

Does the church offer online payments for tithing and fast Sunday yet? (ExMormon here, haven't been to church in ages.) Imagine if the tithe system was based on, or at least included Bitcoin transactions, how much easier it would be not only to pay online, but as a ledger to replace tithing slips. Purely hypothetical, but not beyond the realms of possibility.

I love the idea of a "fact checker" site for news articles. It would also be great to have a list of common misconceptions that could be refuted/explained with citation and references.

I don't think it's about saving money. This is a really smart move for Coinbase to broaden their pool of talent and span their support across time zones for better after-hour response times. Telecommuting is a successful business model and can easily be managed over VPN. I've done it for years.

Just a suggestion, FR33Aid, which is a well-known Bitcoin-only charity, has direct contacts with the Phillipines and is collecting donations right now that are going straight there. Teresa Warmke of FR33Aid, is matching donations up to 10BTC.

It's actually a very freeing experience, and promotes smarter and more thoughtful spending. Sometimes I think back to the value increases we missed out on by going full Bitcoin (like our 35 BTC anniversary dinner last year that would be worth $18,000 today!) but it was worth every Satoshi being an active participant in the Bitcoin Eco system on the daily and moving away from our dependency on banks/dollars. Good luck with everything!

I have female friends and relatives who are not in the tech world that are interested in using Bitcoin, and this site is for them more than anything.

Hey Matthew, confused over all of this yesterday in realizing there were 2 separate entities of bitmuchies, I ended up buying from both of you, prior to seeing this post. So I guess we'll see who delivers me some product to review! I do appreciate the adjustment you made to my order since you were out of stock of the particular item I requested.
I doubt THEbitmunchies is a scam, as they are only selling chips and redbull. I spoke with the owner last night and my impression is that Ira pulled a fast one, on both of you apparently. He seems like a decent guy who got screwed. I hope you guys can figure something out, it was confusing trying to use a coupon code from his twitter acct on your site, which is what led me to this whole mess.

Congrats on your new addition! We are also setting aside Bitcoin for our kids. Cassiscus coin is the easy and simple option, we've been talking about keeping them in a safety deposit box somewhere possibly. Plus, kids love gold coins! It's like gifting them pirate treasure...

Here in Hawaii, we have a huge population that remits earnings back home. Interesting fact: in Tonga (my descent) remittances constitute the highest proportion of GNP than any country in the world. My relatives here in the states spend a lot of money getting their money into the country. Bitcoin can already solve this NOW, without a company adding their own additional fees to convert to local currency. What we need is infrastructure to make Bitcoin usable in their economies, not rape them with unnecessary fees. Technology needs to mature and advance in these places, and when it does, we'll see natural adoption.

Super cute! I used to maintain 2g and 4g in my ears, but I decided to let them shrink last year. Otherwise I'd be buying!

Agree with this for the most part, but considering the BTC discount brings the nightly stay to about $100, you won't find a single hotel room in Waikiki at that price. If you want to do Waikiki on the cheap, I'd go for it, Paokalani St isn't that bad. That being said, here in Kailua, there are some awesome Bed and Breakfasts around here for about the same rates, and our beaches are 10x cleaner and less crowded.

I still think it will continue to be a fantastic introduction to Bitcoin's tangibility for newbies and naysayers because of the gifting option within the app. Last month, while my parents were vacationing 2500 miles away, they mentioned eating at The Rainforest Cafe. Bitcoin&gt;Bitpay&gt;Gyft&gt;Parents and I was able to treat them to an impromptu lunch within minutes. That gesture was an ah-hah moment for them in how useful Bitcoin and the services built around them are. And aside from that, I don't see large retailers like Old Navy adopting Bitcoin any time soon, and those of us who use Bitcoin for our daily needs &amp; depend on its usability and liquidity, Gyft is not merely a tool, but a lifeline.

Moms need "real world application" demonstrations to relate to. Here are some things I've done and experienced with Bitcoin as a Mom:
1. Last summer, I allowed my son to invest $50 of his savings and purchased 10 Bitcoin from us (value was around $8 at the time, so it was a small discount). We encouraged him to watch the markets and save, rather than spending that money. Today his savings is worth over $1k. And he is happily learning how good deferred gratification feels.
2. My brother recently went away for college. I set him up with a Blockchain wallet on his iPhone and can send him Bitcoin across the Pacific Ocean in seconds almost for free, saving both of us time, money, and hassle.
3. Shopping online with Bitcoin is by far the easiest way to pay for things. A quick scan of a QR code with my phone and its done and paid for. No worrying about balancing my checking account, pending transactions, extra sign-ins with verified by visa or MC, etc.
4. And finally, inflation inflation inflation. We see it fairly extremely in Hawaii. Hypothetical scenario that is pretty accurate: A gallon of milk cost $4.50 a year ago, now it's $5.99. I lost 25% purchasing power with USD, so now I can only buy a half gallon and a quart of milk for $4.50 (again hypothetical maths.) Had I bought 1 Bitcoin last year with that $4.50, today I'd be able to buy over 23 gallons of milk.
Those are solid experiences I have had personally with Bitcoin, that is not pie-in-the-sky shit. The rise in value over the 2 1/2 years that we have been invested in Bitcoin supports our family, pays our bills, and puts food on our table. If that is a small precursor to the potential of what Bitcoin can be in the future, there is nothing stupid about it.
@_date: 2013-08-02 06:47:50
Awesome! I promptly received a receipt upon purchase and a tracking number for shipping. Looking forward to receiving my matcha!
Also, not sure if this is just for Bitcoin specific customers, but shipping was free. Which is really a gift in and of itself for us in Hawaii, so thank you ;)

Just received my shipment! Placed order on a Sunday, and arrived today (Thursday), which is FAST considering I live in Hawaii. Looking forward to the official opening.
What I'd really like to see in the future is an auto-ship program where I can set a reoccurring shopping cart to be sent on a regular basis (monthly, bi-weekly, etc.). And with the release of v0.9, I definitely see this as a possibility. Good gawd that would make my life so easy :D
I know MNW has a sordid rep in the community, but I would say let the service speak for itself. These are the kind of businesses that the Bitcoin community needs to advocate if we want to thrive.

Who's spamming? My husband and I use Bitcoin to buy cool stuff and I am showcasing that. I additionally wish there were more vocal women out there to talk to about Bitcoin from my point of view as a consumer. I rarely bump into any.

It would be great to incorporate Web-of-Trust ratings from OTC as a flair of sorts and/or GPG verification. As OP states, trust really is everything in the Bitcoin community and WOT is a tried and true process.

This is very true. But living off Bitcoin is old hat! Lot's of people do it, it's not a new thing, and fairly easy to do. So I see this not as an "experiment" to see if it's possible (because it is) but a couple jumping at the chance to exploit a trend for monetary gain. Those who donated the project are naive in thinking that the Bitcoin community's best interests are being served. They can, and have every right to, spin their "experience" to however they see fit to promote their movie. Just like "Reality TV" does for ratings. And because we paid for the bill, they have nothing to lose!
For example, their main focus is to get local brick and mortar businesses to accept Bitcoin on their behalf. We all know that we aren't there quite yet in making Bitcoin an attractive option for retail, and for those not as tech savvy. That will just come off as a negative sticking point for those who are being introduced to Bitcoin for the first time with their film.
I used to live in the Orem/Provo area for many years, and the odd Mormon culture also has the potential to overshadow the content of their film. I love Mormons, I think they are nice people, but it will be extremely difficult for people to identify with them.
I REALLY do hope that they stay true to the essence of what Bitcoin stands for and promote the benefits of its use and adoption, but I will remain wary and unimpressed until the final product is released.

That's the myth I want to dispel. There already are MANY female-centric businesses out there that accept Bitcoin, I am in talks with many of them and plan on featuring their wares.

I've had the same funky glitches with my Coinbase wallet when trying to transfer coins out to my Blockchain wallet. It would remain in pending status for a few hours then disappear, but my balance would be re-credited. It took 3 tries, when finally the transfer went through, almost instantly actually...
Something I would keep in mind regarding support at Coinbase- Olaf is the ONLY support person there currently, with a user base of over 200,000. I know that doesn't make the trip any faster or easier, just offering some perspective. They have a good product and good intentions, just lots of growing pains IMO.

Cool, my field is IT as well, and as I mentioned elsewhere, my husband Phraust and I left our jobs to focus full-time on Bitcoin over a year ago. I've been closely involved with his efforts in mining, so I am very much aware of the technology behind Bitcoin. I feel that the technology has matured enough to a point that there needs to be a focus on the usability of the currency in the consumer markets. TheBitcoinWife is my fun, tongue-in-cheek contribution to demonstrate that there really is a lot of cool shit you can buy with Bitcoin. Accessibility in technology is everything, otherwise, what's the point in having nice things? Some people seek to be offended, others have a sense of humor and know when to laugh at themselves.

I cashed out my entire 401(k) last year to buy more Bitcoin and upgrade our FPGA mining rig to ASICs. At the time, it was a huge risk and a total ballsy move on our part. But it worked out REALLY well. That being said, the past isn't always an indication of the future and NO ONE in the Bitcoin-sphere (or this subreddit for that matter) can predict if it will pay off today like it has for people in the past. Only you and your wife can make that call for yourselves. Just make sure you make the decision together. You don't want to end up one of the dozens of divorcee's in this subreddit that lost their marriage over Bitcoin.

New technology can't be described with words, it has to be touched and experienced to understand its true value.
1. Set up a Blockchain wallet for them and throw a small amount of Bitcoin in there.
2. Let them watch the wallet and the markets for a while.
3. Point them to a trusted Bitcoin business with excellent customer service, and show them how to buy &lt;caramels, socks, soap, etc.&gt; with the Bitcoin you gave them.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
Not only will they be able to witness *possible* valuations of the coin you gave them, they will get to experience first-hand how ridiculously easy it is to shop with Bitcoin online. They may not want to invest after all is said and done, but they certainly won't be able to claim it's worth nothing.

I agree. BTC to Moneypak has been the most convenient solution, as specific merchant gift cards are less ideal for everyday use. We have used Gyft for Amazon, and it works extremely well. I really hope we get to enjoy a future where Bitcoin doesn't not have to use these intermediary crutches in order to be a viable alternative to the dollar.

I can't think of a single reason why she wouldn't want to be a step ahead of the game and cater to the quickly growing Bitcoin community.

I'll also be happy to purchase something from her store and write a review on my site.
