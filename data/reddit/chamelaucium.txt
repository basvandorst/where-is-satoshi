This one: 
Great to send to people who aren't familiar with bitcoin because he mostly speaks on how currency technology is so desperately due for an update.

So cool! I work at a plant store and often have customers looking for hanging wall planters like these. We don't have them in stock often, so I'll be sure to recommend her site!

I think older people have just had to live with the fed for a lot longer, haha. On a personal level my dad was definitely starting to feel like the only prospects for his retirement savings were depreciation (at best) or just losing it entirely to another crash, and he was disheartened because he couldn't see any other realistic solutions. I also think a lot of older generations couldn't conceive of a radical change in currency without it being an inherently violent one (I know I couldn't!). Bitcoin is really exciting because it restores hope, AND it simultaneously provides solutions for so many other people across the world. It's just a really cool thing to be a part of.

He's talking about his motorcycle. Idk, my dad likes to make up lingo on the fly.

Ha it just occurred to me how that comes off, but no. He's referring to his motorcycle.

Not sure where the one above is, but I know there's one in Liberties Parcel at 2nd and Brown.
