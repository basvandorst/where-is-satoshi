Go fuck yourself fucking troll. 
Their both corrupt. If you'd read what I said, I sent the wallet dat file to recovery services and they even state it's corrupt. 
QT on my machine fucked everything. Even on a fresh dat file, it fucking corrupted that shit too just downloading the Blockchain. 
How the fuck could someone manually corrupt their wallet? Just think about that stupidity you post. Unless I opened it in a god damn hex editor and start fucking smashing the keyboard, you can't manually corrupt it. 
Learn some reading comprehension you stupid fuck. No wonder no one likes this community. Because of fucking cunt faggots like you.

I had them backed up. I'm not stupid or a liar. I work as a network infrastructure engineer. This shit is easy enough that you don't have to know computers. 
When launching the program, it would state that the databases are corrupt. Replacing the dat file with my backed up dat file resulted in corruption of the backup file and even sending that dat file and any other copies I had to Dave were all corrupt. I had it saved two other places. A USB and elsewhere on the machine. 
I wiped out all traces of qt (not just uninstalling, deleting the folder fully) and while just updating it, it again stated that the databases were corrupt once it got to be about 2 weeks behind. 
Dave from wallet recovery knows the full story. He admits he has never seen this before.

Don't ask for upvotes.  It's one of the few rules of reddit and the admins are very serious about it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:25:58
Thanks. The thing is, I did have it backed up in 2 other locations. Those backups became corrupt by trying to load them via qt once it became corrupt. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:02:36
It is all of them. They were holding their bitcoins on an exchange. Even though the community CONSTANTLY tells everyone to specifically NOT do this. To use private wallets and paper wallets. Yet people still think "it will never happen to me." Well look what happened, dumbasses. 
As I said, their own negligence and I have no sympathy. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:37:05
This is the best option. You always get the dollar value back of the coin, not the exact coin amount. 
So if you buy something for 1 BTC and the price goes up and it's now worth .8 BTC, you'd get .8 BTC on the return.
You get the exact amount back that you put in based on current market prices. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:32:30

They were encrypted backups. I had a backup elsewhere on the same machine and on a USB.
I sent the backup off the USB to dave and that is the one he said was just destroyed. He sent me back a bunch of information with the hex information, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:05:15
I had backups. Loading them into the qt corrupted the backups....or they were already corrupt.

Alright I just sent myself .03BTC from my local wallet to my btc-e address.
You can see it there.
What are those other transactions it shows going to 25BTC and 2.4BTC and stuff? I have .005 already in there and it's still there that I sent myself around a month ago from coinbase. No idea what these other transactions are and it shows -0.005 but that 0.005 is still there?

It's not bruteforce. You can simply load in CD/DVD with a PE environment and there are plenty of tools at your disposal that will just find the registry key with the password and blow it out.

I'd debate this to say that the price fluctuation is more like a stock right now. It jumps to good news and falls to bad news. 
When the inflation rates calm down in the long run, then I'd say it's more like fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:36:02
I like blockchain because I can keep the wallet myself and have all the control. However, it seems like coinbase has the easiest way to quickly convert BTC into USD.
On Blockchain, how can you convert from BTC to USD? The only option I see, which is "bitstamp deposit" is to another site. Wouldn't that take time? If the BTC value skyrockets and I want to quickly get my money that day...coinbase seems to be the best choice?
Sorry if this seems stupid, learning a lot here. i currently have a coinbase and blockchain account. I have 0.00636761 BTC in the coinbase already.

I'm not asking how to hack at all. People were stating that you wait for 6 confirmations because that is the time before the transaction can be taken back. I assumed there was a way to do a "chargeback." I am 2 weeks into learning about BTC. This would be considered a noob question and you could have just answered it the way you did instead of starting off malicious.
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:35:44
Hey thanks! what do I DO NOW?!?
I think I'm getting the hang of it. Still confused if I need a wallet or not still if I have coinbase. I want to download my coins as a backup. Can that be done with coinbase?

Listen I'm an advocate for BTC but I don't think inflation can count. Even if the dollar loses 10% over the next 3 years. In 3 years, BTC could be gone completely. As in 100% inflation.

Gotcha. Thanks for the info.

I just signed up on coinbase and am all setup except buying any bitcoins. Do i still need a wallet? Where do I get my bitcoin "key" from on coinbase? I do not see it anywhere.
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:07:49
OK, I also signed up on blockchain. 
I like coinbase because it seems right away easy to convert to USD, so if I choose to pull out quickly, I can.
I like blockchain because I'm in control and nothing is stored anywhere except where I want to store it. However, it seems like in order to convert BTC to USD via blockchain, I have to also sign up on bitstamp and then transfer and then sell. How long does that transfer take? If I want to bail out in 1 day via blockchain, is that possible?
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:12:40
Thanks for all this info!
Someone sent me a tip on here. I can't seem to figure out how to get that tip into coinbase though. Will it only work with blockchain?
If I go to blockchain, how do I convert BTC into USD? I didn't see that option anywhere in their "demo wallet". If I take this seriously and it skyrockets again, I'd like to be able to get my money quickly at the price point it is at. Coinbase seems to be good for that.

Every time I make a transaction on blockchain, is that when I should do a backup? 
So blockchain does store all the info, you're only making a backup incase you want to upload your wallet somewhere else or if blockchain goes down, correct?
I have a coinbase account and I'd like to keep that strictly to buy and sell BTC. Is this a good idea? I'd only keep coinbase for buying/selling and would always transfer to my blockchain. Is this the right way to do it?
Is BitStamp the same thing as coinbase? Any reason maybe I should switch to bitstamp?
I started BTC yesterday, read about it for ~5 hours. Got 2 others to join in on it already. Just trying to REALLY understand the concepts so I maximize my efficiency and protect myself the best here. Also, so I can be knowledgeable and sell it to others.

@_date: 2013-11-13 16:31:08
Then how come the whole point of confirmed transactions is to ensure the person didn't take the money back?
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:19:53
So as long as I don't add my own keys, I should not need to backup. So addresses are in the wild and known all over. Keys being added is what's private and needs a backup. Got it. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:31:08
Gotcha. Thanks!
Large amounts of BTC is probably best for paper wallets then I am guessing?
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:00:55
Is it better or worse to download the entire blockchain? I made a "bitcoin address" on coinbase and am using that now on bitcoinget. Is this the same address I give out? It doesn't say if it is private or public.

I very much bet that I can remove any password on a non-encrypted drive. I will bet over $10,000 on it.
PE utilizing an MRI BDE environment with built-in tools. No brute-force, dictionary, or tables. It simply blows out the registry and Windows files in control of the passwords.
I have removed passwords from over 400 XP machines, over 300 Win7, and over 50 Win8. These numbers are very rough estimates.

@_date: 2013-10-30 21:31:19
I've been doing a ton of research. Just taking more time to REALLY learn it. Just iffy on a few topics, that i've posted here.
I've been watching for the last 2 days and reading any thread that is relevant. 
So my statement about blockchain containing all my data is correct, it's just that my backup protects me if it fails? So I don't need to keep doing a backup every time I make a transaction, just have backup copies that will always allow me back into my funds? So if I use bitcoin for a year and do not do a backup in that year and blockchain goes down, did I lose all those transactions in the last year or no, I am good, since I have the backup and the public keys are on public domain?

I sent myself some BTC from coinbase to blockchain. It is still pending. Why is this? This was hours ago.
Do I have to sign on to blockchain from the same machine every time, is that why it's not working?
EDIT: Just sent all of my BTC to my blockchain wallet and it all went through. The older one is still pending. Weird. It says it cancels after 24 hours though. There are no confirmations yet on the older one (been about 5 hours).

I am one of those people who want to make the effort. I am still skeptical of bitcoin because as of right now, it just acts as a wild stock. Regardless of how well it is doing, does not guarantee it will even be around in 10 years, or even a year. I do admit that it looks promising.
I'm currently looking for the best place to start learning it at and that will offer me the best knowledge. I am willing to start at $100 and start learning more about it from there. $100 is a sound investment for me so that if it's lost, that's ok. If it grows, that's ok as well.
How do I generate bitcoins beyond just buying it like a stock?
Is coinbase really the best place? They charge a 1% fee and apparently that is not the norm?
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:03:30
Yeah but tomorrow BTC could plummet to $1 or even more realistically, $500. $1 would still be guaranteed within a 5% margin of where it is now for at least the next 3 years. You can't guarantee that with BTC.
