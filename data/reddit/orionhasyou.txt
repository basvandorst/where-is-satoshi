This is the supplied workaround in case you want to apply it.
1. open Notepad
2. paste the following 
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
    "DisableATMFD"=dword:00000001
3. save as FontFix.reg to the desktop (make sure its not .txt)
4. save and double click the file and apply
5. Gild me  ;)
6. Restart

Dude I thought that, too. and is right. Me and a few people I know agree that this is exactly what mining is doing. Cracking SHA. There is no Satoshi. Just a huge NSA cracking grid.

Miami New Times and the internet. Ultra is the end of a 2 week festival. More events happening those 2 weeks than any other place in the country at any other time of the year.

uh oh, ITT: Miami people. I live here. I hate it. It's not like theres even a break in population. It's over populated if anything. And the City of Miami is still a slum surrounded by multi million $ business and apartment highrises. nothing is even open past 6.

Ive asked this before. With the NSA and their supposed ability to break encryptions and huge server farms, what exactly would happen? How much hashing power could the taxpayers actually bought the NSA?
