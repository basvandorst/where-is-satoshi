There are enough people outside our space who think it will go to zero. More than who think it will go to a million, simply because else it would be a lot more crowded in here.
Just one example: 
Another testament is the website with Bitcoin Obituaries. It has been declared dead more than 300 times by prominent people who thought it would die out and go to zero.
Needless to say, it became a meme.
Do not become biased by the limited amount of people in the cryptospace who might think it goes to a million. We are just a tiny minority compared to the people in the world. Even within the cryptospace itself a lot of people regard the bulls calling for a million crazy.

Bitcoin has been in a 10 year bull market. What are you talking about?
Its all about perspectives.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:09:11
Your second and last paragraphs are contradicting. You mention Bitcoin's only value is what the next person is willing to pay for it. Then in your third paragraph, you mention two additional and very important values of Bitcoin; decentralization and monetary aspects. Another one is souvereignty, uncensorability and unconfiscatability.
In today's world, such aspects are priceless and of astronomical value in my opinion. Value the Bitcoin network generates for every individual, no matter your religion, race, or gender. And that's why Bitcoin goes up the more governments or any other influential entity go against it. Getting rich is undoubtedly a nice and welcomed side effect in this process.

As long as the majority of the sheep herd is still dreaming away in fiat la-la-land and keeping faith in the dollar, they have nothing to fear... yet.
Their main task is keeping the herd together while they devalue the fiat currency. Meanwhile calling Bitcoin bad and for criminals. Add some money laundering, drugs trade and maybe even child porn allegations to the mix if needed. By the time the herd wisens up and sees through the lies, one satoshi reached par with one dollar and the sheep's fiat turned into toilet paper.
That's how they roll (no, not the toilet rolls). We are early adopters.

Funny how people think about their wealth first in the case of a Carrington Event. Don't you think we will have bigger issues if that were to happen? What do you think will happen to Nuclear Power Plant cooling systems all over the world?
Nuclear Power Plants need a lengthy shutdown procedure where the cooling system needs to be active long after the power plant has been shut down to prevent meltdowns in the still reactive power cores.
I don't think it matters whether we hold gold or BTC at that time.

I treat them like any other regular NPC in a computer game. Which means that apart from when they block my way, I don't regularly interact with them on any more meaningful level. The AI is usually pretty bad. They often fail at even just getting out of the way, which is a very basic task if you ask me.

Then you're in the wrong place. BTC is for the long haul.
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:14:11
Well, no, not really.
You can only really say it has gone up in value SO FAR. To draw the conclusion it will keep on doing that in the coming years, while logical in theory, is however a stretch. For one, it assumes demand stays the same or increases, and that part is not yet certain. Regulations or simple futures dumping might make Bitcoin look like an unattractive investment for the coming years, reducing demand. In that case new supply can reduce, but if the demand is not there it does not really matter.

On the blockchain. Probably cashed out for USD a long time ago. The guy running the infamous BTC-e exchange, for example, was suspect for laundering part of the stolen Mt. Gox BTC.
So yes, you could trace the Mt. Gox coins, but it will not be of any value because it ended up in user's wallets who used BTC-e at the time. It exited into USD and hence became untraceable from then on.
Hope that answers your question.

@_date: 2019-10-24 22:39:38
Disagreed. Bitcoin brings a whole slew of new things to the table Gold, or any other currently existing asset, does not have.
* Not confiscatable; thieves cannot easily take it away from you if you take the appropriate measures as Bitcoin has no physical presence. Governments same story. Technically a wallet can be carried in the brain.
* Trustless; Bitcoin solves the age old problem of having to trust a third party in dealing with transactions of any kind.
* Easily divisible; try chopping up your gold. Bitcoin can be divided into tiny parts called satoshis.
* Uncensorable; like you said, no monetary policy can prevent you from transmitting it across borders.
* Verifiable; everything can be audited on the blockchain. Before we had to, once again, trust third parties that the gold was actually there. We can also actually verify its scarcity. The supply of gold is unknown.
* Non-counterfeitable; you can counterfeit Gold to an extend by wrapping lead or another metal in a nice gold layer. This is the reason a gold dealer usually wants to refine the gold when you sell it, to check if he is actually getting solid gold. This leads to extra costs upon selling. A Bitcoin is a Bitcoin, there is no counterfeiting here.
In short, it is the best kind of money we have so far.

I don't care about all that political BS and stand above it. It is all a game played by the elites anyway to divide the masses. A very tiresome game with no winners. If you do not see that, you don't know how to turn things to your own advantage, which is only detrimental to yourself.
You need to take care of yourself in this world. There is no use in getting riled up for someone else's political BS agenda as that will leave you behind poor and get you nowhere. But hey, at least you can feel morally good, right? For what it's worth...
You can play the game to your advantage and get something out of it, or you can march with the sheeple in the political "jeux du jour". Your choice, but I know what I'm doing.

It could happen. You could also get an annoying guy you never asked for in your passenger seat claiming he made your car and wrote the whitepaper for it.
Lots of weird shit happens during forks.
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:57:31
Thats not how the halving works.
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:36:25
They already get excited about sub-1% moves in the metals markets. Such low volatility is good enough if you have a lot of it (think kilograms).
On the other hand; it is a store of value and regarding that it does what it says on the tin; it stores your value. Especially gold.
@_date: 2019-10-07 22:43:10
Its by design. Probably refers to McAfee's after he lost the bet.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:44:59
I think you're in the wrong sub.
@_date: 2019-10-19 22:10:09
Agreed on the last sentence. They'd have to get the Bitcoin from my cold dead hands.
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:36:16
I think we have bigger issues than the price of Bitcoin in that case. What use is having magic internet money when your ass is on fire due to scorching climate change?
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:33:59
What is this growth you are speaking of?
I still remember 10k.

No condoms. Hit or miss.
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:59:13
Nope. Its "vires in numeris" now. Strength in numbers.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:53:18
Thats why its called the halvening; the price gets cut in half, because the new supply gets cut in half too. Makes sense right?
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:35:29
Bitcoin or Shitcoin!

He survived the 2018 bear market. That's what it does to you. Notice how he keeps the paw on the coin? This cat is a hodler. No whale touches this cat's stack. He is PTSD about it and harpoons whales on first sight, good or bad. No fucking around here.

So far it seems they do

I'm here for the tech.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:52:21
And a bad one at that.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:32:44
Aside from the fact that all options except C are debt, and hence not money.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:55:39
5k seems more reasonable than 100k.

Scalper's heaven.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:29:58
Possible, but then it would have had  in that dialog.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:59:58
Thats right; its never a wrong time to buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:56:44
Much automate, very wow.
@_date: 2019-10-28 23:43:19
If only we had that...
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:27:46
I can already see the goblins hopping around down there.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:41:58
Agreed. I think the biggest hurdle for Bitcoin is that it requires some form of intelligence to understand it's significance. And that's where it goes wrong.
All the masses care about is *herp derp* ease of use. Give them ease of use and they will give up their privacy without looking.
That way Bitcoin will remain in that nerd corner of the internet while the wolfs once again slaughter the naive sheep.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:48:41
Are you that old guy saying BTC is going to zero?
@_date: 2019-10-19 22:03:15
Wrong. If you invested $1 in gold in 1785, you'd have no nickel today as you'd be dead as a rock. You'd be layin in your cheapskate wooden coffin with folded empty hands while some other fella is spending your hard earned gold.
True on the Bitcoin part tho.
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:14:19
As is quantum cryptography.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:26:24
Same here...

Corporations ALREADY control governments. Its just not so visible yet for the average proletarian as it is hidden behind smokescreens of illusionary democracy.
@_date: 2019-10-10 23:06:23
And then bring a big chunk to the taxman.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:22:39
That's not moon. That's another planet.
I do hope that will be the endgame though.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:04:59
I ain't fly no plane.
@_date: 2019-06-24 08:31:56
Lol this discussion is absolutely going nowhere.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:28:22
The majority of the people are normies for a reason; they don't spend time to learn or either plainly could not care less. As long as it fulfills the purpose they intend to use it for, it will be good enough.
The biggest hurdle for Bitcoin is that it assumes some level of intelligence by its users to understand it's significance. If a centralized solution comes along that effectively does the same and also claims to be similar, people will accept it and hurr durr that Bitcoin is useless now. No one is *actually* going to read whitepapers in that target group.
We are the nerds on the fringes of the internet.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:30:33
Uhu, that's what you and me know, yet the average pleb will say its a blockchain and that Bitcoin is now useless. They don't have the brain capacity to differentiate between centralized and decentralized or what's a blockchain and what is not.
The average normie is not even able to recognize the difference between a traditional bank account and cryptocurrency because "its all digital".

Must be a blast to be on the same table after the next stock market collapse. I would not touch it with a ten feet pole right now, prices are way too high.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:21:06
You lucky bastard.
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:19:07
Correct. Fiat drove out gold in the 70s with Nixon's abolishment of the gold standard.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:54:36
Yes, it is one giant descending triangle.
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:43:34
At least he can get steamrolled and try it. With BTC its not possible at all as there's no physical form.

Lol, the space is still very small dude. Look outside your bubble.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:33:28
No one cares. We are going down.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:02:31
Wait a little longer so we are only up 90% this year?
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:30:02
We're due for a dump because you sold? Sound logic.
@_date: 2019-12-09 08:16:35
Sounds like you made it in life. I am jealous.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:31:14
Do you own Bitcoin (BTC) or "Bitcoin" (BCH) or perhaps even "Bitcoin" (BSV)?
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:23:57
There is always "more fucked up". Doesn't mean "less fucked up" isn't fucked up.

That's impossible.
I am never wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:14:29
Sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:24:49
Funny thing is that slowly but surely we get all the same traditional BS like in the old systems; paying extra for services.
Soon there is no real advantage to using BTC over, say, western union to send money.
Must be nice to be creating your own market; we require KYC and if you don't want it, you pay for it.
@_date: 2019-12-17 07:19:56
But they sure as hell experienced the losses. :)

It probably was in 1969. We had some decades of inflation since.
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:47:46
Or we just suddenly dump with a huge darth maul candle.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:53:13
Ah yes, the PhD fallacy. One of the properties of the traditional system is that it is made to sound complicated on purpose. This makes one think a PhD is needed, but it is actually simple logic if only it was written in layman's terms.
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:31:10
Alles ist vorbei!
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:45:57


Thats what layer 2 solutions are for; to make it faster. The problem Bitcoin solves however is not speed, but security and decentralization. You cannot solve all parts of the blockchain trilemma. Speed goes at the cost of security and decentralization and vice versa.
Centralization in China is only temporary because they now happen to have the newest hardware.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:59:20
Store of value is one of the evolutionary stages on the way to becoming a currency though. Look up the lindy effect.
When something becomes a store of value first, it creates a more stable price which is desirable for use as a currency. We are hence on the right way.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:38:05
There are no other options. That is the whole reason Bitcoin is here. Before, we had no options. Our destiny was to go under with the current system. Bitcoin is a lifeboat.
@_date: 2019-12-07 10:05:48
He is still thinking.
He probably missed the boat and now it has to be dirty.
@_date: 2019-06-18 15:08:40
Whats the court ruling on Craig btw? He stood trial yesterday right? I am a bit out of the loop.
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:08:27
I said nothing about "the world". Of course there are genuinely complex things. I just said that finance is unnecessarily complex. It is on purpose so that the common man has a hard time understanding what is actually going on.
If you think about it logically, it makes sense from the perspective of an elite group wanting to stay in power.

It's hard to be clever in a world full of naive or plain stupid people. You see things you do not wish to see, while if you were just one of the stupid ones, you could remain blissful in your ignorance and ride off the cliff with the rest.
It's scary, yet oh so real.

Or the proof that he doesn't exist, depending how you look at it.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:46:17
Wrong. We are losing money with bank accounts on a frequent basis. Examples:
- Inflation devalues the currency you are holding in the bank.
- Negative interest rates on your savings.
- Nowadays you have costs for even having an account at a bank. Costs for holding a debit card, etc.
- Some banks have withdrawal or deposit costs these days if you use cash. Or you cannot withdraw at all or only up until a limit.
- Most banks have outrageous costs for transferring money across borders. Bitcoin only has a neglegible miner fee, which keeps incentive to secure the network.
Bitcoin fixes all of the above.
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:33:39
I think its a picture of the Central Bank of Zimbabwe.

Until its "monetized" it is kind of an investment though.

Sell it and rebuy on an exchange for 10k I would say. Arbitraging like a boss.

Some of the former conspiracy stories turned out to be true, so yeah, certainly possible.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:15:15
Plot twist; BTC was created by the USA as the new world order money.
Badum tssss.
The lack of resistance from the US and members of the senate actually "liking" Bitcoin during the Libra talks was also a peculiar thing to see. I think if I was (part of) the elite and had a failing system to replace, I would let some clever engineers create something new under a pseudonym and let the peasantry promote it by word of mouth.

@_date: 2019-09-29 19:31:02
People are willing to put money into an investment that's possibly not profitable for decades (stock market), so I guess spring next year is not a bad proposal.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:37:13
Seems they think they have to store actual physical coins. Would love to see the look on their faces when they find out it's a virtual currency and it all fits inside a hardware wallet the size of a thumb.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:42:38
The US targeting Bitcoin will confirm its use case; people will see the importance of an unconfiscatable currency and cash out their dollars into BTC.

It feels like I'm in but this really is the Bitcoin sub. What gives?
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:35:47
Indeed. Strangers on the internet are in fact very reliable.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:48:25
Never knew what the deal with that overhyped post was. Such posts are posted in the Bitcoin subs pretty much everyday.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:53:07
Ah, so its value is based on fear. That's like I am a drug cartel and print my own currency and people having to pay protection money to me to stay alive in this currency.
Well, it is a business model of course where you create artificial value. A pretty malicious one though, not based on scarcity, but based on fear. If it wasn't for that government of yours I could just shoot a deer and live a happy life without working and ever needing a currency.
And having better quality food at that! Also being more environmentally sustainable because I don't need my food hauled over from I don't know where... I don't need a car to go to a remote place called work just to sit on a chair for 8 hours a day (something I don't really need to go there for, you can do it at home if you want to). It is a ridiculously convoluted system we created, while in the end all we need to do is the same; live, eat, sleep and take a dump.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:57:12
How about 7k?

Yup, never underestimate a man with nothing to lose.
@_date: 2019-09-22 06:05:55
People go wild over shitcoins because they can be very profitable for a few users (majority loses). They are even talking about a new so-called "altcoin season".
