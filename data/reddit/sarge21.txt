You're basically saying "The apocalypse can happen so I'm willing to accept huge risk because it's entertaining". Not a convincing defense of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:40:47
You're defending bitcoin over fiat by saying the risk of losing all your savings is fun
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:48:58
Well your choices are to attempt to educate people to mitigate that risk, accept the risk, or stop using bitcoin.

This thread is about a leaked MTGOX database.
beetlejuicier's post was about downvoting anything MTGOX related. 
These are two different discussions, which are not relevant to each other, and which both happen to involve MTGOX.

Bitcoin, the technical marvel of future currency (its only weakness is stupid people and banks)

I don't believe that is based on evidence

Perhaps Bitcoins and altcoins respond to something in common which affects their value.

There is no guarantee that it will retain its current value.  That is the point.  That it has increased in the past is irrelevant to those who do not own it already

Bitcoin isn't the idea.  It's the implementation of an idea.  It can fail.

No,  I was giving an example of safer investments in which people invest more than they are willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:02:20
The market cap of bitcoin right now is ~6 billion dollars as far as I know.  If bitcoin were to go up 1000% per year for 5 years, that market cap would be 600 trillion dollars, or more wealth than there is in the entire world, and that accounts only for bitcoins currently available.

Traders can only take your money when you buy, not when you sell.  When you sell, you are taking their money.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:47:51
The price went up in the past so therefore it's a good store of value? That misses the point.

Lots of people buying and selling creates a liquid market.  I don't understand how this could be considered a bad thing.
If you're against selling at any particular price point because it will end up higher in the future, you should be buying at that price point.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:05:27


Just because something went up, doesn't mean buying it was a good decision at the time.  Sometimes poor decisions pay out, and sometimes good decisions don't.  
People are driving up the price of bitcoin only because they expect the price to be driven up.

Shouldn't you be concerned with the actual value of bitcoin (what you can buy with it)?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:34:20
What point of mine are you addressing? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:42:29


There would be no way to make that decision knowing the information we had today.
For example, lottery tickets are universally considered a bad investment.  However, in retrospect they are a great investment because you know the winning numbers.  Do you see what I am saying?

No it won't. Provide evidence that it will happen.
At 1000% per year, after five years the bitcoins currently in circulation would be worth more than the current total wealth of the entire world.

By what definition did I define a good store of value?  The question of "why is bitcoin a reliable store of value?" was put forward and you answered with something that doesn't imply that it's a reliable store of value.


It's been extremely volatile in the past and has lost 1/3 of its value in a month.  What will its value be in another month?  Why should I trust that my value will be retained, when that has not been shown to occur?


Yeah, its future value is almost nearly certain and almost completely reliable, unlike bitcoin.
