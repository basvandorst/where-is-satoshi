The capital cost of POS is greater than mining in POW network. However, mining also has a variable cost of electricity and maintenance, which is the reason why the miners are selling cheap now, it is really difficult to get any profitability from S7 Antminer at current prices, so the investment is apparently greater than $500.

So is it about having a decentralised exchange for BTC or use other exchanges like Cex, Kraken etc.

If only, would it!

That is definitely comforting, now all I have to do is learn computer coding then understand the source code of bisq. probably in 2 to 3 years expect a fork of bisq.

Yes, it is a proven model but is it the ultimate model. POS, DPOS, POA are well written algorithms which address some of the limitation and cons of POW.

I would rather not shop with BTC in such high price fluctuations.

Again having a foolproof system in a decentralized exchange is something that doesn't look quite happening soon. 
Another thing why are we paying trade fee of .001btc for every 1 BTC traded. It just doesn't make any sense.

 I don't see how it is any different then POW mining. The rich can afford the most hashing power and get richer.  Plus the rich can afford to open up mining operations in places with cheap electricity.  Poor people don't even have the option to do that. If anything, proof of stake is MORE fair.

I will definitely try to consider your request :D
