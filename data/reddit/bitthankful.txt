Thanks for this. I was very skeptical about bitcoin at first but with a little open mindedness and by having the chance to get a thorough explanation with live examples from my son was very convincing. I'm sure he'll be fine and I'm confident that whatever he gets out of this will be worth the effort. 
As of precautions, I've talked with my son about why some "business models" in the bitcoin world don't sound sustainable and how others are just too risky. Aside of that, I'm embracing the fact that with bitcoin he's getting a chance to experience financial freedom first hand. And all that in en environment that could be described as an online wild west. 
Overall, he's mostly enjoying learning, being part of the community and buying stuff with his own money rather than trying to profit. It's funny how bitcoin as a hobby can be rewarding.

Oh man... Bitcoin related products and services created by fintech startups or even hobbyists are making money seem fun again. It takes some effort to understand what you're doing at first but the flexibility of "programmable money" is simply amazing. 
The one thing I like most is the blockchain. The applications such a robust public ledger could have in the real world sound very exciting.

I agree for the most part. Another thing is that our success story is very case specific. Bitcoin was a great fit by several means. Best thing for me though is that I can enjoy meaningful discussions with my son about topics we're both interested in. I doubt I would have been here posting this in the first place if that wasn't the case.
