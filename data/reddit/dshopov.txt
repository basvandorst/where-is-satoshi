What bothers me is that zanetackett stopped responding ... this is never a good sign

Basically they have "implemented" a new fiat currency and we are just the sheep who use it :)
Now they have all the ingredients to print money

Here is one:
Hackers are usually people who know what they are doing. What do you think will happen if you give them a clue about who is after them ? :)

Have anyone noticed how suddenly service monitoring stopped at 
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:24:01
Yep, and on top of that it is like 1.xW of power consumption and no mater what they say I am running mine from my computer's USB 24/7 for more than an  year now (so basically free)

Save yourself some $$$ by buying a raspberry pi with 128G sdcard. Its silent and can be powered by an usb charger
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:14:26
Still cannot login, clef should be removed from the page if it is not working .... right now I cannot even log in with password because: "Too many failed Logins from your IP. Retry later or contact Support."
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:21:37
You can always sync it somewhere else and copy the data dir. It is generally not a good idea to do the sync directly on the SD Card (life expectancy and such)

So You are saying that being 73 (instead of 23) will make any difference ? :)

I am not sure you understand how exchanges work.
Let me clarify: What you see on a webpage is what they have in a database somewhere. This database have nothing to do with the actual bitcoin wallet balance. When you trade / loan the database gets updated, not the wallet! This is done in order to save A LOT of spam transactions that will only lead to A LOT of fees for the exchange, also to provide you with all that clicky things you see on the webpage (+ a lot more stuff like micro transactions in bitcoin myth) . Imagine that you had to wait for 60+ minutes for every trade you made ... this is why they keep the balance they think you have in a database and not touching the wallets until someone deposit / withdraw. 
Hacked wallets have nothing to do with what you see in a webpage (exchange). The webpage (exchange) use its own database to track who have what part from overall balance. The whole "every user have its own multi-sig wallet" only makes things harder to trace. By the time they trace all the addresses the hacker(s) will be long gone with the coins. +1 for cold wallets

Sorry zane, it is just paranoia :)
I love to see graphs moving indicating that some action is being taken. Maybe the team forgot about that monitoring while moving into the new location. nvm we are all just stressed after what happened with gox

40370, hoping I am not too late :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:18:05
NO WAY!
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:09:27
Every Friday ... $10 ... every currency I am interested in ... that's about how I do it. Otherwise you will just keep on wondering
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:03:24
And we see how this works right ? We have a split in the community
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:14:55
Its already proving that bitcoin cannot even be attacked from the inside :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:23:14
Not really. Developers nowadays need to swallow their pride and think of how to give everyone a choice just like Satoshi did with his original idea .... yeah he failed to predict the centralization but let's hope he choose his successors correctly
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:17:40
That is because we lost bitcoin when the first pool appeared.
Centralization will be the doom of bitcoin and that is what Satoshi failed to predict.
Currently only few people have a saying on what the network should be the rest of us can just watch and pray
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:07:46
The same people who couldn't agree on what should be done and brought us to a split (forks forks forks)
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:08:40
Well users actually are powerless ... how many users have their own wallets and what should they do when the network is already switched to the new code ?
What should happen in my opinion is that those BIPs remain BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement **Proposals**) and everyone should have a vote if a BIP should be activated / deactivated on later stage.
If everyone have a say in the matter we wont split because of different opinions.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:17:41
Yep. Thank you all EXCEPT Gavin
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:18:17
There is another "freedom the protocol" thingy called setban - 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:08:07
Its only natural ... 8k monitors are just around the corner
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:58:55
They will have a vote on BIPs which are created by people who knows what they are doing. If the BIP is activated or not will be voted for real and not just some imaginary voting systems that just say when they will be activate (not if ... like it happened with segwit and 2mb that leaded to a fork). Currently LN have limitations if not under segwit and asicboost is not working under segwit ... well if the community discard either the rest should follow as they all had the chance to cast their vote and not just make yet another fork with little to no support ... if we continue like this we will destroy ourselves 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:34:07
Well that's the million dollar question that developers should ask themselves instead of beating themselves in the chests trying to show who has the bigger ePeen. If they don't try ... well bitcoin future is clear: endless forks until nothing remains
