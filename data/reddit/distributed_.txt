Couldn't have said it better.

Pieter Wuille is one of the coolest guys around.

I'm not believing anyone claiming to be Satoshi until they can sign with his PGP key.
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:09:45
Absurd. Good luck seizing my Bitcoin.

I want Elon Musk to share his views on Bitcoin, he probably thinks it's awesome.
@_date: 2015-05-15 05:07:23
Still, throwing this in at the end doesn't exactly do justice to it's significance.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:09:08
A perfect example of what Bitcoin enables. Love it.
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:41:26
Right, and that's a terrifying thought. But holding private keys is far more discrete than a bag full of cash.

What are your thoughts on Mike Hearn's quitting and claiming bitcoin is a failed experiment? Are you worried about the tensions within the community?

How is scanning a QR, typing a number, and hitting "send" too complicated for the average individual?
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:37:45
In a time when rappers run technology companies it wouldn't surprise me.
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:56:07
Well I understand where you're coming from but its dangerous to try to define who's good enough to vote. That's led to some nasty things.
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:52:27
That's awesome, I'm going to make one of those :)

90% of the population doesn't understand everything about politics. Doesn't mean they shouldn't read about the issues and vote in elections.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:06:00
My reaction exactly
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:07:12
TechCrunch said between 500-600k 
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:28:58
Yeah I'm for that. And there is no such thing as an enlightened dictator. Every human is subject to human tendencies, which is why dictatorships always go wrong. But I'm all for systems that don't require a dictator, like bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:09:23
Yeah I agree, especially because I believe they had raised as much as $2 million.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:48:52
I disagree. I find that if you can approach the topic in the right way, you can grab the interest of many people.
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:24:01
Guys, it's not about the price. Don't tell people to "buy in", get people to understand bitcoin's potential as a technology. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:36:33
This is meaningless.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:25:59
Good riddance 
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:48:30
I definitely know what you mean, one thing I tell people is that they can save 20% on Amazon with Purse and Starbucks with Fold.
@_date: 2016-05-03 01:06:08
I honestly can't remember the last time I laughed as hard as I did just now.
