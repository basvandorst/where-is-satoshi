Tried it a couple months ago. You can't use any wallet, you have to download an app that requires your ssn and other personal info. The attendant had no idea about any of it.

It provides a lot of freedoms other technologies don't. I am regularly impressed by nuances of the network's designs and how people build on it. Anyone can contribute, and the mining incentive model drives innovation to improve instead of destroy. The development ethos has stayed consistent as well

I wonder how a company like Binance manages access to the receiving address(es).

I think it's easy to see free speech as only being exercised by people you disagree with. The people you agree with are just being "normal".
