All orgs involved in strategically "interesting" security should've assumed complicit, in any country that has intelligence agencies The way it works is that the agencies approach the company, bind them under national security to not say anything to the n OK z, then make them an "offer they can't refuse".  For example, "we'll make you the top dog in your industry, if you add this spyware for us.". They probably play hardball if you try to refuse, too. 
Long story short: it's not secure unless it's open source, you formally audit the source code, and compile it yourself.  That includes the compiler, the OS, the BIOS, and the hardware chips etc.
Yes, security is hard.

The best thing about having anonymous hackers accepted as commonplace is that government agents love anonymity.

"much better"
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:18:09
You're thinking of waypoints on a journey.  As far as I can tell, checkpoints in this context simply refer to hitting number divisible by 100.  Nothing in forex suggests that you can't rise to 100 (or 500, or 7300, or whatever), then fall, then rise to the same point again.  I'm asking if bitcoin is different, and if so, SPECIFICALLY how it's different.  Vague analogies won't cut it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:56:22
There's no guarantee of stability long-term, either.  For all anyone knows, someone could release a much better system than bitcoin tomorrow, and bitcoin could keep declining every single day after that.

Yep.  Good luck suddenly depositing $50k in your bank account that previously hovered at $5k, with no questions asked.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:28:13
The same is true of all money though.  The only reason physical currency has value is that you expect to be able to trade it for other things in future.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:55:18
Unless they want it to happen.  For example, China is very anti-bitcoin.  Maybe that means the US sees a way to destabilise China's economy using bitcoin.  Wars have been fought to protect currency value, so a bit of intrigue and passing simple laws isn't unthinkable.

It's actually bitcoin inflation, due to bitcoin mining scarcity.

Authentication is a different issue, though.  There are many ways to solve that, according to how much you care about it being scam-proof.  Note that even in the real world, though, there's no such thing as 100% scam-proof. id fraud happens, as part of an arms race of sorts.

To be fair, it's a virtual token that has no intrinsic value, and which people used to generate in hours.  Saying that's REALLY worth $4k or more doesn't make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:52:27


I'm no expert, but I think you're confusing currency with the economy that uses the currency.  The Bitcoin community, and the value of the coins, includes both: the currency, how it's created, the economy built around it, etc.
For example, bitcoin (probably) could have been set up so that everyone on a network gets an even share of newly generated coins, so that generating coins was a public good and not just a greedy act, and that everyone would share in the "wealth" equally.  Instead, it follows quite a different model, where the people in first become super-rich, and the people who hear about it or get involved later become "the poor", so to speak.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:50:38
Not sure about where you are, but pretty much everywhere I've seen bitcoin for sale, it's at an ATM, or some other place with security cameras watching you.  I think I saw ONE or TWO exceptions.  Extreme caution is warranted if attempting to evade taxes.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:00:40
The site has lots of scams though, apparently.  So that's three places, none in the regional capital, all pretty far away, where I can trade cash for btc, and 1 out of the 3 or more might be scams or worse.  Just saying... that's pretty slim pickings.  AND if there are so few, they'd be easily monitored, assuming they're not entrapment operations to begin with.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:38:12


Good point.  It would still be much more balanced, but you're right that would still be a huge problem, either way.

Not following.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:03:09
I don't know.  What if all users got a small fixed rate, and early adopters mined, but most of the money went into an escrow account, to pay out other users later?  It would encourage and accelerate adoption equally, but by promising new users payouts when the mining is getting harder, rather than giving big payouts to the already passionate initial users, who'd likely stick around for other reasons (like believing in and developing for the platform) anyway.
There must be a way, if only through digital contracts built on a blockchain, rather than directly creating something like bitcoin.

Double the coins, more value, but on one blockchain, you'll have less value than on the other, depending on which blockchain most people prefer after the fork.

You ASSUME it's designed as a tool of subversion.  For all I know, one or more governments invented it to get everyone away from cash onto a fully recorded financial system. Who knows?

I've had more trouble than use out of hardware GPG cards in the past.  Can Trezor be backed up (or are you just relying on the device never failing)?  Is the code open source, in they stop making new driver/software releases for Linux, for example?

As they have every right to do, if they've earned that cash, and it can sustain them in future without additional work. Forcing inflation is simply a way to make people keep working for thier masters, even if they've already worked enough for their own needs.
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:48:33
The fact that it worked out OK doesn't negate that it was an idiotic risk to take.

That's true.  However, whilst still limited to a few businesses, then a lot like cash, at some point, it has to turn into real money and go through the banking system (which monitors everyone's transactions a lot more than most people realise).
I agree though: once an entire "closed loop" of business can be conducted via bitcoin (say: one guy farming and selling his goods for bitcoin, then using that bitcoin to rent a server that some colo company has, whilst the colo company also pays for its utilities (broadband, electric, rent) in bitcoin), then there's a good chance.
However, even then, all of these companies would need to be very careful about anonymising their wallet use via vpn+tor or something, and keeping those anonymouse wallets entirely separate from their other business/private wallets.  That is... as far as I understand bitcoin anonymity, which isn't very far ;)
Tricky business.  And bear in mind that while all that is happening (and especially IF that happens more and more), government will be upping its game in regards to analysing and monitoring transactions.
There's a reason they have the saying that two things are CERTAIN in life: death and taxes.

Yeah, I know.  I was thinking of localbitcoins.com.  Most of the offerings there seem to compromise your anonymity in one way or another.  Then again, I live in Belfast, which is a smallish city on a smallish island --- I assume places like NYC have more "flexible" options, on that site or otherwise ;)

No, bitcoin is a scheme for making new elites.  You're thinking of blockchain.
