Here is what you do, use steganography. Give them part of the key with spaces in it. Then later on give them the other half so when you overlay the plates together you get the final full key. Also would help if you obscure it in some way like in a picture.

Not to mention the TBs of data that everyone would have to store. All clients would have to download the entire gitchain, and what would be the incentive to waste all the storage space and bandwidth. Also what would prevent someone from truncating the chain as soon as you got the next commit?

This might be true but if he want to really show his support for bitcoin he should start accepting it as another form of payment now. This will help contribute to the overall usefulness and awareness of bitcoin. Sitting back and saying I wish someone would so something about the bitcoin thing is not good enough. He should take action and encourage others to as well.

Actually the hash is given in Hex so the possible letters are 0-9, A-F. But otherwise yeah it's still quite high.

I'm sorry if this gets downvoted like crazy but it was pretty obvious that it was a scam. Why would a $100k machine do 275 GH/s but a top secret "Google" version do 6.4x more for half the price. Plus seriously the RAM is the limiting factor. LOL I cannot see why papamoi didn't recognize this as a scam.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:08:43
Nope. The only way that would happen is if say the medical research happened to need sha256 hashing, or if miners decided to donate a portion of their processing power to crunch medial info, forfeiting a portion of their profits.

You are screwed if you didn't backup the wallet.dat The nature of bitcoin makes it impossible to recover coins if you lose your private key. And when I say impossible I mean there is not a single person on this planet that can recover it.

But a currency isn't really a currency if you convert it before use.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:39:50
Easiest method would be to convert it back to BTC then either transfer them somewhere else without easier cashout methods, or try and sell them directly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:18:05
I was thinking the same thing. If only I had some dollars lying around :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:21:19
If it hits $12 a coin i will be buying a few. Otherwise mining for me. I was just hoping the complexity would drop :(
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:08:55
No I say it like we need to stop thinking of it terms of How many USD/EUR is it worth if we ever want it to be considered a currency.
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:19:45
Like this idea better. Accept donations, and just put it as a game. Maybe a small payout from donations, but required buy doesn't seem like a good idea.

All I have found so are is this on the home page:
&lt;!-- I imagine that right now you are feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole... --&gt;
Reference to matrix. Don't know how it ties in though.

Sorry for reposting this, was just trying to do market research, and google yielded nothing of use, also I was looking for the more technical aspect of it as in will blocks still be generated, just no reward for the blocks.

Your coins are not worthless. They have the same value as they do now. 1 BTC (if you say have 1 BTC in your wallet), will be worth 1 BTC 5, 10, 100 years from now.

Run your wallet in an encrypted VM running linux with nothing but the wallet software with an encrypted wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:54:54
Why yes you can. Go hit up ebay and pay 4x the current value. Otherwise no.

They sit in the wallets that are lost and remain unmoved forever.

Right here :) Watching this subreddit is the most fun I've had in a while.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:45:22
Quick google search revealed [this]( Don't know how relevant it is, but hey
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:04:35
You are assuming that it will not recover.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:36:13
Love the idea, do you accept steam codes?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:02:10
That is the best advice around. I think I will take it and disregard you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:42:17
Correct me if I am wrong but can't you claim the code on your account then gift it to your buyer?
**Edit quick google search reveals that this cannot be done. So yes I see the problem here. Seems like no steam games :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:29:25
Sorry that should have been subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:21:57
First post. Seriously?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:19:19
Step 4: realize you got screwed because you paid about 1.8x the actual market price.

Best you can achieve is 4 bitcoin per month. [source](
