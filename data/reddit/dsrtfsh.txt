Congrats.

Big money is trying hard to enter bitcoin. They can’t find enough supply globally. I spoke to a broker stuck with $30 million  of his clients money with no supply of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:46
There is barley any supply. I know brokers waiting to buy and can’t find supply.

I do not see any roller coaster shit happening!

Great job. Entertaining too. If only we can get the community to do visual animation to run while you talk.

I saw it too. Looks like a scam or a scam in the process. Too good to be true type of returns.

Excellent work. You can teach the young dudes here 
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:05:34
Their influence to bitcoin price will be to zero.

Do you mean trade.

What is this a country?

I do not care about opinions. I made great profit great. I sold everything. Now I simply wait till the fundamentals give signal. Now it's clear. Fundamentals are being manipulated. Let the dust settle what could you possibly lose.

Seatbelt on. Smile ready:)

He is not asking for much. Seems like another day another quick robbery.

All roads will lead to bitcoins. Time will tell. No other currency make sense as much as bitcoin.

Anyone noticed the tits strategically placed at the end of the article. They know their readers. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:04:48
Yes you should.

Volume is too low. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:24:19
Any argument against bitcoin would offer the same with the USD. These idiots are words for hire. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:42:31
If your watching every minute and concerned, sell and take your money. This is not for you.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:54:22
If you really want to know and prepare your tax obligations then go here and do it.  no excuses.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:41:14
It’s a form of payment. Good to have in your mix of investment. Remember tally sticks was the currency to have in its days. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:20:10
It's a correction. No fear. We still in huge bull market.
