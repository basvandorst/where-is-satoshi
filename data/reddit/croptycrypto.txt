The key point here is that nobody knows what’s going to happen with bitcoin. So, just like everyone else, he’s willing to take some risk and expose himself, enough that he thinks he’ll convert well if it does well, but similarly enough that if it performs poorly, he’s isolated enough that it was a shot at something promising but he wasn’t burnt.

Well, Bitcoin isn’t A PoS, nor is BIP system if I recall.  It takes some arbitrary but valuable percentage of community votes to pass a BIP.  My point is that despite my belief that bitcoin can reach like $20-$50 thou per, I do not believe that Bitcoin will hold market majority forever because asic mining is bound by Moore’s law ATEOD and its less efficient.  I think ultimately 10-20 years out people will use bitcoin out of the fact that it is a mature and developed technology but it will not be alternative number one.  It will be an even more fascinating world if i am wrong though because it means Moore’s law did not set before us a ceiling, but a roof-hatch.

Fundamentals means look to basic micro-economic theory. In bitcoin, the Supply curve is a straight vertical line. Demand curve is a negatively sloped vertical line with a high x-intercept. If you decrease the supply of bitcoin, which means you move the supply curve vertical line to the left, it intersects with the demand line at a higher point. The Y axis represents Price, the X axis represents quantity. Here is an infographic:

The concept of Intrinsic value is an intermediate step towards creating loyalty to a system.  The true value of bitcoin lies in the group’s loyalty to bitcoin as a system, because of what it enables us to do.  Bitcoin didn’t matter when nobody valued it.  Now it has value because people value it.  Thus the only “true value” is the groups collective psychological loyalty to that system of value. That true value can be seen as the number of units in the system.  So if we don’t actually need the intrinsic value system (gold, sha256 hash work energy expenditure) because we’ve defined “true value” as opposed to intrinsic value as our committed loyalty to said system, then proof of stake seeks to establish a system on true value.  We saw the same thing happen when we left the gold standard.  It’s more efficient than asic mining, it’s all we need as abstract thinking Homo sapiens.

@_date: 2017-11-09 02:31:50
Tell me what you can do with a sha256 hash that doesn’t require abstract thinking and I’ll concede to you that a sha256 hash has true value.  But otherwise sha256 is just a bootstrapping for the real lightshow. “true value” is just some fraction of the agreed upon supply which is the summation of all arbitrary fractionings; the supply or any fraction thereof doesn’t need to exist physically in the external world it simply needs to be “known”.  Every money supply we have ever created has been a bootstrap to get our brains to (1) accept the concept of a fraction (2) accept the concept of some finite supply.

Lightning network is a definitely a good idea; the majority of people only need to transact with people nearby them, so basically cities could act as payment channel subnetworks.  I’ll have to look into atomic swaps more, thanks for that.  Be careful saying that mining will become irrelevant, because don’t forget mining is the only way bitcoin exists.  If there’s nobody’s to mine blocks then there is no bitcoin.  
It will definitely be interesting to see how it all plays out: platforms offering improved blockchain design iterations / smart-contracts-as-a-forethought will have to compete with the fact that bitcoin got the product to market before everybody.

@_date: 2017-11-08 17:24:54
Because this is not the only way to address transactional throughput, they did not go through the Standard hard-fork proposal process for bitcoin known as BIP, and the only upsides of this fork serve miners/businesses.  A lot of people are going to get hurt due to this fork.  Segwit2x did not implement replay attacks which essentially says the users of bitcoin do not get a choice of join segwit2x. Alternate solutions for transaction flux improvement are still being discussed, one of which is lightning network. This is happening because businesses want to grow bitcoin at a non-organic rate.  Doesn’t that sound like businesses to you?

Yeah, we left the gold standard in the Nixon era.  The stock market actually rose during that time, contrary to common expectation.  It worked out decently enough.

Filtering out the borderline ad dictionarium, You’re being purposefully obtuse if you believe that “losing everything” is a good advertisement for caring at all about bitcoin, from the perspective of the proverbial layperson, who’s net interest and cognitive devotion to understanding bitcoin amounts to not much more than maybe a few conversations over coffee with friends about “unscrupulous fake internet money” and the net perspective that it’s not going to be important. 
If I were a financial adviser and I lead with the line “but don’t trust me, the stock market has crashed seven times” I wouldn’t be in business for very long.

Remember, OP. There are ~8 billion people on Earth. There are on the order of (accurately) 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Bitcoin addresses. Divide that number by even 100 billion. That will give you “how many BTC accounts are available per ~tenth of a person.” Accounts are handed out with random distribution. The math will hash out to show that there’s a like 1 in 10^68 ish chance that they’ll find an existing address (I.e. yours). I could be off by like 19 numbers on that magnitude, and we’d still have, like, an indistinguishable amount of privacy buffer between accounts. That’s an unfathomably small probability. It’s functionally 0 for our scale of reality.

You’re not understanding that personal attacks are not a foundation for an argument in this case. The topic wasn’t the nature of Roger Ver’s character, and whether he’s a paragon of justice or a total scumbag. It was whether Bitcoin Core had failed and Bitcoin Cash was the “true bitcoin” because it achieves a faster transaction rate. Fundamentally, there’s no success thing as “well he’s a scumbag” playing into the clearly technical discussion at hand. If you want a conversation about Roger Ver’s and whether he’s a good person, you should set that up, but that’s not Alex Jones’s topic.

There was a severe lack of well constructed questions. Instead they were just personal attacks on Roger that were kind of ad hominem and pointless. So fucking what if he got arrested for selling firecrackers. Is that really the best way to point out the fact that scaling a distributed  ledger by increasing the block size is a poor decision? If you can’t recognize the failure in basic reasoning, how can you expect to think properly about anything?

If “the narrative I want to push” as it were doesn’t jive with you, you’re outside of reality. I dislike Roger Ver and everything he does. That doesn’t change the facts: this convo with Alex wasn’t about Roger Ver’s character. Then again Alex Jones is an entertainer or a crazy person, so truth be told the conversation doesn’t actually matter for the advancement of humanity.

I believe Bitcoin is actually kinda a shitcoin (gasp) from the perspective that there are far better ways to conduct blockchain systems where operational costs are not $300,000/hour (POW for you). Just because all the weight is behind POW doesn’t mean it’s the best solution. I will still have to look for those papers though, I’m interested.  Blockchain must be held to the same standard of technological advancement as the internet or cellphones.  The new Natural selection.

Definitely correct on the importance of permission-less digital gold, however the p2p aspect is valuable for individuals in developing countries, where legacy banking systems do not operate with the same amount of societal benefit as when they were introduced in first-world countries (back when they were the developing ones! if you think about it, that's why we had centralized banks in the first place; decentralized-p2p wasn't an option before 1970).  Bitcoin promises to invite the financially disenfranchised of South America/Central America/Northern Africa to the global economic table.
Cardano, Ethereum, Ripple, NEO, and other BlockChain2.0 platforms promise to bring "smart-contracts" to this entire system, so that not only can we have p2p permissionless transactions, but we can also tell a stories with each transaction that possess important details for regulatory/financial institutions, AS WELL AS set up identity-based systems of chain reactions. From the user perspective, all future transaction inputs become as simple as (1) your ability and desire to execute the transaction and (2) your biometric signature. That means (1) buying a car (2) buying a house (3) getting a loan (4) getting insurance, etc. are all streamlined to wanting/affording to transact for these things and proving that you are who you are--just once.

All right say we are at 12.5 coins per block with the difficulty of X. Let’s say we Updated bitcoin core to a system where we produce 6.25 coins per block And the difficulty Was reset to be X/2. Say that X/2 difficulty is an equilibrium point now, where the current number of miners doesn’t give the difficulty any extra upward momentum. In essence we have kept the rate of bitcoin added to the system constant because The system produces twice as many blocks as before with half as much bitcoin in each block. 12.5/X = (6.25/(X/2))

I find this mindset dangerous, but maybe I am missing data.  IMO, Bitcoin's last hope for relevance through 2020 is the Lightning Network team, who are also trying to introduce Discrete Logic Contracts for smart contracts.  And the community can't even fully rally behind them.  Ford's Model T was revolutionary, but it was by no means the ceiling on automotive innovation.  Ethereum was the first crypto idea reinforcing that same notion.  To ignore any valuable cryptocurrency platform is to ignore value itself.
also it depends on what way "X way" is.  If it goes to shit because of transactional overload, the economic theory of substitute markets applies, meaning the top crypto-dog with high transaction throughput gets a large infusion of customers.  sitting asleep at the wheel is how the 2008 financial collapse happened.  Wouldn't it be so ironic if people in bitcoin fell asleep at the wheel because they though it was a done deal in a dynamic ever-shifting universe?

*Do your research* 
If you don't have a CS background, get one. In fact, get any semblance of a decent education in the crypto field. There's a breadth of online courses to get you there. Go to coursera's princeton course on Crypto currencies. 
 Anything you don't understand, research it on youtube. People think computer science is this great big chasm reserved for guys who are good at math and had no friends in highschool but the fact is its just thinking and anbody can think.
 
Otherwise, *don't even bother with crypto.*

Wait till it drops back below 6000, put your $500 down, and then invest another 1/10th of your income monthly in cryptos.  Also, as with all tech, cryptocurrency is an eco-system.  Don't discount the other cryptos just because Bitcoin has 56% market share. Apple once fought for even 3% market share.  If you want particulars to investigate: Ethereum (obviously), Cardano, NEO, Cosmos/Polkadot.

This isn’t an answer to my question, unfortunately, maybe I should clarify. “Average rate of new bitcoins released PER UNIT TIME remains constant”: please see that rate of bitcoins released per unit time is a function with inputs
 (a) difficulty to produce a block (measured in avg unit of time) and
 (b) amount of bitcoin rewarded per block (measured in BTC).  
Please recognize that these are related inversely, such that avg bitcoin produced per unit time is equal to BTC per block / difficulty to mine block per unit time.  Thus if we lower both factors proportionally, we get the same average amount of bitcoin produced per unit time.  this would accelerate the rate of new blocks produced per unit time, which means we get a higher transaction speed.  while holding average amount of bitcoin constant.
The only question is “can system consensus scale with this strategy?”  Is consensus based on inter-node network speeds?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:59:41
Thanks for the article.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:43:31
While simultaneously decreasing the amount of bitcoin per block proportionally so that we aren’t accelerating the rate at which we get to all bitcoins mined.

But how are you going to support your argument? Where is your proof? It’s far more effective to highlight the conceptual issues of a runaway blocksize than speculatively point a finger at coincidental events and shout, “Correlation! Villainy!” It’s like Milo Yiannopolous says: “the best way to refute someone’s platform is to give it the full radition of the spotlight.” I don’t necessarily always agree with what Milo says or who he is, but that’s quite the poignant point.

Eh, I would argue that just because rent paid remains constant regardless of proof implementation (everybody will continue to barrel their computers away at full speed) doesn’t mean value vs. rent remains constant too.  Proof of Stake offers a greater transactional processing rate than proof of work.  If consumed power remained constant then at least we’re extracting a greater transaction rate. Cardano offers a proof of stake algorithm which guards against grinding.  Lightning networks will work because a single actor in bitcoin doesn’t need to transact typically with more than his local surroundings.  There will be a whole crypto ecosystem; not just a single, Sauronic coin.

Your strategy should really be to research alternative cryptocurrency developers, such as the aforementioned. Your intent should be to understand (1) the platform they are designing, (2) what makes that platform unique and valuable in the future, and (3) decide if that idea is worth investing in.  If you can't understand the computer science behind these different platforms, (a) educate yourself in the aspects of their platform which you don't understand, (b) get nerdy friends who will walk you through it slowly, (c) don't invest if you really can't wrap your head around it.
