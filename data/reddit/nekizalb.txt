 will do it.

This is the same thing I feel. It's difficult to error check when you have literally no way of narrowing down what is right or wrong. I realize that's part of the game, but it gets frustrating going over the same questions over and over, second guessing yourself each time...
Side note: I'm going to hate this Clym person more and more each week..... Your =/= you're, and given I'm pretty sure the misspelling of rhyme was significant in the first quiz, other grammatical errors are not cool... =(
Also, appears the first quiz has been solved...
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:39:02
I'd like to request a few clarifications. Please answer any you feel appropriate to clarify without ruining the quiz =)
Section 2: are we answering with city names or countries?  
Section 4, question 4: first letter of surname, i assume?  
Section 4, questions 7 and 12: cased on shown on screen or as names are conventionally cased?  
Section 4, questions 6: Does number plate refer to the license plate, or to numbers ON the license plate?  
Section 4, question 10: whhaaaaaaa?
I also have lots of WTFs in regard to Clym's Riddle, but i suspect there's little clarification that can be made without giving the clues away. ;)
Thanks! These are fun!

2.5 weeks with no claim. Do you think we'll see any new information soon?
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:39:17
great! I'm excited for the information.
I also wanted to add one more clarification request on 4.5. can you clarify casing? generally last letters would be lower case, but the onscreen presentation of the company name is written upper case style, but smaller than the first letter, which can indicate lowercase...
@_date: 2014-05-06 04:02:30
some deeper research revealed the more likely butterfly candidate. =)
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:32:38
Yeah, that's what I'm trying but apparently I'm missing something on one of these.
I'm having a good time trying to figure it out though!
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:55:51
Just to be sure, did you deem these questions didn't need any help, or will we not see an update till the weekend? Just want to make sure I understand your intentions =)
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:45:34
I've given up on this. This is how far I got, in case it helps anyone else still trying this puzzle... I'm stumped
I know something is wrong in it, because I've bruteforced the ?s, but no dice. Hopefully this helps someone else think of a question different, but without new information, I'm done.
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:17:22
I believe there should be 51. 
 lists the valid WIFs in numerical order. It's smallest value starts at 51 characters long
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:12:57
Any chance clues 6 and 9 in section 2 got mixed up? From my research, the animal in 6 doesn't have a number in it's name, but 9 does. Just checking! 
Thanks again for posting these. These clues as a whole seem much more solid than last weeks. I'm finding myself not having to question myself nearly as much. Thanks for taking the extra time to improve!

Outlook also won't mark an email as read until you unselect it, by default. So you can be reading an email and have it disappear right before your eyes. Very irritating.
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:59:24
I was more concerned with 6, but I appreciate the confirmation =)
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:22:29
I look forward to the next quiz. This one is kicking my butt... I have something wrong, but can't seem to talk myself out of many of them... 
When will the next be posted?
@_date: 2014-04-24 04:47:15
Do you know who section 2, character 8 is? Just curious if you brute forced it or knew...
also, thanks for posting this =)
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:52:30
There is a bot downvoting comments in There are several threads floating around about it...
Edit: 36 seconds for this one...
@_date: 2014-04-15 04:41:23
This is as far as I've gotten... ? being characters I really don't know and a couple characters that i've narrowed down, but am not sure of. 
section 1:
  
    JZLRiWDnVsQ  
         ST
section 2:  
    n9HZa1L?BpVK
section 3:  
    EAFRLHDjhW8Y
section 4:  
    eWEDUSP3sbbnGPx  
     S K
Unfortunately, I've bruteforced every possibility filling in the blanks, which means one of the other answers is wrong. I'm stuck on which one though, maybe someone else has ideas? (though given the age of this post, I'm sure few will find it... =(  )
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:44:21
Nice work! I have an old laptop mounted on my wall that I set up the port forwarding to today. Its been running my wallet for some time and now it's contributing back. It's not the greatest, but every bit helps!
@_date: 2014-04-20 00:04:15
That makes much more sense. Thanks
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:26:51
Do you intend to release additional hints as time goes on if the prize goes unclaimed? Currently, if you miss a single question, you're screwed but have no real way to narrow it down (other than your own confidence in your answers). Any plans to increase our ability to error check ourselves? (Maybe something like giving us the SHA256 of each section?)
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:55:48
If anyone is stuck and would like to collaborate, I'm all for it. Just PM me. I'm pretty confident on my of my answers with only these left open:
section 3:3,5,11,12 (6 and 7 I have AN answer, but not 100% on it. Same with 1 and 2. Basically only 4, 8,9,10 are set in stone)  
Section 4: 5,6,10
Additionally, any hints willing to be given are happily accepted ;)
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:20:16
Yeah, definitely. Clym needs to take a trip back to grammar school for sure.  
Section three last two lines I read as 10 is the Sam as eight, and the last two (11,12) are the same thing. Now, they are either the same as 10, or it has something, somehow, to do with the hand counting nonsense.
4.4 same concern. I've been trying both names just on case  
4.5 yup. Included both the manufacturer and the companies. Casing isn't specific either  
4.14/15 the answer is two characters and I took the reversed ordering of the questions to mean reverse the answer as well. I'd much prefer the question be worded like section 1 however
Edit: formatting to fix phone
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:27:56
The &amp; is an invalid character. Need something else there...
Your key is also 1 character too long...
I got n for section 2, question 1 ([ned](
@_date: 2014-04-24 04:44:32
The rhyme! I went with the missing H in rymes, not the present Y.... FOILED
Well played Well played. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:02:38
That's where I got too. Still waiting to see where I went wrong. :)
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:02:28
Last week's proved too difficult for me. Onto this one!
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:52:59
Generally a good idea to double check your own post for errors when pointing out those of others.
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:22:13
I love that a bot just provided the smart-ass answer to this post.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:47:42
Is there actually any math out there that implies an even (or near even) distribution of keys to addresses?   
 
The pigeonhole principle guarantees that one address has two or more keys, but gives us nothing about the distribution, right?
