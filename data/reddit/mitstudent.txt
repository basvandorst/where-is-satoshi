I think it's just $10,000,000 is the cap for the input field.  So, if the amount you are purchasing is more than that amount, then it just shows 0.  So, the max number of coins change not because the size of their hot wallet is changing, but because the price of bitcoin is changing.

ahh i see yeah i was gonna say it takes a while to get the confirmations...
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:35:45
how long does it take for the payment to process?

but given the total quantity of bitcoins in circulation, this explanation doesn't seem likely.  unless someone bought out Dell and Newegg entirely with just bitcoin or something of that scale.
