HTTPS isn't secure against people who can sign certificates with a trusted root key or have the server's keys. Maybe a global adversary that already has /dev/rand backdoored can protect their backdoor by eavesdropping on the connection. Maybe some exploit can weaken your local randomness somehow and add that to knowing random.org's keys and you can use it to steal your money. Maybe a targeted attack on a user who is on Tor or behind a company network that SSLstrips without validating the certs, or a rogue WiFi hotspot at a Bitcoin convention.
There's probably a million other things that I'm not smart enough to consider, so it's better to just play it safe and when you're generating secret keys you simply don't use input from anyone at all ever, specially not a secret generating service that has a huge fucking bullseye painted on it.

That's the attack vector, if they do know some of your original string then they can shape the thing you XOR it with to keep the output looking random while drastically reducing the keyspace.
This is the problem with Linux XORing RdRand in rather than hashing it in, because the chip probably knows the input and has direct influence over the mix-in then the output is probably asynchronously backdoored by NSA.

Form factor aside my laptop is a very powerful computer, it has as many cores and as much RAM as the SQL servers I work with, it run VPS images with multiple web servers and services, cut down virtual network infrastructure for a project. If I was working on a network simulation project then it could be running hundreds of virtual switches and routers with full BPG routing tables. But in this new world it would be unable to run a Bitcoin node, and that is a problem.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:09:46
Unless of course someone has information about the state of the phone and can MITM the connection so the XOR reduces the randomness somehow. I can't think of a way that could happen, but that's the problem, it introduces complexity and unknowns, one piece of complexity caused this code to fail in production.
Local noise like an SHA256 hash of an image from the camera (thermal noise), some noise from the mic, the accelerometer, the compass, even global variables like the current date and time are far less risky than trusting an external third party and everyone on the journey to them.

You can't deny that it would move the blockchain off of consumer hardware and on to servers. If you want several terrabytes of storage space then your best option is to go with one of the few cloud providers out there who dominate the market. That smells like centralization to me.

In such a system you wouldn't even need proof of work, you could run the whole thing on some other algorithm, say, each node gets to generate X number of blocks in T time. The decentralized ledger just solves a many-to-many organization problem where all trusted parties are on equal footing rather than being locked in to a major player's technology stack.

I'm not directly arguing against the increase, it may well be the network's best option, but we must recognise that it comes at the expense of accessibility. 20MB blocks will mean that I can't host a full node on my laptop machine, I don't want any spinning rust in my machine and I don't want the block chain to take up my full terrabyte of SSD. How can we expect innovation in the developing world if a rich Westerner who spends $2k+ every couple of years can't casually run it on their hardware? Whichever way you look at it that is a real problem.
I'd personally prefer some kind of growth calculation built in to the protocol that gradually increases the network's capability but does so slowly enough so that it also increases its accessibility to all. We can tweak the calculations in response to the world's economic conditions and advances in technology, the aim should be for the barrier to entry to be lowering in real terms over time.

Validating blocks already takes a lot of hard CPU work. Uploading and downloading blocks already takes a lot of bandwidth. Running a full node already takes a lot of disk space. Increasing block sizes will put more pressure on all of these.

Meh. The attack is almost small enough to be considered a hobby project, possibly a commercial endeavour. It's unlikely to be a state attack, I mean, you do know what military intelligence and cyberwarfare outfits are capable of, right?

That's an ugly way of solving the problem, rather than fixing the bandwidth over what's probably a shared Internet connection it would make more sense to implement some form of QoS or make it back off to 80% of whatever the detected limit is.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:51:42
Oh yeah I'm not opposed to the button per se, I meant the way that it works. The detection thing is the hard part, it's a difficult problem that requires a novel solution, one that most p2p software hasn't already solved.

Sure you can do that, but what happens if the company that is holding your bitcoins gets hacked, goes bust, gets shut down for a lengthy criminal investigation, the CEO runs off with all the money, corrupt DEA agents steal everything or the exchanger decides that you're a fraud risk and puts a hold on your account indefinitely? All these things have happened multiple times in the past so the general consensus is that you're better off being in direct control of your keys.
@_date: 2015-04-01 01:10:11
No, you can actually encode data into the block chain by sending coins to unspendable addresses. For an example just run `strings` on the data files, there are a bunch of messages in there.
@_date: 2015-04-11 19:15:48
When the message "the parameter is incorrect" bubbles up to the surface it's usually in response to some sort of disk problem. Could be permissions in the filesystem, a damaged file or something more serious like your disk drive is about to pop. 
Just in case this turns out to be a cryptic apocalyptic prophecy make sure you have backups of your stuff. And also if Armory has a way to reverify the blockchain files do that, or move and download them again or something (after backing everything up!)

He's wrong, the US or British government could utterly destroy Bitcoin if they wanted to and it wouldn't cost them any more billions because they have already bought the infrastructure to do so. They have wire access to most of the Internet, have influenced trade bodies to insert flaws in most of our protocols, have backdoored most of our hardware, have root access to most of our software, they have more PhDs than CERN and can cut through our software like a hot knife through butter. On top of that they have real flesh and blood spies and the support of law enforcement if need be.
If a state cyberwarfare programme can destroy Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities then it would be unwise to bet that they couldn't do the same for Bitcoin, we're talking very powerful adversaries here.

This gives me an idea. A year or so ago Money Saving Expert did a mass-switch of energy providers in the UK to get the best deal, the savings were incredible.

No need for a centralized source outside of OpenStreetMap if that's what you mean. Anyone can invent a new bitcoin attribute that is a `last_confirmed` timestamp or similar, anyone with an account can then update that timestamp including websites that have API keys. It doesn't matter who confirms it as long as someone updates the timestamp in OSM's database. 
Of course it would be nice if that was integrated into coinmap so coinmap's account updates the timestamp in response to input from users, but it's not strictly necessary.

Because if NSA want all the traffic they can just DDoS the sites and they'll inevitably move to DDoS protection that is already compromised. Given what we know from the Snowden leaks CloudFlare are compromised, and if I was over at NSA running a project to keep an eye on the Bitcoin infrastructure a DDoS combined with compromised market leading DDoS protection is the lowest of the hanging fruit. You don't need a tinfoil hat to see how obvious it is.
