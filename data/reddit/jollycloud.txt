This is a prime example of why Bitcoin will never become mainstream.
There has to be a way to make victims whole in certain circumstances. The answer can't be as simple as "No options, sorry. Try not to make the same mistake in the future." 
Most people don't want to "be their own bank".  When shit goes wrong (like theft or fraud) people look for someone to make it right.
Not saying you're doing this OP, but I see it time and time again

See the part in my post where I specifically say "in certain circumstances".  
Certainly your bank wont replace cash you lose if you leave your wallet on the subway.  However...
\- If your bank information is compromised and someone attempts to withdraw your money (very similar to what happened to OP), the bank will credit your account.
\- If your debit card is lost or stolen and it gets used fraudulently, the bank will credit your account.  
\- If you write a check and that check gets "washed" and addressed to someone else, the bank will credit your account.

I said this back in January or February when the price was about $3500.

100% this. I deal with similar scams everyday. If the grammar is questionable, and if they ever use the word "kind" or "kindly", it is almost guaranteed to be a scam.
