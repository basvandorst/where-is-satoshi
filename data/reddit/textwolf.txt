Robin Hood was robbing tax collectors collecting taxes believed to be abusive to the people, not random rich folks.

if you don't mind me asking what exchanges/coins have you moved on to since coinbase?

I've never had an issue with coinbase like I did with kraken... what have you experienced with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:50:48
:/ Well, here's to not running into those problems as bad as Kraken hit me...
Agreed that the fees are high and using coinbase's interface is awful to try to receive coins. Gdax is a bit better but still annoying...

Do you have an alternative recommendation to purchase coins with USD if not coinbase?

You forgot you're on reddit, where even the libertarians have forgotten that taxation is theft.

I judge that the majority is misused, especially considering the deficit spending nature of the government. It's easy to agree to spend fucktons of money when its repayment can be relegated to the unborn's tax dollars.

It's the same reason certain sports players think they're justified for kneeling for the national anthem: they have grievances with whatever they perceive the government or community is doing and wish to not support it in one way or another.

Seriously the amount of pro-government sweep the evils under the carpet sentiment here is really depressing. bitcoin really has become a much bigger tent.

The US taxes people even if they aren't citizens, if you do business with entities based in the US.

Curious where you're getting this idea as I'm a mid-20's American and nobody I know uses checks willingly except my grandparents and relatives who are 60+. The only time I've ever used a check is to pay for a car repair where the bill was more than I had available on my debit card.
