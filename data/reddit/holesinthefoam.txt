Coinbase does that because they like to float the cash. They're making tons money on the cash by holding it up before funding accounts, paying out, etc. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:32:54
No it's not. ACH is virtually instant. Transactions usually only take a day to complete, even on weekends. The problem is that banks don't post them to accounts right away. They like to hold up the funds, and float them so they can make money on it before giving it to you.

I have been doing this pretty much for the last year or so. I'm trading forex (low-risk grid trading) with part of my bitcoin stash, then pay myself a "salary" that my gf and I live off of from a portion of the profits, which I convert to Euros with a debit card. Works like a charm. 
All you need is a good debit card that doesn't rape you on ATM and currency exchange fees, an exchange that doesn't rape you on fees (I'm using limit orders to sell on Gdax, fees are next to nothing) and you're all set. It's quite doable as long as you manage your costs, and budget wisely according to what your BTC stash is. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:02:41


Again... waaaaaaa!! :D
Nobody cares what you want. You don't even have to pay high fees if you're not an idiot and know how to set fees lower in exchange for waiting a bit longer for confirmation. I just did a substantial BTC transaction two days ago and it cost me a whole 45 cents and took a whole 3 hours to confirm. It was nothing special. So seriously, quit whining like a bitch because you don't even know how to manage fees. And again, segwit and LN will both be getting adopted in due time. The reason it hasn't happened sooner is because of the impending S2X clusterfuck which just got called off. What, you don't think that developers had a lot of shit to deal with because of that?


Yes, they are, and it's happening faster and wider each and every day. And guess what, they're not whining like you are about fees. :D


Again, nobody gives a flying fuck about what you want. BTC is not some company that is here to serve you, you self-important douchebag. Grow the fuck up, and understand the game you're in. And for fuck's sake learn how to use a wallet that allows you to set your own fees, you're embarrassing yourself out here with your endless whining. 


Waaaaaaaaaa... geez, what a fucking baby you are. :D

Thanks for the lecture Dad. 
The fact that you have no BTC means you have no skin in the game. Therefore, you're nothing more than a lame-ass armchair quarterback, trying to shower insights to the rest of us who aren't as enlightened as you.

@_date: 2017-11-14 16:17:03


It is what it is. People are paying $2 for a transaction all day long and have no problem doing it. It's only insane FUDDY whiners like you who are complaining about fees. 
 


Compared to what? Paying $20 for WU? Paying $25 for a wire transfer via a bank that will take 24-48 hours if not more to arrive to the receiving account? You have no fucking idea of what you're talking about, dolt. BTC gives people the ability to be fully in control of their money without it getting eaten alive by inflation and being subject to bank manipulation. It gives people who maximize its usage complete financial autonomy and independence from bullshit fiat. And yet... you whine about fees. :D 


Hey meatstick, I'm in Thailand right now. The minimum wage here is less than $10 a day (300 baht). Do you know how many Thais use and save with BTC? Rest assured, it's a growing number.  People buy BTC via their fucking smartphones and/or via LocalBitcoins day in and day out, and funny how they manage to survive just fine with fees. There are plenty of developments that will continue lowering fees and speeding up transactions. Stop your endless whining and buy some fucking clues.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:28:46
It's just a bit more complicated than that. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:53:49
BTW, I'm a BTC/forex trader. The broker I use wasn't even going to release BCH to anyone who kept BTC in their trading accounts post-fork. Enough people complained and threatened them with legal action that they relented and basically gave everyone their BCH and put them in their own separate sub-account. They did this simply because they understood how badly they would be exposed legally if someone were to take them to court on this issue in either the US or EU.

@_date: 2017-11-11 07:32:28
It's an attack on BTC. Get a fucking clue. Quit whining about confirmations and be smart with your transactions when shit like this happens. This reaction is exactly what the idiots trying to fuck up BTC want. This shit goes with the territory of BTC being a decentralized, trustless property. Developers will continually find ways to improve and optimize BTC as we go along. Unfortunately, they had to focus a lot of time and energy on the bullshit S2X upgrade, which now isn't even going to happen. Stop being part of the problem, and start being part of the solution. If all you can do is whine and complain, then do us all a favor and sell your BTC. You can whine and complain later when you've realized that you've missed the boat because of this stupidity and self-important-ness that you're displaying now. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:17:29
Explain my point to a clearly uninformed dolt? Yeah right.

@_date: 2017-11-13 11:38:28
Once the mempool clears up, fees will go back to normal. The BCH assholes and their ilk are spamming the mempool to keep things like this. There are plenty of updates coming including Segwit which is live and slowly getting adopted, along with Lightning Network which will improve things significantly for smaller transactions. In the meantime, stay calm, and be selective about your transactions. If you need to do a transaction quickly, use a wallet that gives you the option set a lower fee, and then use a transaction acceleration service such as ConfirmTX (google it) and they'll set you up. Just whining and complaining won't do anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:18:56
You call this a dip?? :D
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:23:08
Uh, no. Funny how BTC worked just fine for me during that "peak" period when the mempool was almost 180k and everyone thought the world was imploding. Sure, the transaction I did on Saturday took a bit longer than normal to confirm (about 6-7 hours for the 1st), but it got to the payee just fine and it cost me a whole .000457 BTC to send (about $3). Imagine that.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:12
Short it all now. Please. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:20:20


There will always be parties trying to fuck shit up, hello??? 
BTC has faced all kinds of hurdles, roadblocks and obstacles in its 9 years of existence thus far. Every single time, it comes out stronger and more resilient than ever. If it was as weak and fragile as many have purported it to be, it would have crashed and burned LONG ago. So really, give everything that's been built thus far some credit, will ya?


Newsflash: adoption is already here. It's happening on such a steep curve that it's blowing everybody's fucking minds. It's no long a matter of IF people will get BTC en masse, it's now a matter of WHEN and how much. Keep up.  


Any losses wouldn't hit the entire market, it would most affect the people directly associated with any exchange's failure. Mt. Gox's implosion didn't destroy BTC, and if you look at the data, BTC's price and volume recovered pretty fucking fast after the meltdown. That alone should tell you something about BTC's resilience. You can also rest assured that BTC is FAR more resilient to exchange meltdowns than it was during the Mt. Gox years. 


You're worrying too much about the wrong shit. FUD has been plaguing BTC since 2009. In fact I didn't get into BTC the first time I read up on it back in 2010 because of the wide misinformation and fear that people had of it and where whining about daily. And yeah, I kick myself every time I think about it. 
Yet,  despite all that, BTC did just fine and thrived despite all the anti-rhetoric and FUD that was being pounded on it on a daily basis. This ecosystem, luckily has withstood tons of destructive attempts, hacking, forks, altcoin hype, and whatever else has been thrown at it to get to this point. It didn't even break a sweat. And yet, you worry so much about the ecosystem because of wariness about tether?? Dude, chill the fuck out. 


As if you/we have any power or control over what BTC does. :D 
Newsflash: BTC is growing and expanding on its own. It can no longer be ignored, or denied. Especially with all the growth happening, and its very clear future prospects. All that is going to happen no matter what you or I do. Stop worrying so much about BTC's fragility, and worrying about potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities and points of failure. Really, none of that shit helps even remotely. 
 


Well, you sound pretty fearful to me, almost to the point where you're losing sleep over this. Good that you haven't sold out. Now, just buck the fuck up, and don't give in to all the FUD. Because honestly, you're worrying WAY too much about nothing. :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:48:13
Yep, thanks for proving to me that you have no idea what game you're in. My advice? Sell your BTC and stick to fiat. It's not worth it to you anymore. Don't worry, it still is to people who get it, and there are more and more of those people coming aboard every single day. And yes, it's a revolution, too bad you don't get that, and it's happening with or without you. For a lot of people, including myself, BTC has been nothing short of a motherfucking game changer. 
And btw, BTC's value is not determined by whether people "spend" it or not. It gets its value from being a truly deflationary asset class and store of value. With innovations and technology that are literally just around the corner (LN and RSK for two, and Segwit, which is already here and in early adoption stage), it will become more of a currency while STILL being a prime asset class. BTC isn't driving anyone away, except of course the greedy idiots who think that some altcoin is going to be "next big thing". And you know what? Good riddance. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:11

It's not my duty to enlighten someone who can't even bother to learn how to the minimal basics about futures contracts before coming on this sub and posting his "concerns" about a topic he knows nothing about. I'll gladly debate with facts and relevant data when I can see that someone at least knows something about what they're debating, if I have the time.

If it's a prepaid debit card, then you won't need to worry about bank oversight all that much. If the card has its own IBAN, and the fees aren't too horrible, not much to worry about. 
And the whales aren't stupid. They don't just cash out their BTC to fiat, they only convert whatever fiat they need to cash (if necessary) to complete a particular transaction. Again, it makes absolutely no sense to cash out to fiat just to let it sit in a bank account. Stop thinking that way, and you'll figure the rest out.

The idiots at BCH realized that it was unsustainable. The miners were churning out empty blocks and coins at such a high rate that it was creating artificial inflation, valuation issues, among other things. If they had been mining at the rate that they're doing now since the beginning, they'd be in a better place now. But no, because of stupidity and arrogance, they're in a world of shit. BTC on the other hand, weathered the low-hash periods intact and came out of it better than before. And now with Segwit being adopted, Jihan's ASIC mining advantage becomes a thing of the past.

Not much anyone can do, really. It will just need to play itself out. Their goal is to create fud and panic. If people don't react, logic dictates they'll eventually give up. Consider this: pretty much every time this kind of thing has been attempted over the past couple of years, BTC's price has just gone up overall. 
If you need to clear a transaction fast, keep the fee as low as possible (within reason) using your wallet's fee selector and use a transaction accelerator, a good one to use is Confirmtx, google them. Also check for he was offering to boost transactions yesterday on this sub in exchange for a strictly optional tip. Spread the word, and let other people know about these options.

Yeah, the US and EU are going to "ban" Bitcoin. Especially when Wall St decides to get in the game. And the "drugs" excuse won't fly, considering that the banking sector has more to do with money laundering for the cartels than Bitcoin ever will. Gonna have to do better than that. Give into the FUD that Bitcoin stands on a precipice to the point that you think you need to "cash out" to fiat, and you'll be playing right into the forces who want to play you like a fiddle.

This only means that you have the rather lame mentality that if you can't buy a coffee with BTC for a  super-cheap fee, then using it is expensive. Hey, I already knew you didn't get it before, you just double-confirmed to me with that idiotic statement. :)
 


I've stated facts. And at this point it's quite the fact that you're pathetic. Why's that so hard to get? You just don't get it because you want to insist that fees are high during this particular mempool issue, without wanting to understand the big picture.

You don't need to cash out thousands of dollars at a time. Hello??? My gf cashes out to a prepaid debit card that has its own IBAN. Piece of cake. For any major purchases, there are now ways to pay via btc directly or through an escrow service that takes the BTC from you and submits the fiat value to the seller. Stop thinking in the old paradigm and thinking that you need to deal with banks when you don't, there are tons of other options that don't involve banks at all, and more come down the pike almost on a daily basis.

File a claim and see it through, they're counting on you not taking any action. Once you have an official complaint filed, they'll probably pay you back and make it go away. 
FWIW, you're better off with a straight-up prepaid debit card that you can load directly from an exchange (after cashing out BTC) via SEPA/IBAN. Look for a good one with low fees and a currency exchange commission of 2% or less (if you travel out of your country often). My gf is Italian and she found a good one at her post office, it works beautifully. Most countries' postal services in Europe have a similar debit card product, so I suspect that the UK is no different. If not, shop around until you find a good one, and you'll be fine after that.

Nobody fucking cares. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:32:21


That's good of you. :)


That all depends on the ideas now doesn't it? Valid ideas? Sure, let's hear them. Just any stupid ideas, even particularly bad/dangerous ones? Nope, they don't get the same kind of support.  


Nice analogy, although it's quite faulty. This isn't a "league" of opposing teams.  


Bitcoin is not in competition with BSHIT, not even remotely. Let's just clarify that right now. BSHIT, on the other hand, wants desperately to dethrone BTC, rather than just carve out its own niche and status in the crypto marketplace. And that's where most of us have a big problem with them. It's also a highly-controlled, commercialized and yes... centralized coin that nobody even wants. Most people who are even dabbling in BSHIT are speculators and newbies who are falling for Ver/Wu and co's schtick. The rest of us who happen to know better see through the bullshit, the mempool spamming, the hash-hijacking, the FUD-spreading (much of it happening right on this sub) and other underhanded, cheapshit tactics, and therefore call it all out. You seem to think that these are two somewhat equal adversaries on a level playing field. Again, not even close. 


All due respect, nobody gives a shit about what stature you wish to adapt. You have yet to make one valid argument or anything that merits any attention. As far as I'm concerned, you're nothing but a yappy troll who's trying to steer a conversation about BSHIT that's simply not deserved. 
 


Good, because you'd obviously lose that. :)


Really? Hmmm... so far it doesn't show very well at all. Sorry. 


Your "opinion on free market of ideas"??? Ok that made me laugh. :D


Learn from BSHIT? That's hilarious. 
As for BCH having issues, so the fuck what? It still works quite well from where I'm standing. I use it every single day and have yet to see any significant issue with it. Do I use it to buy coffee at Starbuck's? No, but I do use it for plenty of other things where it simply wins hands down against anything else, including forex trading. There are also plenty of technological improvements being added and implemented that will just make BTC work even better. Segwit (already online and steadily being adopted), Lightning Network to name just a couple. The core devs are the best in the world, and they make the devs at BSHIT look like toddlers dawdling around and shitting themselves. It's that obvious. 


Responding to your droning, long-winded dissertation, calling you out on bullshit and glorified FUD isn't quite the same as having a conversation about the merits of BTC vs. BSHIT. Again, there's no comparison. It's like comparing a broken down VW Beetle with a Tesla. If you don't get that, then I can't help that. But maybe you should refrain from babbling on this sub until you do.

Hmmmm... wonder how much the collective power bill is for the global banking and finance industry... hmmmmm.... 
And in case you don't know, the cost of power is dropping like a rock, and will continue to do so in the long-term. Alternative energy is taking over, catch up.

Wow, you STILL don't even remotely get it. :D
Wall St. is struggling to remain relevant. Anything they do from here on in will be solely to convince the public that they are still a vital institution and pillar of the global economy. They, unlike you, fully understand that they are being rendered obsolete by this disruption. Imagine when stock exchanges switch to blockchain technology and they won't even be needed for the fucking stock and bond markets. What, you don't think that's going to happen?? :D
 


Yet again, you're confusing passion for anger. It's ok, I get that you're probably not intellectually-astute enough to understand the finer points of what I'm discussing here. Maybe, over time, you will slowly absorb it. Or not, who knows? Who cares? 


Oooh... ouch. :D 
This coming from the redditor of two whole weeks, who can't do anything other than post about his whiny first world problems. 
Trust me when I tell you, I don't give a flying fuck about what you think of me or even my stature in this "community". 
I'm not here for karma points or to get bullshit affirmation. I'm on this sub to try to help keep shit real. 
For years, I just lurked, read and digested what others were posting/commenting, while learning things as I went along. And much of what I learned was thanks to this sub. I didn't even start commenting here, until I was confident about my knowledge and understanding of the topic. Maybe that's what you should have done too. :)
And don't worry, the fact that I'm thinking about Bitcoin's global impact far beyond what it has already done for me, and how it can conceivably help billions of people climb out of perpetual poverty, is good enough for me. Arguably, it makes me a better person than you, since I'm not just thinking about myself. Go figure. :D

@_date: 2017-11-08 14:08:05
The receiving wallet saw the payment within a couple minutes of me sending it. The confirmations came within 3 hours. Any merchant who deals with BTC knows that the confirmations may take a while, but they ALWAYS do. I've yet to hear from a merchant or anyone for that matter that a transaction didn't confirm within a reasonable amount of time. And if the mempool is backed up and it takes a bit longer, so fucking what? 
And let's get real. There's FAR more to the utility BTC than using it to buy a pair of cup of coffee at the local Starbucks. To whine about confirmation times without actually getting that is ridiculously small-minded. 
BTW, As a point of comparison, ask any merchant how long they have to wait to get their funds from their merchant bank when processing credit card payments at their business. I can readily assure you, it's longer than pretty much anywhere in the world. Now you're talking anywhere from a day to a week, plus giving up anywhere from 2-5% of the transaction for the privilege of waiting to get your money. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:10:18

It's not for the elite class dimwit. BTC is for anybody and everybody. People can store value in any increment that suits them. If they can't buy via an exchange, they can buy locally for cash via platforms like Paxful and LocalBitcoins in any increment they can afford. 
The ones who can't afford high fees don't even have to pay them. They simply set the fee to the lowest setting and wait a bit longer for confirmations. Big fucking deal. Even this week, I paid relatively low fees (below 100 sat/b) and got confirmations within 3-6 hours even with the mempool as swamped as it has been. 
And if you've been getting paid with BTC for the last 2 1/2 years, and kept at least part of it in BTC without cashing out to fiat, you definitely need to stop whining right the fuck now. 
You don't even have to be all that smart to realize that you've gained a tremendous amount of value by just sticking to BTC during all that time.  Hello?? And you're still complaining about fees??? Grow the fuck up already.

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:13
No, I'm not wrong about that. The miners don't dictate which chain is BTC. Plus, miners will always mine whichever coin is more profitable, otherwise they are just flushing money down the shitter.  The only reason that miners are mining the shit out of BCH right now is because of the low difficulty, so it's more profitable. This changes in about half a day, then it becomes more profitable to go back to mining BTC blocks. BCH will NEVER be bitcoin, no matter how much that used car salesman Ver insists on it.

It's not about being emotionally attached, it's about getting it. And sorry, you don't get it, at least not yet. :)


Actually, you have no idea what you're talking about. BTC is always scaling. The core developers are constantly improving BTC so it works faster and more efficiently. Segwit is live now and adoption is steadily increasing. LN has  been tested over the past few months and it's ready for primetime, to go live within the next few weeks. This is not hyperbole, it's the real deal. 


Says the clueless newbie.  :D 


Hey, bonehead newbie. I've been using BTC for the last two years. I live on BTC, I travel the world on BTC, I forex trade with BTC. I told banks and fiat to fuck off long ago, and haven't looked back since. Do you know how many people there are just like me out here? You're sitting here trying to give me this hilarious lecture about how BTC isn't usable, while I'm just laughing at your ignorance and patronizing stupidity. You clearly have no idea of what you're talking about, yet you've convinced yourself that you do. And yeah, right now, you're look like quite the presumptive newbie dumbass out here. :D


Yep, you had to double down on your previous stupidity. You don't even get that BTC is a near-perfect deflationary asset class and store of value, and yes... it's also a currency. You have got some serious reading up and learning to do, because quite frankly, the more you comment on this sub at your current level of knowledge the dumber you will sound. Just sayin'... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:50:31

@_date: 2017-11-20 11:12:20


I know I'm not wrong. I didn't need you to tell me. 


Do yourself a favor. Stop talking yourself even further into a hole. You don't know what you're talking about. There is NO "global" fiat system. Each independent state or federation of states (like EU) has its OWN system of fiat currency, governed by its own reserve or central bank. And if not, they just use the currency of another country (like many use the USD instead of issuing their own). 
And yes, they DO burst all the time as I have already clearly proven. 


Spoken like the true pseudo-intellectual that you are. There's nothing "could happen" about it. It has ALREADY happened, and is currently happening in several countries. Several more countries are on the borderline of a major currency failure. There's nothing theoretical about what I said. 
As for Bitcoin "bursting". You apparently know little or nothing about how BTC was designed. It's the complete antithesis of inflationary, centralized, fiat currency. This makes Bitcoin quite resistant to all the forces that would meltdown fiat currencies. Really, you should inform yourself a bit more about this stuff before commenting. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

I don't know, can you stop being full of shit and spewing FUD or nah?


Uh... *cough* Bullshit. They suspended withdrawals/deposits for about a day on the 11th-12th during the major mempool backlog and EDA bullshit because of BCH's shenanigans. 
Check their status page: 


Hmmm... that's odd, they're showing plenty of activity both  in and out of BTC on their site, as recently as 2 minutes ago . They did post that there are delays due to "high levels of market activity", but did they close transactions? Nope. 
I also have an Exodus wallet, and it's not showing me any problem at all to trade ETH to BTC via Shapeshift. Hmmm... wonder what I'm doing wrong. 


"Coinbase too" what?? They're showing "degraded performance" on their status page, and that too is due to the mempool backup, which is steadily going back down now. 
BTW, this happens ALL THE FUCKING TIME on CB and Gdax when the mempool is large. Never mind that CB is all but dead to me because of the shitty way they handled the now dead Segwit2X fork. 
Anything else? FUD loser?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:53:22


Your salary would be lower because your money doesn't inflate. Goods would be priced lower because money doesn't inflate. The ratio would pretty much be the same as now, only instead of 100 notes we would be using 10 notes.
You clearly have no idea how inflation works, nor how fiat currency works. Geez. 


Hey dumbass, what do you think BTC does? BTC gives anyone a store of value that's deflationary, especially compared to shitty fiat. It gives anyone a hedge against inflation that they can tap into at ANY level. Even if it's .0001 of a btc. Whatever currency they switch to BTC will help them fight inflation at whatever level they can and give them more purchasing power and resistance to future inflation. 
The way it's designed, BTC doesn't give a shit what happens with fiat or local/national economies, it will always provide its holders with a certain amount of purchasing power that is entirely independent of what their local economy dictates. 


Why are you muttering shit that has absolutely no bearing on what happens when people buy BTC? 


Wrong. Deflation at any level will directly counter inflation that's economy-wide. A perfect example of this are Venezuela and Argentina, two countries that have been dealing with hyperinflation for quite some time now. People who were smart enough to purchase BTC were immediately given a hedge against the demise of their dying currencies. They were able to use this BTC to either transact business directly peer-to-peer without the need for shitty Bolivars or Pesos, or with other hard currency that held value better than their home currencies. It's really that simple. Geez, the more you comment, the more you show your ignorance of some very basic economic concepts. 


Yeah, no shit. :D


Dude, really, please stop babbling all over this sub. Comment less, and read more. The more you post, the more evident it is that you no fucking clue about what you're talking about. Wherever you studied economics, you should go ask for a refund, because seriously, you didn't learn a fucking thing.

I've been saying this all along, there are plenty of whales and heavy traders who are waiting in the wings for any significant dips. People who think that BTC's price can be heavily manipulated or shorted, simply have no idea of how many big players are getting into this arena every single day.

There's a post out here that explains it all, and luckily for you, even in a way, that your obviously gullible, easy-to-manipulate feeble mind can comprehend:
Read it more than once if you have to, then yeah, shut the FUD up. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:20:48


That's your bullshit opinion, douchewad. You think I give a flying fuck about what you think? I'll give ya one guess. :)


Nah, I'm just cutting to the chase. As I always say,  it's not an insult if it's true. 
"straightforward questions"???? BHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA :D
Wise up, already. He's making utterly ridiculous pseudo-intellectual arguments that make Pascal's wager look like a Broadway play. It's beyond hilarious. He's obviously intent on FUDDING, even to the extent that he's using bullshit which is ripped right out of BCH's FUD playbook, ("BTC death spiral" anyone?) 
Then... he declares that people have to prove a negative in order to satisfy him. I see apologetic idiots like this all the time, and can spot them in a nanosecond. And no, I'm not going to pussyfoot and waste time. Sorry, I got better things to do. 
So if you think that he's making even remotely logical arguments, then that only means that you're gullible as fuck. You should work on that. :) 


Loaded? That's being generous. :D
And I'll just tell him to shut the fuck up without debating him. He's not worthy of
a debate, considering the fact that he's only here to raise FUD bullshit and stir up ire and worry. 
Again, if you're not able to spot that, the problem lies with you. I'd work on that. But don't expect me to feel the need to respond or discuss the way that YOU think I should. Nah, fuck that. 


Um... not to fall for FUDster bullshit whose trying to use ridiculous arguments to raise doubts about BTC's stability maybe? 
Never mind that it should be to blatantly obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that he's full of shit and is spinning his wheels, while trying to get others to spin their wheels too. If you can't figure that out, honestly... you shouldn't even be dealing with BTC, you'll just hurt yourself. :)
It's not my job to worry about what newbies think or don't think about my posts, just wanted to make that point clear. 


Oh, so now BTC's survival is dependent on social politics? :D
You can rest easy, BTC is not dependent on what people like you or I say about it. The fundamentals and logic behind it is more than enough. It's why it's gotten this far. 
So yeah, it doesn't even matter what this dickwad OP says about it. It's ability to function efficiently and thrive depends on far more than that. 
And luckily, there's enough smart people involved with the right vision that should keep it on track. Stop flattering yourself, and taking on (and imposing on others) this bullshit burden of responsibility that's non-existent. BTC will be just fine with or without you and/or me. So calm the fuck down.  


That was beautiful. *snort*... :)
Well, considering that I'm an outspoken atheist, you can rest assured that I don't consider BTC a religion. :)
I do however, choose to maximize my use and implementation of BTC to the extent that I no longer even worry about fiat ever again. I've completely freed myself, living off what I make in BTC, and sure, I'd like to see others do the same thing. 
Noble enough for you? If not, that's fine, like I said before, you can go fuck yourself if you don't like what I'm saying.  :)

@_date: 2017-11-17 09:07:59


Waaaaa.... toxic... waa.... what happened to our community? :(


Won't argue with that, there are some ridiculously spoiled whiners out here. Whenever something strikes them as remotely "imperfect" about BTC, they feel the need to come out here and whine about it, rather than understand that in the grand scheme of things petty issues and bumps in the road don't fucking matter. It gives a great cover to all the concern trolls who come in and pull the same shit with the sole purpose to FUD the shit out of this sub. While lame-ass apologists defend them and their right to whine and raise FUDDY bullshit about nothing. You're absolutely right, there are a lot of spoiled, self-entitled douchebags out here. And I shall call them out whenever I have the time and energy to do so. 


I see less of those out here everyday,  to be honest with you. Sure, this sub will always have the "HODL, just HODL" contingent out here, and... so the fuck what? Sorry, but that narrative is far better than the FUD and muckraking that other commenters think that they're self-entitled to do out here. 
Raise questions about legitimate issues or problems? Sure. Fine. Exaggerate or expound on ridiculous petty issues such as... *gulp* rising fees due to a backed-up mempool and malicious spamming ad nauseum?... shut the fuck up already. 


Sorry, that's bullshit. There has been no end to whiny complaint posts and "OMG what's happening???" posts out here. If anything, the admins figured out that there was a concerted FUD campaign happening and did what they had to do put a limit to it. 
Yet, people like you will whine about the fact that this community was literally attacked with a bullshit campaign, and people reacted strongly to it. All in the name of 'preserving the sanctity of this community'. Ah... go fuck yourself you self-righteous blowhard. 
And the fact that you even tried to say that "the network is unusable" shows what your real agenda is. Sorry to break it to ya, but the network never stopped being usable. Even in the thick of the spamming and EDA bullshit that happened last weekend, Most of us were able to transact with BTC with little or no problems. Just because some people couldn't buy coffee or send their BTC for 20 cents doesn't mean that the network was unusable. So get a fucking grip and quit exaggerating you big fucking baby. 


Again, go fuck yourself you self-righteous, pseudo-intellectual blowhard. Now you think you have the intellectual authority to predict the future? And you wonder why people call out such horseshit? :D 
And now you want to conflate what is happening with this subreddit with what is happening with BTC in general? Wow... talk about toxic. :D


See? See how fucking obtuse you are being? You actually think that everybody wants to be "rich" ?? Hey... dumbass... here's a newsflash: most people in this world just want to be able to live well within modest means, while giving their kids a better future than they had. They want to do that without constantly having to be stomped on by a flawed economic system that doesn't give a shit about them, but just wants them to be eternal slaves and work for shitty wages to earn a shitty currency that gives them no future whatsoever, you self-entitled fuck. And guess what? BTC is giving them that possibility. 
Consider this fuckface... 
If just a couple years ago, someone making just $10 a day and bit the bullet, made horrifically difficult sacrifices just to invest $1 of it on BTC for a whole year, they would end up with roughly $300 of BTC. Do some math and figure out how much that BTC would be worth today. Here, I'll help you, back around this time 2 years ago, 1 BTC was worth around $250. That means that this working peasant would have about 1.2 BTC @ $300. 1.2 BTC today is now worth about NINE FUCKING THOUSAND DOLLARS.  What do you think that kind of newfound wealth would mean to a family who's been struggling to survive on $10 a fucking day? Do you know how many people did exactly this in places like Venezuela,Argentina,Zimbabwe and other developing countries that have failing financial systems??? What a motherfucking game-changer this has been for the developing world, and how it will only continue to be just that for years to come??
I'll bet that you still don't fucking get it.

So, because a major exchange suspends activities during a particular flux or issue with the network, this means BTC is a dismal failure?
If you really believe that, do yourself a favor. Stay away from BTC and all cryptos in general. :D




Yeah, how long did that last, about 8 hours on a weekend? :D




You haven't made a point. All you have done is play the classic role of an idiot fudster.  This kind of shit happens on CB ALL THE FUCKING TIME, even when things are hunky-dory in BTC land. 
In the grand scheme of things, performance issues for exchanges don't affect BTC's overall state in any way whatsoever. If it takes a little longer to make a withdrawal or deposit, so the fuck what? Shit like this will happen, and BTC always recuperates, and gets even stronger in the process. 
You really don't get it, do you? 
In your lame-ass view, you think that if things don't work perfectly 100% of the time, then it must be a total failure. Shut the fuck up already.  
You obviously have no idea what decentralization means and why it's proven itself time and time again in the BTC experiment. 


Ok, so now you're illiterate too. 
It wasn't one guy, you dumbfuck. It was a concerted effort that involved several organizations, an exchange in Korea that spearheaded the pump and dump, and one particular self-important asshole who has quite a bit of mining power under him. 
And yet... despite all that, BTC survived just fine. How did BCH fare out? :D 
But hey... keep whining and FUDDING about how fragile BTC is. Keep making an idiot of yourself out here, it's ok with me.

Read up on this sub, BCH is hogging up all the hashrate because of the low difficulty. This will change in about half a day, and BTC will become more profitable to mine. Once that happens, things will go back to normal. If you can't wait, and really need to accelerate your transaction google confirmtx they can help you.

Denial? Yeah right. Again, let's see what happens with BSHIT in a year. :D


It's not a test tube, it's a scamcoin. Get a fucking clue, limey. 
 


"CEO model"??? :D 
You look like an idiot who has no idea what he's talking about. 


Nah, you're just softball shilling for them, that's all. 


There are plenty of entities biting at BTC's heels. Many of them are worthy of attention. BSHIT? Nah. 


Obviously, you don't even care about what you know or don't know. 


Well, acknowledge this. BSHIT tried desperately to knock down BTC so it can reach parity with it, and failed miserably. They are still trying to do that, although it's obvious that their actions are a dismal failure. You have absolutely no clue of the actual game that's going on, and want to simplify it all down to being healthy competition. It's not. If you still don't get that, then seriously, you're in the wrong arena. 


I don't really give a shit about what you're ok with. You're a clueless shill who just keeps talking himself deeper into a rabbit hole filled with batshit. You're essentially playing an apologist for BSHIT, saying that their shitty tactics, greed and ego-driven antics is somehow "healthy competition". It's not even competition, that's not the point. The point is that it's predatory, and will sour a lot of people who are trying to benefit from BITCOIN. That's where essentially my problem lies. While it's everybody's responsibility to do their own due diligence, that doesn't give a pass to people trying to run a scam on people who miss something due to misrepresentation, omission or downright FRAUD. Again, if you don't get that, then that makes you part of the problem. So yeah, go to r/btc and knock yourself out. 


Scared? :D 
Hey idiot, I own plenty of other coins as well as BTC. I happen to see strengths and advantages in many of them, and how having them just makes for a stronger crypto ecosystem. So much for your ridiculous argument there. You still don't get that what BSHIT is doing is dirty, fraudulent and even criminal. Personally, I hope that it melts down and burned investors go after Ver and co with a vengeance. They reap what they sow. Again, stop being an idiotic apologist for a scam that doesn't deserve any positive light. Stop being a mindless shill trying to polish the turd that BSHIT obviously is. Ok?

Best thing to do is buy a certain increment regularly regardless of the price, and take advantage of dips if/when you can. This will allow you to cost-average over time. Then, just keep the BTC  for long-term growth. If you think that you're just going to get every "bottom" of a dip, rest assured, you won't.

There's a lot you obviously don't get about BTC. You're so small-minded that you whine about fees rather than understand the big picture. You're too bourgeois for BTC, cash out and stick with shitty fiat and visa/mastercard. We'll all be better off. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:56:29


Sure, banks want you to keep your money in their bank, without paying you interest, just for the privilege of charging you fees to do "unlimited transactions". You're fucking hilarious. :D


Yeah? On what planet? :D
MC/Visa charge merchants processing fees ranging from 2-5%. Guess who ultimately pays that? You do.
As for their debit cards, they ALL have fees, whether it's for ATM usage, currency exchange, monthly/annual fees, loading fees and more. If you travel and use the card abroad, they will eat you alive with currency exchange fees, POS charges and foreign ATM fees. Don't even get me started. I'm a full-time world traveler, and nobody knows this better than me. 
For credit cards, don't make me laugh some more. There's no such thing as a "free" credit card. You will always pay either a minimum interest charge, an annual fee, and a whole slew of other charges depending on how you use a cc. For you to even say this is a fucking joke. 


You're VERY curious? First of all, the actual fee doesn't have to be anywhere NEAR $5-20. If you want to send a small transaction, you can use a wallet that allows you to set a lower fee, and send the payment that way. I've paid as little as 15 cents for a transaction, and it's almost always been confirmed within an hour or two. The receiving wallet almost always sees the transaction within 1-2 minutes of sending it. Again, are you fucking kidding me? People do this shit every day. :D
BTW, with Segwit, transaction fees will go down even lower and confirmations will take far less time. It's currently around 10-15% adoption, and that will go up significantly  once more wallets and other exchanges add it on. Then in a few weeks, we'll see Lightning network go live which will completely transform the way micropayments and small transactions are done. 
So there ya go.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:50:54


Yeah, I'm utterly terrified of BTC losing its dominant position. :D


And yet, it's gained over 600% in a year, hit a market cap of over $100B, and all projections have its price just continuing upward. But those fees... we're all terrified of them going any higher. :P 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:10:23
Yeah, stay greedy, see how far that gets you. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:43:40
But the money may never actually convert the BTC into fiat in the process. If the vendor chooses to keep the money received for the sale in BTC, the vendor is actually better off in the long-term. Stuff can be priced in fiat all day long, doesn't mean that fiat actually has to be used in the transaction.    
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:45:56
No need to "manipulate" the market.  Adoption of BTC is happening at an accelerated pace worldwide, especially in countries whose currencies are grossly inflated and/or worthless. More and more investment funds are coming aboard and taking it seriously for long-term growth. BTC is not a "pump and dump" dogshit stock, you need to shake that mentality and figure out what BTC is really all about.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:37:53


BTC has lost half its value in an hour? When did that happen last? 2012?? And how long did it take to recover from it? :D
You seem to have a serious problem understanding what short-term volatility is. BTC is in fact one of the least volatile currencies on the planet right now when doing apples to apples comparison over YEARS. Don't take my word for it. Compare BTC's monthly historical chart to that of any major currency. Don't worry, I have already done it. I trade fiat currency pairs with BTC every fucking day. :)
Case.Closed. 
 


You're right, it isn't a savings account. Compared to hodling BTC savings accounts are a total and complete JOKE. 
BTC is BETTER than a savings account on so many levels it boggles the mind. For one thing, it's a store of value that is 100% deflationary. It provides you with complete control of your funds, as well as the ability to earn FAR more from it than the pittance of interest that your bank gives you in exchange for "insurance" that will never be needed. It also gives you a solid hedge against betting your future on an inflationary currency that WILL only lose purchasing power over time at the rate of 3% or more a year average. 
As far as taxation goes, I'd rather be taxed at capital gains rate than ordinary income any day of the week. If you're a long-term hodler, and are indeed subject to taxation, going for CG taxes is a piece of fucking cake. The fact that you even bring up paying taxes as an adverse issue for BTC just adds gravy to your joke of a comment. 
It's clear to anyone with a modicum of intelligence, people who are keeping their money in banks who are not just asking for trouble, they're demanding it. 


Excuse me but... 
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA... 
...are you fucking high?? :D :D :D :D 
My BTC is even more liquid than a fucking bank account any day of the fucking week. Especially considering that I'm a full-time world traveler. 
In almost any case, it takes me all but two minutes to cash out BTC on demand and have it on the way to my debit card, ready to be spent however way I fucking please within a matter of HOURS. 
I'm also paid by clients via BTC and other cryptos, where I have my money in my wallet in a matter of minutes to hours without paying the usual 3-4% processing fees that Paypal and other processors charge. Again, are you fucking high???? 
Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? Your blathering has literally no basis in fact or substance whatsoever! :D :D :D 


Funny, but those of us who are doing just that (in my case, it makes absolutely no sense to have any more than a couple of grand in fiat at any time) are not only better off financially than we ever have been, we understand what the future holds. Your problem is that your line of thinking is shaped by the same ol' fear tactics and bullshit that the financial world has been pounding over people's heads since the beginning of time. The absolutely ludicrous notion that we NEED banks and the bullshit false sense of security/peace of mind that banks provide. Try telling that to people who live in Venezuela who dunked their life's savings into fucking banks, only to find that their Bolivars are fucking worthless. Try telling that to Greeks who couldn't take out more than 50 euros a day from their bank accounts during their central bank meltdown a couple of years ago. You're a pathetic fool who has fallen for the biggest lie out there. And what's worse, is that you think that you have grounds to lecture people on bold choices and decisions that they are making to reclaim their financial sovereignty. Even to the point that you're wagging your finger and being a condescending douche about it. 
Yeah, well, no thank you. :)

Really? You don't understand the concept that it's not about quantity of transactions that determines "adoption", but how BTC is utilized? It's clear that for many users,  it's a store of value. Which means that they're not going to be piddling it away at the corner store or at Starbucks. But maybe instead, they'll buy a house, car or boat with it. Or maybe, they'll use it for trading and investing instead of using it to buy a dildo on Overstock.com.

Hey newbie, you have a lot to learn about BTC, how about you take the time to learn about it before making asinine judgement calls that are based on a particularly challenging time for it? Which, let me remind it survived relatively unscathed and will emerge from this phase even stronger than it was before? 
There is simply NO comparison between BTC and pathetic inflationary and self-defeating fiat currency. If you can't get that, even this early into your foray into BTC, do us a favor. Sell your BTC pittance off, and stick to cash. Really, we won't mind. :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:12:03


Can you at least make it banter that's worth bantering about? So far, you're failing miserably at that. :)


You don't have to rephrase anything. The question you raised is still utterly full of shit. 
Why? My stance has nothing to do with BSHIT's artificially pumped-up price, geez. 
It has more to do with the tactics that their cadre is utilizing to "sell" it to people. The lies, the FUD, the overblown claims, shut the fuck up already. 
The fact that BSHIT even needs to be sold at all to somehow convince people that they're "the real bitcoin" should be a clear indicator that the whole shebang is seriously flawed and corrupt. 
And the guys behind the project? Where do I begin?... :D
A sleazy used-car salesman/egomaniac/convicted felon, a money launderer and casino ripoff king, a self-important dweeb who claimed for years that he was Satoshi, and... an egomaniac Chinese miner who wants to monopolize/centralize BTC mining. 
Oh yeah, that's a winning combination right there. It OOZES trust, goodwill and integrity. :D
Seriously, get a fucking grip. You're being duped beyond reason if you think that BCH has anything to contribute to crypto. 
They are in it for themselves. For ego, for greed and to literally steal what Bitcoin has built over these last 9 years and claim it as their own. Fuck them. 
The fact that BTC continues to thrive despite all their shit should speak volumes to you. Yet, you think that BSHIT is some kind of contender? Get the fuck outta here. :D
So yeah, whatever, go to r/btc and babble about it there, ok? You'll find tons of adoring fans and head-nodders there, don't worry.

If you're too much of a cheap shit to pay $3 to send BTC anywhere on the planet without involving banks or other payment processors, that's your problem, loser. 


Maybe not for losers like you who whine about fees, and think that shit should be as cheap as they get to have it under ideal circumstances. For the rest of us who know better, and know why we're in BTC vs. shitty fiat, it's nothing. Grow the fuck up, your whining about a $3 fee only shows how pathetic you are. Stick with Paypal and Crapple Pay if you think that's a better deal. Bye.

@_date: 2017-11-17 06:05:32


Yep, you still don't get it. :D
Dude, again, get a clue. Wall St isn't "moving with public interest", they're struggling for SELF-PRESERVATION. A HUGE segment of the finance sector as we know it has just been rendered OBSOLETE by the Bitcoin revolution. The shameless fuckers who wrote the fucking book on "bubbles", tried to portray BTC as a "bubble" in order to scare people away from  it. Once they realized that's not going to happen, they decided oh well... might as well come aboard and profit from it too. 
As for getting a pound of flesh for every transaction, again, are you fucking kidding???? That's not going to happen either. Wall St. can't steal the position of being the "middleman" in BTC because there is simply no need for it. Fuck, when atomic swaps go live, there will barely be any need for exchanges anymore! Wall St. sees the returns happening, and they want in, that's all. They're also seeing that the fiat currency fuel that their industries depend on so critically is losing its role in the global economy. Talk about a major disruption. 
That's what they attempted to do with Segwit2X and it failed miserably. That's what Ver, Wu and their cadre of scammer dickwads are attempting do with BSHIT and it's failing miserably. To gain and maintain some kind of control over this BTC beast. For fuck's sake, you don't even know the game you're in, or even who the players are. :D


Another silly remark. Hey, dummy, BTC was in its infancy 9 years ago. It's now akin to a child prodigy breezing through elementary school, and getting smarter and more capable by the fucking day. You are so behind the curve on this, minimizing its stature and position in the world, that seriously, it's pretty laughable. You're overthinking things to the point that you're not thinking at all. :)


Maybe if people like you stop posting poorly-thought-out musings without understanding anything about what is happening,  they won't get called out by people like me. People who are tired of the mindless bullshit being spouted and discussed on this sub as if they were valid topics instead of shit that everybody should really be talking about.

Having a prepaid debit card with IBAN doesn't mean you're dealing with a bank. My gf is Italian, and she has a prepaid debit card from the Italian Post Office, no bank involved. 
Fees are quite low/reasonable (except for international ATM's which she won't use unless she has to), and there's no currency exchange fee/commission. Being global travelers, it makes it very easy to access BTC anywhere in the world without hassles. 
Switching to fiat for the "last mile" is often a necessary evil and as long as you're converting from BTC your way ahead of the pack when it comes to inflation and loss of purchasing power. Just something to consider. You can be your own bank while using the existing system to your advantage.

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:09:15
Ok fair enough, I deleted my previous comments and will agree that it's not as simple. Fair enough. 
But that said, let me just put it this way:
If I were a "whale", and I had a shitload of BTC on Coinbase pre-fork, and I wanted to move my coins off CB so I can access my BCH to sell off, use, whatever, and CB wouldn't give it to me, you can rest assured that CB would be seriously exposed to legal action if they didn't comply. The legal risk would force them to relent, especially if this issue were raised in a US or EU court. 
It doesn't matter what their TOS or any other "agreement" would state on this. If a plaintiff were to prove that CB was acting improperly or was intent on defrauding or exploiting an accountholder by not releasing the BCH to an accountholder for coins held on account pre August 1st exposed them to undue risk or financial loss. And yeah, this would not be at all difficult, CB would have a major liability on their hands, not to mention a serious PR fiasco. 
One thing I can tell you is this: Chances are pretty high that high-balance CB account holders who bitched loud enough for their pre-fork coins post August 1st, got them. 
Sure, it might have required a letter or intervention from a lawyer, and probably under the condition that it happened quietly as a "customer accommodation", but they got them, let's just put it that way. There's no way that CB would risk a legal shitstorm in exchange for holding somebody's BCH until January. Nope,not gonna happen. The problem is that most CB customers just took CB's "promise" to deliver the BCH to them at face value, and didn't make much of a big deal about it afterwards. 
Personally, CB is dead to me after the way they handled S2X, but that's another story. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:54:14

Until the mempool goes back down to normal levels, fees are going to be high. as of now, there are just over 100k transactions in the mempool. When it gets down to about 40-50k, fees should go back to fairly normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:14:17

The fact that BTC is not bound by any rules, limitations or other controls set by a central bank means that it can thrive in any type  of economy regardless of how well or shitty its national fiat currency is doing. Need examples? Check Venezuela or Argentina. 
And BTC is a "speculative asset"??? :D :D :D 
Thanks for showing us all how little you actually know about BTC. :D
And it's funny how for people like me and countless others, it functions incredibly well as a currency as well as a store of value. It's also amazing how well it works as a base currency for forex trading. But hey, what do I know, I've only been living on BTC for the last couple of years now. :)

@_date: 2017-11-05 09:47:11


In the grand scheme of things, that doesn't matter at all. It's just more efficient and practical to apply a "fiat" price to something being paid in BTC to show relative value in the marketplace. If no fiat is being used in the transaction, then all it is really being used is a basis for the price, nothing more. 


Naww... really? :)


Funny, I use it as currency every single day, it's quite attractive to me for very logical/economically-sound reasons. Hmmm... I wonder what I'm not seeing... 


Um... what???? :D 
If a currency is deflationary, it doesn't mean that prices have to go down at all. And if, for the sake of argument, prices did go down,due to a deflationary currency, how is that bad exactly? If BTC is involved in the economic equation, then their currency increasing in value can only provide them with more purchasing power. The market eventually equalizes both elements. 
You seem to misunderstand something, deflation is the antithesis of inflation. They don't both cause the same problems. Inflation is far more sinister than deflation can ever be.  
Prices are dictated by the marketplace and if you study economics, you will find that deflation plays a very small role in the grand equation as opposed to INflation. In fact, deflation spurs economic growth as well as promotes more equality in the economy for myriad reasons ranging from the fact that workers get more purchasing power from their hard-earned money, to the fact that global markets can better compete without factoring in for diverse currencies, inflation rates and other hurdles. 
INFLATION, on the other hand, negatively affects both purchasing power of the currency AS WELL as the cost of goods/production, and therefore causes prices to increase to account for it. And with few exceptions, wages almost never increase to keep up, therefore causing workers to effectively lose purchasing power over time. 
And... for the most part, inflation is caused by artificial economic forces, printing of money, governments assuming more and more debt, etc. 
Here's a question: Why do you think that the rich have such a hard-on for getting and hoarding up more and more wealth? It's not just sheer greed. In their eyes, it's all about long-term economic survival. 
Simply put, they can do math. They can readily see that their purchasing power (ie; their personal wealth) declines each and every year due to inflation, no matter what they do. No matter how much money they make from their investments, their wealth erodes easily at a rate of 3-5% a year.  
Their ultimate goal in being greedy fucking capitalist assholes is mainly to combat their inevitable loss of purchasing power. This is accomplished by doing two things: 
1. Gain an increasing share of the economy's wealth, even at the expense of the middle and lower class. 
2. Lower their tax burdens over time. 
BTC is the non-wealthy-elite's antidote to their strategy, it's as simple as that. It's also the big reason why they will come on board in droves in the future (even more so than they are now), because they see the writing on the wall, and the days of cash being king are numbered. 


Well, considering that I spend BTC that I'm earning via my trading/investments, I'm not replacing anything, so what you're saying makes absolutely no sense. I know people who are buying houses for cash, and flipping them for BTC. I have a friend in Florida who buys project boats/yachts in Florida and the Caribbean, and sells them strictly for BTC. Why? Because he understands that his upside is FAR better doing it that way than trying to make just a profit in dollars or euros.  
So see, it's the shortsighted mentality that you display in your response that only accentuates why there is so much ignorance in this space. BTC is not something that's theoretical in its value and potential. It's proven itself in many ways over the last 9 years, and will only do so even more as it's applied in other ways that we haven't even thought of yet. The genie's out of the fucking bottle, no matter what you think. :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:04:18

As long as BTC buyers who used Tethers can move their BTC off Bitfinex, and as long as they keep no money sitting in their Bitfinex accounts, there's no real way they can lose. Just sitting on Tethers makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, so if Bitfinex bites the dust or Tether goes south, that's on the account holders. But the claim that Bitfinex is driving up the price with "non-existing money" is ludicrous.

Do some research. It's no secret that Ethereum is at the complete whim and disposal of its creator, Vitalik Buterin. If you don't know that by now, then you probably shouldn't be dealing with any cryptocurrencies, you'll just hurt yourself. :D


Scalability, schmalability. BTC is constantly improving and evolving, and the scaling will come with time. Funny how I have absolutely NO trouble at all sending or receiving BTC at will where the receiving wallet didn't see the transaction within 1-2 minutes. Confirmations taking a bit longer? Who the fuck cares? :D


Thanks for the advice, plumbing's working just fine. Sorry if you can't take someone being blunt and direct with you regarding your utter ignorance and stupidity. And... do you really think that I'd consider your advice even remotely worthy if you can't even think your way out of a paper bag? :D

Everybody wants that. Not just fatcats. If working class people held currency that didn't deteriorate in purchasing power every year due to stupidity of its government and/or central bank, things would be totally different now. This is why BTC is such a game changer, everybody can benefit from this asset class to preserve their wealth and purchasing power, and not at the expense of the rest of the economy.

No it doesn't. People need to stop sabotaging and tripping BTC up every other month due to sheer greed, arrogance and stupidity. Everything that's happening now is because BCH is hijacking all the miners with their ridiculous EDA, which essentially pays miners for empty fucking blocks. Why are the blocks empty? Because nobody fucking uses that shitcoin, and nobody ever will. It's being artificially pumped because of FUD and misinformation, mostly due to that POS Ver and his bitcoin.com scam site.

Of course I have a debit card. I also travel all over the world, so I require a debit card that doesn't rape me in currency exchange fees. It took me ages to find a good one, and since then, I save literally hundreds of dollars a year in currency exchange fees. Whats your point?


Dude, don't make a comparison between credit cards and BTC, seriously. You're already making an ass of yourself as it is. :D


You're such a clueless consumer that you really have no idea that you're paying for all those "benefits" whether you know it or not. Back when I had a mastercard with BofA, I had a pretty great gold card that gave me tons of benefits that cost me next to nothing,  including bonus air miles, rebates and all kinds of other shit. All I had to do was maintain a minimum balance of $2500 in my checking account to get them all. So basically, I let them float and use my cash in exchange for bullshit benefits. Other than the miles, I didn't really benefit. Now imagine if I had put that money into a mutual fund or other vehicle that gave me a solid return every year, and just let it compound year after year. Get it yet?


No it doesn't, not even close. Because with banks and credit/debit cards, you're still dealing with shitty fiat. Currency that is literally getting eaten alive by inflation every year, and loses purchasing power with each passing month. It's also subject to manipulation, so if you travel overseas, you get killed by exchange rates and differentials, especially in high-inflation countries. You seriously have no idea of what you're talking about, and to be here trying to compare BTC to fiat/credit cards is utterly hilarious. :D


Its potential? Hey idiot, do some math and figure out how much $1000 of BTC would be worth today if you bought it this time last year. Then tell me how much better off you were keeping that $1000 in fiat. :D :D :D :D :D 


Wow, that was pretty stupid. You do know that people can do both right? You can HODL, and simply replenish any amount of BTC that you spend with more BTC. It's like magic... :D


Yep, thanks for confirming that you're an idiot and have absolutely no clue whatsoever what BTC is all about. Its potential has only been proven many times over the past 9 years. Too bad you're stupid to even realize that.

Well consider me unimpressed, since it's abundantly clear that you're already one. 


Yes, it's a platform, duh. But like it or not, it's also a coin. In fact, it's now two coins due to a rather contentious fork. As far as being "decentralized", that's highly subject to debate and interpretation. I've already done my research on this, sounds like you need to do yours now. Sounds like you need to figure out why they even had a fork in the first place, resulting in ETC/ETH. 
And BTC core developers are at war? Really now.  :D
BTW, sorry, you've exceeded my "idiot time" allowance. So this is where I end our discourse. Again, pull your head out of your ass, get some clues, and maybe, just maybe you'll make some headway.

Secondly, BCH is a nothing less than a shitcoin BTC-wannabe that's being shilled by a greedy chinese miner and a fuckhead used car salesman who thought that they can hijack the blockchain for them to control. Yeah, that went well. :D
As for BTC fees, you're again showcasing your utter and complete stupidity with what you said. You do have a certain amount of control over fees. People who whine about confirmation times also don't really get it. People like you have no idea what BTC's strengths are,  nor what it's being used for.

Your very first mistaken assumption is here:
BTC is NOT a product or commodity like a sweater. It's an ASSET. It's an asset whose value is derived from other assets being injected into it. For the vast majority of BTC hodlers, that asset was indeed good ol' fiat cash or cash equivalent. That simply means that the value of one asset has been essentially transferred into BTC. Much like when one buys gold, the value of the assets/currency purchasing the gold fuels the value of the gold itself. The market values btc on the basis of sound economic principles, probably more so than any other asset class. 


Sorry, but this statement is utterly ludicrous. The market cap of BTC as an asset class is a JOKE compared to other asset classes. It's why it's on such a rapid growth curve.Because not only has its true potential been identified and established, but its future prospects as both an asset class/store of value AND a currency are in a word... major. 
You seem to be looking at BTC as nothing more than another digital/virtual currency without understanding what the real ramifications of its existence truly are. BTC is literally turning the financial world on its collective head. It's disrupting virtually every level of banking and investment finance like no other innovation ever has before. This is a profound paradigm shift happening before our very eyes, and the best analogy you seem to be able to come up with to showcase it is with "sweaters", it's laughably absurd. :D


That's simply not true. Not every single one. Many BTC holders/buyers/traders have only arrived in the past year or even few months or weeks ago! There are MORE people entering the arena every single fucking day. Coinbase alone had over 100k new account holders in just ONE day after CME announced a futures contract for BTC. So again... ARE YOU KIDDING?? There is new money flowing in from both individuals and investment funds at a mind-boggling rate. Guess what they're doing?? They're fueling the growth AND supporting the price/value of BTC today. It's so obvious that a 10 year-old can see it. Why can't you?


And...so what? You don't think that those hodlers are using/trading and supporting the value of BTC in some way, shape or form??? Are you kidding??? :D


And here lies the problem with your rather ridiculous, shortsighted assessment. That you think that they've all made a profit. You're looking at it the wrong way. You only make a profit when you actually sell the asset and take the profit. If you're sitting on something of value, that value becomes part of your net worth. You're worth more because of that asset, even if you don't cash out. You don't HAVE to sell in order for your net worth/wealth to be determined. 
Furthermore, just selling out for fiat is a no-win proposition in the long run. For SEVERAL reasons. 
1. ALL fiat currency is inflationary and therefore LOSES purchasing power over time. To sell your DE-flationary  BTC for fiat is a losing proposition in the long-term. And this applies EVEN IF BTC flatlines in value and never goes up again in the future. Chances are that won't happen, anybody who took a single economics and math class should be able to figure that out.
2. Taxation: If you cash out your BTC to take profit, you will most likely be subject to taxes by your home government. At the very least for capital gains. Short-term traders will be taxed on it as if it were income. Keeping your holdings in BTC means government can't touch your money until you decide to put it back into the banking system or convert it to cash. This provides you with full autonomy and sovereignty over your wealth, without having it be subject to seizure or manipulation by any other entity. 
3. Privacy. Keeping your BTC, ensures that you will be able to maintain privacy from prying eyes and fingers. Provided you took proper measures and steps in acquiring your initial BTC, you're virtually guaranteed privacy from various institutions and entities. Example: In the US, almost 150 million people had their whole lives compromised by Equifax's security fuckup. But guess what? Equifax has no way of knowing whether or not those people are holding BTC. 


You're right, it's conceivably a whole lot more in the grand scheme of things, and its price will need to catch up big time. :) 


Again... cash out FOR WHAT???? A fiat currency whose purchasing power is deteriorating at a rate of 3-5% or more per year??? To put the proceeds into a dogshit stock that MIGHT give them 10-15% ROI a year (before inflation is accounted for) or stuck into a shitty money-market account that might give them 2-3% a year??? 


You seem to think that you know what the "whales" are thinking. You don't even know basic economics. :D


Thank you for proving yet again,  that you have absolutely no clue of what is fueling BTC's growth. 


Wow, stupidest thing that you have said yet. :D


You should not guess anything. You clearly have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, and making absurd statements like this only showcase pseudo-intellectual ignorance and yeah... arrogant stupidity.

Not necessarily, those transactions with the low fees still sludge up the mempool making it take longer for the legit transactions to get added to a block. It also forces the legit users to pay a bit more than normal because of the fact that the mempool is so huge. The less transactions backlogged, the lower the fee per transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:52:09
Meh. 
Considering the fact that the vast majority of tethers in circulation are held and managed by two exchanges (Bitfinex and Poloniex) not really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. Of course their tethers are going to change hands a bunch of times in the course of heavy trading, duh. 
Surely there was a lot of trading action going on during this pump and dump attempt,but to say that the price is being "held up by tethers" (whatever the hell that means) is most definitely bullshit.

Yeah, you need to read up on LN. They're simply a new layer of the network that takes a big load off the miners for processing confirmations. There's nothing "centralized" or "third party" about it. They're merely a new level to the network.  


Hey clueless newbie, nobody cares what you think or don't think is a good option. There are a lot more brains behind the BTC project than your arrogant little brain can possibly comprehend or fathom. :)


I like Monero, as well as LTC, and they will have their place in the crypto market and add some interesting layers to the ecosystem. But they will never have the critical mass and acceptance of BTC,  that's simply a given. BTC is by far the most progressive, malleable and anti-fragile coin, and that's not going to change for a very long time. Deal with it. :)
 


I'm not your friend, clueless newbie. You're not teaching me anything, all you're doing is making a total ass of yourself with your ridiculous comments. 
I can send a transaction for .05 right now if I wanted to with my electrum wallet. Sure it would take a while to get confirmed, but it will, with no problems whatsoever. I've done it dozens of times. 


There's a lot you don't know, obviously. :D


You think I spend BTC at a coffee shop or buy clothes with? :D Hey clueless newbie dumbass. I have a debit card that gives me all the benefits of spending BTC as fiat that doesn't rape me with currency exchange fees, costs me nothing to load right from my exchange account via SEPA and lets me spend spend spend all I want without having to worry about any of that shit. 
And guess what, I know tons of merchants who take BTC and don't care about how long it takes to get confirmations. Once they see the transaction show up in their wallet, they're happy. That takes less than 1-2 minutes more than 99% of the time. They know the confirmations will come in due time, and don't make the customer wait. Are you stupid or something? Do you really think that merchants wait on confirmations at businesses and retail POS??? :D

People are literally dying to get their hands on any bitcoin they can in the developing world, because they understand it's their only way out of the clutches of fucked up fiat currency, corrupt central banks and governments that don't give a shit about them. They don't have the luxury that you and I have. You're so short-sighted that you don't even get that this is the future of BTC. Because the more and more that the developing world (as well as the 1st world) gets it, the more extinct bullshit fiat will become. The more people will get lifted out of dire poverty, and the faster the global economy will grow. In a way, let me add, that will benefit far more than just the wealthy global elites. 
Why do you think that Wall St is looking to get onboard? They see the writing on the wall. They can do math. They fully understand that even with conservative estimates BTC will continue to explode and dominate. They can no longer point at it and mock. It has outperformed literally ANY other investment vehicle in history, by simply existing. By simply doing what it has been ingeniously designed to do. 
As for me, I won't be shy to say that BTC saved my ass. It's given me a degree of security that I didn't even think was possible a few short years ago. And guess what? I did it in a way that it doesn't even matter where the price goes. If it goes up, it's just gravy. It's a nice position to be in. Guess that's what happens when you get it, and can figure out how to leverage the power you have with it. Does that make me passionate about it? Hell fuckin' yeah. :)
So, tell ya what, don't confuse anger for passion. You're confused enough as it is already.

@_date: 2017-11-02 08:31:02
Geez, is it too difficult to get a fucking clue about the game you're in???
BTC is not just another "investment opportunity". It's a major financial  disruptor and revolution. It's sending tremors across the fucking planet on so many levels it boggles the mind. Banks are shitting themselves, because they see the writing on the wall. Money, which as we all know, LOSES PURCHASING POWER over time. It doesn't matter what country's currency we're talking about. Inflation is a fact of life. 
BTC is changing all that from top to bottom. It's also going to eliminate the current model of financial institutions, banks and private equity markets. This is not hyperbole or exaggeration. It's happening before our very eyes. 
Did I write this to convince you of anything? Fuck no.  I'm posting this comment to cut through the bullshit conjecture, doubt and apprehension that people display when they're buying a fucking car or other depreciating asset, and apply the same line of thinking to BTC.  It's utterly ludicrous, and as long as people don't change their mindset, rest assured that many are going to miss the boat. This isn't about getting rich, it's about making and embracing profound changes that are happening with or without you.

And this post, which let me remind you is being repetitively deluged all over this sub is irresponsible, baseless FUD. How about that, by an oh esteemed redditor of a whole what... 4 months? :)
Who gives a flying fuck about "tether redeem-ability"? Tether is tether and Bitcoin is Bitcoin. 
As long as you can buy BTC with it and move it off of Bitfinex and sell/convert to whatever you want, there's no risk. If you choose to (stupidly) leave your money and/or BTC on ANY exchange and shit goes south with that exchange, that's on you. Everyone should know by now that keeping any kind of funds or crypto on an exchange is just... plain... dumb. 
So tell you what, go do your bullshit concern-trolling somewhere else. Mmmkay?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:28:52
Are you kidding? Get a fucking clue, redditor for a whole two weeks. Did you even finish FUD troll school? :) 
Fiat sucks. 
There's simply no comparison between BTC and bullshit fiat. If you can't see that now, you're never going to see it. So really, don't bother.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:38:11


So... what? You think it's ok to misinform people just because YOU think they aren't savvy? Who the fuck are you? You think you're doing them a favor by muttering completely unfounded horseshit because you think you're protecting them or doing them a favor?? 
Please, go on... :D


First of all, everybody coming into the market are coming in with different reasons and different goals. It's not your job (nor mine) to gauge or determine whose motivations are well-founded or not. Who the fuck are you?
And if you ask me... people putting their money into BTC are giving themselves a far better future prognosis than if they left it in shitty fiat. Even at today's prices. Does this mean that they should be reckless about it? No. But your misrepresentations and utter bullshit only muddies the waters for people who are trying to make an informed decision. 
Consider this... I literally debunked EVERY FUCKING POINT you tried to make in your utterly stupid comment. And rather than you counter with any facts or substance, which let's admit you have none, you tried to explain yourself even deeper into a hole by saying that your horseshit was meant to help people protect themselves somehow. Don't make me laugh even more than I already have. 
And again, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU to portray yourself as an "expert" by making points that have absolutely no validity whatsoever?? 


You're clearly one of those weak hands, dolt. So do yourself and all of us a favor. Sell your BTC and stay the fuck away from it. Because you clearly have no business taking a condescending stance to other people, telling them that they shouldn't risk their money (when let's face it, they're actually doing quite the opposite by getting into BTC), when you clearly have not one iota of a clue of what you're talking about. You got called out by me because what you were saying was utter horseshit. And furthermore, your condescending stance just made it all the more hilarious. Go flatter yourself somewhere else. Try a fucking mirror. 
 &gt;At the same time I'd really hate to see an uninformed person getting the wrong idea about this and losing money they can't afford to lose.
It's not up to you what decisions people make or don't make for their financial futures, dumbass. And it's most certainly not your civic duty to try to scare people away from what may possibly be their best opportunity in their fucking lifetime to break free from the institutions that have been keeping them under a slavemaster's thumb their whole fucking lives. Let people inform themselves with FACTS, not bullshit obtuse opinions like the ones you just displayed here, and make their own fucking decisions, mmmkay?
 


Welp, guess you should have thought twice about trying to lecture people when you're not even remotely qualified to do so, eh? 
And um... newsflash. I didn't lecture you about the future, you fucking dolt. I kept shit real about the present more than anything else. 


Uh... no... you don't get to say "we're on the same page" after the utter horseshit that you posted. You are on a completely opposite page in a totally different book. Let's not polish your glorious turd. :)


And again, it's not up to you to tell people what they should or should not do with their money. Nor is it your job to tell people that they should keep their money in a fucking bank account when it's clearly fucking stupid advice for probably 99% of people who are reading this right now. You're a fucking presumptive douche who thinks that you can predict the future, and think that you have the intellectual wherewithal to condescendingly warn people what they should or should not do, when it's painfully obvious that you don't. Stop kidding yourself, and stop acting like you're qualified to give advice when you are admittedly just one of those "weak hands" you are purportedly waiting for to shake out of the market. Geez. 


Well, I'd rather you shut the fuck up on this sub and not propagate bullshit myths, FUD and conjecture at other people's expense. Crazy huh?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:50
Reality check...
Segwit is already here, slowly being adopted, hovering around 15%. If/when a couple of exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini get with the program, adoption will be over 50% in a day. Once Bitcoin Core's next release is out (0.16), segwit will also get a big boost. Segwit is already proven to streamline confirmation times and lower costs, as long as people use it. Get a wallet like Electrum, and you're good to go.
Lightning Network is 90% complete and passing its real-world tests with flying colors. Devs are saying that it will be live within a matter of weeks. 
People need to stop panicking and whining like bitches. Stop freaking the fuck out, and understand the long game. What's happening now is a pump-and-dump for BCH coupled with a spam attack to exploit the fact that miners are mining BCH over BTC because of EDA differences. 
If all you can do is whine and complain, then do yourself and the rest of us a favor. Sell your BTC and stay on the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:04:54
Yeah, that's what is going to happen. Because the market for BTC is so closed off and there's absolutely no new money pouring in from throngs of new traders, investors and even Wall st. concerns. There isn't a futures market that's about to open up for it in the first week of Dec. Or whales like Novogratz and Cuban who won't even blink at buying 20+ mil on any new dip. Nope, Ver and his cronies control the whole market, and we are at his mercy. 
You're a sharp one. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:01
Ok fair enough, I deleted my previous comments and will agree that it's not as simple. Fair enough.
But that said, let me just put it this way:
If I were a "whale", and I had a shitload of BTC on Coinbase pre-fork, and I wanted to move my coins off CB so I can access my BCH to sell off, use, whatever, and CB wouldn't give it to me, you can rest assured that CB would be seriously exposed to legal action if they didn't comply. The legal risk would force them to relent, especially if this issue were raised in a US or EU court.
It doesn't matter what their TOS or any other "agreement" would state on this. If a plaintiff were to prove that CB was acting improperly or was intent on defrauding or exploiting an accountholder by not releasing the BCH to an accountholder for coins held on account pre August 1st exposed them to undue risk or financial loss. And yeah, this would not be at all difficult, CB would have a major liability on their hands, not to mention a serious PR fiasco.
One thing I can tell you is this: Chances are pretty high that high-balance CB account holders who bitched loud enough for their pre-fork coins post August 1st, got them.
Sure, it might have required a letter or intervention from a lawyer, and probably under the condition that it happened quietly as a "customer accommodation", but they got them, let's just put it that way. There's no way that CB would risk a legal shitstorm in exchange for holding somebody's BCH until January. Nope,not gonna happen. The problem is that most CB customers just took CB's "promise" to deliver the BCH to them at face value, and didn't make much of a big deal about it afterwards.
Personally, CB is dead to me after the way they handled S2X, but that's another story.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:11:47
Funny, I just did a BTC transaction for a whole 45 cents, confirmation took a little over 3 hours. 
I wonder what I'm doing wrong. :P
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:34:00
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:58:17


Oh, I know better than you ever will. :)
 


And yeah, it's exactly that backwards mentality that keeps people from understanding the fundamental paradigm shift that has been brought on by BTC. It simply is no longer the case that "cash is king". 
BTC is by nature deflationary, not limited by geographics and not controlled by any government or central bank. Fiat currency (Cash)... ANY kind of "cash" anywhere in the world... is ALWAYS inflationary. It's just a matter of how much. 
You think cash is king? Try telling that to Venezuelans who've had their lives destroyed by the fact that their cash is now essentially worthless. Countless Venezuelans have publicly stated that if it were not for BTC, they would be totally fucked. 
Or try telling that to Argentinians who had to deal with triple digit inflation rates for decades, where the only place to get a decent exchange rate on hard currency is on the black market. 
Too many people think that "cash is king" because until recently, there was no suitable alternative, with the exception perhaps being gold. As long as you think that "cash is king", you will be profoundly missing out on BTC's most unique strength, while exposing yourself to inevitable risk and loss of purchasing power. The rest of us who already get it? Not so much. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:35:25
Sorry, you and the other commenter both merit being called out on your obvious ignorance and stupidity, but yeah... not my job to educate or inform you. Show me that you know something about the topic, and maybe we can have a discussion. Saying shit like "your blind faith" and the other guy's "the entire network will collapse" only shows me that there is no clue. 
But yeah, keep whining if you must.

@_date: 2017-11-09 14:36:44
The question is... where did you NOT go wrong? :D
First mistake: Using coinbase as your primary wallet. You should only use Coinbase/GDAX to buy/sell coins. Then, transfer them to your own wallet on your computer or phone. With your own wallet, you can set the fee per every transaction. 
Second mistake: Sending 1e  to demo to your friend.  Huh?? Who does that? What are you trying to illustrate? Using BTC to buy a pack of gum? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:04:11
That was just sad.

All this is happening because BCH is being seriously hyped to whales in S. Korea, while a lot of fake/wash trades inflate the price. The BCH cartel is doing all it can to artificially pump the price via a couple of exchanges. They're taking advantage of the mempool backlog due to low difficulty to mine BCH, where miners are churning out virtually empty BCH blocks like candy. 
The charade will end when the difficulty goes back later early Monday AM. The mempool will start clearing up because miners will get back on BTC, and then let's see what happens.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:59:49

Oh, was that an attempt at a witty retort? C for effort. :D


Thanks for proving yet again, that you're a clueless dolt who sees everything in black and white. Did I say that people should go "all-in"? Where did I say that? :D 
Calling you out on your bullshit doesn't mean that I'm telling people to be stupid with their money. I did say that it's NOT my (or YOUR) job to tell people what they should or should not do regarding BTC. I'm the one telling people to get informed and make sound decisions for themselves. You, on the other hand, are the one who blathered horseshit that had absolute no basis in fact or even sound economic principles, just so you can feel good about yourself exuding bullshit pseudo-wisdom. :D
In any case, thanks for at least admitting you are wrong, and you're welcome for the sage advice. 
Here's one more piece: Don't give advice out of your ass just for the self-flattery of it all, and you won't make yourself look like a complete fool on public pages. 
You're welcome. :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:53:06


You prefer to waste energy to banter pointlessly about things you apparently know or understand little about. Got it. 






Bitcoin in itself isn't a "business". It's not a "company". It's an open-source decentralized network. Again, your poor ability to make adequate comparisons or analogies fails you. 
The douchewads over at bitcoin cash are attempting to hijack something that's not centralized and/or controlled by any single entity, government or institution and turn it into a centralized, controlled business.  The fact that they have somebody who bears the title "CEO" is all anyone needs to know.  
If you don't see anything wrong with any of that, then congratulations, that makes you part of the problem. That makes you what I've considered you to be all along. A suckered shill and FUDster. 






Did I say that they have the ability to succeed? Uh... nope. But that doesn't mean that they're not trying their damndest. It also doesn't preclude me nor anyone else from pointing out what their obvious intentions are. They're certainly trying to take over BTC, and in the lowest, slimiest possible way. They're also doing it in a rather fraudulent way, hoping that they can dupe unwitting or uneducated newbies and get them to buy BSHIT rather than BTC, which is what they really want to do. That's all there is to know. It's not about them succeeding. It's like saying some fucker who tried to rob a house shouldn't be prosecuted because he failed to break in. 






Good. Then shut your fucking mouth about BSHIT on this sub, mmmkay? 




 
Nobody gives a rat's ass about  spot. Let all the other alts kill each other for it. Who the hell cares? 
And yeah, let's see where BSHIT is a year from now. Fuck they've already had one unannounced/unplanned fork for fuck's sake. Do you really think that the future bodes well for them? It will be deemed the most expensive crypto failure thus far. 
And what... you don't think that the devs and the brains behind BTC aren't? Do you think that they need you (or myself, or anyone for that matter) to tell them that "we can learn" from their shitty tactics? Well no fucking shit Sherlock... 
Regardless, that doesn't mean that you should speak about their supposed "merits" where it's not deserved, nor do they deserve any kind of redeeming light whatsoever. There is literally nothing positive or beneficial that the idiots at BSHIT are bringing to the table. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 
 


Wow, brilliant hypothesis. :D
I wouldn't trust BSHIT's devs to write a basic cgi script for one of my websites. And never mind that Lightning Network has already been getting plenty of tests and passing with flying colors. No need for BSHIT. Nobody wants BSHIT. Is that so hard for you to take?


Again, faulty hypothesis, so why are you kicking your dead hypothetical horse to the point of stupidity? Wait, don't answer that. :)


Yeah, I prefer to just see the bad and want anything good to stay away from the bad. When something good mingles with bad, they get unnecessary bad shit splashed all over them as a result. Not good. 


No. Again, sorry, but you really need to stop with your ridiculous hypotheses, bogus analogies and bizarrely stupid comparisons. You truly do suck at making arguments with those devices. And even if any of them rang remotely true, it would still not make all the BSHIT baggage worth it. You talk as if we're dealing with two evenly-staffed teams with similar talents, resources and skills, and that's utterly ridiculous. 
 






Oh no, I don't hang out in scammy, lying-ass subs. You won't find me there. But hey, you knock yourself out. :D


I'm not worried at all. But it doesn't mean I should applaud assholes who are fucking shit up for other people while desperately, manically trying to bring it down. Fuck that, and quite frankly fuck you if choose to give them the time of day. 
Anything else you wanna cover?  Or are you just going to keep bantering on and on ad nauseum? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:40






 
Just trust me, I know more about it than you do. Especially since I saw my entire nut vaporize during the '08 meltdown. 
 






Again, you have no idea what you're talking about. There are plenty of developing world countries that are having MAJOR currency issues. India, which accounts for about 1/6th of the entire world's population, is still reeling from its demonetization clusterfuck from last year. Look at what's happening in various countries in Africa and Latin America, and you'll soon figure out that fiat doesn't work nearly as "issue-free" as you purport it to be. 


That only really works if inflation stays at a rate that economists deem "healthy". That healthy range is under 2% a year. Anything over that, voids the benefits of inflation vs. debt in simple terms. What also complicates the situation is the rate of debt being accumulated by the government and/or its central bank. BTC doesn't depend on any outside factors to thrive. It's by nature deflationary which means it acts as a counter-force to all the inflationary mechanisms of any economy, even supposedly healthy ones in industrialized countries. 


Yep, we'll see. Remember this conversation. :)


The real problem lies in people saying shit that they have no idea what they're actually talking about. You know, like you just did.

You surely don't comprehend facts nor logic, therefore any further debate with you is nothing more than a waste. You're convinced of your idiotic "theory" to the point that you'll talk yourself in circles to defend it. You haven't made one factual or verifiable citation and even went as far as misrepresenting what the detailed comment I posted even says about tether. So really, just stop. :)

Some opinions are better than others. When you base your opinions on facts and substance, there's a far higher chance that your opinion will end up being more valid than say, someone who bases theirs on complete utter horseshit. See how that works? If you still require clarification, go discuss opinions with anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and creationists, let me know how that goes for you. :)

If you have BTC in a wallet on Coinbase from pre-August 1st, and you transfer the BTC off CB to another wallet, then you should be able to access your BCH immediately. At least that's the way I understand it.

Not at all a fan or supporter of Tether, but in their defense, they do claim to have an equal amount of USD backing all tethers that have been issued and are in circulation, kept in an account that is audited regularly by an independent auditor, FWIW.

BSHIT is trying to ride on the coattails of BTC in the most arrogant, underhanded way possible. They're also trying to destroy BTC in the process, which is self-defeating and yes, evil and greedy. 
BTC doesn't need any of that shit to thrive, it's doing it anyway, but BSHIT's existence is a detriment to newbies and impressionable people who may get screwed and have their taste for BTC and other REAL cryptos soured for life. 
You're wrong.

He said fiat in general. If he meant USD, probably should have said that. And the USD is eroding on the markets. Down almost 10% since last year. Expect its value to just deteriorate further as the Trump/GOP-orchestrated batshit starts slamming the US economy big time next year.

A mempool clogged with low fee transactions increases the normal fees for everyone else. If you want your transaction to rise to the top of the heap to get confirmed first, you have to pay a much higher fee. That's the goal of the spam attack.

Not everyone is part of the problem. There are some bad actors who let greed, arrogance and power trips go to their heads that are fucking up shit for everyone. The good news is that BTC is pretty damn resilient, and just keeps getting better with every challenge. The devs who get it are with BTC, the critical mass is behind BTC, that's not going to change, nor should it just because some douchebags try to game the system that was created for BTC and other cryptos to thrive in the first place.

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:03:17
Funny, I use BTC almost every damn day, even when fees are high. I prioritize my transactions, and the ones that can wait, I lower the fees. On the priority ones, I pay whatever the fee is, OR I use a transaction accelerator like ConfirmTX. Why? Because it's still worth it to me to do that than deal with a fucked up bank and bullshit fiat. 
There are a lot of BTC users, holders and traders who understand the big picture, and adjust their usage of BTC accordingly. The mempool is high because BTC it's essentially being spammed while being somewhat deprived of the normal level of hashpower by Jihan and co. They're doing this exactly to make people complain about BTC. So people who do that are playing right into their hands. 
Again, people have to know the game they're in. Otherwise, sit it out and quit whining. There's a revolution going on with or without you.

Your first fatal mistake was trading btc vs alts. It's a common one, and most people trading that way get burned big time. You should have been doing low-risk trading with BTC as your base currency for currency pairs and Gold-USD. It would have made all the difference in the world.

Mempool is being still being spammed. # of unconfirmed transactions was going down steadily until about an hour ago, when it spiked by about 30k transactions. Now it's being spammed periodically with hundreds of identical transactions made to the same wallet addresses to keep the backlog going on. It's obviously a desperate attempt to trip up BTC and create chaos and mayhem.  Don't fall for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:37:16
What you do? Don't be so fucking gullible and impressionable. That's a good start. 
BTC is doing just fine as it is, and it will only keep getting better, more efficient and more innovative with time. If you prefer to side lamer Schiff who talks from both sides of his mouth when it comes to BTC, do us all a favor and stick with gold. Trust me, nobody will care. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:17:55
Keep it in BTC, and spend it/invest it. Convert to fiat in relatively small amounts only if needed to spend.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:49:34
Don't worry, it won't be long before the FUDsters claim that the stolen tethers are propping up BTC's price. :D
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:01:59


Yeah, so bitcoin's survival is dependent on any exchange not crashing, and people not being stupid enough to leave their money on it. Listen to yourself. :D
Kraken has been having all kinds of problems for the last few weeks. To the point that people are jumping ship in droves. Hmmm... wonder what effect that had on BTC hitting its ATH yesterday.  :o
 


It might affect you in the short term, as the market absorbs any fallout or losses caused by an insolvent exchange. But to say that any one exchange's susceptibility to failure is somehow detrimental to Bitcoin's survival is ridiculous. That's the whole point of having a decentralized, anti-fragile, fungible and censorship-resistant system like BTC has. Figure it out. 


Exactly, there's no proof, and it's all ridiculous conjecture and speculation. And again... even if Tethers WERE being gamed, and melted down, it would still have little or no effect on BTC. Especially on the long-term. 


Sure it is. Don't be concerned about anything speculative and exaggerated. When there's real data and facts that support any kind of issue being a threat to BTC, sure. Until then... quit spreading FUD maybe? :)
 


You have no idea how I play it, but thanks for the lame lecture. 
Unlike you, I'm all about facts and substantial data. I'm also able to discern between two entirely separate issues. What may be bad or risky for Tether has little or no bearing on BTC, just because some traders used it to buy BTC. It's not like the only "exit" from BTC is Tether, and vice versa. And that will never be the case. So again, keep shit real, and stop spreading FUD on the basis of bias, conjecture and pure speculation, as well as ignorance of the actual facts. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:24:47

Are you fucking kidding? I'm citing the guy's article because it says almost exactly what I've ascertained on the situation on my own. Saves me a lot of typing and going back and forth with clueless idiots. :)


Like I always say, it's not an insult if it's true. You are proving beyond a doubt that you're a clueless, gullible fuck AND a FUD spreader. And yeah, I'm making plenty of points while calling you that, you big fucking crybaby. 


I'm not defending tether in the least, my main point is that what ultimately happens with tether, in ANY case, will have little or no effect on BTC's state. If you still don't get that, you're in denial of facts, mathematics, and logic. That's why you're being called out for your stupidity. 


Not with BTC. Maybe with other low-volume shitcoins whose meager volume may be directly affected by the the trading of it underwritten by tether, sure. But NOT Bitcoin. 


Yep, including you. :)


Well, that's what this FUD campaign is surely trying to do. Not working, but yeah, it's fucking annoying as hell seeing the same shit posted all over this sub for the sole reason to raise FUD. 


Dude, you can barely write a coherent sentence, now you want to impress me with your "studies"? Really? :)
And yeah, BTC is so shaky, it hit another ATH a few hours ago. :D


Yes, it's pure speculation, and the market doesn't give a fuck about your utter stupidity. But hey, keep trying to freak people out over nothing, you're doing an amazing job so far. Keep it up, and BTC will hit 9k by midnight. :D
 


Nobody cares what you believe, especially since you clearly have no clue how the markets even work. This shit was attempted a week ago with a major FUD/smear campaign, along with an unprecedented mempool spamming attack. The price dropped alright, the idiots thought that BCH was going to take over. Panic ensued. Then BTC hit two ATH's within days after it. 
Oops. :P


Ok, so sell, and sit it out. And shutup on this sub while you're at it. We won't mind. :)
Yeah, thank buddha that the real world doesn't depend on idiots on Reddit for trading advice. :D


Again, if you act like a clueless douche, you'll be called such by me. You've yet to make one single coherent argument. All you've done thus far is continue to spread needless, baseless FUD, which at least now you clearly admit is pure speculation, and unfounded on anything factual or even remotely logical. 
Stop being a FUD-spewing asswipe, and maybe you'll get "insulted" less while being called out with facts, logic and substance. See how that works? Probably not. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:09:33
You don't have to cash out to do all that. In fact, cashing out denies you future growth of your capital, not to mention returns which will only continue for the foreseeable future, based on even the most conservative models. 
To cash out of a store of value and yes currency that's truly deflationary, to a fiat currency that will just erode and degrade over time is mathematically and logically stupid. And all to do what...  to end up paying unnecessary taxes and to see a bunch of zeroes on a bank statement? :D
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:14:57

How do you know why people are getting into BTC? Do you think everyone is getting into it strictly to get rich?? Sure, a lot of opportunists are jumping on board, so the fuck what?? Many of them will quickly realize the incredible power and value of a decentralized, trustless currency/asset that you and ONLY you control. It's a no fucking brainer! The ones who don't "believe" in BTC but still want to own it for whatever reason? Again, so the fuck what? That's the beautiful thing about BTC, it doesn't matter what you do or don't do with it. It doesn't affect anyone else in the grand scheme of things. Fiat on the other hand?

It's not expensive or slow to people who fucking get it, and know how to use it and leverage it properly. I've never had a problem with a particular transaction, even when I paid the minimum fee while the mempool was overloaded. So the receiving wallet receives the transaction within 1-2 minutes 99% of the time and has to wait a few hours for the confirmations. Big fucking whoop.

@_date: 2017-11-08 09:09:24


Yeah, I'm the one on drugs around here. :D
 


 


"Google search 'volatile' "? Are you fucking kidding me??? :D
FFS, what the hell am I dealing with here? This is hilariously insane! :)
Um, hello??? I've been trading forex for years. You're going to tell me what "volatile" is? Really? :)
And...I also understand the difference between short-term volatility and long-term volatility, apparently better than you do. 
Let me take just a couple of minutes to help illustrate my point to you. :) 
Just look at the fucking monthly charts for BTCUSD vs USD vs any other currency or even the Euro vs any other currency, and tell me what's more volatile to you in the long-term. I went through the trouble of uploading screenshots of my active charts, just for you. 
First, let's look at a few USD major currency pairs' monthly charts, just for shits and giggles: 
EURUSD: 
GBPUSD: 
AUDUSD: 
USDJPY: 
Now, let's look at BTCUSD, shall we?  
 
Again... Case. Fucking. Closed. 


Actually, that's not at all what I said. What I did say was that even at BTC's price today, it's still a FAR better proposition than keeping your money in some shitty fiat currency that's just going to keep degrading in its buying power at the rate of 3+% average per year (and that's if we're talking about the USD or EUR, let's not even talk about other currencies that are inflating at FAR higher rates, ok?)
Never mind the fact that all mathematical indicators clearly demonstrate that BTC hasn't even scratched the surface of what its true market cap potential is, especially when compared to other store of value vehicles like gold. And... never mind the fact that anyone who invested $1000 in BTC this time last year would now have around $9000 for it. Which, if they continue to HODL the majority of that, should only continue to grow. 
As for your point about forks "going terrible", answer me this: 
How many forks has BTC survived to date? And isn't it clear by now that BTC just gets stronger and better each and every time one happens? The 2X fork is no different, BTC  will come out of this stronger and badder-asser than ever before. Why? Because it has consensus, the technology and a global network of core developers who know their shit. It also has the global critical mass that no other coin can touch. That's not going to change any time soon. 
Support for B2X is waning by the hour, miner signaling is now well below 80% and falling like a rock as miners and exchanges pull their collective heads out of their asses and realize that sticking to this dogshit deal is akin to shooting themselves in the foot. While there's always a chance that something can go to shit due to a fork, the risk is far more on the side of the shitcoin that's being forked rather than on BTC's side. Let's keep shit real, and stop with the needless FUD, ok?


Ok, that was an utterly stupid statement. HILARIOUSLY stupid. :D
Tell me, what "deflationary commodity" existed before BTC. After all, anyone can do it. Give me say... three examples of successful ones. Waiting. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:46:22
It's not speculation. It's what is happening. Watch the incoming transactions on blockchain and you can see for yourself.

@_date: 2017-11-27 10:36:10
Why do you feel the need to whine about your personal dilemma regarding whether or not you should sell off your BTC? Again, nobody cares. If you think you should sell,then you clearly don't even get the game you're in to begin with. So yeah, sell and watch from the sidelines with your silly fiat monopoly money. Nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:39

@_date: 2017-11-14 03:24:39
We'll just have to wait and see what happens when the mempool goes back to normal, won't we?
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:33:56


Which is essentially the same thing I've been saying. Tether is not BTC, it doesn't fucking matter what happens to Tether in regards to BTC's overall health and viability. 
   &gt; Now ask yourself this, would a company that is operating fraudulently have a roadmap of all these new features that no one will ever use if they don’t provide these promised audits as they say they will by the end of the year?


That's pure speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:50:09
Pretty sure Coinbase is legally obligated to release "pre-fork" coins if you withdraw post August 1. To not do so basically exposes them to all kinds of legal bullshit and complaints of fraud/deception that would drown them, particularly in the US. They already dodged a major legal bullet with the way they handled S2X, so I doubt that Coinbase would want to expose themselves to a class-action lawsuit because they think they can float BCH that can effectively be argued is not even legally theirs. 
Personally, I don't understand why anyone kept any btc on Coinbase prior to the fork, that was just stupid, let's not even get into that. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:35:20
Shut the FUD up. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:17:46
Yep, you learned the hard way. People have only been saying for years that trying to daytrade BTC and/or other cryptos is just a losing proposition in the long run. It's painfully obvious, yet some boneheads think that they are making money by losing $5k one week, then making back $2k the next week. It's pathetic and yeah, it affects the entire market with unnecessary volatility, not to mention enriches exchanges who are more than happy to make money from traders' stupidity. 
Hope others read and heed your painful life lesson, sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:11:39
Sell, be stupid. Nobody cares.

You don't have to become a millionaire to become financially independent with BTC. It all depends on what you do with it. A lot of people are buying it not because they want to get rich, but because they despise the current financial and banking systems and see BTC/blockchain as a better way to manage and grow their wealth. My only regret is not doing it sooner than I did. 
But thanks for your totally inept post anyway.

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:07:19
Many of the transactions flooding the mempool are spam transactions, probably being initiated by the same miners who are churning out empty BCH blocks like candy. This is all part of a larger agenda, designed to artificially pump BCH while creating FUD for BTC. Don't fall for it. If you don't have to do a transaction today, don't. If you do, use your own wallet where you control the fees, and use a transaction acceleration service like confirmtx if you need to do something fast. Just stop bitching about confirmation times already.

As for people who only make a few dollars a day, they will adopt easily once segwit and LN are fully up and running. BTC is an ever-evolving technology, speed and efficiency will increase over time, and cost will decrease. So don't worry about them. Funny how despite the supposedly outrageously high fees, BTC is gaining wide usage in the developing world for things like remittances, protecting savings, and dealing with home currency (hyper)inflation. So don't worry about people in the developing world, they're smarter and savvier than you'll ever be when it comes to using BTC. :)

No, but it will surely bring over-inflated stock values back to Earth.

Technically, they're supposed to give you pre-fork coins on a withdrawal if you had those coins in your CB wallet pre-fork. But there's no guarantee that they will do that automatically. You can rest assured that CB has a ton of account holders complaining right now that they don't want to wait until Jan 2018 to access their coins. Whether CB acts on it or not, is an entirely different story. Threatening legal action, if it's worth it to you, is probably the best bet.

You must be functionally illiterate. Here's what he says:
*Now ask yourself this, would a company that is operating fraudulently have a roadmap of all these new features that no one will ever use if they don’t provide these promised audits as they say they will by the end of the year?
So as of now they have enough runway until the end of the year. I say we give Tether/Finex the benefit of the doubt.
While Tether could be operating fractionally (so to could any exchange in crypto btw), there is no proof or evidence of it today. It trades at normalized rates. You can’t just create 100’s of million of dollars without the marketing realizing somewhere.
Sure, you can say this is a confidence game, but so is crypto, so is the USD, so is the concept of money. I see no reason to be more concerned with this risk than the already risky environment we trade in with exchanges.*


Also from the post I referred, and I concur:
*WHAT IF I”M WRONG? CRYPTO WILL IMPLODE!
No it won’t. Sure there will be a dip maybe even a correction, but there are only 395 million Tethers* (now 640+ million). *People will get out of Tether even at massive discounts (until $0) into crypto because they can’t get USD, but not more than the 395 million tethers circulating (at this time).
At a certain discount people will understand what is going on and stop trading for Tether. BTC + ETH is worth over $100 billion, how many time does the entire amount of USDT have to turn over to cause a massive crash?
What will get hit the hardest are the people left holding tether (if/when they implode) and Trex/Polo/Finex.
To think Polo/Trex would rely so much on USDT that they didn’t fully vet it is absurd as well. Whats more likely, Polo/Trex’s due diligence or this  person based on conjecture?
I’ve already seen a Forbes contributor try and get ahold of Bitfinexed on twitter. 
Could I be wrong about all of this??? Of course, but, I feel I have provided more evidence than the other side. You are the Judge :)*
You claiming that tethers will cause "instability" in the crypto space is pure, unadulterated (and unproven) horseshit. You also seem to think that the entire BTC market (which is now well over $100Billion) is somehow propped up by $640 or so million worth of tether. Come on... :D
It's utterly ridiculous, and again, the only people who are vulnerable to any meltdown of tether are those who keep tethers in their accounts, which quite frankly serves no purpose, so therefore stupid and exposing them to needless risk in any case. 
It's that simple. If an exchange melts down over anything tether-related the fallout will be limited to that exchange and its customers. Did Mt. Gox's collapse kill BTC? Nope. Same difference. 


Nah, not sticking my head in the sand. No need to. It's what happens when you can intelligently understand the facts and realities associated with this issue, and not jump to harebrained conclusions, then try to spread FUD on account of it. You know, like what you're doing right now. Again, if you spread groundless FUD without even bothering to understand the relevant facts and realities that counter it, you shall get called out on it by people like me. I for one, can clearly see the narrative being perpetrated by Ver/Wu/Fake Satoshi, and they're desperately trying to scare the shit out of people with this tether issue. And you, being either a gullible rube, unwitting or useful idiot, or like I said before, just a plain ol' clueless dumbshit, wish to continue pushing that narrative, then can't understand why you're getting bitchslapped. 
So yeah, really... just shut the FUCK up. :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:19:37
I know you know, it still needed to be said anyway to give context and perspective to what you said in your comment, since a lot of people still apparently have no idea what BTC's actual market cap is. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:08:34
Yes, as long as you're not a US resident/citizen, BTC is an option to deposit to Skrill, there's a 1% fee. Just be aware that you won't be able to access those funds originating via BTC using the Skrill debit card. But you can use it to pay others via Skrill, and or withdraw, etc. It's an annoying wrinkle that I just found out about the hard way. :P
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:22:55
Um, son? I'm probably older than you, boy. :D
And thanks for your ridiculously oversimplified and yeah, silly response. 
Also... thanks for indirectly agreeing with me that any inflation over 2% per year is not considered particularly good for an economy. Hyperinflation, btw is not what happens over 2%. It is an extreme circumstance when inflation reaches high double and even triple digits over an extended period of time. 
But that's NOT what happens when inflation runs high, as in over 2% per year, but well below hyperinflation rates. When inflation is this high, it steadily eats away at an economy's overall growth in various ways. Especially when workers' wages and commodity prices aren't adjusted for inflation.  
Check out this handy-dandy chart, and you'll see what inflation has been for the US over the last century or so:
You'll see that with just a few exceptions, the average annual inflation rate has been well over 2% a year. In fact, the annual average is 3.18% between 1913 and 2015. This clearly means that overall, the US economy has been working inefficiently for well over a century. 
Now, let's talk about deflation:
Most economists agree that deflation is only considered a bad thing when it's happening in an economy that is heavily dependent on debt. The problem lies in the fact that fiat currency-based economies accumulate debt regardless of how well or efficiently its home economy is functioning. BTC is a game-changer because it's a deflationary currency that can still function well in a debt-laden economy. 
In the case of an economy that has been incurring rather high overall inflation rates for say, oh, the last 100 years... deflation is actually a good thing to happen because it reverses trends and gives workers and consumers more buying power, while lowering prices that were only increasing due to high inflation. It's really that simple. 
And why is that? 
There are many reasons, but a good one is because the currency can still increase in overall value/purchasing power, while keeping high inflation at bay (healthy inflation can still continue at 1-2% if other economic conditions warrant, and the government doesn't increase its national debt too much). 
All the while, BTC continues to increase in value and scarcity due to its structure. It also can't be manipulated like fiat currencies can. Central banks have a lot to do with how much or how little inflation there is because it controls the floodgates of credit to banks and borrowers. 
Bitcoin doesn't have or even need any such control on the debt-side of whatever economy it's being utilized in, so it's simply not affected by debt or any of the effects of debt on a national or even global economy. 
And in case you haven't figured it out yet, this is exactly why central banks and certain governments are shitting in their boots about BTC. It changes the game entirely for the wealthy elites. Deflation becomes a tool of advantage for the average consumer/wage-earner, while hurting the game that banks and governments play with their currencies and debt. 
Anything else you wanna know, boy? :)

You do realize that there are tons of people who will jump all over BTC if the price drops, right? Are you factoring them in your "fucking dog" prophecy? Are you taking into account that Coinbase alone has over 800,000 new customers over just the last three weeks of August? How many of those new investors are new "whales" who will not blink an eye at buying BTC at any price, because  they can confidently forecast where the price is going to be 5-10 years from now?

Are you kidding? I cash out of as much or as little btc as I need, literally on demand. I actively trade forex with my btc and have been making enough to live on, and travel extensively for the past year. Cashing out to pay my expenses and bills has NEVER been a problem. All it takes is a good exchange and good debit card with an Iban and no currency exchange fees. Done. 
Incidentally, I have a friend who just bought a $100k yacht with btc. Literally transferred it to the seller's wallet in a matter of minutes, and the entire transaction cost him a whopping $1.12. No exchange or cash conversion needed. The seller will more than likely just keep the bulk of that money in BTC for the foreseeable future. Why? Because he simply has no reason to "cash it out".
Let's stop with the nonsense please. BTC is easy to liquidate pretty much at any human level without affecting the entire marketplace.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:34:30

But hey, let's run with this. What would constitute a "significant non monetary use" to you that Bitcoin can't do? Enlighten us. 
I've only been living off of Bitcoin for the past year and a half or so, what do I know? :) 
"U know nothing about economics, it has a perfectly definable difference in this regard."
Yet again, you make an utterly stupid assertion without knowing a thing about me. I've already underscored my points behind why what the OP said was utterly stupid.

"U are like many other bitcoiners that think because Bitcoin is awesome and ur friends don't understand why, that u are a guru on economics."

Considering that you can increasingly use bitcoin to buy goods and services more and more everyday, as well as send money and exchange value with/to others directly without the need for exchanges, your claim is utterly bogus. There is hardly a need to "cash out" of BTC. In fact, it makes more and more economic sense to keep your wealth in BTC with each coming day.

Coinbase is having some issues with SEPA. I actually had to wait 6 days for a withdrawal to arrive, which is the longest time Coinbase EVER took to process a SEPA withdrawal. On their status page, they show a "partial outage" for SEPA transactions, but offer no explanation. I saw it before I made the withdrawal, and did it anyway. I didn't expect there to be such a long delay. 
I suspect that your transaction will get completed in due time. From now on, I will always check their status page before doing another withdrawal.

I'm not mad, just a bit perplexed at how some people can't understand the game that they're in. Bitcoin is a concept that requires a paradigm shift for people to entirely understand. Just jumping on the bandwagon for the sake of being on it isn't enough. Once you understand that this is the future, whether people like it or not, and yes.. a profound revolution in how society functions, both now and in the future, it all becomes real to you. This is why the now obsolete banking/finance industry is shitting itself. This is why corrupt governments are starting to realize that they no longer have the control that they used to have. If they understand the realities, tell me. Why don't you?

"...clearly... ... factually... ... obviously... no uncertain terms... You are so full of yourself."
Typical response by someone who doesn't like to get called out on their obviously false and biased horseshit. Don't worry, I see it a lot on my FB and Twitter. :)
"And passive aggressive, insulting strangers while pretending to have some kind of moral highground using smilies and "friendly suggestions"."
But see, that's just the thing, I do have the moral edge on this particular discussion. That's because I'm sticking to facts and not catering to biases, which you clearly are. Case closed, you lose. Learn from it. 
"I thought you had something interesting to say, but you blew it man. Your true colors are shining through."
That's ok, you're just butthurt because what you believed was false, cognitive dissonance is a bitch. Your true colors shined through with your first comment. Quit whining, confirm stuff before posting, and again... learn from what happened. Whiny little bitch. :D

*slow clap* *standing*
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:38:35
Another point I'd like to make. In the long run, it doesn't really matter what the value of BTC is, because people don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin to benefit from it. They can buy it in any increment and still be able to effectively benefit from having it vs. not having it. As more and more countries and markets adapt it, it will be easier to spend and use, thus increasing its utility. Which brings me back to the original point I made, no matter how you slice it, it will still be part of the "real economy" in some way, shape or form. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:30:47
Yeah, I don't know anything about economics. :D 
Hate to break this to you,  but I do. That's why I know it's stupid shit. Bitcoin is an asset class like ANY OTHER asset class. It's STILL part of the "real economy" no matter how you slice it. Just like gold is, just like platinum, just like any other asset class whose value is determined by its market. You can both HOLD bitcoin and use it, you can use it as a base currency for any future investments you make, you can also stuff it under the proverbial mattress (like many people do with cash). Cash is probably the most hoarded asset in existence and yet it's INflationary. Imagine that... 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:47:06
Second stupidest thing I've read all day. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:08:15
Allow me to dissect... :)
"Sure thing. Bitcoin has been on the radar screen of major governments and financial institutions for a number of years now. They've accumulated majority position. The run-up it is a classic speculative bubble that just had a blow off to 5000. The whales got in a long time ago."
No shit sherlock. But you seem to fail to understand something pretty significant. The whole scenario of a "classic speculative bubble" doesn't apply to Bitcoin and the dynamics behind its growth at all. It's a whole new and different ballgame. 
Bitcoin has already established itself as an asset class that's in a league of its own. With much more value, utility and value that can't be dictated by a central entity or bank. And the fact that only about 10 million people in the world own bitcoin at all is evidence enough that it's still well in its infancy. Blockchain technology is not only here to stay, it's proving itself to be resilient, reliable and yeah disruptive on so many levels. Bitcoin has not only paved the way for all this, it's proven to be the gold standard of the disruption. It doesn't matter how many "whales" are involved or looking to cash out, it will continue to grow and expand in ways that you can't even comprehend yet. Especially once the next steps in its evolution take hold, namely LN and Segwit. 
"Big money governs the direction."
Yes, that game works for stocks, where a particular market can be cornered and/or dominated by a chosen few. Bitcoin? Not so much. :)
"The price action has become more in line with institutional manipulation this year accordingly."
Many experts will readily disagree with you on that. In fact, it's been proven many a time that efforts to manipulate BTC beyond any short-term has failed miserably. 
"Even if some so-called whales come on board while the price is dropping, it is the majority insiders selling on the way down that will take precedence."
Again, nobody cares. I sure as hell don't, because there is and will be for a long time to come, a never-ending line of new adopters, users and yes, traders who will gladly buy it all up, and keep the price from crashing through the floor. Just wait until there's acceptance in the developing world, this shit's going to absolutely explode. 
"As for this idea that bitcoin is going to save Joe six pack, that viewpoint fails to consider that the existing wealthy incumbent parties have already made substantial land grabs in bitcoin."
Land grabs, so 19th century. :D
"This ensures there will be no subversion of existing economic structures."
The subversion has already happened, dumbass. People like me saw the light years ago, and have taken the plunge, NEVER to go back to the world of fiat, manipulated money and corrupt financial sectors. And soon, billions of other people will see the light too.  
But hey, enjoy your dwindling-value fiat while we laugh at you. :)

Can you do that to send money ANYWHERE IN THE FUCKING WORLD? FOR FUCKING PENNIES?? Without getting raped with fees, inflation and foreign exchange commissions?? 
Let me help with that. No. You can't. 
And that's not even the beginning as to why BTC is destroying banking as we know it. Yet, you are here whining about confirmation times. You're so short-sighted it's laughable. 
So again... waaaaa, Keep crying about "long confirmation times even though you see the funds arrive in your wallet almost instantly, you big fucking baby. 
If you think that transferring money with banks is so awesome, then stick with banks then you pathetic sheeple. You obviously don't even get what BTC is all about.  And people with a lame mentality like yours will probably never get it. 
So, go ahead. Keep paying banks ridiculous fees so they can control and manipulate your money. Keep losing value to inflation. Keep allowing governments and central banks to determine how much YOUR money is worth. Just quit whining like a bitch here. Good?

Coinbase is hardly a monopoly. They're just one of the easier ways to get Bitcoin, and if they try to steer people to 2x with their own goals in mind, the market will not react well to that in the long run. People aren't becoming Coinbase customers in order to be told what to do by them. Coinbase was my first account when I got into BTC, and since then they've tried to steer me to use Bitcoin Unlimited instead of core. I immediately saw through it, and made me want to educate myself even more about what is happening with Bitcoin. People who jump on the bandwagon will want to get independent information before they make any decisions, and yeah, people are going to stick with the REAL Bitcoin because that is what got them interested in the first place. These guys who are trying to monopolize or take control of an asset class that is sure to explode will come to understand the hard way that the tricks that worked in centralized banking and the finance world won't work with BTC and crypto in general.

Ok listen people, stop fucking whining about confirmation times. You know the transaction is going to be confirmed. The receiving wallet will still see the transaction show up within 1-2 minutes of being sent by the payer, if that. So if the mempool is backed up, or you payed an uber-low network fee or if Mercury is in retrograde, whatever... and it's taking a while for the confirmations to happen,  again... SO THE FUCK WHAT?!?!?!?
You KNOW that it will get confirmed in due time. Do you understand that they will ALWAYS start getting confirmations in a few hours in 99% of the cases no matter how much you paid or how backed up the mempool is??? 
People need to stop whining about this. It's probably the most annoying thing on this sub that people  are constantly whining about confirmations. Oy vey... stop! It's such a waste of time and space already.

Get ANY prepaid visa/mastercard that has low fees, and a currency exchange fee of 1% or less (they DO exist). If you're in Europe, a lot of cards have an IBAN attached to them (like a bank account), so you can easily convert your BTC via an exchange to EUR and then send it directly to your card via SEPA. I've been doing it this way for the past year, and it works like a charm, and my costs are minimal. I'm traveling all over the world on it.

His analysis doesn't take into account some very important details: 
1. Economies of scale, as bitcoin's growth becomes more pervasive and globalized, costs will continue to decrease. 
2. Decreasing energy costs/increasing energy efficiency. Thanks to the rapid expansion and declining cost of wind/solar the cost of electricity will continue to decline over the coming years. 
3. Addition of more and more bitcoin nodes on existing computers and networks that aren't mining will further expand the cost distribution, and decrease the energy cost per transaction even lower. 
So IMO Bitcoin is not only sustainable, there is practically no real downside.

OMG 10 minutes??? That's horrible!!!! :/
Funny how most of my transactions happen within a minute to show up in my wallet. Confirmations start popping up in 30 minutes or so after that, and that's with paying the absolute minimum fee.
Here's the thing: If the confirmations take 1 hour or even 6 hours... WHO THE FUCK CARES?!?! You know it's going to get confirmed, you know you have the BTC in your wallet. So why not just shut the fuck up and wait for it to confirm already? Compared to the time it takes for funds to become available in a bank or a credit card merchant account (not to mention the ridiculous fees involved), it's a no-fucking brainer. People need to stop whining about confirmation times,  seriously.

The transactions themselves are practically instantaneous you big baby. I've yet to see a transaction not show up in the receiving wallet in more than 2 minutes. Guess what? That means the transaction went through. Now the matter of CONFIRMING it takes a bit more time. The few hours or so that it may take is irrelevant. Compare it to waiting for a check to clear, but with BTC transactions you KNOW that the funds have been received, as opposed to the possibility of a check bouncing. Get it???

Just zoom out on the chart and quit worrying and whining. If you're that nervous about BTC's short-term price moves, then you probably shouldn't be in this game. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:11:37
Funny thing is I pretty much do... Loser! :D
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:22:54
And... so...? 
Finland does have a constitution and it also signed on to the treaties to become part of the EU.  Nothing else needs to be said now, does it? 
Case closed, now go have yourself some Salmiakki until you pass out on the train home. :)

That's happened to you how many times? Once out of how many transactions? So now you're going to panic about confirmation time every single time now?? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:00:24
Uh, because that's what is, maybe? And maybe, you should educate yourself on the actual topic before posting something as ignorant and mindless as this? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:11:28
Yeah, Madrid is just enforcing its national constitution that the Catalonians ratified and agreed to back in 1978, that's all.

Bitcoin IS blockchain. Everything that extends from the original blockchain technology brought to reality by Bitcoin shall always be correlation to what is happening with Bitcoin. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to reinvent the wheel.

Wow, somebody needs to take a basic economics class. :D
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:42:36
I like functional societies. Governments are a part of that whether we like it or not. Not all governments are "bad". But if your ideology forces you to oversimplify complex concepts and issues, then maybe you just need to work on your ideology. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:57:57
No, Spain has the law and constitution on their side. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:04:53
I'm not mad, just a bit perplexed at how some people can't understand the game that they're in. Bitcoin is a concept that requires a paradigm shift for people to entirely understand. Just jumping on the bandwagon for the sake of being on it isn't enough. Once you understand that this is the future, whether people like it or not, and yes.. a profound revolution in how society functions, both now and in the future, it all becomes real to you. This is why the now obsolete banking/finance industry is shitting itself. This is why corrupt governments are starting to realize that they no longer have the control that they used to have. If they understand the realities, tell me. Why don't you?
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:53:03
FFS, anyone who banks with any big bank needs to grow a fucking brain and close their accounts LAST FUCKING WEEK. Go to a credit union or a well-reputed community bank (if there isn't a credit union available to you) and give them ALL your fucking banking business. You can rest assured that these guys will not fuck with you the way the big banks do with all their customers every single fucking day of the week. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:34:13
Yeah, thanks for the advice, I'll take it under advisement, with the cautionary note that it's coming from a dipshit. 
So have you done any research yet? Let me guess... :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:52:55
Keep kicking that dead horse of an argument loser. You think I expect you to                                                        be able to understand sarcasm now? :D 
Anyway, good luck with your alt/shit coins and your awesome banks. See how far it gets you. You obviously don't understand what's happening with BTC,  so yeah, cash out asap and switch to alts. Do us all that favor. 
Seriously this is fucking hilarious. Is it so hard to just admit that you're too much of an idiot to admit that you're making much ado out of nothing? That you're whining like a bitch about a total non-issue? Oh wait, you're too ignorant and stupid to get that, that's right... :D
And again, thanks for the laughs. Seriously, watching idiots like you do mental cartwheels to the point of self-defeat is entertaining as hell. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:08:23
Yeah, you win. Every single "war" in history has been necessary and required to create new "independent" nations. Got it. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:39:51
Yep, and never mind that the reason Catalonia thrived since Franco's death is because of the Spanish government, its infrastructure, its military and NATO and the economic framework that allowed it to thrive into the relatively wealthy region that it is. Now, they just want to claim that they don't need Spain, or the EU, or that they don't owe them anything?
Fantasy land indeed...
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:32:57
What constitutes a "subset" of a population?  
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:39:11
You just need to "get it". Once you do, it will all become clear to you. If you look at Bitcoin as strictly as an investment opportunity, you will never get it. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:49:03
Yeah, as if you know anything about me. Just because I understand the basics of civil society doesn't make me a slave. You're just whining because I and others on this thread didn't fall for your assclown philosophies lock stock and barrel like your gullible, pathetic ass did. Go showcase your ignorance and stupidity somewhere else. Good? :)

Another idiot who will be jumping out of a 20th story window a couple of years from now. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:05:53
 Being direct and blunt isn't being hostile or barbed. You don't need to kiss people's asses to get a point across. Sometimes being direct and blunt is just more efficient. Telling people to not whine about confirmations and understand that their transactions WILL get confirmed in due time is the point. It is a constructive point. Complaining about confirmation times is stupid and pointless. Give me a fucking break already. 
But thanks for the lecture, dad. :D
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:32:27
Get it through your head. You don't have to sell bitcoin. You can make bitcoin your default currency and simply BUY fiat currency whenever you need to. Why is that still such a hard concept for people to grasp??

BTC isn't about buying coffee. You clearly don't get it. Read up a bit on what BTC is all about, and then maybe you will. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:27:39
They don't get it. Tell them to educate themselves. Read Satoshi's whitepaper, and maybe watch a few explainer videos. It's not your job to educate them, but you can point them to good information, which is readily out there.

@_date: 2017-10-25 08:49:21
People who get blinded by greed, arrogance and stupidity pull shit like this. Powers that be in banking/finance saw an opportunity to try to gain an upper hand by tapping into it, et voila, you have this shitshow. 
But at the end of the day, it's all ok. 
It shows the true colors of the fuckheads behind Coinbase, Xapo,  Bitpay and any other company that chooses to become corporate whores to gain control of BTC, rather than understand why BTC is what it is today, and just continue growing with it, and profiting from it. 
As far as I'm concerned, come hell or high water, any company or individual that sticks with B2X is dead to me. 
And BTC will thrive without them, rest assured. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:24:18
Find a good local credit union, and move all your accounts/business there. They will never ask you shit like that. I told banks to fuck off 10 years ago, and it's the best decision I ever made.

People who say shit like this have absolutely no idea how the cartels handle and launder their money. They launder over a BILLION dollars a day without ever getting caught, with little risk and relatively low cost. And yet, you think that they even care about cryptocurrency? Hilarious. 
BTW, just so you know, the drug trade is only about 5x bigger than it was when Pablo Escobar was alive. And the players involved are FAR more sophisticated and adept at the game than Escobar ever was.

@_date: 2017-10-13 07:15:55
Oh one more thing, a lot of those people who are "joining in just to earn quick money" will soon get to understand everything that Bitcoin can do, both now and in the future. Once they understand and can at least somewhat grasp its utility and capabilities, that will be a "whoa" moment for them that will change how they look at everything else. My only regret is not figuring this out for myself a lot sooner, but I did manage to do it just in time to change my life. Better late than never. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:46:11
Here's an idea: Just get ANY prepaid debit card that offers reasonable fees and won't kill you with currency exchange commission. Simply sell BTC to the currency of your choice, and deposit it straight into that card. It's how I have been doing it for the past 2+ years now. Works perfectly, and my overhead is ridiculously low.
 
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:50:58
Me? Angry? :D
Having a low tolerance for ignorance and stupidity doesn't make one angry. :)

They will not confirm nor deny the rumor. They're due to do their quarterly conf. call today and promised there would be some groundbreaking announcements. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:05:22
Yeah, sure. That's gonna happen. Do you have any idea how many people are getting into BTC every day? You talk as if the number of people buying BTC has topped out. Not even close. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:27:18
It's not about "predicting" the future. The future is here now. And saying inane stuff like "success and failure are equal in probability" is utterly hilarious. Again, know the game you're in, or do us all a favor. Sell, and sit on the sidelines, this is happening with or without you.

Who gives a rat's ass about short-term volatility??? :D :D :D :D 
Try this: Check the USD's weekly chart against other major currencies over the last year. Particularly against the Euro. It's tanked about 15%. 
Now, look at the long-term volatility of the USD and even other major currencies via the weekly and monthly chart on major pairs, such as EURUSD, EURGBP, GBPUSD, USDJPY, etc. Look at how "volatile" those currencies have been over the last several years. 
Now, look at Bitcoin's weekly chart over the last several years. 
Now tell me, which one has show more growth, and has  been LESS volatile over the long-term?
Case closed. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:35:48
No you really don't understand how the narcos move their money around. That involves real estate, shell companies, front businesses and yeah, good ol' banks. In fact, only a tiny fraction of their monies move physically by the truck or boatload. They have plenty of other redundant channels to move their money around the globe at will. At the end of the day it's a cash business, always will be.

Calling you out on your infantile stupidity and ignorance is not an insult, it's just stating the obvious. It's not an insult if what I'm saying is true. :)
You're the one who had such a hard-on for how long it was taking to confirm your bullshit .0004 btc transaction that you had to whine about it on a public forum. You get called out on being such a pussy, so what do you do? Whine some more.

You really should learn a bit more about your own country's history. Every province in Spain had to ratify the new constitution which was drafted post-Franco. And what, you're saying that Spain is essentially still a dictatorship? Come on... 
And also you seem to forget, the Catalans received a certain degree of autonomy as a result of the new constituation. Catalan became an official language again (which was made illegal by Franco's regime), and other cultural/political considerations. It's not like Catalonia has been getting screwed by Spain. There's just too much ultra-nationalism and provincialism going on that goes way back, and it's time to grow the fuck up.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:21:02

Get a decent debit card that has low fees, low or no currency exchange commission and provides you with an IBAN. In the EU, most of the countries' post offices offer such a card product. Simply sell BTC and deposit the proceeds directly to the debit card. Boom, done. I've been doing this for the last 2+ years, works like a charm, no matter where I am in the world.

Catalonia's not going anywhere. They agreed to the Spanish constitution in 1978, and the Spanish government will hold them to it, by force if necessary.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:33:43
Totally agree on that point. Poor execution by the Spanish police, but with the right intentions and cause. The Catalans are exacerbating the situation with their arrogant/separatist attitudes, and it's not doing them any favors. They have no legal basis to stand on whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:19:18
They're violating the constitution that they ratified and agreed to in 1978. They don't get to change the rules just because they get an ultra-nationalist hair up their asses. Doesn't work that way. They're fucking themselves over more than anybody else. All Spain is doing is enforcing the constitution. Catalans need to get over themselves and grow the fuck up. The last thing Europe needs is more "balkanization". 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:15:23

Simply put... more and more people are getting into the game. A lot of people are buying a little bit of BTC, and quite a few bigger players are buying more. More and more big money players are understanding the upside potential, and coming aboard as well. I fully expect this trend to  only gain more momentum over the next year or so. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:38:29
Uh, it's going through the roof everywhere. :P

Look on Paxful or LocalBitcoins.com for traders who will buy your BTC for Baht at a USD-THB rate that's acceptable to you. The other option is to get a good debit card that has no currency exchange fee (or at least a low one) and simply use that while traveling in Thailand. You'll get a favorable interbank rate without any hassles. You'll also be able to lock into  a set rate for all  the USD you're going to use while in Thailand without having to worry about fluctuation or volatility, which will be inevitable for the next couple of months.

You're doing it wrong.

My gf is Italian, she is on Coinbase/GDAX and has no problem whatsoever exchanging BTC/EUR. In fact, she just sold some a couple of days ago without a hitch. Not sure why you would have any problem.

*fap* *fap* *fap*.... sorry, what was that?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:28:12
Thank you. :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:58:18
Exactly.

Hodling BTC just makes sense for the long and medium term. There's no point in cashing out to fiat that's just going to keep losing purchasing power over time. Cashing out fiat for short-term spending via debit card is the only thing that makes sense to me. There is simply no other place or investment I can keep my funds in that will get the bang for its buck that it gets with BTC. Don't be a fool and cash back out to fiat just so you can see zeros in your bank account, do the math and you'll quickly see that it's just plain stupid. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:08:19
Have you always been this assumptive and stupid?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:24:39
Oh, you're still here? :D
First off, you have no idea what my situation is regarding BTC, dolt. I have been practically living off my profits from BTC, for oh... quite some time now. In fact, my situation is hardly affected if btc's price goes down. Crazy huh?  :)
Secondly, just because you are too stupid to figure out how to do that for yourself doesn't mean other people are. You're a prime example of what happens when arrogance and stupidity merge. Wear it proudly.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:35:08
Prior to it occurring? Do you have any idea what's going to happen over the next few hours or days? No, you don't, nobody does. 
But the fact of the matter is that despite these blips and dips, BTC continues trending nowhere else but upward. There are tens of thousands of new people delving into BTC each and every day, and that is not going to let up any time soon, barring some cataclysmic event. People need to stop freaking out and and start understanding the game they're in.

Banks stopped being relevant to me years ago. Bitcoin and crypto has only enabled me to take my bank-free life to entirely new levels.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:27:15
Wait til November next year... 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:32:53
Oh no, I just soiled myself.... :/
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:02:03
Something tells me you should have closed your accounts with them something like 15 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:06:09
Yep, that was very unfortunate. But it's not too late to get back into the game. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:55:01
The fapper has spoken. :D 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:07:47
There are other ways to buy BTC other than via banks you know. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:15:59
Again, I don't debate clueless ideologue dipshits. However way you care to judge doesn't amount to much to me. Dipshit made an utterly stupid statement which stands on its own. Nothing more to add. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:43:11
No it's not, you're just too lazy to do your research, so you have to admit you're wrong. :)
Here ya go... a couple of teasers... 
Costa Rica,
Let me know if you need more, other than the other 2 just mentioned on this thread.
Now the debate is over, and you're still a dipshit. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:42:40
Funniest shit I've read all day. There are literally 10's of thousands of new people dipping their toes in the BTC pool every single day. Adoption is still in its early infancy. The volume stats speak for themselves. That makes you a clueless moron spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:41:26
It's a stupid question. That's what you don't get... "dude". 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:23:59
Glad I only read about a third of that. Ramble much?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:34:16
Did you not really get mine? :)
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:28:06
Because personal responsibility is just asking too much from people, is that it? Just because some people are too stupid or lazy to properly store their private keys and other data somewhere safe and offline, that makes BTC a failure? Really now? :D  
So why should people even have to lock their doors, pay high insurance premiums and even keep valuable stuff in safe deposit boxes then? 
Based on your ridiculous argument, the "government" should protect everyone from ANY risk whatsoever, right? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:22:26
Oh god, I think I'm gonna be sick... :P
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:09:40
Uh, because more people are buying BTC than selling. It's actually quite a simple concept. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:34:03
I love it. I fucking love it. :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:43:30
Damn, I just spent six weeks in Prague, totally missed this!
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:49:03
It's only accurate to someone who doesn't understand basic economics. You know, the thing that essentially dictates the value of assets or products in the market.

Ignition has been fine regarding withdrawals and deposits. Tons of fish and donks, and easy to stay profitable if you know what you're doing. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:39:30
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:53:47
Hodling, and getting more whenever I can. For those of us who see the big picture, it's an easy decision to make.

Funny, I've been living off btc for going on six months now. Easy peasy. BTC-to-Skrill-to-prepaid Euro mastercard with interbank rates and no commission. Costs me 1% + 5e per transfer. Pay anywhere with the mastercard, done. :P

I'm trading forex with BTC on SimpleFX, works fine no matter what BTC's value is. The higher it goes, the more margin I get, I simply cash out withdrawals whenever the price is favorable. My BTC continues to grow, and I'm practically living off the profits now. 
Piece of cake, zero stress, and steady profits without worrying about when to buy or sell. I'm a copywriter, so I'll eventually write this strategy up in a manual and sell it, for BTC of course. :)
