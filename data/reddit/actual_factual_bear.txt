Currency is a claim against goods and services, and thus *is* an IOU.  When you work for an employer, they give you money symbolizing that you have given them services which they value and thus for which they owe you something.  Whoever you are working for got those IOUs (presumably) from their customers, to whom they provided something of value. You can then go trade those IOUs with other people in exchange for something they have to offer which you value.
It used to be that currency was backed by gold.  In fact, that was kind of how paper currency originated, as an easier to carry claim on gold held somewhere safe.  That was an IOU too, because the note literally meant that whoever issued the note owed you and would repay on demand whatever gold was owed.
Currency doesn't have any actual value itself, aside from the value it provides as a medium of exchange.   The paper and ink of a note have very little worth in themselves, the value comes from the social convention assigned.  This is also true of Bitcoin - the individual bits, even the hash itself has almost no intrinsic worth.  Proof of work is a sunk cost and doesn't give the numbers value.  The fact that people value it for whatever they value it for is what gives it worth.

so here's the thing... if you look at the volume in the last 24 hours, it is following the price rather closely - volume going up as price goes up, and volume going down as price goes down.
what does this mean?  every time the buyers dry up the price falls?  does this imply (future) strength because falling price on low volume means there is less panic selling so the sellers are getting exhausted, or does it weakness because the only support is people trying to time the bottom and when they get exhausted there will be no more support?

I looked at [average transaction amount]( and [median transaction amount]( which are now exceeding $140,000 and $3,000 respectively.   The median being so much smaller means what?  I think it must mean there are a few really huge transactions which are skewing the average.
Anyway, I think in part the fee is not scaling with the transaction size  to the point where it only makes sense to do large transactions.  So maybe you aren't paying the same amount, but the percentage is going up as the transaction size gets smaller.  Not too long back I looked at changetip and it would have cost me about 60% of the (relatively small) amount I had to cash out.   Anything above 5% and you're not even competitive with the worst credit cards.   For large amounts like $140,000 a [$28]( transaction fee is only 0.02%, which is cheap.  If you're buying coffee, Bitcoin doesn't make sense.  For a computer, car or house it's fine.

Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency, and in a down market this puts a stronger floor on its price than other cryptocurrencies.  But when demand for Bitcoin increases, there is only a limited number of BTC that will ever be mined, so demand flows into alts, and this puts a stronger ceiling on its price than other cryptocurrencies.

It's a limited form of deflation, though.  Several years back I was waiting to buy a certain size flat screen TV, don't recall the size now, but I wasn't willing to pay more than $300.  Prices kept falling and falling, but then they stopped and never hit $300.  The TVs got better and more features were added like "3D" or whatever, but I never got that TV.
Or, look at storage: hard drives, flash drives, RAM, etc.    At least in the new market there is a fairly established "base" price below which you'll never get anything.  Every year or so what you get for that price increases, but you'll never find a new hard drive of any size for a dollar even though for certain sizes the naive math would suggest you should.

I agree with everything you say except part of this.  Bitcoin as it stands appear to require computation.  Economic crisis or banking collapse by themselves wouldn't wipe this out, but in any truly apocalyptic scenario (which I am *not* advocating, by the way), where stability of computational infrastructure or the power grid was affected, Bitcoin would not hold its value as well as something physical like gold, and might even become worthless.

"Until you can get 50 cents for every dollar you have."  That doesn't even make any sense... if I've got a dollar, i've got a dollar, not 50 cents.  Unless you mean the bank refusing to give me the dollars they owe me when I ask for them.  In which case the FDIC steps in.  Not even during the deepest depths of the financial crisis did the so-called "powers that be" allow monkey market funds - which aren't even FDIC insured "break the buck" - when it looked like they might only return somewhere in the 90 cents on the dollar range.
The biggest concern with cash (aside from the lack of safety in having *too much*) is inflation, and I haven't heard of this happening during a financial panic, as these tend to be deflationary.

Not sure if you've thought this one through.
Every day thousands of motorists are driving by the sign and are going to be to varying degrees distracted by the sign.  Some are trying to fumble with their phone and bring up a way to scan something before they pass the sign, and then, for all the people who try this, only the first one will actually get anything.  After a few days some people will start to get the hang of when the billboard is coming up and some of them may even figure out when it releases the funds so now you've got a sudden extra burst of traffic around that time with people fighting it out trying to hit the drop.  At the very least I would make sure the billboard plainly declares exactly how much the released BTC is worth to try to reduce competition for people who won't bother if it's only a buck or two and won't be upset if they miss it.  Also, it might be better to randomize when the drop happens during the day so it's not predictable to give more people a chance.  If it's a digital sign it might be nice if it actually indicates whether or not the drop is about to happen and/or has already been claimed so people aren't too distracted at all times of the day.

Since it doesn't seem like anybody else has explained this, here it is:
7 bits + 1 stop bit + 1 bit (even) parity = 9 bits per character sent down the line.
8 bits + 1 stop bit + 0 bits parity = 9 bits per character sent down the line.
Since every character sent and received has the same number of bits sent and received, these two settings are roughly compatible.  I say roughly, because for the first case you have parity checking, where the number of 1s (or is it 0s?) has to be even or else the receiving computer will think an error occurred.  I don't recall why this would work on the receiving end (the newspaper's side), maybe it just actually ignored parity while generating it for sending, but on the user's side the Mac would interpret the extra bit as part of an 8-bit character and (maybe) strip it off due to only using 7-bit ASCII, no parity checking to worry about.

Just between you and me, I haven't bought any now, and I never will at any point in the future.  And I'll tell you why.
There will never come a time when I am required to own bitcoins for any reason.  It's not going to supplant fiat, and unlike gold (which I also don't own as I don't believe in the apocalypse) it won't be worth anything if the world goes to hell, because it requires a large infrastructure of miners and computation power which in turn requires a growing economy and plentiful power generation.
And there's another reason.
Two years ago somebody change tipped me what at the time was 20 cents worth of bitcoins.  Seeing the price where it is now I just for fun went to look at what it was worth.  Apparently you can only transfer bitcoins out of changetip now.  That 20 cents is now worth over $5.  Well that's nice, I said to myself.  I could use $5, maybe buy something at Wendy's with it, or maybe just keep it so I can say I have some Bitcoin.  But what's this "small" transaction fee it is mentioning?  It would be a whole $2.  Sure it's not much money wise, but it's 40%.  I don't consider 40% of *any* transaction "small".  Even the priciest credit card, as far as I know doesn't charge much more than 5% for a transaction, and you get a lot of benefits for that 5%!  Apparently this whole transaction fee stuff is quite troubling and has been getting worse, although I keep reading that relief is just around the corner.    Where is this frictionless currency I was expecting?

I'm going to argue that this is false.  By the same analogy, someone could publish a list of values, which, when XORed against any legitimate file on your computer (for instance, some system file everybody with a particular OS has on their computer), produced a file containing illegal porn.
It's more likely, I would say, that the list of windows .bmp .gif filename/offsets that pointed to RGB values is itself the child porn, because you're basically specifying a different encoding system and the values in that system which form the picture in question, whereas there is no evidence that the user had any knowledge of such encoding system or that any prior art exists for it.

I don't buy it. How many of those laws actually apply to something you are doing?  For example, I'm pretty sure laws regulating pig farmers don't apply to me in any way shape or form since I'm not a pig farmer.  Plus, the average law most likely doesn't stipulate the behavior of any individual, or have any compliance requirements that could lead to individual penalization - for instance, what part of the the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (which is federal law) could you possibly break and be punished for?

As I have gotten older I have realized something that younger people often don't get.  When you are over 35 a lot of new things seem to be against the natural order of things, but when you are 35 almost *nothing* new is against the natural order of things.
To put it differently, when I was young I always wondered why people were so "set in their ways" and not open to new things.  I resolved that when I got to be their age I would not be like that.  But it wasn't until I was in my 40s that I realized that while sometimes people's resistance to change is irrational and could be done without, it is also sometimes the case that people don't want to change because they have found something that works, a local minima of effort and local maxima of their own effectiveness, and change necessarily involves moving away from that.  "If it's not broke, don't fix it"  The true challenge is not to continually exist in unoptimized regions operating at sub-optimal efficiency in search of that elusive global maximum, but rather to recognize when a promised new maxima is in fact meaningfully higher than where one currently operates.
From that standpoint, while bitcoin is an intriguing technological development, I have yet to be convinced that for the average person - or myself at least - it's not trading off one set of problems which I can effectively deal with for a new set which will prove to be more troublesome.

Funny you mention that, because I read an article that since its top, Apple lost more than Facebook was worth yesterday.  If you look at how much Facebook was worth yesterday it's about the same as what Bitcoin was worth at the peak.  So by that logic, Bitcoin is worth about as much as the company that helps piss you off at friends family members on the other side of the political spectrum and who enables Russian troll farms to influence U.S. elections.

Yeah if you look at the chart carefully, you see it's going to plateau just under $18k, then plummet to $16k, and then there's apparently some end of the world singularity at the beginning of March that knocks us back in time and Bitcoin temporarily forks and then plummets to around $3k by about 2 weeks ago, briefly recovers to nearly $6k, then stumbles again, recovers to about $5k,  then slowly declines until by late last October it's below $4k again.

~~will have value after the apocalypse~~ oh wait, i guess there won't be any electricity to run the hashes then
~~won't rot, spoil, or tarnish~~ never mind on that one, unless you have lots of backups you'll get git rot eventually
~~has industrial uses~~
~~can be used for jewelry~~
~~is pretty to look at~~  never mind, those pretty coins you see aren't the actual bitcoins...
~~is really secure, doesn't even need a vault like gold does~~  never mind on that one, apparently all it takes is a couple thugs with crowbars to force you to divulge your private keys

Wow.  I was just thinking the other day that being able to buy or sell bitcoin at an ATM would be nice, basically inserting cash and having bitcoins transferred to a wallet or vice versa.  But there is no way in hell I'm paying a transaction fee (8%, seriously? (*)), plus the idea of needing an id is just ridiculous.
(*) it's so sad it's funny, but most ATMs on the map say "Fees: Operator disabled reporting"  gee i wonder why, is it because they know if i saw how much the fee would be i would give them the finger instead?

Fun Fact! During the California gold rush (and probably other gold rushes as well), a lot of people made bank, not by mining for gold, but for selling supplies to the miners.

If you hold real estate with a fixed-rate mortgage you are actually short feeble federal notes and therefore benefit from their decline in value.  Heck, even without a loan you still benefit to some degree.

I love how often this is brought up without mentioning that the Federal Reserve is required by law to return all surpluses to the U.S. Treasury.   Currently this is on the order of nearly $100B/year.

When I was a kid my dad was always collecting pennies, especially pre-1983 pennies which were solid copper.   When he died I inherited his jars... there was close to a hundred dollars worth.  I mean, it was nice to have, sure, but it wasn't really *that* much in the grand scheme of things.

This is a very interesting situation, it's almost like trying to fight against a law which makes it illegal to lie or be a jerk, while at the same time in private not lying or being a jerk and yet giving yourself the *appearance* of supporting liars and jerks and possibly being one yourself.  
I find it interesting because while it is presented as a matter of individual rights, what it seems more like is a question of where the legal line is with regards to behavior.  The state has already mandated that people not murder, and there doesn't seem to be any controversy there.   On the other hand, hardly anybody would advocate for a law against picking your nose.  This seems to be somewhere between the two extremes, a bit further than some people want but not so for other people.
