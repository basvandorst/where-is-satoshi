I listened to Schiff's arguments against bitcoin on the recent Joe Rogan podcast.  They were all bull.  For instance he said that the increasing amount of retailers accepting bitcoin will never increase the price because they just use bitpay to dump the coins on the market.

Well if you hear thousands of success stories from nofapping then there is at least some truth to them.  At the very least there is truth to building mental discipline where you can decide which thoughts come in, and that right there is a valuable tool.
You may not consider you porn use addiction or life interfering, I never thought mine was.  But honestly I have had an abusive life and that probably increases the chemical dependence that sexual release gives, especially for someone who already has severe social anxiety, etc.  And probably the people that see the greatest benefits of nofap are those people that have social/mental problems before nofap.
Think about giving nofap a chance someday and trying it for a month.  1 month cannot hurt right?  And then you have your own testimony to tell nofappers that they are full of it.  Because really, I am not going to be convinced by anyone that wont try it for themselves and make a conclusion.

To me this was the obvious solution before i even read it:
"A simple workaround is to not use the tx-id to identify transactions on the exchange side, but the set of (amount, address, timestamp) instead. If a user complains about not receiving their withdrawal, support can look it up using these 3 variables. It takes a little bit more work from support, but it prevents this attack from succeeding."

The prisons are a reflection of the corrupt laws ,especially from the drug war and over population of state prisons.  Anarcho capitalism and free market solves that problem by competition.  If some prison/security force is bad it will lose out to its more successful competitor.  You can still have privately owned oversight companies that keep checks on each company.

Yeah, but what would ever prompt them to ask unless you were being investigated for some major criminal activity and the government somehow knew you were tied to bitcoin?  I still doubt bitstamp, etc send any voluntary tax information.  The main concern would be large flagged deposits into a bank account.  People have been withdrawing wires from mtgox for years and you would have heard about someone being busted for evasion by now I'd think, but no stories.

What i see is when the volume is high it is because there is a emotional move in the market, good news or bad news.  When the news is stagnant there is little btc trading because no one has an idea of where the price is going to go.  And like I said the price almost always has to dip before large investors get back into play and buy up the cheaper coins, raising price and volume.

What gets me are that the answers to these questions are so obvious that bitstamp is just pretty much putting on a half assed security show for the US government.

So you all know....
The tulip bubble is a myth, it never happened as most people say. People made futures contracts on the market but when the time came to fulfill the contracts absolutely NO ONE paid the price. Most paid only 10% of the original contract price. It WAS a major moment in history in the breaking of contract law, but it WAS NOT an example of a population of people getting burned by the market.

We don't completely suppress sex, we leave it all for one person that we love.  There are plenty of testimonies of people saying they enjoy life and sex better with nofap, whether or not they started it with a girlfriend.  I wouldn't want to be a monk and don't think they do themselves any good not taking wives.  
I seriously am 6 days into nofap hard mode and am having real physical withdraws.  I have done opiates before and the withdraw feeling is very similar.  It feels like having the flu but different.  And I am having intense racing thoughts when I lay down, and even mental imagery of porn/gripping my dick.  When I meditate and block the thoughts of fapping i can feel my brain ache right above my eyes, and the same spot has a headache all day. 
 I only fapped 1-2x a day every other day before I started nofap, I can't imagine what it feels for like David Docouvney to come off his 10+ a day fapping.

And they have the funding to change their business model quickly too.  I think the chinese government will come to their senses as more and more countries take a positive stance.  
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:48:58
I am thinking Bernanke at least owns quite a bit now, and I wouldn't doubt if there are some officials in the Chinese financial ministry that own them too.  If it becomes accepted by the governments it will be from the inside out where corrupt politicians and banksters want their stashes to grow.  But in all it will benefit everyone.

And then they both lose their bitcoin fortunes when the price drops to about nothing because of lack of trust.  That is why such an attack will never happen.

Self control is having mental discipline where you can keep your mind clear of sexual thoughts and stimulus until you are with the one you love.  This is the way to get the maximum reward from sex.  If you think you have mental control then try to just go 7 days without thinking about sex and see how difficult it its to keep your mind clear.

There is a LOT of confusion about bitcoin in china right now, but the good news is that ultimately bitcoin is still legal there and businesses are still accepting it.  So it may take a few weeks for things to settle but you know it will be back on the rise over the high again.
