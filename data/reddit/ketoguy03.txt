Please stop!!!! You're being scammed! Stop, and start informing yourself!

When you send money using bitcoin, it is put in a place called the mempool, where all new transactions go. A few minutes pass, and then it is bundled in a block, and then broadcast to every full node on the network. This is why confirmations are important. Because you make the whole network aware that you paid, and thus it is impossible for the sender or the recepient to commit fraud. When you make a zero-conf transaction, you're sending money using the mempool as a vehicule, and do not tell the network that you make the transaction. That gives the sender and the recepient of bitcoin the possibility to scam the other person with almost no effort.

How much BTC was in there?

no. C is an angle, and 4 is the measure of segment BH. The joke here is that those who made the exam accidentally made anti-bitcoin cash propaganda.

What if you did:  
10 word phrase ---&gt; undisclosed hashing function 1 ---&gt; undisclosed hashing function 2 ---&gt; unidisclosed hashing function 3.  
Why this is safe: 
Assuming that the attacker dosen't know how much times  you hash your password, and what hash functions are used and in which order, it becomes near impossible for them to find out. If out of 20 options, you chose three, the amount of possible combinations for a single character in the original password is no longer 78, but 474552 (26 to the power of 3 times 27 possible hash function combinations. Now image having a 10 character word: It will be (474552 to the power of 10), making it virtually impossible to crack it. 
However, this strategy only works if the hashing functions and amount of hashing cycles are undisclosed.  
Use this advice at your own discretion.

This video was for me the eye opener. Good if you want to get into technical details. Watch till the end.

It depends. If it's something I can do in 2 hours or less, I'm taking it.

They probably sent another empty transaction with higher fees to outspend the first one and thus cancel it.

How? If you send the funds to an incompatible adress, either the wallet refuses to perform the transaction or it is being corrupted, and the money is lost.

True. But they didn't go bankrupt and actually repaid their users, so it will make newcomers feel safe.

Not a chance. If your screenshots are right, then your adress is 332v64tCXXRmnxXtuybSDEXbbMvz4wDsb5. However, if you check the blockchain, you can see that right before tricking you, the scammer sent some of his stolen funds to 37bnUVS2nFSwXekh3hrBjYCP2ZHHgW52tF , an adress with 31 btc, and a very long history of transactions. 
Simply explained: your money will sit in his wallet for some time, than he will launder it through a bitcoin tumbler, and you will be able to say goodbye to your funds forever.

They are inherently weapons. Indeed, fractional reserve lending, interest, and inflation are all ways of secretly robbing everyone.

mBTC and µBTC are good units.

Miners would all reject them and the money would stay in the wallets it came from.
@_date: 2019-04-01 03:12:37
Because accepting so much transactions with such low fees would make miners lose a lot of money. Since their motive is financial, THEY WILL block them.

How do you compete on your own against 3 mining pools totaling 55% of the network's hashrate?

Definitely. The fact that you can send money anywhere in the world very fast and for cheap without it being censored already makes it a very useful asset for the progress of the human species.
