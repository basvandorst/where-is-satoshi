Thanks!  I love boxing, I love bitcoin, why not combine the two, you know, for science and moon and stuff?

Thanks for the feedback.  I will use the Bitcoin logo.

Haha - I plan on holding up a sign with a QR code

This is phenomenal.  I was planning on spending any donations I get to contribute to the BTC economy, and betting is one of my favorite things to do...

The QR code on the t-shirt doesn't seem to work, so for those of you who are interested in donating, the BTC wallet address is - 16pREzmSaYuVaA6TAybVDk3s5XupQaBDvN.

Exactly!  I'm prepared to have this conversation on Saturday.

It's worth a try.  If they try to deny me entrance, I'll present my ticket and yell "Do you know who the *hell* I am?!"  ...works every time, right?
