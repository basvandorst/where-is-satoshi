The laws in the victims country are the ones that apply for whatever compensation he's able to get.  For example, if I lent a car to someone in North Korea and they kept it, it would be theft.  I could apply to my DA/prosecution and while they wouldn't bother with the case, they would explain I do have an open and shut case against them.
The problem is trying to get money/compensation/etc from the other person.  In my North Korea example, the NK government would laugh at the prosecution and North Koreans are generally not allowed in other countries, so the only threat left (exile) doesn't mean anything.
In the case of Japan, most countries have good relations with them.  If someone from there steals from you, the prosecution might actually give a damn and help you out.  If the Japanese government didn't want to comply in any way, then that Japanese person would be denied entry into other countries (possibly more than just the country where the victim lives).
How do I know this?  A friend of mine appeared to have skipped out on a traffic ticket in the US from 20 years back.  He went over there a few years ago and was promptly arrested and jailed until he paid off the ticket.  In the end, it turns out the ticket was actually dismissed but the court in that city screwed up, so he was released.  I suppose he could have sued, but he's not that kind of person.
So, if the staff of Mt. Gox actually do run off with the bitcoins, they can expect to have to live in Japan forever in the best of cases.  And with this much visibility, they can expect the Japanese government to work with other governments in prosecuting them.

What you're saying makes complete sense for someone seeking to buy a new (to them) house with a mortgage.  However, this is a refinance.  Your goal, as the bank, should be to continue the mortgage, not terminate it--and a properly written contract would bind the bank to continue the mortgage so long as payments remain current and the bank would violate no laws doing so.

Winning a block only nets you as much value as bitcoin is worth.  Bitcoin won't be worth much if the blocks are too small and people can't get transactions confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.
Ergo, they will need to balance out their preference for low block size with the value of bitcoin as a whole.

The inclusion of a word in the dictionary constitutes endorsement of the existence of a group numerous enough to believe in the concept, and, depending on the wording, a tacit acknowledgement of the existence of whatever the dictionary describes.

Hmmm.  Let's rephrase the issue.
In my hands I have 5 valueable bearskin rugs.  I'm at a car dealership, and I see a nice car I'd like to buy.  I offer them the bearskin rugs, which would be plenty to pay for the car, but they refuse because they don't have a use for them and don't want to bother trying to sell them.
I consider going to an exchange to get money for them but I don't want to bother.  The exchanges seem like they're not particularly secure and the price fluctuates by the minute.  Plus the fees aren't as cheap as I'd like.
Opax steps in and says "Hey, we have a deal for you.  Give us your bearskin rugs, and we'll give you this lovely credit card for very little money.  The neat thing is the price you see is the price you pay because typically merchants aren't allowed to charge for for using the card!  We will take care of everything for you, and if you have a rug left over, come back and claim it anytime".
You figure hey, this is a great deal.  You go to the dealership, buy the car on the credit card, and then drive to a local diner and have a laugh with the waitress as you explain how you're actually buying your meal with leftover bearskin rugs from buying the car!  She says she doesn't want to be tipped in those, and you explain no worries, you'll put the tip on the card and she'll get cash!
As to how you got the rugs?  Well, on the weekends you're a hunter.  Tax free, baby!  (Ssssh... don't tell them!)

Yes I am.  You waited over a minute for the next screen that said the money was sent?  You need to get a new PC man.
I can see waiting for the result, but that's Satoshidice wanting more confirmations, not bitcoin.


Debit isn't slower, though.  It's only slow as balls when coupled with a crappy landline.  TH doesn't do that.  My experience is the card goes in the slot (2 seconds), you punch in your pin (5-10 seconds), transaction is sent (5 seconds), pull out your card (2 seconds).  That's it.  As for the transaction being fully confirmed, that's completed via batch at the end of the day.  The confirmation the terminal receives while you're there is just checking that there's enough cash in the account to fufill the request, marking the cash as used, and verifying the PIN.  The retailer does not actually get the cash until the next day.  It's a lot like bitcoin, really, but slower.
I think maybe you've never dealt with Interac before?  Batch transactions like that are basically the norm (and during the time between the money being marked and transferred that night, weird things can and DO happen, occasionally).  Configurations that actually pull the money into the retailers account immediately are more expensive and rare for low value transaction companies.
Bitcoin is the same way.  You can get the transaction SENT really, really quickly.  Getting the money into your wallet takes some time.  You know, just like interac, although instead of waiting 24 hours, bitcoin gets it done in minutes.  That portion of the transaction is done *in the background* after the customer is done sipping their coffee.  For both cases.

Which is about where everyone is left after various other extreme events that insurance companies won't pay for.  Sue the insurance company.  Good luck.  Sue Gox.  Good luck.

No, they must pay out to whatever the limit is where you are, and it isn't going to be big enough to pay out the big accounts.  Also, where do you think the money comes from?  Hint:  You.  Either you paid for it in high service fees, or you paid for it in taxes (which is worse, because you passed the buck), or you paid for it in inflation (which is the worst, because now even those who don't pay taxes, such as the poor, are paying).

Let's say I have a printing press that prints $5 bills.  It can't do any other denomination.  It can print $10,000 a day, and costs $1,000 a day to run.  Every day, they print 1% fewer bills than the day before.  The costs are fixed.
I can build 100 of those machines each day.
All you have to do now is draw a graph.  At some point on this graph, the fixed costs meet income.  Now work out net income and how many devices were built over this time.  Divide.  You now know how much to charge per machine.  As expected, the first day's orders will produce incredible riches.  Maybe the next couple of month's orders will produce some handsome profit.  A few more months on and the machines are breaking even.  And a few more months after that, there is no profit.
The fun thing is, the 1% reduction isn't fixed and changes all the time.  As a conservative company, you bet that it will increase.  Your customers bet it will decrease (and that's why you still have orders to ship after the devices are worthless).  In the end, the business made the same amount of money either way, but managed to gain free insurance against loss due to changing hash rates.

Fortunately, with this being the internet and all, all it takes is one country.  I know for a fact online gambling has been completely A-OK at various Indian reserves in Canada, and Canada has no say whatsoever on gambling on reserves.  It would also look HORRIBLE if Canada decided to blockade the reserves from the internet.  Most Canadian regulations also don't apply there, such as tax regulations and money laundering regulations.
I also know that some of those reserves are running online gambling right now.

TigerDirect's former comptroller admitted TigerDirect purposely didn't pay rebates until customers moaned for them.  Dell sued TigerDirect for lying about Dell products.  3 years after the first mail in rebate fraud investigation, TigerDirect was sued by the Attorney General for using another mail in rebate scam to keep customers from getting their rebates.  The board of directors of this company was also accused by the SEC of being involved in the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise so he could lie to shareholders on company reports.  He was fined by the SEC and lost his stock options.

I sent 0.01 BTC off the other day, and 0.7 BTC were sent (since that's what the smallest transaction was in this wallet).  0.01 BTC went to the destination and 0.69 BTC were sent to the next address in my wallet.  As far as the blockchain is concerned, I moved 0.7 BTC.
If we worked with cash this way, I'd earn $1000, but spend tens of thousands of dollars, because many of my transactions are for less than $10.

It is illegal in Canada to [decrypt]( any foreign satellite transmission, paid or unpaid.  There's also a small matter of it being illegal for Dish to accept Canadian subscriber, not due to the stupid Canadian rules, but due to deals they made with various media companies to only sell to certain markets (US and a couple of others).
However, if Dish can get a paying sub from Canada without "knowing" they're Canadian, it's cash in hand for them, and what they don't know doesn't hurt them.  As for the Canadian, it's rare (but does occasionally still happen) that someone gets busted for paying for non-Canadian satellite service.
So, overall, if you can get Dish money in a manner that doesn't disclose your location, and you can keep your mouth shut, plus you can fake a US address, you're on your way to getting US television service in Canada.  Bitcoin significantly facilitates the first part.
For the pedants, it's actually illegal to decrypt a transmission that is not authorized.  Authorized means the CRTC approves it.  The only authorized companies are Canadian, except for XM/Sirius, who capitulated to CRTC rules requiring lots of forced Canadian additions to their programs.  Typically 35% of a broadcast must be Canadian or the CRTC will fine you/shut you down.  Thus dish would need to significantly modify their programming if they wanted Canadian authorization.  Since nobody wants to do that, effectively, it makes the market Canadian only.

In Canada.  Here, the typical mortgage lasts 5 years (Other options are 1 year, 2 years, or 10 years) and interest is based on 35/30/25 years paid monthly (or fewer, and it all depends on which government is in power at the time as to the maximum length).  Mortgages will typically be paid bi-weekly (which means each year the mortgage is recalculated based on it having been repaid 2 weeks faster), and occasionally monthly, or weekly (which does not carry the benefit of biweekly).
Once you finish that 5 year term, your mortgage is up for renewal and you must refinance it.  You may typically either find another bank (in which case you would then be subject to the same scrutiny anyone else is subject to when getting a new mortgage) or you may just sit on your thumbs and accept the offer from your current bank.
If you had a variable mortgage (which everyone should have, as it is always the cheapest) nothing really happens at all.  You just enjoy the same terms tomorrow you had yesterday.  If you have a fixed rate mortgage, you get a new fixed rate based on whatever the bank would typically offer someone in your situation if they applied for a new mortgage that day.
However, I've never heard of anyone here just being dropped at that 5 year mark unless they violated the terms of their mortgage contract somehow, and those terms are generally limited to current payments, current insurance, and fully paid taxes.
You can break your mortgage within those 5 years by paying a penalty and search for a new mortgage, in which case, you're throwing yourself to the wolves.  :)  It works out well for some people who had terrible financial situations when they bought the house and thus got a horrible mortgage, but a couple of years later managed to get better employment and thus would be able to get a rate so significantly better it pays for the penalties.
Most mortgages here, especially variable, allow a large amount of principal payment at any time.  For example, I have a $190k mortgage, 35 years, 5 year refi, biweekly payments, variable, and I'm 3.5 years into it.  I can pay $37k tonight if I managed to win the lottery with zero negative consequences.  In 18 months I will have the opportunity to either find another bank to take on the mortgage, pay off the principle in full (negating all future interest and thus closing the mortgage completely), or continue with what I have right now for another 5 years--all with $0 penalty.
Probably the big differentiator is the lack of risk for banks in Canada.  If you screw up, the bank always has recourse to take your home OR any other assets.  So, say you bought a nice $50k car, and then get $5k behind in the mortgage.  The bank takes a look at your finances and realizes the reason you're behind on the mortgage is you're paying $1k a month for the car.  They also take a look at the mortgage and see they're underwater on it.  The bank can work with the court to have the car seized (it would be seized by the company that you have the car loan with) and then they'd seize $5k of assets in your home/bank/wherever, if they can.  The end goal being you don't have a car payment anymore.  :)
I know in the US the worst a bank can typically do is just take back the house.

Oh, they are for that area, certainly not for all of Canada (Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto are known as the hotspots of ridiculousness).  There's also major areas with depressed housing markets here (Windsor and Montreal come to mind).
That being said, in an area with income like that, a house price that high shouldn't come as a surprise.  House prices for small homes have typically always been at least 3 times the average household income, and that home is large and has lots of property.
A housing market crash is possible in some areas, including this one.  However, until that happens, prices are what the market will bear.  There are extraordinarily inflated areas where I would say a crash isn't really possible, such as Fort McMurray, because the number of houses built is based on jobs that literally are immovable and are unlikely to disappear (except if oil prices crash)--and there's already a housing crisis in areas like that as it is.
If you want some unbiased information, head on over the to [CMHC's]( website.  Their job is to insure otherwise unlikely mortgages against default, so they want to know exactly where the market is heading... there's zero benefit to them if they guess wrong.
Housing is a highly regulated market and that means that the normal factors (supply and demand) don't work as cleanly as they should.  For example, in my city, the city has (almost) stopped approving single housing projects despite the demand for such being extremely high, instead favouring multiple family dwellings (such as 8-plexes) which very few people here want (this city has one of the highest ratios of young children to adults of all of Canada).  This greatly inflates the price of resale detached single family homes, and depresses the value of condos, thus creating a broken market and signals to developers that the housing market is crashing (because nobody is buying their new inventory, because they're building what people don't want).  The news then reports that we're in a bubble that will pop (in my area) because they don't consider that the lack of demand is manmade, although they are right that single family homes are priced higher than necessary.

Banks are only obligated to lend you money when you enter a contract that obligates them. My home refinances next year and my contract obligates the bank to offer me the same terms I have today for another 5 years so long as my payments are always current (they are) and I continue to pay city taxes and house insurance (and maintain the place).

The saddest part about interac is how each bank stuffs bonus fees into the cost.  A typical interac cost, for a merchant, is about 15 cents, sometimes up to 50 cents depending on how good of a deal they cut with service provider/bank.  By the time most banks are done with it, they manage to find a way to either get a flat rate out of you monthly (say $15) or they charge you bonus fees each time you use it, typically more than double that.  Yes, I know there's a few uncommon banks that don't do this, but the big boys do.
With bitcoin transaction fees, you pay the miner one single fee and that's all that will EVER be paid to transfer that money.  Much less unpleasant.  :)

Perhaps it's money laundering legislation.  Over here in Canada, any transaction $10k or over in cash has to be reported, and the reporting is "secret", in that the teller can't tell you that they are doing it, but instead must just ask questions to fill in the report.  Once you know this exists it's easier to just joke about it with the teller, although they still won't admit they have to fill it out, at least they feel less stupid.

More inventive every day.  Each time this happens, the value of Bitcoin drops.  Customers will demand security.  Look at Kraken trying to scoop up customers by proving solvency.  No company would spend money and time doing that if there wasn't an economic advantage in it for them.

Bank closes account.  You immediately phone and open an account.  Rinse and repeat until the bank runs out of ID numbers or does something illegal, like get tired of opening new accounts and refuses, at which point you sue them.
I bet after the third iteration the bank would have the message you're not going away and flag your account to not be closed ever again.

Worse, it will take law changes.

The hardware remains legal to posses in Canada, only the use of it is illegal.  Back before grey market was illegal in Canada, I just drove to Sears (yeah, that long ago) and bought a dishnet receiver.  Claimed it at the border, paid taxes, done.  My subscription was via Zed Marketing, which could ring a few bells as to how damn long ago that was!  The same thing can be done today (minus that it is very difficult to find anyone willing to break the law and provide a subscription proxy), and the enforcement is so lax the border guards wouldn't even think to say anything about you being unable to actually use it.

Interac (which is the debit system Tim Horton's would use) does not charge a percentage, they charge a flat fee per transaction.

The neat thing is the internet doesn't work like a physical store.  On the internet, you can use these things called "firewalls" and "logins".  Even a really poor implementation of either is a sign of "GTFO if you won't follow my rules".  Sure, someone could put in the effort to break into your site, but then almost nobody will think the cracker is the good guy.
On the internet, if you don't put a small amount of effort into showing someone you do NOT want them to access whatever you place on it, the default is yes, they may access it.  If you don't want someone to access your site without following your rules, you could simply have them create a login and put VERY obvious rules in the account signup page "**AD viewing is not optional.  If you do not agree to view ads, or use any method to prevent viewing ADs, your access is unwanted and may be prosecuted.**" well, then you'd be within your rights to say someone ripped you off.  You could even (try) to put them in jail.
Nobody does this because it's offensive and people will run away from the site.  Well, guess what that means:  If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.  Close your site and let someone else move in who can stand it.
Choosing to avoid that model proves the person using the internet simply doesn't understand how it works.  As with many things in life, ignorance leads to unhappiness.

:)  Well, I'm going by the idea that socialism is intertwining of civilization with the state, where many (not all) services are provided by the state, and the state pays for said services through taxation of its members.
I'm happy enough to be told I'm wrong, however.  But if what I'm saying is a relatively good generalization, deficits cannot be run with bitcoin, and thus taxation is the only method remaining to pay the government.  Current taxation methods (mostly) work because the government has found ways to track income.  However, bitcoin makes it very easy to anonymize income, and thus renders taxation much closer to a voluntary affair.
I suppose it comes down to whether one believes that most people would voluntarily pay taxes or if most people are paying taxes only because they feel they cannot avoid doing so successfully.  For me, I believe it's the latter.  I know so for myself.

Assuming a cash transaction takes 15 seconds just handling money (having worked a till, that's about what I expect and have experienced) how is bitcoin slower?  0 confirmation would take less time than that.
I'm just not getting how bitcoin is going to take a whole minute.  Back when I wasted money I played satoshi dice and I believe it took me about 5 seconds to lose $5.  :)
A decent NFC setup would solve the speed issue.  I mention NFC because TH already takes NFC payments, so they have the equipment.  NFC lights up.  You tap your phone, NFC tells your phone to send X bitcoins (2 seconds).  You enter your password with your other hand and confirm (10 seconds because some are slow typers).  Your bitcoins are NFC'ed to the till (2 seconds) and the server grabs your coffee while the transaction is completed in the background.  If the server is too fast, doesn't matter, go onto the next transaction--they have your face if you stole from them.

Also, yes, most people have seen their salary go up significantly over the past 7 years.  Yours may not have, but the average has most certainly risen, simply check statscan.  Of course, it is destroyed by the fact it's due to inflation, but that's a different issue.
Simply between 2007 and 2011 (which ignores three years of additional wage increases) family wages have increased in [Alberta alone]( from $82,030 to $89,030.  That's a 9% increase right there over 4 years.

It's all about what the customers are willing to put up with.  Across the US, I've almost never come across a non-prepay pump (In fact, I'm so used to it I just by default go inside first--rather frustrating because US pumps will not accept Canadian credit cards, so I also have to go inside to pay by credit).
In Canada, I have come across prepay only at night, and even then, rarely, or at pumps that are the very furthest from the store (those pumps hardly EVER get any use, BTW--even when it's so busy there's lines of cars waiting, those are empty).  It might be that I only live in the 10th largest city here, but every time stations talk about prepay becoming the default, customers get upset and go to the holdouts.
I think the answer really comes down to just how serious the customer is about their time being wasted.  In Canada it seems customers would rather take the bus than prepay, if that's what it came down to.  LOL.

If you are getting your money instantly, you're paying far too much in transaction fees.
We changed our store from immediate payment to nightly batches.  Our transaction fees were cut in half.  The effect was the same as instantly raised all our prices by 1.5% without the customers even caring.
Of course, in either case, the money is only kinda ours.  Took one chargeback from a fraudster to figure out why you use a separate bank account specifically for credit cards.  In fact, it was that idiot that encouraged us to discover batch transactions elsewhere, so perhaps in the end he did us a favour.

Then why do they accept cash?  Cash at a coffee store is basically zero confirmation.  The high volume ensures that unless your note stands out (50s or 100s) you are only going by paper feel and that the note looks good at 10 feet.
You can buy paper that feels like bills for a moment for less than 5 cents a page (Look for high cotton content--BTW:  If you are sending in a paper resume, always use this sort of paper.  It gives people the subliminal impression you're worth more.), and you can colour laser print a note for less than 2 cents a page.  A $5 bill created this way would pass muster at 90% of coffee shops.  Of course, that note doesn't pass holograpic tests, UV tests, counterfeit detector pens, IR light checks, duplicate or real S/N tests, planchette tests, foil strip or even raised ink/braille tests.  Only a select number of places check for that*.
Why don't they worry about this?  Because most coffee shops might have one counterfeit note pass through a week.  And the loss from those is even higher than bitcoin as a counterfeit $20 note being used on a $1 coffee nets the store a $19 cash loss and the loss of 10 cents of coffee.  That's still less than $3 a day.
If you walk into a coffee store and defraud them on a regular basis, you can be sure you'll be banned in no time.  And arrested.  The police don't take kindly to thieves.
*- Even banks don't bother with all that.  I once took a few thousand cash out of our business' bank to get inventory and pay for a stall at a flea market (our secondary gig to our main store).  One of the $100 bills I took straight from the cash envelope was found fake by the bank that accepted the monthly payment.  Once I explained where the money came from (and showed the receipt) all of a sudden it wasn't my problem anymore.  In that case, both serials were visible under UV light.  FWIW, magic marker (can't remember the brand I tried, but it was probably sharpie) often doesn't show up under UV light, so getting the ink for that isn't even so tough.

Access to websites is a little different, depending on what it is that's being delivered.  If it is, say, access to a magazine, worst case scenario is they get to read a dozen articles for "free", total cost to you is perhaps 0.05 cents.  You close the account and blacklist the wallet.  Problem (mostly) solved and your total loss is basically nil.  Heck, you might actually come out of it with a fat profit since you get to claim the $1.99 on your taxes as "theft".
If it's access to a game download, yup, you'll have to tell the customer to come back in 10 minutes.  Shocking...

The scam is that when they broke the contractual ship date for the products they refused and then actively tried to block refunds.
It's the same scam as a dealership offering to have a car custom built for you in two weeks then turning around in two weeks and telling you they'll keep your entire payment (which you made upfront) even though you have no car, and they'll have it to you "soon". And still not understanding why, six months later, you get the bank to cancel the cheque.

I wonder if a garage actually accelerates rust.  Outside is the coldest it can be.  Most garages end up with some heat from the home.
Salt is most aggressive on metal when it's mixed with water, rather than snow.  Thus, in a garage, your car is busy thawing out and activating the salt.  Outside, your car is busy being frozen as hell.
Of course, the engine would prefer the warmth.  However, engines are a lot easier (and cheaper) to replace than a subframe.

Check the reply from SEMLover.  Yes, I have seen overweight Ethiopians, however, they're immigrants to Canada, so I fairly concede they wouldn't count.
However, since you mentioned Ethiopia, how about something published straight from there:


Learning in private school, having small family size, being in male headed household and living in lower middle
income household were positively associated with overweight and/or obesity.
In the case of Ethiopia, since the country is so dirt poor (which, unfortunately, is the fault of Ethiopians--typically a specific few that steal the wealth--that's why dumping money at the country doesn't work) it's hard to find any that can afford shelter or water, never mind food.  However, the moment a lower-middle class emerges, obesity.
Ethiopia is beyond poverty, and rather their issue is that the government and/or local leaders literally steal anything that would have gone in the children's mouths.  Does that result in them being poor?  I posit not.  If you made $1,000,000 a year, but $999,950 were stolen from you every year before you even got your paycheque, do you have a poverty issue, or do you have a theft issue.  This is not to say that without the theft Ethiopians would make that sort of income.  It is, however, to say that if the theft stopped happening, the average Ethiopian would be overweight based on the current trends, as they would be experiencing poverty, instead of theft.

That's because bitcoin is gaining value due growing up.  As time goes on and more places accept it, that portion of the equation will settle out and bitcoin will much more closely track the traditional value of non-fiat items.  That is a good thing.
I entirely do believe there's some exciting inflation in the future for various currencies around the world.  Not hyper-inflation insanity, but I can see bread being $6 a loaf by 2020 (It's $3 a loaf where I am right now.  I bought bread at $1 a loaf when I got my first apartment just over 10 years ago).  That's bitcoin at $1000.  Throw in more and more popularity and that's bitcoin at $10,000.  So, what my personal pull-it-out-of-my-arse guess is is that 1 bitcoin "suit" today will buy 10 "suits" in 2020.  And after that, it won't buy anything further nor less.
Bitcoin at a million, no, that won't happen without either hyperinflation, or all of us on our deathbeds because it's the year 2100, at which point that loaf of bread will probably be $600.

If you convert BTC directly to fiat, you will pay taxes on it.  At best that will be capital gains taxes.  That is generally way, way, way more than 5%.
Direct spending of BTC does not require payment of capital gains (well, it might legally require it, but it generally is far too difficult to be worth the time of the government to investigate it).  Thus you earn a discount already by using them.

Those are the overarching definitions when it comes to those parties interest in authority.  Go ahead and verify with your favourite encyclopedia, or even with a well learned professor at your favourite university.  The latter will probably have a lot of negative things to throw your way as well, but they won't disagree that the point of libertarianism is local government and as little of it as possible, for better, for worse, despite the likelihood of it happening or not.
Antiestablishmentarianism is an even easier definition.  It's literally right in the damn word, just pull it apart into its constituent pieces:
Anti - Against
Establishment - Law, church, civil/military organization, public or private institutions**
What covers the majority of that defnition?  Government.  Only once are private institutions mentioned.  The word itself implies those that currently exist, which only just barely includes the BTC foundation.  And since it has zero control over BTC (it just makes suggestions and you can ignore them any time), it just doesn't fit the bill at all.
** - It also includes a place of business including furnishings and staff.  I really, really think you're stretching to say that antiestablishmentarians hate on furniture and people that have a job.
You probably want more proof for the libertarian definition.  Here's what [wikipedia]( says in the first line, and it is very well cited:
"Libertarianism (Latin: liber, "free") is a set of related political philosophies that uphold liberty as the highest political end. This includes emphasis on the primacy of individual liberty, political freedom, and voluntary association."
Is the BTC foundation compatible with individual liberty?  Well, let's see, you don't have to pay for it.  You don't have to join it.  You aren't even compelled to do either in even the slightest fashion.  So yes.
Compatible with political freedom?  It's not part of government, thus this test is relatively pointless.  I will state a definite yes here.
Compatible with voluntary association?  Did they ever even make the slightest attempt to compel you to join?  Me?  Anyone?  No?  Yes, compatible.
So, please, stop with the horseshit of "just yours".  I hope this post has proven to you just how incorrect you are.

The good reason will only come about once they have some BTC to spend.  The question is why they would ever have that.
One has to think of the source of money to answer that question.  Looking towards buying it on an exchange is the same way you'd fund your vacation in a foreign country--it is definitely not the primary method you'd ever want to get money except in unusual circumstances.
For it to hit that threshold where everyone ends up with BTC to spend it needs to get into their hands the usual ways.  Paycheques, payments from others for loans (even something as simple as splitting a bill at lunch), money won from the lottery (even $1 on a scratch and win), money sent to family, etc.  I expect loan payments and money sent to family to be the first barriers broken (since payments over distances are easier with BTC, and micro-payments are a fun way to encourage it without pissing off co-workers too much), and paycheques to be next (since for some companies paying employees who choose it in BTC would be less hassle).
I think next time I owe someone a few bucks at work I'll offer them the choice of BTC or cash.  I should load up $20 worth on my phone...

You're using an extreme example (almost 1/10th of the entire currency stolen at Mt. Gox) so we have to compare apples to apples here.  If we were to go with a smaller exchange (there was one in Canada that lost under 1000 bitcoins recently, actually) I'd be willing to say your idea is much more feasible and would have a much more positive outcome.


I never even considered private insurance, because, frankly, no private insurer is going to want to deal with such a hot potato, especially now.  The risk level of being the first in the industry is way too high, and private insurance companies are incredibly risk averse.  Heck, I remember when I first tried to get insurance for my small retail store, I had to call a dozen insurance companies before one would even consider offering it.  The excuses given were always "Well, the government is going to be changing the rules, so we'd rather not take on any new accounts until we know exactly what those rules are."
If they're that risk averse some slight rule changes tell them to stop considering offering slip 'n fall insurance, I can't even imagine the difficulty level anyone will have getting them to break into a new market.
If you regulate they require private insurance, and then the private insurance never comes, the bitcoin exchanges will cease to exist.  I don't like that proposition.


Odd how my example was all about how when the government got involved, private insurance was harder to get, then!  I know it's anecdotal, but I also know any broker will tell you that in Ontario in the early 2000s finding an insurance company to sell insurance was like pulling teeth--and that it was precisely because the government, as it is wont to do, chose to reconsider the regulations.

Please read that and get back to us about why you feel this man's open action to negotiate with the bank was fraudulent.  Some issues you'll have to leap over:
* Reliance on a patently absurd false statement generally will not give rise to fraud
* A misleading statement is more likely to be fraudulent when one party has superior knowledge in a transaction, and knows that the other is relying on that knowledge, than when the two parties possess equal knowledge. *The bank is automatically assumed to have superior knowledge in financial matters, period*
* When a person has a duty to speak, silence may be treated as a false statement *Recall, he sent the edited offer openly to the bank with his application for review*
* (1) a false statement of a material fact *I'm certain he would be more than happy to collect on his contract*
* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue *Do you think he thinks he is being untruthful to the bank in his offer?*
You have a lot of hurdles to jump over before you can successfully accuse him of fraud.  Care to give a go at some of them?

I can't say for outside North America, but 40 A mains are typically not enough to run many North American houses (at some point in the past--many have switched to gas heat now).  Electrical baseboard heat will add a 20 A @ 240 v or more per room, alone.  Our stoves are also rated to use a 40 A @ 240 v outlet (but due to various rules, typically only use 32 A maximum)--and many people elect for electric stoves, even today (gas stoves exist but are certainly rarer).  Most people will also have central air, which is typically a 20 A load (but varies depending on how large the unit is).  Dryers are a 30 A load (and I've never seen a house without a dryer here), and gas dryers are even rarer than gas stoves.
40 A service just isn't enough since, at peak, a house here could easily use 60 A or more on just standard appliances.  Of course, from my experience, I keep my average consumption (minus mining) down to about 5 A.  It's just those random peaks that would cause 40 A service to be a big pain in the ass here.
From what I see about temperatures in Cyprus (18 C winter, 27 C summer), chances are you don't have built in heating, and it looks like A/C could be optional without sweltering to death.  If in Cyprus you don't prefer to dry your clothes in a dryer, yeah, you're probably fine with 40 A.  Although if you don't have a gas stove, I guess you'll be playing musical chairs between the BFL units and your electric range.

Actually deflationary currency encourages lending, inflationary currency discourages it.
If we look at currency as apples, inflationary currency has shrinking apples (Each apple is less good over time )and deflationary currency has expanding apple (Each apple is better over time).  For simplicities sake, each apple today weighs one pound and inflation is 10% over 5 years (and deflation is -10% over 5 years).
I offer you a loan in inflationary apples, 100 apples (Weighing 100 pounds) in return for 110 apples in 5 years.  In 5 years, the apples are now 90% of their original size.  You bring me back 100 pounds of apples (110 apples in 5+ years apple sizes).  I made absolutely nothing on the deal.
Now, I offer it in deflationary apples.  Same loan, 100 apples today for 110 in 5 years.  In 5 years, you pay me back 110 apples, each weighing 1.1 lbs, for a total of 121 pounds of apples.  I not only made my 10 apples back, but I made a bonus 11 pounds of weight as well.  I'm super happy!  So happy, in fact, that my next loan could be 100 apples today for 100 apples back in 5 years, since I'll still make 10 pounds on the difference.

Page 9 -- 14 AWG is rated for 20 Amps to a fixed resistive load.  It is derated by 80% + 5% when used in typical home service, providing 15 Amps in those cases.
The outlet, of course, isn't to used with a breaker/fuse rated higher than what it is designed for, which is 15 A.  You can draw 15 A from a 15 A circuit all day safely.  Check your 1100 watt microwave (which is certainly drawing at the limit of 15 A).  If they're safe to run for 99 minutes and 99 seconds, then why would they not be safe to run for days on end?  If the microwave required 20 A (which based on the idea of derating on plugs/receptacles, it would), it would have a 5-20p plug, instead of the 5-15p.
And in the USA, things don't change for 14 AWG:
In the case of a 15 A BFL device (check page 23 and skip the appropriate sections):
Step 1:  15 A
Step 2:  Skip.  This device is not continuous per NEC/CEC regs.
Step 3:  1.00 x 1.00 = 1
Step 4:  1 x 15 A = 15 A =  AWG wire.
Bonus:  Step 5:  Derate wire by 0.8 due to it being bundled with another wire in the same holes in the wall studs.  20 A x .8 = 16 A &gt; 15 A =  AWG wire.
Now, based on the answer, select outlets that conform to 15 A wire specifications (5-15r) and select circuit breaker that conforms to 15 A wire specifications.
I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm trying to say:  Ask someone who knows the NEC or CEC what size of wire you need to supply a 15 A non-continuous non-motor load.  They will tell you 14 AWG.  They may suggest 12 AWG so they could supply it with a 20 A t-slot so you don't get nuisance trips, but if you asked them what code says, they will say 14 AWG.  The electrical code is designed to keep your house from burning down, much as I'm not a fan of regulation.
Just to add, I'm not an electrician.  I only took a 6 month course to be one, but ended up back with my passion, computers.  :)  However, certain bits of knowledge don't easily leave you.  :)

Private schools in other countries where the local public schools either don't exist or have very low enrollment have been shown to be accessible to those with low to moderate income.  Due to the enrollment level in public schools in the US, and the fact that while they might not be great, they're not laughably terrible, of course you will only find expensive private schools.  Parents without much money will opt for the free option every time as long as it's of mediocre quality or better.
Private hospitals have no competition because of heavy government standards restricting them all to providing the exact same level of care and worse, forcing them to provide care for free.  It is of no surprise that in a competition free environment with onerous regulation you end up with high costs.
The poor die inside and outside of hospitals in countries with socialized medicine as well.  It's called "That drug/procedure isn't on the approved list" or "There's an x month wait for that procedure" instead.

Shit products that don't live up to the hype.  Doubling prices for products they weren't even PRE-ordering (they listed it as an order that ships in two weeks) that won't ship until mid-2014.  Products that went from "hot as a single space heater" to "HOLY SHIT, hotter than your central furnace".  People who ordered in June of LAST YEAR still waiting for product that was promised to be delivered last October.
And yet they somehow think they're going to release a completely brand new product with completely brand new chips in a completely brand new form factor.  And they'll have it done in 3 months.  Which, at the current manufacturing ability, means that if it were true, they'd be shipping the brand new product for 1.5 YEARS before they'd be caught up on current orders.

Two separate power supplies mean it's using about 1150 - 1250 watts per outlet.  This isn't too much for a single circuit, but it does mean you need TWO circuits per mini-rig.  Your kitchen outlets will typically be capable, although it's an odd place to use the device.

Actually, it's exactly because the socialized medicine can't pay that they die.
Think about it.  The reason those drugs aren't approved is because the government won't pay for them.  If the government won't pay for them, it's because they can't.  If they can't pay for drugs to prevent cancer, patients die.
As for people dying due to not having access to various things, having restricted access to various things is so pervasive in Ontario the government created a provincewide wait time calculator:
Do people die due to wait times?  I don't know.  I do know that if you leave various life threatening medical issues too long, the problems get worse and eventually the patient dies.  I also know that when you're at the point that you've been goaded into providing a wait time calculator, you might just be at the point you're not providing adequately timely care.
And why would there be wait times?  Well, when someone said they'd only pay for 1000 of something, but everyone needs 1200 of them, then 20% of people are just going to have to wait.  Waiting for something you need now because someone didn't pay the bill is being denied healthcare because the government can't pay for it.

I had an interesting experience on this track yesterday, but with good endings.
I went to the US from Canada to pick up my bitcoin miner (Finally BFL delivered, fucking worthless PSU quit within 5 minutes, though).  Brought it across the border and declared it as electronics to the lady at the border crossing.  Considering the price, I knew I'd be paying duty on it.
Went in to customs to pay, and handed them the receipt.  They asked what it was for.  I figured I may as well say exactly was it is: "Bitcoin Mining Equipment".
"Are you on silk road?"
"No, I don't deal with that stuff"
"I heard bitcoin went down a lot in value due to that"
"Yeah, but only for a bit.  It's back up now."
(neighbouring customs officer) "Oh yeah, that bitcoin stuff, I have that!"
(me) "It's up to $110 now"
(neighbour) "Yup!"
I figured my car would be torn apart for drugs, but nope.  I just paid the 13% and went home.  Seems it's hit such a critical mass and yet the government here just don't care so long as you aren't in it for the drugs.  LOL!  Sure felt like saying "bomb" in customs though, what with the first reply.  I figured for sure I'd be spending an hour or two waiting upstairs while they figure out if I'm on any watchlists or anything.

All competitors could stop shipping right now and it wouldn't make these things of any more value (well, I guess the network wouldn't grow so fast, so there may actually be a slim profit margin after a year or so in that case--so they're priced just right if everyone else gave up shipping stuff right now, but they're not...).

It looks like the code change to require service calculations was around 1933.
Chances are high if you have less than 60 Amps feeding your house you have knob and tube wiring and thus are finding home insurance prohibitively expensive.  You also, for certain, if you don't have 60 Amp service, have ungrounded outlets, and thus what will you plug this unit into?  You're going to hack off the safety ground pin, aren't you?  You will also be lucky to find more than 1 outlet per room in a home from 1932, so you will need a 4 bedroom house and lots of extension cords (and a willingness to not use anything electrical in that house).

The comma "thing" is more a regionalism than right vs. wrong.  There is an argument for making sure the last comma is there when the sentence would be confusing (there's also the reverse argument to avoid the comma if it would make the sentence confusing).  Eg:
- My favourite sandwiches include:  Ham, salami, peanut butter and jam.  (Do I like the combination of peanut butter and jam, or do I prefer them as separate sandwiches?)
- My favourite sandwiches include:  Ham, salami, peanut butter, and jam.  (Here the distinction is obvious:  I prefer them all as separate sandwiches--although I suppose there is still the argument that perhaps I want all those ingredients on one sandwich--but yuck!)
Frankly, I say to use the extra comma UNLESS you think it would prevent conveying your thoughts to the reader.
The two spaces thing, though, doesn't have as much weight behind it.  Neither one nor two is wrong, however, many people (myself included) find that double spacing makes reading easier (even with proportional fonts).  The nice thing is that with HTML it's always set the same way when displayed to the user (unfortunately, generally with only one space--I imagine CSS can fix that though).

It doesn't work just fine, but those who genuinely believe the state should control their lives will of course back away from anything the state says "no" to.  Obviously that means bitcoin's value is lower due to fewer interested parties.

You could always have a legal excuse to carry munitions (er, sorry, encryption) out of the country.  The question is--should you need to pay a lawyer to get that legal excuse, lest you end up in jail for carrying something the government clearly doesn't want you to carry?

Bingo.  The reason you have to force certain types of companies to do what you want is because they used government force to make themselves the only game (sometimes games) in town.  Rogers gets forced to carry stations, Bell gets forced to provide phone service (well, they used to be forced to), and Banks should be forced to provide banking service.
Not because it's right, but because it's the end result of abusing the government.  Live by the sword, die by the sword and all that.

If electricity is free, and the time spent configuring and maintaining the setup isn't eating into things you'd rather be doing, then even getting 1 mhash is good value--assuming the device is also free.

If Quebecers didn't hate the English, why do the majority support the oppression of those who aren't French via loi 101/bill 14?  The excuse of "our culture" isn't just worn thin, it's worn out.  It is out and out exceptionalism.  Being considered a lesser person for not learning Quebecois (as your last sentence insinuates) is exactly what I'm talking about.  Vive le Quebec libre?
Those of you from the US reading that link:  Does it not give you the impression that those who don't speak French in Quebec will be treated as second class citizens in Quebec?  Isn't that how the start of hatred is shown, by thinking of others as a lesser species not worthy of your time?  By stripping them of what makes them distinct?  By subjugating their stores based on the language they speak?  By the government selecting what private jobs they may do based on their language?
If all you use your guns for is hunting, you're all set in Canada.  MANY Americans do not just use/own guns for only that purpose.  MANY own them as collectors items (Many of which wold be banned here--what kind of Collector wouldn't want at least a handgun in their collection?  I suppose there's also stamp collectors that only collect Canadian stamps too, though...), and MANY own them for personal protection.  For those two categories, and again, that covers a LOT of Americans, those Americans will be very disappointed.  Just look at the backlash against the limited magazine sizes in NY to see just how many Americans want to own a gun for more than hunting.  Few simple hunting shotguns are banned under that law, yet thousands of New Yorkers are 'Up in arms' about it.
You are completely wrong about sales tax in the US.  The highest sales tax in any US state maxes out at 11.725% (Arizona):
Only 3 US states have a higher general sales tax than the LOWEST sales tax you will find in ANY province in Canada (Arizona, Illinois, Arkansas).
Only 2% of Americans have a higher sales tax than our lowest sales tax province.  That means 98% will be surprised when they cross the border and buy anything (should they assume Canada is identical).

Yes, without the accident (or some other actual harm) it's not a real crime.
Consider that in many places (where I live) your car only needs to be tested for roadworthyness once, when you buy it.  If you buy a new car, you can drive it until the wheels literally fall off.  Technically, once it stops meeting safety standard the police can pull you over, but the police are not mechanics.  They would have absolutely no idea your ball joints are worn out even if your car *was* on a lift.
Yet, somehow, I've managed to drive for 15 years without either being involved in, witnessing, or even hearing through family about an accident that was because the other vehicle was unsafe.  Perhaps that's because people don't want to die?  Or maybe because people so broke they can't maintain their car also can't afford gas?  Both?  :)

That and, to be completely honest, my wife has admitted, well before we had children, she has no interest in a career.
In my jurisdiction Alimony is a given in any case where just one person is working, whether the spouse is career oriented or not.

Also, minor issue, but it says there's a zip code error when I enter my postal code the proper way (with a space).  Removed the space, and it worked.  The back end should probably just delete spaces and it would be cool (although atypical) if it also figured out when to say zip vs. postal vs. post code.

Bingo.  When I ran a shop and had problem customer, I'd just call the police and the problems were solved.  Typically the problems ranged from customers that believed they could have their issue solved by loitering for a few hours after they'd been told "No, you can't have it your way, now leave" to a customer that shoved me because he felt we treated him poorly (I'll admit I wasn't the nicest guy on the block to do business with, but there's no need for assault).
In both cases, the police came and explained it's a private business and if you're told you must leave, you do, and you don't come back.  Else you'll be cited for trespass.  In the case of the dude that shoved me, 3 cars showed up instead of 1.
If I were selling illegal goods I'd have had to have resorted to pulling out the shotgun under the counter (which I didn't even need as a business man) and telling them they have 10 seconds or they'll be leaving in a wheelbarrow.

Using any hashing algorithm that produces an output smaller than the item being hashed (which is kind of the point) is gong to produce collisions.  People harping on MD5 being broken for passwords need to be hit with a cluebat, hard, because there are multiple possible passwords that will hash to the same result with EVERY hashing algorithm--it's kind of the requirement of being such an algorithm.
Other than the speed aspect of testing against it (which is alleviated by, you know, not handing the attackers your password database) I have yet to see a reason given from someone as to how it helps someone without the MD5 sum authorize themselves.

The store pays, although the user can pay as well depending on how shitty their bank is (mine is free, $3.95 a month in total fees/free if I keep $3k or more in the interest free account).  The amount the store pays, if they put even a small amount of effort in, is 10 - 15 cents per transaction, and thus sets a floor to the price.
Interac (the system by which debit runs in Canada, I suppose you could consider them the electronic version of a cheque clearinghouse) is not really associated with any single bank but is its own entity.  The only source of income they have are from transaction fees.  Thus they must exist.
One thing we do differently from the US (and perhaps elsewhere) is Canadians almost never have a combined Debit and Credit card.  In fact, your average Canadian is quite confused at US terminals asking what type of transaction they'd like to make, since in Canada the card itself tells the terminal if it's for debit or credit.  Not to them that they're not smart enough to realize the card isn't American, so you have to put in a fake zip code... sigh... you'd think that it wouldn't happen for people from Quebec because many of them have their cards coded to tell the terminal to switch to French, but perhaps there's some holdouts in Louisiana?  :P
Credit cards take fees based on percentage, which is why places like Tim Horton's (coffee shop here) prefer Credit Cards over Debit Cards, as with a fixed fee small transactions are much better to do on credit.  Of course, the credit way of doing it is moronic, because the difference between $10,000 and $1 to a computer is a few bytes (most financial institutions store the numbers as straight ASCII so they don't end up with floating point errors and other stupid math problems).

If you have $30k to spend on a bitcoin toy, you probably have $200 to get an electrician to run three split outlets right beside your electrical panel.  And $200 is a generous amount to pay, you could probably find an hungry electrician to do it for $50 if you supply the $50 in parts.
The average joe should be able to wire three such outlets beside the panel in about 2 hours.  If you're doing it yourself and it takes longer than that then you probably don't know enough about the work and should call the electrician in.  :)
As for me, the original wiring in my house (built in 1980, also was the cheapest house built in the city at that time) would support these just fine.  My kitchen came with three split receptacles as required by code (although 1 such receptacle would have been the legal minimum, most people like more than 1--yes, I have checked the fuse panel, they really are all home runs).  A weird place to run the units, but there you go.

Yeah, I know, too wordy, sorry.  I was just trying to provide some support for the argument.  :)
For the heck of it, I chatted with a friend's father, who is a licensed master electrician.  He saw absolutely no reason why you couldn't or shouldn't run a 15A residential circuit at 15A all day if you like, other than suggesting that a little bit of headroom would be smart to prevent nuisance trips.  Heck, he agreed that if you wanted to plug a 20A load into a 15A circuit, assuming the circuit meets code, it's not dangerous.  Just a waste of time.
Did you make sure to mention the type of device being plugged in?  Usually electricians, when they have to worry about power draw, are dealing with fixed loads, which sometimes need to be derated.  But consumer items such as the BFL box don't get that treatment.  That being said, the same electrician I spoke to had to teach lots of journeymen not to waste wire doing derating improperly, so it's common to find electricians that aren't getting it.  He's had ESA multiple times inspect his installations that are at minimum code (hey, cheap clients) and passed A-OK.
Microwaves are advertised (on the box, not on the approval label) based on the radiated power.  They're not 100% efficient, so a 1100 watt microwave will consume significantly more than 1100 watts (mine consumes about 1700, IIRC--I should plug in the watt meter and check for fun).

The fortunate thing is the only purpose in life for grade 8 is to prepare you for grade 9.

Probably because order numbers are only one step more descriptive than random numbers when it comes to BFL.  Order dates and Qty ordered are the only two measures that actually matter.

What is non-sensical is that you can be arrested for driving your own car on your own closed-circuit private race-track drunk.  That's why the mythbusters couldn't actually test their drunk driving theory properly because even out in the absolute middle of nowhere, where the vehicle would run out of gas before it hit anyone, they would be jailed for drunk driving.
If you can find edge cases that prove the law is wrong, that's usually because the law itself is wrong and needs to be brought back to reality.

You're going to run into so many different reasons here, it's going to be difficult for you to get a good understanding.  Here's a short uninclusive list of reasons for living in a world without tax (many of which are opinions and not necessarily fact):
* Taxation is theft
* Taxation removes individual choice and hands it to democracy--the same democracy that is 3 wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner
* Smash the state/general anarchy
* Taxes fund crimes against humanity (war without purpose)
* Taxes fund fiat and thus encourage inflation
* Taxes hurt the poor and help the rich
I could go on, but I think you get the issue.  As for how a tax-less world would work, you'll find an even greater variety of answers, all the way from a completely voluntary society, to general anarchy, to voluntary communism.

I'm not going to suggest paypal aren't without problems.  I hate on them plenty because they typically aren't good with customer service and they do charge too high a fee for what they do, IMHO.  However, despite all that, they are making good on their promise to protect the buyer (this time) so why not give them recognition where it is due?
Bitcoin is the answer to paypal if you want to send money to someone you inherently trust, or if you want to send a donation.  I've been helping out my mother in law with $500 a month.  Since she doesn't use bitcoin, I go to an ATM from my bank, withdraw $500, then drive that $500 to her each month.  Or I could use paypal and their exhorbitant fees would make up for the gas I use.  Bitcoin would solve this entirely.  I know I am not the only one who does this sort of thing.
If you want protection, then you pay for it, and that's where paypal is useful (but not properly useful because they don't support bitcoin).  Here's the key:  **Had bitcoin BFL buyers been able to move their bitcoins through paypal, they would now be receiving bitcoins back.**  There is no technical reason for paypal not to support bitcoin, it is simply a political move.
There's no hypocrisy here because bitcoin is cash and paypal is a service.  You can hate on a service without it affecting bitcoin.  They're different entities entirely and serve different, although dependent, purposes

Nahh, I messed up in my math for some silly reason.  Service is 240 volts.

You won't get it for a very long time, as mentioned.
Issue number 2 is that there's some quality issues cropping up with BFL hardware.  If you check the forums you'll see handful of users whose units have smoked themselves, literally.  Also, some of the jalapenos have crappy fans that self-destruct if you move the unit while it is on.
BFL is nice about sending you a replacement, but you will have several weeks of downtime while waiting for your warranty to happen.  The most frustrating part of the downtime is that since they're busy as heck, they can take weeks to answer your RMA request.
I'm not going to go into the details of the build quality of the mini rig.  While I understand the reasons why BFL and BFL's customers are willing to accept such bullshit (and thus, based on BFL being in the OH JESUS FUCK stage of a company's life, am willing to defend them), it still sucks ass.
(Yes, the article is full of idiotic mistakes, but the pics speak for themselves)
Bonus reason to wait:  BFL's current pricing is too high.  The ROI, by the time you get your unit, will be slim at best, and never at worst.  The old pricing isn't so bad, but you're out of luck for that.

Actually, drunk driving being illegal doesn't seem to be an effective deterrent at all.  Instead the results usually are people driving on a suspended license, which then results in them being unable to get insurance, which then results in their next accident being even more of a nightmare for all involved.  There are a lot of drunk drivers out there that won't stop until they are in prison (and will then immediately re-offend once released).
It seems that the better application of the law, for them, would be to increase the level of punishment once the accident is determined to have been caused by intoxication so they can go to jail where they won't harm others.  You know, rather than taking away their license and asking them be driven to community service for a few weeks (which results in the aforementioned situation).
The thing is, because the law is unjust, you will find nobody who is willing to put someone in PMITA prison over a 0.03 blowtest, because the public knows, in their own hearts, that the guy really isn't guilty of anything.  And that just means you end up with the lax and worthless laws you have now that end up justifying police checkpoints.

It affects the temperature of the fan itself.  The fan has bearings and grease.  Bearings always have a limited life (even when they're lubed for life).  Heat typically shortens the life of mechanical items, which means that when you pull heat through a fan it will (typically slowly) cook the bearings and lead to seizing.
Unless a designer can't design a better way (eg:  They want to avoid negative pressure, or the fan is to be used in combination with intentional heating) one should never design a fan to exhaust hot air--and if one does, appropriate heat rated parts should be sourced.

You have single phase service for your home?  Is it still on DC service?
Your 150 Amp service provides 18 kw.  7 kW produces 24,000 BTU.  A 13 SEER A/C unit (low end nowadays) will use 1 watt of electricity to move 13 BTU.  24,000 BTU will therefore need less than 2 kW to keep cool.
That means that you will use only half of your home's electrical service to both run and cool this unit.  You'll even be able to run the range and dryer (but not at the same time, assuming you crank everything on the range up).
Edit:  Made a dumb mistake myself!!!  36 kw, not 18 kw.

What you're suggesting is that fractional reserve banking lowers the bar for handing out loans (which is correct).
That means that while the same low-risk and/or high-return ventures are still satisfied (as they would have been without fractional reserve banking) higher-risk and/or lower-return ventures are now being satisfied that would not have been before.
While that might appear as a good thing to some, to me, that's why so many businesses fail.  They're high-risk and low-return.

I worked that out too, but only at BFLs old prices and only if you live in the USA.  If you live outside the USA, you can add ~20-25% to the price of the item due to taxes and shipping, plus double the price as BFL doesn't sell that cheap anymore.  My personal guess is about 700-900 million being where the network stabilizes (unless BFL has a big sale in the future--all other ASIC companies are charging several times BFL prices, so I assume they're only looking for the cream customers, not the cheap customers).

These are even worse, they're FCBGA, which means they don't even have pins.  They have pads (or solder balls, whichever you prefer) underneath the chip that require the chip be heated quickly to a small temperature range for them to safely melt and fuse to the board.  Too much temperature, ruin the chip.  Too little and you have the XBOX RROD situation.
Although the hobbyist has ways to deal with this, he also will want to mount dozens of these chips at once, and that will definitely spell disaster for some of the chips if you're not doing it with professional equipment.

You're absolutely right.  I'm sure it took more than a decade for mail order in the US to become trustworthy.  It's going to take time.  Probably quite a bit of time, but I think that being said, far less time than it took for companies to offer good ways to protect your cash from scammers.  We didn't even have credit cards until 1921 (after the concept was invented in 1887).  That's a long time after greebacks were invented.

I live in Canada and understand the differences Americans will notice most.  There are US states that aren't horrible to live in which have no property tax or income tax or sales tax (and states that do generally keep it around 7%).  I am pretty certain in any of the provinces in Canada you cannot avoid any of those three things (except Alberta, where you only pay national sales tax).
In the US being a vocal KKK member, while repugnant, does not put you in prison (1st amendment has no overrides).  And the US has no national language (although I will heartily admit that being Mexican there is not going to help you).
One US state that's nice to visit even allows fully automatic weapons, and most allow several guns you'd never see anyone but SWAT or the Army with in Canada.  And nowhere in Canada can you have a concealed carry permit except if you're a member of law enforcement/have a job that requires it.
But, feel free to correct me if there's anything I'm incorrect on.

If adding bitcoin costs less than the profits on the $2000, who cares?  It's still win-win.  From other comments here, this is literally a mouse click away.  Even at the slim 5%-10% margins on computer hardware, that equals plenty of profits.

Personally, I think the time to payoff for any of these units will be about 1 year (About 1.5 years for jalapeno buyers).   At least I bought with that as my goal.  I think I'll be pleasantly surprised, but won't be disappointed if it takes that long.
Also, I think the number of minirigs sold is actually closer to 30 or 40.  Not totally sure though.  Maybe BFL would tell you if you asked?  Considering they're not longer for sale it's not like it would hurt BFL all that much to let us know.

You can also buy bitcoin equipment and bitcoins themselves on eBay.  Doesn't mean they are permitted for sale, though.  I don't know what SR's policies were on takedowns because I never used the site, but if they're anything like eBay, they're reactionary.

Can I drive a Crown Victoria on any city road in Germany that I choose, since I paid for those roads with taxes, so long as it wouldn't damage the road?
Hint:  I know the answer is no.
Germany also has a rather unpleasant history with socialist parties so it is definitely the last country I would look towards for advice on the topic.  :)
FWIW, the answer to private companies ripping you off for water is called a well.  I can't have one because the city charges a lot for water here and since people would like a well so they can stop paying for it, they made it illegal.  You know, because of save the children and all that jazz.

As a parent planning to homeschool next year, the secret for us is for one parent to focus intensely on improving their career and the other to focus on the home.  My wife will be doing a large portion of homeschooling and I will be providing the backup on subjects she's not familiar with.
It's a large sacrifice, but IMHO, it's entirely worth it.
Private schools (where public schools exist) often aren't really all that much better.  I spent 6 years in one.  The goal for most parents using a private school is increased babysitting and a bonus of being able to talk up how great is is their child attends a better school than your children.  This doesn't bring about a better learning environment.  It brings about spoiled brats.

Next time you're at your local PC shop, ask them how often video cards have clapped out fans.  Those fans are mounted to hot heatsinks and those still have the benefit of correct airflow.
It doesn't take much with dinky cheap fans for them to burn out.  Video cards typically don't run much past 100 degrees, and even if they are, most start to have serious issues if run like that for a long time.

Yes, but if in 2 years 10 Ghash is virtually worthless to mine bitcoins with (if it follows video card trends it would be), your unit is basically garbage (who would buy it, especially once the cost of electricity is higher than the return rate--although I admit for these unit that will be in the satoshis a month range).  In some places you may even have to pay to dispose of it, leaving you with a final negative return.
However, those video cards might be worth 1/4 of what you paid for them in 2 years (based on what I've seen, they'll be even more valuable than that).  That's still a tidy $1,200+ you can pocket.

Most tax law leaves you guilty until proven innocent.  Also, they audit using a lot more tools than just word of mouth (eg:  They use Benford's law to their advantage, they also check your return vs. your neighbours to see if you're likely underreporting).

And social skills are best learned by caging 30 people of almost the same age in a room with someone 2 to 5 times their age, right?
Homeschoolers get far better socialized than institutionalized children.  They have the ability to talk to adults as peers, they have the ability to interact with children twice their age without feeling uncomfortable, and they can give respect where respect is earned, rather than where respect is due (not that institutionalized children actually ever give any respect).

Homeschooling, an option practiced today with proven results that beat public education for quality both in the immediate and the long term, is incredibly affordable (depending on your situation).
If public education *poof* disapparated and *poof* all private educators charged so much even the average person found it out of reach, those private educators would simply not make much money at all as a massive adoption of homeschooling would happen nationwide overnight.
Of course, I'm more of the opinion that the for profit market would recognize the opportunity available to create a lower cost education market so they can take advantage of this sudden glut of students that are being homeschooled.  The large number of 2 working parent families would be happy to shell out a couple of thousand a year per child to these lower cost alternatives rather than give up a job to monitor and educate their children.  And thus homeostasis is born.
But, if that doesn't happen, yup, lots more homeschooling.  Perhaps in clubs with various parents on the block taking shifts.

Performance improvements to Jupiter and Saturn
Here at KnCMiner we have always stated that the final performance of our machines has not been set in stone. We simply do not want to overpromise and then have to correct ourselves later.
The performance increase that we can announce today is based on direct feedback from the chip manufacturer who have been working with us for some time now. They have come back to us confirming the performance improvements in our RTL code.
So it is with great pleasure that we can finally announce our Jupiter is now a 400 GH/s device and therefore Saturn is a 200 GH/s device.
We are now so far down the chip development path that we can safely reveal these figures. There will be further announcements from us about the chip manufacture soon, and we will keep you all informed of all progress
Power usage details
We have previously specified the power consumption of the Jupiter device at a 1000 watts. We have now received indication from our chip manufacturer that this may be lower.
This is where we need to refer you to our statement of under promise and over deliver.
So until you hear from us again on this, we would like to reaffirm that Jupiter will be less than 1000 watts and Saturn less than 500 watts.
Unpaid orders
There has been some confusion about our ordering process. While we may admit that the pre-order registration, 7 day payment window, and even the wording on our site have added to the confusion.
We would like to make it clear that orders which are not paid will not be given a place in the shipping queue until they are successfully paid for.
All orders are kept in your account history and we have not removed any active (New) orders. We will shortly begin removing any unpaid orders from our system if they remain unpaid for more than 7 days.
So for those of you that have been confused by the order/queue/payment process. You will have a few more days to pay for your orders before they are removed. If you have any concerns on this please email us at info
Lottery results
The lottery has now been drawn. The winners have been announced, with their permission on our webpage 
Queue position update
We know you have all been waiting for the shipping queue position update and over the next few days we will be adding a comment to your orders which will give you the day that your boxes will be made, tested and shipped.
For example Day 1/Day 2/Day 3. This will indicate how far from the start of shipping your order will dispatched. This update will not apply to new orders and will only apply to the orders which were based on pre-order registration. All other orders will be dispatched in the order of payment.
Chip Progress report
The more technical audience amongst our customers have been asking for a lot details on the chips we will use. The information we have available to you today is that Jupiter will be a 4 chip design and Saturn a 2 chip design.
This means that we can achieve a minimum of 100GH/s per chip. Which we think most people will agree, puts us far ahead of our current competitors.
Our ASIC package selection has been optimized, allowing the use of a smaller package. The selected package is a 55mm x 55mm HFCBGA package (2046 ball count), optimized for maximum thermal characteristics.
Further news
We are still on track to meet our deadlines of shipping the first boxes in September. We will be providing regular updates in newsletters here and on our site.  so keep checking regularly so you don’t miss out on any updates.

I said back when the fee was built into the client and made hard to change it was a bad idea because it was going to be too much.
"It's just dust" they said.
Now it's about 5x the price of a debit card transaction in Canada.  It's a BIG problem when I can send fiat through my bank to a merchant for FAR less than sending Bitcoin.  Fortunately, there are ways to set the fees to something more realistic.  Should be closer to 1 or 2 cents, IMHO.  That would make it 1/10th the price of a Cash transaction here.

Most teachers are now enforcing communism on school supplies.  They require all parents to overpurchase.  All students then dump their supplies in a bin at the start of the year and the teacher gives 1 of each to each student.  This is why personalized supplies are frowned upon.
As for grading papers, at most of my schools this was accomplished in the laziest fashion possible.  Homework was self-graded (the teacher just walked around the room checking that something was written and then wrote answers on the board).  Tests were occasionally marked by a teacher, but most of the minor ones were passed to the student behind you and the teacher provided the answer key on the board.
Curriculum is provided complete by the state, at least where I am.  If a teacher follows the lazyness I've seen, they can work 35 hours most weeks, with four weeks a year of 60 hours (when midterms/finals are given, as the teacher must mark those themselves).  That's a smokin' hot deal if you ask me.
Due to teacher's unions, no teachers are fired unless they are so publicly shamed (pedo/beating children--I had a teacher with each issue that got the boot) it is deemed necessary.

Well, here's some proof about the school supplies, I don't want to spout off without it.  :)
As for what I plan to use to teach my child, I intend to use the recommended learning levels from the state, but I'll be modifying them to allow her to have the freedom to focus as she wishes, with a supporting hand if she's avoiding subjects so she picks up some interest in them.  There's a few items I will likely not bother with (National Anthem--unless she's particularly interested in it, complete avoidance of religion--I'm atheist but I feel strongly that it's her decision as to what she chooses to believe, extreme phys ed--I went to a school where the phys ed classes consisted of an hour of running... ...that doesn't exactly make children excited to go to them, avoidance of health education--I believe a child should learn sex ed at whatever point they are interested in it, not in "grade 7").
I know there's some great teachers out there.  I did have a couple.  There were some mediocre ones as well that clearly were trying but had fatal personality flaws.  Unfortunately, too many weren't at least trying.  I expect that for the lazy teachers it isn't entirely their fault.  The system is really set up for teachers to fail.  Unions protect horrible teachers, school boards set up defenses against unions and students that put teachers in terrible binds, and the government treats them all like play toys.  The end result, for me, culminated in the entire school system striking for 2 weeks under the union mandated excuse of better pay and fewer students, but the truth is it was gerrymandering that they were afraid of.
Your mother choosing to fund those school supplies was a voluntary act of charity and is to be commended.  Frankly, it's capitalism at its highest.
I'd fight for improvements to the system, but let's put it this way.  The act that makes Canada a country requires the government to fund catholic schools (but oddly enough, not public schools--they choose to do that because it would cause public outrage not to).  Due to this focus on religion, we only got rid of protestant (only) religion it in the public classroom at the start of the 90s.  We only got rid of distributing bibles 4 years ago in my city, and in another city they were fighting to keep that tooth and nail and failed about a year ago.
Besides, I wouldn't be popular.  The public schools in my city were charging $100 for timetables because they were out of money.  I wouldn't pay out of principle (you stole my money via taxes and still aren't satisfied?!) and because I don't want to subject my daughter to my politics, better for her just to avoid that situation.
I suppose I should throw one last thing in, in Canada corporal punishment is still legal in the classroom (Sec 43 of the Canadian Criminal Code).  It hasn't been practiced for a while, and all school boards have banned it, but there's a difference between losing your job and losing your freedom.  As long as that law remains on the books, I'm just not interested.  Nobody hits my child except me, and frankly, I'm not hitting her either.  :)

BitCoin is digital cash.  Treat it as such and you won't be disappointed.  You wouldn't order from a random mail order catalog sent to you whose company you have never heard of nor anyone else.  You would order from the sears catalog (okay, no longer since sears sucks, but you get the point).
If you found something in the possibly scam catalog, you'd choose a different way to send cash that protects your interests (credit card).  The same with bitcoin.  In the case of bitcoin the popular service is escrow, but the future will probably include a credit card service once it's popular enough someone find it worthwhile to figure out.
In the meantime, just like ordering from ads in the 1800s, one needs to be careful not to be scammed.
Really, it's not the currency that's the issue, it's that lack of support infrastructure.  But that only grows with popularity.
Bitcoin shouldn't offer any form of protection past "Is this bitcoin genuine?" -- just the same as cash where the only protection is "Is this $100 bill real or counterfeit?"  Lose your $100 bill, too bad, so sad if you don't have insurance.  Lose your Bitcoin?  That sucks, hope you have insurance.

When you bring a US car into Canada, so long as it meets standards (the Canadian government publishes a VERY long list of cars that do) you pay ~$200 RIV fee + sales tax (same as you'd pay here) + all the other fees they slap you with here (gas guzzler / A/C fee).
Since you pay all those either way, no need to avoid them.  Well, I'd love to, but I'm not willing to risk having stuff seized by customs over it.  Especially an entire vehicle!
Only thing is since you'd not be able to get a plate or insurance until you properly get the car into your name you'd have to tow it to the border.  That's less difficult than you'd think.  :)

$450 buys you a 7970, which produces 650 mhash, with some pocket change left over.
So they cost about the same as a gpu miner that is more than double the speed.
Or you can buy a 7850 @ 300 mhash for $180, and the $270 left over pays for 2.7 Mw/h of electricity, or 2.37 years of electricity.

Avalon does 68 Ghash with 595 watts, BFL does 60 Ghash with 290 watts.  Or so the pictures show...  We'll know better once more than one of the long board units actually leaves their doors.

A polite blowoff is a pointless answer that ignores the question.  For example, I explained to the major grocery chain here I've quit shopping there due to them charging for bags.
Their response was to explain how environmental they were now they charge for bags.
In this case, the bank would have responded with how the US currency system benefits society/civilization (usually one of those is used to snidely suggest the other party is a brutish ape).

 - Believes government should exist and be intertwined with the church
I have a strong feeling this guy has some sort of multiple personality disorder.  Helping to fuel that is that he believes in reason over faith, but wants the government to exist based on faith?  Hey, look, I agree, government isn't reasonable, but we want to push it further towards that?

Alright, here's the simple explanation:  Most oil today is used for things where oil is simply an energy provider.  It could be replaced with electricity or any other energy.  Electricity (or whatever else) isn't being used because oil is cheap.
When oil goes up in price, cars, airplanes, and boats will all use something else.  Electricity for some, hydrogen for others.
The only things that really require oil (that quickly come to mind) would be when it is used as a lubricant (but even then, there *are* other options) and plastics.  And, of course, food.  We can generate oil from corn for only a few times the current oil prices, and those demands are low compared to how much is burned for energy, so we will never run out.
Also, even if we couldn't generate it from corn, prices would simply increase and people would recycle oil like mad (and we'd do a much better job).  Even now, you can buy recycled oil for your engine--economically we're at a point where it's almost a break even deal for re-use vs. burning it in barges.  Give it another 30 years and I expect most oil to be recycled and many vehicles to use alternative energy.
We aren't running out.  We are just going to use less of it.

What is this intrinsic value of gold that makes it valuable?  I understand there's a need for gold to make things like semiconductors and non-tarnishing connections, but that's a very small amount of the consumption of gold.  From the last time I bothered looking, only 11% of all gold is used for making things that actually have to be made of gold.
The rest is saved because it's a shiny thing, or worn because it's a shiny thing.
Bitcoin can be held because it's a fun thing, and you can wear your cellphone with bitcoins in it.
If we discount all the non-industrial uses of gold, gold would fall in value by 90% tonight.

The correct nomenclature would be:
organic -- Fertilized only with fertilizers that were considered safe in 1950 and pesticides from that era, or for animals, products from that era (eg:  Milorganite [yum, PCBs], Rotenone:  LD50 143mg/kg or parkinsons, malachite green:  LD50 80mg/kg or mutagenic)
Non-organic -- Fertilized only with fertilizers that are considered safe in 2013 and pesticides too.  While this includes the above, the unsafe products from that era that are still allowed are avoided because since then newer inventions have usurped them anyways.
Don't fool yourself that the "organic" label means the only thing going on that food is horse poop.  It covers so much more.

How long, at your electricity rate, can you mine "for free" off the price difference between the 130 watt $74 (That's $124 current price - $50 when you sell it on craigslist) 7850 GPU, vs. this device?
During that time where the electricity is effectively pre-paid, will the 7850 pay back the costs of electricity and the $74 it cost you?  if the answer is "yes", then the GPU is still for you.
BTW:  At $0.34/kwh you should consider getting a natural gas generator (buy a propane generator and modify it if you have to).  Those should be making you power at about $0.30/kwh, saving you money.  I have no idea why you would willingly overpay so excessively for electricity!

A switch to any different form of government (or lack thereof) will always entail a difficult learning period.  Everyone gets scammed at least once, this is part of life.  I am willing to bet at some point you were scammed too.  Heck, the first time I was scammed was some time back in Elementary school.
Once people are scammed the first time, they learn not to get scammed again.  Out of the ashes of fuckups like BFL will rise insurance schemes and better escrow systems.  Libertarianism is partly about free reign, but it's also about YOU learning to wisely spend MORE to ensure you have the security you want.

Assuming only the video card and not including the cost of running the PC (which can vary wildly from a power sipping Atom based PC to some multi-CPU behemoth), a 7970 costs 2.5 cents per hour to run where I am (~10 c/kwh).  At today's rates, the 7970 generates 16.1 cents per hour, for a net profit of 13.6 cents per hour.
That leaves you with a 4.6 month break even period.  Of course, difficulty will go up so it will be longer than that.  On the anniversary of your break even period you'll be able to obtain $100 - $200 for the sale of the video card, which should pay for the equipment you had to purchase to run it, if you happen to be learning about bitcoin at your local library instead of on your own home PC.  :P
For comparison, 300 mhash will take, at today's rates, 8.4 months to reach break even.  Again, this period must be longer as difficulty will increase.  In fact, the multiplier for how much longer will be worse than for the 7970, since we're talking about almost double the amount of time for it to do so.  I strongly believe that at the point you've paid for this USB device, its value will be near $0, so the laptop you had to buy to run it (again, reading this at your local library?) will never be paid for.

You are confusing anarchism and libertarianism.  Libertarians believe in the government only existing to protect your right to life, liberty and property.  As part of that, most libertarians believe in a minimal state whose core purpose would be to provide judgement when such rights are violated.  The "laws" would be simple enough a 3 year old would know at what point they were broken.  The costs of maintaining this limited government would be so low that even a small number of satisfied customers would happily choose to pay to maintain it.
Anarchists reject all forms of government, even the absolute minimal form of it protecting and enforcing contracts.
Libertarianism is related to anarchism just as socialism is related to anarchism.  They both take anarchy and form a government around it.  Libertarian society is the first dose, totalitarianism is the last dose, and socialism, communism, and fascism are somewhere in-between.
In summary, a libertarian would be happy to avail himself of legal justice in this matter since they paid for something and didn't receive it.  It's a simple case of theft.  Various libertarians would have different opinions on whether or not today's government are the right tool to solve the issue or not, though, since today's government depends on jackbooted thuggery and thievery to get the problem solved and individuals will differ on whether stealing from a thief is the right thing to do, or if a thief deserves tasering when he refuses to give up his stuff.

Here's the problem:  You're equating the public educating themselves that drinking results in unsafe driving with law enforcement.
It is not illegal to stick a knife in your toaster.  However, that stupid practice ended itself when parents told their children that doing so would result in their death.  There was no need for anyone to outlaw it.  There was a need for education.
Ask someone who is over 65 why people drove drunk back in the 60s.  I guarantee the answers will be one of these:
- It was publicly acceptable at the time, or at least not something you would beat the shit out of someone for doing
- People weren't well educated on the effects of drinking and driving and thus didn't understand the safe limits of the behaviour
I can almost guarantee not a single one will say "Because back then it was legal".  And when asked why it was curbed, I can almost guarantee the answer won't be "Well, people stopped because they changed the law".  Instead, it will be "People stopped because everyone learned it was a terrible behavior and everyone stopped accepting it."
Drunk driving laws are a clear case of the government stepping in after the problem was solved to mop up a free victory.  I file them in with seatbelt laws and texting laws.  
Education is what works (hell, in the case of seatbelt laws, most police departments let you off at the time with a warning if you were willing to watch the video of people getting their faces creamed when not wearing seatbelts).  The laws just happen to exist for a false victory.

Oh lord, the article is even DUMBER:


In what country are you only supplied with a 40 Amp service (remember, that's 2 x 120 volt phases, so 40 Amp @ 240 volts provides 2 x 40 Amp @ 120 Volts?  Where?  Cuba, maybe?  All homes are REQUIRED to have a MINIMUM 60 Amp service BY CODE and VERY FEW got anything less than 100 Amp service because, BY CODE, if you plan to have an electric stove, you gotta have a tiny shoebox of a house to hit the square footage limit for 60 Amp service.
Also, if your house sets on fire because you put too much load on any circuit, or even too much load on the supply feed, your electrician is a fucking idiot and WILL be going to JAIL (possibly for MURDER), along with the inspector that passed your house.  Electrical code does not permit any residential installation where you could actually put more load on the wires than they can safely handle.

Several US states have no sales tax.  You can't own an AK-47 in Canada (you can in Nevada).  Thanks for admitting taxes are high in Canada, I don't like to mention that because someone always points at California as if it is the entirety of the US so I try to avoid that point.
I'm not getting into the healthcare debate as both countries have terrible healthcare systems.

BFL chips can be overclocked too...
...of course, that's assuming they ship the chips.

Very expensive.  Retailers pay less for cash transfers with Interac in Canada.
Bitcoin won't be accepted if it costs more than cash does.
