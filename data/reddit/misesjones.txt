The other not so nice sounding, but vital, thing to say is that in a free market the best players are left with the capital.
This is good because they are more likely to put that capital to some productive use and not consumption.

Of course it did.   The way they handled it the transaction never happened.  But it did happen and you have evidence.
The main thing is they need to explain how they are authorized to release cash which has been deposited to your account to someone who is not on that account.  Maybe they can, but that is ridiculous to me.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:50:58
I would review this closely.  I noted that it clearly states they are not required to identify persons making deposits to your account.  I did not see where they are authorized to reverse a deposit to a person not on your account but I didn't read it closely.

I have had a very good experience with Coinbase (except their buggy credit card backup process, but that is not vital).

I used to be a banker.  I don't understand how they could possibly justify returning deposited cash to someone who is not an accountholder on the account the deposit was made to.
He would seem to have no authority to act on an account he is not a party to other than to make a deposit to it.

This was a joke, but I am one of the ones who believes we need to come up with relevant, one and two syllable names to make the decimals of Bitcoin easier for adopters to get their head around.
It is just what people are used to.
In the US, we have Pennies, Nickles, Dimes, Quarters as our common coins.  Many other countries have similar nicknames for their coins and they become part of the culture.  "Penny for your thoughts", "not worth a plug Nickle", "not a Dimes bit of difference between a Democrat and a Republican".

I would be interested to hear Mr. Tucker's take on this:
One thing is obvious to many of us who pay attention to the slow motion train wreck that is Washington.
Our constant annual deficits are unsustainable and our National Debt is, without a doubt, unpayable.
Since the debt is unpayable, how does Mr. Tucker think our basically corrupt government will try to extinguish this debt and what lies will they tell the public while they do it?
More importantly, what role can Bitcoin and/or other crypto-currencies play to possibly ease the pain of this coming storm for those of us who adopt it.  How does he think this might all play out.
I know this is just a guess, but I think a lot of his opinions.
Sounds like a great show!!

I will leave it at this.  I would nicely ask to see the branch manager.
I would tell them the story indicating that you delivered merchandise upon confirmation that the bank had received a deposit from your customer into your account.
Then ask them to point out in writing in your account agreement where they are authorized to allow a withdrawal of deposited cash to someone who is not authorized on your account. I can't imagine they have a leg to stand on, but understand that they will not admit it readily because somebody will have to answer internally for this loss.
It may be policy, but I don't think they have a legal leg to stand on.  For $4,500 I would sure make them prove they do.
UPDATE:  I am happy to hear you got your money back.  I am also happy and honestly a little surprised to hear about the very helpful manager who ran this down for you.  There are still a lot of good people working in banks.  Unfortunately they are usually not the ones running the banks.

I am going to respond and then we are done because arguing with someone who is not open minded, but foolishly stubborn is a waste of time.
The simplest way I know to point out the incredibly obvious uptrend is:
Approximate average daily $ volume of the 5 lowest volume days in the 2nd Qtr of 2013:  **$9,000,000**.
Approximate average daily $ volume of the 5 lowest volume days in the 1st Qtr of 2014:  **$45,000,000**.
That represents an approximate increase of 400%.
I expect that increase to be at least 500% and probably 1000% or more over the next year.  This is mainly because sellers accepting Bitcoin and the systems to do so are just coming on line.  They barely existed one year ago.
I expect the growth in transaction $ volume to grow exponentially, as in 100 times+ over the next 2 to 5 years.

I had a feeling that was the case.  If they did some kinda bogus intraday reversal it wouldn't show on your statement.
The key point is it happened and they have admitted that.  They handed your money, which had been deposited into your account, to a non-account holder.  I think they thought he was the account holder based on the deposit he made and just did not ask for ID when he wanted to reverse it.  That would be plausible, but it is still their error.  You are in the right here, but it aint gonna be easy.

The problem with this comeback is that it takes one of Buffet's best qualities, his penchant for admitting his mistakes in detail, and uses it against him.  You used his own words from a Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report.

One solution is to only do this kind of thing locally at a single local branch.   Talk with the branch and tell them on occasion this will be happening and it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a contact and let them know when someone is making a deposit to your account.  Especially for that amount of money.

The government can and does print unlimited money.  They will also control interest rates as long as they can.
If the free market was allowed to set rates (as it should) do you think they would be at all time lows based on the current risk environment?  They would be significantly higher. 
Who do these artificially low rates help?  Banks and others with access to the Fed Window who can borrow for a little of nothing and invest it nearly risk free and earn a spread to recapitalize themselves.
Who do these artificially low rates hurt?  Anyone who has responsibly saved capital because they cannot receive a market rate on that capital.  This hits home for me personally because my mother has some of this type of capital which she should be earning many thousands of dollars more on per year if free markets where in effect.
Soooo, tell me why I shouldn't see this as the US government taking money out of my mother's pocket and handing it to businessmen who made terrible investment decisions and did not fully pay for the risks they took?

Good points. A lot of people on here seem to think everything is black and white with a bank.  It is not.  They make decisions, hopefully within the law, every day. 
If they had just been more careful in this situation, asked the guy for ID, told him they needed to contact the account holder prior to reversing the transaction, he would have walked out quickly and the onus wouldn't be on their customer and them to figure this out.
I don't care what they say their policy is.  They were under absolutely no obligation to reverse a transaction for someone who was not a customer.

I agree that knowledge needs to be pooled and standardized and it is in many disciplines.
Where we have a fundamental disagreement is over the idea that any type of state bureaucracy is the proper arbiter of this standardization.  The market will handle it given time.

I don't think most Ponzi's are Ponzi's from the beginning.  Even Madoff said that was not the case.  They usually arise when a mistake happens early and funds are lost and then it just becomes a game to not have to admit the mistake for as long as possible.

But, who would want to pay the higher prices with fiat they deposited when they could acquire the coins at a much lower price on other, safer exchanges?

I like The Wire reference, but probably for a completely different reason.
Andre does sound like the typical person who has lost their money on Gox.  Omar seems to represent the Free Market to me.  There is no government interference in this exchange.  Andre is going to pay what he owes Omar just like the folks who took a risk with Gox are going to lose thier money.
This is a market in its infancy.  The possible returns are huge so, by Free Market principles, the risks are going to be significant and losses will be sustained (because governments won't cover them up).
When this market is more mature and safer and the possible returns are much less, the financially less sophisticated (that is not meant as an insult, I know nothing about physics but those that do get paid in that field) will slowly enter.  They will be taking much less risk at that point, because the early investors who managed their risk the best will have picked the winners (exchanges and other businesses) and will have made the waters safer.

I actually upvoted this because I appreciate you taking this much time to respond.  I think the final sentence was pretty rude and uncalled for, but I am used to that with internet heroes.  Nothing in my post gives any indication I am holding myself out to be a journalist.
I make a habit of analyzing people based on what I believe their motivation and incentives are, rather than what they say. People just lie too easily these days and I am not excluding myself although I try very hard not to tell a lie that harms another in any way. Just covering up my own issues usually.
That said. I was trying to focus on what I believed to be the motivations of these individuals.  My opinion post, and that is all it was, should be read with that in mind.  
My short opinion is that Leah spent a lot of resources, mainly in the form of time, on a story that Newsweek had already pinpointed as the cover story for their print relaunch.  I think she heard what she wanted to hear, because that is what she needed to hear.  It was what was best for her and that is commonly what people are motivated by.

I guess I am saying I respect his opinion on a number of things, but Bitcoin aint one of them.  And it aint gold.

I might change the word most, but I absolutely believe the current valuations in the US stock markets will be proven to be ridiculously high.
The Federal Reserve and the US Government have shot absolutely every arrow they have in their quiver to sustain it. 
It is going to be an ugly fall, timing is the only question.  When that happens, I will likely be interested in equities again (I am still interested in specific ones).
But for now I am mostly interested in protecting the Fiat I do not want in the market and I don't believe the USD is the way to do that.  That is how I found Bitcoin and I am comfortable converting a good bit of savings into it over the USD with the potential I see.
If I am ignorant, so be it.

Like I said.  I was a banker for 20 years.  I am very familiar with intraday accounting.  My point is that, in my experience, a non-accountholder cannot walk up to a teller who took a deposit and ask to reverse it on an account he has not authority over.
It makes no sense. I would not accept any amount of explaining from bank personnel until they show me their authority to do this in an account agreement and then I would want to see how this is legal.  Accounting practice and legality are two different things.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:27:37
Once that deposit was placed into his account, that person did not have the authority to withdraw it or reverse that deposit.  If the bank asked for an ID and he said he was not the account holder, would they have taken money out of their drawer and handed it to him?  They didn't do their job.

A Ponzi is always run by an individual or a very small group of individuals who control the inflows and outflows of money.
Who is that in the Bitcoin world?  MTGOX may have been a Ponzi, but we all know that is not Bitcoin.
Edited to add that if we are talking about one of the many goverment Ponzi's, then that very small group becomes very large.

I think this post has fostered a good discussion, if we keep it civil.
One of the things that attracts me to Bitcoin and this community is its many Libertarian qualities. My username might make that obvious.
Along that vein, I am very hopeful that as people adopt and use Bitcoin they will become more independent thinkers with little need to be "protected".  It seems this thread is about protection.
I am interested in other thoughts on this.  I am not interested in being protected, but I also do not want to see people get hurt so it is a bit of a conundrum (5th grade vocab baby!!) for me.

The FACT is that there are many people who were using GOX as a casino and now they want to act like innocent bystanders since they lost their money to a corrupt, incompetent casino.
I am sympathetic to the many innocent folks for whom GOX was their only choice to obtain BTC easily, but many who knew better and had others options are now doing a lot of bellyaching about how this shakes their confidence in Bitcoin.

I guess I don't understand your point.  If the guy walked back up and said  he deposited the cash into someone's account by mistake, the bank should not release that cash without contacting the account holder.
Who would have said it was a proper deposit and it was in fact his money for merchandise he delivered.  The guy was knowingly commiting fraud and the bank could have stopped it by doing their job, what am I missing?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:20:18
Also upvoted because discussion is needed.  This is a well worded argument, but everything about it needs to be seen through the lens of existing government regulations which fog up the entire lens.
Mt. Gox would never have remained a viable exchange if existing government regulations the world over didn't make it so difficult for better players to enter the exchange market.  That is changing, but it would have happened much more quickly if not for the minefield of existing regs.
This also applies to online poker and a myriad of other issues.

Another example of someone who has "made it" with the media and has forgotten that effort and research are required to make proper judgements on things.

I had the same problem trading Aurocoin yesterday.  I finally figured out that the entire trading screen was blipping back and forth between current and 15 minutes earlier.  Half the time you weren't seeing the current market data for the coin.  That is why your orders weren't executing.
I sent them a message and told them they should roll back all trading on the coin to the time before the problem started.  They admitted they had technical problems, but did not answer on the roll back idea.
I have traded a lot on Cryptsy and have found it to be bascally a well run site compared to most, but this was a major snafu that cost people a lot of money.  The coin went down on heavy volume during these problems as everyone was panic selling because they couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.
I sent a final message saying that if they did not have a plan for handling this kind of F up in the future they were going to lose customers as soon as a better option came along.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:42:31
Well said. 
If you don't look under the hood, it can definitely be mistaken for a Ponzi, but people have a tendancy now to call anything that goes up a Ponzi.
I believe that most major world stock markets, the US Social Security system and any number of other accepted things are much more like a Ponzi scheme than Bitcoin ever will be.

As I have stated elsewhere, it is very common for people to make deposits to accounts that are not theirs. It is done every day.
What is your source for "You are not supposed to pay people through this mechanism."  If you are in two different towns it is a very convenient way to transfer money.
No doubt the poster could have handled this better by informing the bank what was happening, but it was the crook involved and the bank being lax that caused the problem.

If you are not familiar with Bill Miller, he is a legend among value investors.  Truly one of the most respected people in the investing world.
To me this is what happens when a guy with an investing intellect like his digs into Bitcoin.  They "get it" like we do and they see the tremendous potential.
Almost without fail, when I see someone intelligent disparage Bitcoin, it is obvious by their comments that they have not taken the time to understand it. Investing genius Warren Buffett included.
Miller clearly stated that he owns it personally and as soon as it is feasible his funds will own it in some form.

I don't have any idea of the makeup of the vast majority of bitcoiners.  
I do believe that those of us who have studied and understand the technology are making a bet that it will be a world changing one.  That is the idealogical bond we all have.
I am also pragmatic and a greedy capitalist.  Because I have put in the work to understand the technology, it allows me to make a confident bet.  If I am right, I can also benefit from "stacking some cheddar" as this thing takes off.
So those of us who believe in it win in two ways.  Why wouldn't we feel a brotherhood?
