You can tell I’m not a local.

I had a similar issue when I upgraded my phone. However I maintained the same number and still had my old phone. So I logged into Authenticator on my old phone to log into CB on my new phone and did some magic on my google and CB accounts to get a new authenticator instance on my new phone.
I realize this might not help your case but I hope I’ve provided a smidge I’d help. Good luck.

Is there any way to reduce fees if I want to transfer my crypto out of coinbase and into a wallet?

Sure, I’ll try:
Authenticator is an app by google that generates unique 6 digit keys that can be used for 2fa (2-factor authentication) for verifying accounts on for various platforms, one of which is Coinbase. Once a generator is made for your account, for example Coinbase, it cannot be created somewhere else. OP’s issue, and my previous issue as well, is that the authenticator app was on our old devices and therefore cannot be moved to our new phones. For OP, they had the additional difficulty of no longer having their old device, I fortunately did.
Since Google Authenticator (GA) cannot be created on my new phone without deleting my old one, I had to sign into my coinbase account on my new phone using GA on my old phone. Once I was signed into my CB account on my new phone, I was able to delete the GA instance for CB on my old phone. Then I went into my GA account online to create a new GA instance on my new phone. Since GA is supposed to be unique, I had to delete the old one on my old phone before creating a new one on my new phone.
OP is stuck because they don’t have their old device with GA to log into CB on their new phone and they can’t create a new instance of GA on their new phone without deleting the old one.
Hope it was clear enough, not sure what exactly you wanted explained.
