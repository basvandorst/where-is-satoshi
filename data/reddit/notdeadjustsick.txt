What strikes me most about reading all these threads is every one here might not have gotten sick had the Center of Disease Control taken it seriously when doctors from Incline Village (Lake Tahoe) and New York called them to say there was an illness that they had not seen before.  People getting a flu like illness but not fully recovering.  I along with my study abroad class mates got sick that year, July 5, 1985 that was 32 years ago.  Instead of acting swiftly the team sent from the CDC to investigate looked at a few files, did not examine a single patient, and not knowing how to evaluate the labs took the rest of the day off and went skiing.  The context of the time I think is critical, researchers were absorbed with AIDS and a re-emergence of Ebola.  The disaster for the patients was the illness was given no attention, and even less respect. For 32 years technology did not exist to be able to see how DNA was changing, how come patients that were sick longer than 5 years had blood work that canceled out the markers of patients that had not been sick that long. Now the technology is here, but inertia is our enemy.  Groups like the Open Medical Foundation need creative sources for support to create the base studies large enough to be able to get us into the funding pool for National Studies.  It makes me so sad to know that all the people on this list did not need to get sick. They are sick because of 32 years of Apathy, thank you for helping to change this story.
