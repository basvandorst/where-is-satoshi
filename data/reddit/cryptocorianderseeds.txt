I'm thinking we probably haven't heard the full story, here. Their terms expressly state how the balance of terminated accounts is to be settled:

Someone who'd rather be writing for a Hollywood gossip column, I think. In the article he addresses her as 'honeypie' and 'baby girl', topping it all off with the picture texts 'Easy there, Sharon Stone' and 'Can you spot which dog in this picture "innovated" Credit Default Swaps?'    
It's like watching a 90's anti-hero trying to be cool.

Ok cool, now if only the content of the article wasn't a flat contradiction of the headline, that would have been interesting to read. Unfortunately though, as the article itself states, cash is legal tender by law, and while usage is dropping, there are no actual plans to remove that piece of legislation. ZH at its finest.

Amazon does offer limited hosting services in the Netherlands. It's an 'edge location'.

They reserve the right to end service with [20 days notice(page 14)]( for any reason they like. These overall agreement terms apply to all plans as far as I can tell.
Edit: In addition, they define you as a small customer or business customer according to your power use. It's unclear to me what would happen if your usage increases and crosses the boundary - Presumably they would have cause to react to that as well.

Or rape you, let's not forget.    
It's always kind of sad when washed-out celebrities pimp themselves out like this. I think the chance of Tyson having any idea whatsoever what bitcoin is or how it works is basically zero.

Why is controlling the assets of a single person in a known location easier than controlling an unknown number of cash streams from unknown individuals to an organization of uncertain size, you mean? Gee, I wonder.

I don't know anything about VHS and DVD history, but the internet was originally only valuable to scientists. It existed happily for years before it even _had_ commercial porn.

OK, listen. I don't mean to be rude, but that's not what a party looks like.

Taking part in and missing the point of, it seems. Give something they are interested in, not something you are interested in.

* Has no mention whatsoever of how bitcoin is doing in Nigeria

Right, pesky regulations suddenly showing up at a week's notice. Terrible shame.
Anyway, I represent someone who wants to sell the Washington Monument for a symbolic amount, would you perhaps be interested?
