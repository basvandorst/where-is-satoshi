Mike Hearn is right. That is the Bitcoin the comunity wants and it is also Satoshi's vision. A bitcoin that will scale, not one crippled by a few miopíc developers full of conflict of interests. Gavin: Please remove those developers and then remove the block size limit.

144 empty blocks would destroy bitcoin forever.
better just 20 MG
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:58:59
Put this message in the blocks or it didn't happen. 
Also, protocol could allow blocks of 20MG and Chinese miners can make blocks of 8 MG and nobody can force them to make them bigger.

Low volatility is key for confidence.
So with low volatility bitcoin can go to the moon.
So for bitcoin to go to the moon is important that price stays in a narrow range.

Proof that miners are colluding and attempting to take away 75% of Hash power to an alcoin implementation should be on topic.

Great news! Hopefully price will not drop too much.

Its not a bug. Transactions need to have enough fee to be included in a block; Its a Bitcoin feature to ensure that the limited space on the blocks is awarded to the transactions with higher fees. The limited space on blocks is also not a bug; Its a feature to ensure success of other payment channels being worked on by bitcoin core developers.
