I just tried this yesterday. Works great and saved 20%. It's very simple and seamless. In the Airbitz app go to Buy / Sell / Spend Bitcoin. Select Starbucks and add funds. In a few seconds a gift card balance will appear. Starbucks clerk will scan the code and that's it. It even tells you the amount remaining on the gift card after a purchase. Well done Airbitz and Fold.
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:30:22
Love it. Thank you Airbitz and Fold

It's the photo and angle. I need to take better pictures for my website. The hats look a lot better in person, especially the white hat. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:12:00
Excellent job CoinSafe. Loving the new innovation we're seeing. It will help with adoption.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:26:03
Thank you for your purchase. I appreciate it. Your hats will be shipped today.
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:18:58
Now, right here. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:42:04
Thank you. Glad you're satisfied with Seals With Clubs hat. I appreciate the business.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:36:31
You're right about the "new moon race." I think you can add other countries in that new moon race as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:20:52
By the way, I haven't forgotten about your shirt. I should be doing a new run within the next few weeks.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:50:14
Thank you. Did you see the sizing chart on the website? If you have any questions, let me know.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:32:51
Here you go. Shipped today  Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:04:16
Well done! Thank you for efforts.
@_date: 2014-05-07 22:27:54
Excellent, thank you for the order, I appreciate it. I'll get in the mail.
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:29:36
It's here 
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:11:14
Hope it gets funded as well. Even though the Piper Wallet is very similar, the more option for simple and easier paper wallet generators is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:49:11
Thank you
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:10:25
You misunderstood me. I was agreeing with you. That's why I said true. By you saying "keep them safe in my own way." That's like you saying holding your own private keys not coinbase.

The money is coming from Venture capitalists. Not sure exactly who though.
Xapo is not the only startup where big money is investing. There are companies like Coinbase, BitPay, Circle, Vaurum. The VC know the future is in bitcoin. The next 6 months to a year is going to be exciting to watch.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:06:36
Thank you for your purchase and the kind words. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:26:28
Thanks for the pointer, I'll fix it.. No offense taken.
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:29:25
Agree, well said.
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:19:14
Yes, here 
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:39:37
I really like the site. Well done. How do I get my bitcoin apparel to appear on there? Specifically my bitcoin hats. Thanks
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:34:31
Damn, I'd love to get involved. I'm a big MMA and bitcoin fan :) If you need someone, I can do the hats and shirts. I do screen printing and embroidery. But July 5th is just around the corner. This is a great idea though.
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:04:27
I actually just bought tires at Costco last week. If only I would of known of Vulcan Tire. Next time, I'll be able to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:43:39
I know it man. I haven't forgotten about you. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:44:38
This is great. Thanks for coming on reddit. I just read through the thread and a lot of my questions were answered. 
One question though. Do you know of anyone in the United States that purchased a SkyHook and has been investigated or bothered by the Government?
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:25:41
Shipping is free. Sure, I'll knock off $5 for you, if you buy 3. Make a note when you purchase or drop me an email, so I'm reminded.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:38:11
True, if you don't hold the private keys of your bitcoins you are not the owner. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:37:39
Portland has a solid bitcoin presence. I've sold quit a few bitcoin hats in that area. Good area for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:27:43
Thank you. Yes, my hats are made with high quality material and they are FlexFit.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:46:58
Sorry, but what is tf2?
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:49:01
Do you need to "stock it" with your own bitcoins or does it access an exchange and purchase the coins for the end user?
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:14:41
Just wanted to thank you guys for stepping up and accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:57:59
Oh man, that is so cool wearing the bitcoin hat and struck up the conversation. I appreciate you buying the hat from me. 
If anybody has any questions about my hats, let me know.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:48:59
Thank you
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:05:03
Ok, set it up on my site. I placed it on the side area of my news section to test it. [See here]( It's not compatible with Woocommerce. If you look at the BitPay plugin it appears under the Woocommerce check out options. BTW, the other option you see that says bitcoin is a different plugin called "Bitcoin Payments For Woocommerce" I've tried but don't use. You might need to coordinate with the folks from Woocommerce to Gear compatible.
Also I'm receiving errors when I attempt to use gear. It either says, it's not enough funds received or too much funds sent. This error appears in about 10 to 15 seconds. I never had a chance to pay before the error appeared. It says I have 15 minutes to pay.
This was very simple to setup. Is their a way to add more details for a product? Like a drop down menu for sizes, quantity, etc. Thanks for your hard work.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:22:49
Get bitcoin from Coinbase or Circle. If you do not want to give up personal info, use localbitcoins.com find a seller near you. You will pay a little higher premium. Then move your bitcoin to one of these below:
Smart phone use: Mycelium or Airbitz
For computer use: Multibit or Electrum
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:14:17
This is awesome. Currently I use BitPay via  Woocommerce on my site. I'm going to try Gear. Looking forward to it working with Woocommerce as well. Hopefully that's in the works.
BTW, if you guys are looking for a screen printer for custom shirts, hoodies, etc., contact me. I have competitive prices, fast turn around, and I accept bitcoin. Keep up the great work. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:44:09
How many bitcoins do you need to start off with, in order to get it operational?
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:23:10
I can make that happen. If the Mycelium crew contacts me. I do screen printing and embroidery.

Can't wait for this kid to roll up to his 20 year reunion in a Lambo with a license plate that says itoldu
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:19:07
I had to sign in to Gear get a link.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:35:04
Ok, I'll check it out and let you know.
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:21:23
No problem man. If you want XXL shirts, I'll get them made for you. Email me and I'll get it done.
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:22:46
You can wear some bitcoin gear. It's a good way to strike up a conversation about bitcoin. Sort of a ice breaker. Shameless plug of the hats I sale :) [Bitcoin Hats](
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:34:27
Sorry you feel that way. I work hard collecting positive bitcoin news and put them in one area for people to read on my site. I've developed relationships with other sites to provide snippets of articles and links.
I'm very active within the bitcoin community and my reputation is important to me.
My site also has lots of content for people to learn about bitcoin. My objective is to spread the positive news about bitcoin and provide information for people to learn about it.
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:52:49
I got my 21.1 mBTC. It worked. TY
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:33:58
Great info. Thanks
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:27:01
I've heard people say that about a lot of bitcoin gear. They say "Gooo Boston"
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:10:43
It's clear bitcoin is entering its next phase, Wall Street. Buckle up for the ride.

Use Airbitz for your phone and Multibit for PC.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:07:36
Awesome list. Thank you. Needs to be a sticky or on the side bar.

@_date: 2017-08-10 15:08:45
Yes. You'll need an OTG cable
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:00:27
Very good explanation
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:32:00
Just pick up a good looking [hat]( Selfish plug by me :)
But people do seem to like my hats.
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:36:03
Just curious
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:07:28
Excellent, best of luck to you guys. Keep up the good work and keep on bitcoining!
@_date: 2015-07-06 01:31:38
This is exactly what I started doing. I offer screen printing &amp; embroidery for bitcoin. And I embroidered really cool flexfit bitcoin hats that are for sale on my website. People seem to like them and they buy them with bitcoin [here](
The bitcoin community is great. BTW, fresh new stock will be available next week.

Great job. Just tweeted the link.

@_date: 2015-07-26 13:02:06
This is fantastic. Well done. Looking forward to seeing further developments and success!
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:22:04
Here's what I'd do if I was in your situation.
First - Download the Coinbase app. This is where you can buy and sell BTC with USD. It also has a wallet. Note: Coinbase links to your bank account and abides by all U.S. banking laws and regulations. This wallet will be good for your buying and selling transactions. 
Second = Download Mycelium (wallet) app. This wallet is compatible with my third recommendation (Coinbase is not). 
Third - Purchase a Trezor. This is a hardware wallet. This is the best security for your bitcoin savings. It can connect to your phone and work with your Mycelium wallet.
Basically, this sets you up for a buying and selling wallet and a savings wallet all on your phone. Be sure to encrypt your wallets and setup 2-factor authentication for security.
