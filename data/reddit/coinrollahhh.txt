Reading the description of the r/bitcoin and going in see all the fricking “investors” is sad. Its a currency that means it have to be used to pay and buy and do business with it just like dollars yens euros and shit... if not libra there will be another thing that will fuck up bitcoin with expert investors.

Bitcoin is supposed to be a subsitute for money, what are you talking about? People heard thr word ‘mining’ and suddennly is fucking gold..
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:28:56
This is exactly what i think everytime i see a post here(well 90% of the time). The sub name shouldve been HoldBitcoin or BitCoinInvestors or someshit like that.. but its Bitcoin so someone has to think of a way of using bitcoin as a way of payment for what it was created for and not: hOdl, tO tHe MoOn and stupid shit like that. 
From you guys only billionaires will get more rich.

@_date: 2019-06-25 01:04:22
The answer is in your question. How much btcc u get with 11000$ if its 0.28$ ... probably 30000+ not 0.9btcc...
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:38:17
Anyone for the cause or just fucking “crypto expert investors” here??
@_date: 2019-12-15 08:58:37
These billionaire guys doing tests. Invest 80k tweet and see public reactions price up to 7.5 boom sell. Damn this works lets try with 800k this time...
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:21:17
1st thing first ppl need to learn how to use bitcoin, if everybody just want to invest and make money than this shit doesnt work like that, use bitcoins u idiots.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:58:38
