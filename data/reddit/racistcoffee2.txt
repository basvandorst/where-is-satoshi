Dude, please don't kill yourself. There are other ways you can put food on the table.
I appreciate how drastic the situation is, but your boys will be torn apart without a father.
Insurance companies often don't pay out for suicides. and even if they do, they can drag their heels for years and years.
A suicide in a family increases the risk of subsequent suicides. 
So what you may consider noble could end up in them killing themselves due to your shortsightedness.
My friends father killed himself and it is a massive burden to carry, my friend blames himself at times for it and wonders if he could somehow have saved his father's life.
Please don't do that to yourself and your family
 Your sons will appreciate in their adulthood the time spent with their family massively.
By leaving this world you will be leaving a massive hole in their lives.
Fastforward 10, 20 years Imagine your joy as your sons get their first jobs or have their wives or have their first kids.
These are days you should be around to celebrate and enjoy with them. 
If you need to talk , feel free to message me over the next few days, I login every other day.
Or contact Samaritans or a therapist and get the feelings out there.
I hope you get some better news regarding the hack and a repayment of your money with time. Or at least some of it.
Please keep the head up

Thanks, I got an email reply from them and I'm going to try and reset TFA now, but the website is under heavy load again, Ddos attacks probably as the other people have alluded to.
