IMO you should, but what do I know
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:21:03
Yeah I was planning on buying one then they went on backorder. I ordered one from Amazon for about $160. Sucks but I'd rather spend extra money on a wallet than continue keeping my coins on an exchange or software wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:50:05
It works just like any exchange. You have to verify your ID, link a bank account, transfer your coin in, then sell for USD.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:41:09
To send from one address to another it must be broadcast to the bitcoin network. So no, there is no way to do what you want to do.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:55:50
In the US there is a consumer finance bureau that you can file complaints with. I suggest you figure out the UK equivalent of that and report them.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:57:37
Put it into blockchain.info and see if your transaction is listed. The only way to tell its yours is to know the exact amount and to know when they allegedly sent it.
But again, there is no guarantee it will be the same wallet address as last time (in fact it would be pretty crazy if it was).

You cannot make money mining bitcoin. you will in fact lose money. I suggest you mine an altcoin instead.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:10:25


Never heard of it. I use this website to check what my fee should be: 
But again, if you use coinbase and gdax you wont have to pay any fees at all.

What do you mean by provider? 
And how could this provider steal "secure codes"? Whatever those are.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:00:06
That would entirely depend on what type of coin you want to mine.

Wow what a well thought out concept. I really liked how you backed up your hypothesis with facts...

I am invested in a few alts because I believe in the technology and the team developing it. I don't buy alts just because they might go up quickly.

@_date: 2018-01-05 15:02:33
Maybe stop using localbitcoins?
If you use Coinbase and GDax they pay for your transfer fees. All you have to pay is a buying fee to coinbase, but it will still be cheaper than LBC

The AntMiner S9 costs about $2000 and mines at a rate of 13.5 Th/s. That means you get 0.01201 btc/day which means it would take about 83.5 days to mine one entire bitcoin.
But you wouldn't make a profit off of that unless you get free electricity. Also note this is mining hardware, not mining software. I have no idea what $18k mining rig you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:59:09
They wont respond to your emails. Search around for their support phone number and call them.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:39:51
Yes you are missing something.
The amounts I posted are completely theoretical. Those figures are calculated under the assumption that your miner will continuously find and win blocks. That is basically impossible with a single antminer.
With real world numbers (if you bought only one and plugged it in at your house) would mean you would only make about $150/month. It costs about $15/day to power the miner, so you would be operating at a net loss of -$300/month.
This is why there are mining pools and centralized mining companies. They need to use a shitload of these miners to actually get the blocks and make a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:47:21
Interesting but not super useful. At least show what the fee will be in sat/bytes. 
I don't really see any reason to use this TBH, but good job.

That is where you messed up. That fee is WAY too low.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:30:58
A ledger is a hardware wallet which is much more secure than a software wallet. They cost about $90 US, but it is totally worth it if you're serious about keeping your investments safe.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:01:48
Yes this is the correct answer.
If you are paid in something other than money, and that thing has a real dollar value, than you must pay taxes on it (like if you got paid with gold).
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:42:49
Because OP could post his Tx ID which I am willing to bet has a severely low fee. Instead of doing this OP just claims "bitcoin is shit. my fee was normal" without offering up proof.
I sent bitcoin yesterday with a "normal" fee and it took about 15 minutes total. So OP is either a noob who fucked up his own transaction, or he's just spreading FUD.

Well we've been going up all day, so maybe now isn't the best time to buy (wait for the dip).
But day trading is really hard. Most people will wait for a dip that never comes, or the dip is still higher than what it was at originally.
So I usually tell people to buy now, because I 100% believe it will go higher (at some point) than it currently is.

You don't understand SaaS development. They all got a massive new influx of users after the holidays. That was in part due to word of mouth from family, but also from a few alts skyrocketing. Everyone and their uncle is trying to get their hands on alts right now, and there aren't a ton of legit options.
If you haven't planned for this it's going to overload your site.
Do you even know what they have to do to allow for more concurrent users? I bet you don't.

So what. It is still a free exchange.
Are you ID verified on it? Because if you are someone could really fuck your financial shit up.
It's also against TOS to use someone else's account, so it would be found out and shut down.

Calm down. Exchanges (and blockchain.info) group transactions together to save on fees. This is standard practice.
But your fees are too low. You'll be lucky if that confirms in less than a week.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:46:10
Well if it is from an exchange you'll have no way of knowing what address they allegedly sent the coins from. Exchanges group transactions together to save on fees, so it could be coming from any number of addresses.
If it was coin from a person, you would be able to get their wallet address.
I guess just try contacting support because if the transaction isn't even showing on your wallet, you don't know the TX ID, and you don't know the wallet ID it was supposedly sent from then there is no way to see the transaction.
You could try looking at the address from the last TX you did with them, but there is no guarantee it will be where they sent this one from.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:56:17
Probably around the same time as the heat death of the universe.
Seriously though, no one can tell you. There is no set time where a node must drop a transaction. It might take an hour or it might take a month.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:26:03
Well if you already have bitcoin in Coinbase you're screwed; you'll have to pay the fees to transfer out.
I suggest you use a different exchange. Something like Bitstamp or Gemini.

There are a few theories:

There are other alternatives too. I could really put my tinfoil hat on and think of some crazy scenarios.

Some people have reported getting it instantly. Some in like a week. Some in a couple weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:48:06
You should never hold bitcoin in an exchange!! If it gets hacked or something you're fucked. That being said, Coinbase is probably the safest exchange to store in (if you must) since their ~~BTC and~~ USD wallets are backed up by FDIC. Their BTC wallets are backed by their own insurance.


But the best option would be a software, hardware, or paper wallet.
Also, yes Coinbase is shit. I bought today on Coinbase and I'm highly regretting it, as withdrawls are taking about 12 hours...

Its actually more like the IRS is paying to do blockchain analysis in hopes they catch tax cheats. Also they subpoenaed Coinbase for some of their users.


Well like I said, how would the US Govt know if I have altcoins on a non-US exchange? As long as I don't sell them they would never be able to find out.

Yes high fees are absolutely a problem with the platform.

Use bitpay to get a bitpay card, then you can buy whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:07:42
The fee is based on the size of the transaction. The more coin you send, the higher the fee will be.
And yeah, the fees are crazy high. High fees is one of the things that is plaguing bitcoin.

The Ledger's hardware is secure and tamper proof. There is literally no way to fuck with the hardware and have the device still work.
The software could be tampered with in theory, but it would be VERY obvious to anyone not rushing through the setup process.
Also, a lot of the Ledgers on Amazon are fulfilled by Amazon, which makes it even safer.

The real issue here is that CPUs are insanely expensive to design. The fabrication is even harder and even more expensive. That's why people talk about the "silicon lottery". 
I think there is a big demand for open source hardware, but I don't see how a company could do that and remain profitable. And unfortunately it would have to be a big company due to the overly prohibitive cost of design and manufacturing.

Oh I see. You're referring to altcoin exchanges. Yes this is a massive pain in the ass which is pretty much unenforceable by the IRS.
If I, as a US citizen, sign up on a non-US exchange, send bitcoin to it, then trade for alts how would the US government find out? They have no acccess to this non-US exchange, they don't know my wallet addresses, and even if they did they could never prove that I own those coins.
It really seems like a non-issue to me unless you're trading massive volume of alts.
I plan on not worrying about it.

It's the same reason why people say not to tell anyone if you're trying to achieve a goal (whatever that goal is). There is ALWAYS someone who wants to see you fail, just so they get some smug satisfaction. Fuck those people.

I'm not saying you're lying, but maybe you are mistaken. Looking at the mempool on 12/12 it is very clear that 30sat/byte is way too low. 
If someone or some website actually did tell you that 30 sat/byte was the recommended fee, I suggest you stop listen to what that source is saying. Because they were clearly very very wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:09:34
No, it won't.
You could try a transaction accelerator. Just search for "bitcoin transaction accelerator" on your favorite search engine. I have never used one, but I have heard they work. 
Besides that there really isn't anything you can do.

@_date: 2018-01-02 20:45:42
Doesn't matter. You still won't make money. I'll just copy/paste from my other comment.
The amounts I posted are completely theoretical. Those figures are calculated under the assumption that your miner will continuously find and win blocks. That is basically impossible with a single antminer.
With real world numbers (if you bought only one and plugged it in at your house) would mean you would only make about $150/month. It costs about $15/day to power the miner, so you would be operating at a net loss of -$300/month.
This is why there are mining pools and centralized mining companies. They need to use a shitload of these miners to actually get the blocks and make a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:45:53
Correct. LN is most useful for small transactions like buying a coffee.

Fee on TX 1: 17.083 sat/B
Fee on TX 2: 26.964 sat/B
Fee on TX 3: 27.105 sat/B
So there is your problem. Those fess are WAY too low. Like WAY WAY too low. If an accelerator doesn't work then your only choice is to wait. Eventually the coins will be returned to you, but it could take like a month.

While the CPU design is really hard, that would be the easy part.
The almost impossible part would be manufacturing it. Intel and AMD have sunk billions of dollars into researching and doing the fabrication. You need insanely precise machines (like nanometer percise), clean rooms, and a ton of other shit. The capitol to start and fund a manufacturing center is insane, and there is no way Intel or AMD would let some open-source competitor use their facilities.

72 hours is the default but a node can continue to broadcast a tx for as long as they want. So the earliest it will be returned is 72 hours, but it could be much longer.

First look at the blockchain.info link you posted. On the right side under "Inputs and Outputs" there is a field called "Fee per byte". For your transaction the fee you used is 457.456 sat/B.
Now go look at this fee explorer: 
The left column is in satoshis/Byte which is the same measure as on blockchain.info. So scroll down until you find your fee of 457. Look all the way to the right of that row and you'll see that it says confirmation will happen in between 20-360 minutes.

Of course they want to over leverage you. They give poor people high interest deferred loans until the system crashes. That forces the homeowner to sell to the bank, and the bank resells the house to another sucker. That's the basis of the 2008 financial crisis.
Companies do the same thing with car loans. There's an ad on my local radio that says they'll give you up to $35k in credit with no money down even with bad credit. When the person invlevitebaly can't make the payments they reposses and resell. They might resell a car 10 times in a couple years.

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:02


This isn't true at all. Look at the mempool. Any fee higher than 600 sat/B will go through. The majority of people are using 821 sat/B.

What the hell are you talking about? If you buy one coin now and it goes up to $100k then you get $85k in profit...
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:51:55
Profits 200 what and in what time frame?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:09
Coinbase is pretty secure but why risk it
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:18:50
Your fee is WAY too low.
You only did 62 sat/B which should be picked up between 3-55 blocks (aka 25-600 minutes) if it even goes through at all. My guess is that it wont go through.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:42:48
Well your fee isn't large. In fact it is under the current average of 990 sat/B. Look at the mempool.
You used 741.977 sat/B so that means your transaction will take between 40-960 minutes. [Source](

No one.
Amazon is reliable but they sell for like $120
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:27:15
You can check the mempool to see how long it will take.
Also just because you did a previous tansfer that was fast with that fee doesn't mean that this one will be fast.

How much is a decent return?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:42:38
Don't do the sell high then buy back in low thing. It is really hard to do and will fuck you over.
Just buy and hold. I suggest you buy now, because on Sunday when futures trading starts the price is gonna go way up (probably)
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:50
Depends on the fee and the tx size. Can you post the link to the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:37:57

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:40:30
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:53:06
It sounds reasonable until you read that they were charging $20 fees with no option to change it. Look at the mempool right now. You can get into the next block for like $1
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:05
Yeah I should have said that your fee wasn't that large in relation to the rest of the network. I agree $89 to move $200 is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:35:18
The best would be a ~~software~~ hardware wallet like the Nano S. You can store all of your coins on it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:35:59
You don't need a wallet to buy Bitcoin.
Go to an exchange like coinbase and buy coin. Then if you want to, transfer it to a wallet (you REALLU should do that, but it isn't a requirement)
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:37:44
I don't know about Canada, but in the US you only have to pay taxes if you sell for USD.

For many of us "mastering bitcoin" is just holding... not too complicated
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:10
With that fee you're looking at 4-107 block wait time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:42
Basically Wall Street is betting on what they think the price of Bitcoin will do. They could bet it will drop then short Bitcoin to force it to drop. Basic market manipulation

Put in only as much as you can afford to lose.
It doesn't matter how much you put in, you get the same % return no matter how much you have.
Of course the more you have the higher your profit will be, but the return % is still the same.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:34:01
Yeah their fees are lower to encourage day trading and there's no free for coinbase to gdax
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:48


Impossible to do by design. If it doesn't go through in 72 hours your coin will be returned.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:57:48
No and coinstar is a ripoff. Just buy some coin sleeves for like $1, roll them yourself, take them to the bank, then just buy bitcoin normally.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:39
All over the place
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:04


It will cancel after like 72 hours and be put back into your wallet


If you have more coin then yes you can spend it.


Nope. Next time check the mempool to make sure your fee is high enough.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:45:08
See? Told you people on this sub hate Ripple

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:19:04
If your coins are in coinbase then send them to gdax then send them to your wallet. The fees will be much much lower than going directly from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:38
Yeah high fees are an issue
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:13:28
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:39:30


What? Once you have bitcoin in your account you just send it to whatever address you want. What exactly are you nervous about?


Generally no, but there are sites (like GDax) where you can get away with doing 0 fee transactions.


You can adjust the transaction fee to whatever you want in that scenario. Every transaction sent on the blockchain pays a fee to miners. You can set this to whatever you want, but if it's too low your transaction won't go through.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:28:59
Yeah but that should never happen.
But I guess time will tell.
To answer your original question though, if all miners stopped mining bitcoin would be dead.

Worst option: coinbase (or any exchange)
Better option: software wallet like electrum. Save your seed!

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:16:13
Yeah I'm holding a little bit so of course I want it to go up.
But XRP is kinda in a class of its own. It isn't really a cryptocurrency since it cannot be mined. It's also centralized and controlled by banks, so there's that.
A lot of people refuse to touch it for those reasons. Those people don't see what's right in front of them; the banks will use it. It isn't going to bring around the revolution that satoshi wanted, but it will make me some money.

I think the anger comes from them perceiving bitcoin gains as illegitimate. As if somehow we are cheating the system and getting amazing gains, while they "follow the rules" and receive almost nothing.
There is a large swath of people that want bitcoin to fail, just so they can rub it in our faces and tell us they told us so.

Because the ability to reverse transactions would be heavily abused.
The entire point of blockchain tech is that you don't need a 3rd party like a bank to send/receive money.
If you could reverse transactions, there would have to be a central regulatory body to control those reversals. That would mean bitcoin would not be decentralized, which also defeats the whole point.

That isn't really true. Electrum with 2FA is pretty damn safe as long as you don't lose your seed. Of course you could get hacked, but that would require an attacker directly controlling your PC while you are logged into your wallet and without you noticing. There would be no way for a hacker to get around 2FA on their own.
Yes hardware wallets are the safest, but you don't exactly NEED one. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:38:23

Even if they did they can't see where the coin originally came from. Also they would have no way of knowing your wallet address. It isn't like you have to give them the deposit address when you cash out.
Also there's no government agency that tracks Bitcoin.
You're overthinking this way too much. Bitcoin is largely unregulated. Unless you cash out and don't pay taxes, you're fine.

Yeah I read it you jackwagon. 
My point is that in the article they say one of the reasons they aren't taking btc anymore is because people were paying like $20 fees with no option to adjust them. That is absolutely preposterous. Look at the mempool right now. If you wanted to get your tx into the next block it would only cost about $1. 
Yes bitcoin has issues with tx fees and volitality, but evertually the volitality will settle and the tx fees are steams fault, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:36:03
Why would anyone spend money on transaction fees to do this?
You don't need to check if your wallet "works". If you have a deposit address you're fine.

Last time there was a significant drop people flooded the exchanged trying to sell. So much that like the top 5 exchanges crashed. So having your coins in an exchange doesn't guarantee you'll have access to them during high traffic.
But having them on a ledger means you can access them anytime and anywhere. It gives you the felxibility to choose which exchange to use.
Yes you have to wait for the transaction to go through, but it's much better that way.

Her 401k is not taxed at all; that is the whole point of a 401k. You pay into it now with no tax, and you get more returns because you only have to pay that tax when you withdraw your money when you retire.
If you want access to the money now, you could take a loan out of your 401k OR you could pay all of the taxes and penalties now.
But you are usually heavily penalized for taking money out of a 401k before you retire. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in dire straights like losing your home or something. Buying bitcoin is definitely not dire straights.

This was a couple years ago, but I put in an order for about $130 worth of coin. I got my coin instantly and transferred it out of coinbase. But then there was a problem with my bank and the balance couldn't cover it. So I went negative $130 and had to pay it back.

Even if you gave proof of purchase there is no way for them to know if you still had the coins when the fire broke out. Renters insurance is very specific about what it covers, and I highly doubt they would even think about reimbursing you for bitcoin. It would be easy enough to buy coins, spend them, then try to scam the insurance company by claiming you still have them.
Also OP seems like he's a teenager who lives with his mom, so he wouldn't have renters insurance. Hopefully his mom has homeowners insurance because the lost bitcoin might be the worst of their worries.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:09:20

Sure you could buy directly from someone. You could use localbitcoins and meet someone near you in person. LBC is usually way more expensive than an exchange though.

There was a payment from my bank that was stopped because my bank is stupid. For whatever reason the bank put a stop on the payment.

Its really pissing me off that I can't talk to a human being over there.

Coinbase is not a wallet it is an exchange. Buy your coin from there then send it to a software wallet like electrum. Also personally I think kraken is better than coinbase

Were you using a wallet like Electrum with a wallet seed?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:39:50
I like electrum. It doesn't matter where you put it as long as you write down the seed and password in a safe space. You MUST have the physical backup. That way even if your computer blows up you don't lose your coin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:40:16
Well I already moved my coins out. I acutally should have said its a buy/sell disabled issue. So they're not stealing my money but they refuse to re-enable buy/sell. So more just annoying than anything. Im just gonna start using a different service.

The only value that Bitcoin or anyother current gas (inculding the US dollar) is an agreement that the piece of paper (or Bitcoin in our case) is worth something. That's all it is. Unless everyone agreed that Bitcoin was worthless there will be no issue. More and more large companies are accepting Bitcoin and as adoption spreads it will only get bigger.

Just like with a software wallet, you need to keep your seed and PIN in a safe place away from the hardware wallet. That way if anything happens you can still access the wallet.
What the guy above is saying is that if you just put the seed and pin in a text file and put it on a USB then any asshole with low level computer knowledge could steal it if they got their hands on the USB.

Coinbase is protected by FDIC just like a bank. One thing you don't need to worry about is getting your bank info stolen. The only thing you would need to worry about is Coinbase getting hacked thereby losing all of your coin, but that is why you move them after you buy them.
Coinbase is a legitimate company and is no more dangerous than doing online banking or buying things on Amazon.


When you buy it asks you to input either how much USD you want to spend on BTC, or how much BTC you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:16


No. The addresses to recive coins in your wallet (and the address you use when you send coins) are called the wallet address.
The private key is a hash which in essence IS bitcoin. Whoever holds the private key owns the bitcoin. It also isn't 1btc=1 private key; it is a little more complicated than that. That is why people say to not store your coin on an exchange, because THEY hold the private key. 
In practice a wallet seed is just as good as holding the private key, since a bitcoin wallet is just a collection of these private keys and the seed gives you access to the wallet.
1. You're welcome!
2. yes I've heard that Electrum mobile app is shit. I can't speak to that though, as I've only ever used Electrum on my desktop PC. I don't use mobile wallets.


Popularity, ease of use, open source, good support. But there are other wallets that are just as good.

Well if you store in a software wallet like Electrum, all you need to do is log into your wallet and it will show you your bitcoin totals. As long as you save your wallet seed in a physical safe place, it is pretty safe. The only way you could lose your coin here is if your PC was hacked with keylogging software and an attacker was able to get into your wallet. But if you set up 2FA on the wallet there is basically 0 chance they can get in. If you got locked up with ransomware you could just restore the wallet from the seed on a clean computer.
If you're talking about having bitcoin and altcoin in the same wallet, well I'm not aware of any wallet that can do that.

1. If you have a computer with your wallet software installed OR you are using an online wallet, you will be able to login whenever you want as long as you know your password (and have your 2FA device, if that is enabled). Otherwise, yes, the seed is your only way to get access back. Keep the seed physically written down in more that one secure location; preferably keep one copy outside of your house if possible.
2. You do not have to use a different wallet app/software. You can create 15 Electrum wallets and spread out your coins across them if you felt like it.
3. Your terminology is a bit off, but yes. More like "if I have my seed I can recover my wallet, which has my existing coins"

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:07
The "code" you're referring to is called a private key. 
It is NOT 1 private key = 1 bitcoin. It is kinda complicated, but for your purposes all you need to know is that when you get bitcoin (doesn't matter what amount) you get private keys.
The problem with exchanges, like Coinbase, is that they do not give you the private keys. They store them until you decide to withdraw your coin. So if an exchange gets hacked, you're shit out of luck since whoever knows the private key technically owns the coin.
So after you buy from an exchange, you want to transfer the coin to somewhere that gives YOU and ONLY YOU control over those keys. 
One example is a software wallet called Electrum. it gives you control over the private keys and is usually more secure than an exchange. Even if your computer explodes you can still access your coin by restoring the wallet with the 12-word seed. The only thing you have to worry about there, is your PC getting keylogging malware installed on it, but 2FA can stop that too.
The most secure storage methods are physical wallets (like Trezor) and paper wallets. A paper wallet is where you literally write down the private key on a piece of paper.
But for most people a software wallet is plenty safe enough.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:53

Only store coins in an exchange if you're ok with losing them. I would never hold any coin in an exchange, unless it was like $5. Yes you should move them when you buy them, or at least at a regular intervals (weekly).
Electrum is not an "offline wallet", it is a software wallet. It still connects to the internet. How else would it process transactions?
Move from exchange to electrum asap. Make a wallet with 2fa and for the love of God write down the wallet seed and password in two separate locations. And i mean physically write them down. Do NOT store these in a file on your PC. Store those somewhere safe, because anyone with the seed essentially owns the wallet.
Electrum is plenty safe enough as long as a hacker doesn't install keylogging malware.

I use Windows Defender and Malwarebytes. I'm pretty sure MB still has a free version.


Basically. Here's the steps you take:
1. Buy bitcoin from an exchange like Coinbase
2. Create a wallet that gives you access to the private keys. I'll use Electrum as the example.
3. Create the Electrum wallet, write down the seed and password. This is SUPER important. Write down the seed and password somewhere super safe. Keep more than one copy. Preferably keep one outside your house, or at least in a fireproof safe. Effectively the seed is your best way to recover your coins if you get locked out of your wallet, or your computer gets abducted by aliens, or whatever.
4. Go to the deposit addresses in Electrum and save your first deposit address in a text file.
5. Go back to your exchange and send your bitcoin from there to the deposit address you saved in step 3. 
THIS IS WHERE I SUGGEST YOU STOP!
Electrum functions so that the seed is just as good as the private keys. Private keys can get very messy, and if you do a paper wallet that means every time you buy more coin you'll need to do this over and over again. Big pain in the ass. As long as your seed is safe, you're good to go!
6. IF you want to fuck with private keys (not recommended), once the transaction goes through, go back to Electrum and export your private keys. 
7. Uninstall electrum and delete the wallet.dat file
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:26


Your paper wallet has a deposit address, just like any other wallet. You just deposit it there just like any other wallet.




Just transfer and delete.


Are you talking about a paper wallet or a single-key paper wallet? Because the former is just a regular old wallet and the latter is HIGHLY discouraged.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:13:25
Oh you have the private keys?
Easy then. Put them all in a text document with 1 key per line. Create a new wallet in Electrum (2FA or not, it doesn't matter) then import the private keys. Then you'll have your coin back.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:59:37


Well I would make sure that I paid taxes, first of all. Don't fuck with the IRS bruh.

You can look at the mempool. That will tell you how long transactions take based off their fee. You can choose how long you want to wait and adjust accordingly.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:54:01
Well it is WAY better than Coinbase, or any exchange for that matter.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:32:39
Receive amount? You don't need to do that...
Just send the coins from Coinbase to your Electrum deposit address. That is it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:33:37
If someone cashes out big then prices may fall.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:55:05
Impossible to say. You could check the mempool for average wait times for that fee though.
Worst case scenario is you'll get the coin returned to you in 72 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:51:11
It is their perogative what they do and don't allow. Legal action would be a massive waste of money.

Just make sure you have 2FA enabled on your account and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:29:35


Technically yes, but if your bank gets robbed the federal government replaces the stolen money. The bank also has records of your account, so it knows how much you have.
With bitcoin, there is no federal agency that will reimburse you if an exchange, like Coinbase Vault, gets hacked. You would just be shit out of luck and poor. 
Whoever holds the private keys owns the coin. That is why people say do not store on an exchange. Putting your coins in Coinbase vault is secure from people trying to log into your account, but if the entirety of Coinbase was hacked there is no guarantee that you won't lose your coin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:42


In your rambling post riddled with spelling and grammar issues? No.


What do previous bubbles have to do with anything?


Yes. Absolutely.


I don't even know what that means.
Sounds to me like you're grasping at straws desperately to "prove" that you're correct. If I was going to guess, I'd say you sold all of your bitcoin at some point in the past, and are now making posts like this to try to convince yourself that you made the right decision.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:42:36
That would be best. You could also try to sell it locally if you feel comfortable with that.

No. One seed per wallet is how it works. If you want a new seed you have to create a new wallet.


Yes that is the whole point of a seed. You can install copay on any computer anywhere in the world, enter your seed, and get access to your wallet. In practice, a wallet seed is just as good as having the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:44:31
Yes of course. Electrum is just software. A hardware wallet is safest, because it isn't connected to the internet all the time and they're pretty much impossible to hack.
But like I said, electrum is pretty safe as long as you don't get keylogger malware
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:40:24
Copay also uses a 12 word seed, so it is probably that.

You misunderstand. Your Coinbase USD wallet is backed by the FDIC for up to $250,000. Your Coinbase Bitcoin wallet is NOT. So if they get hacked and your bitcoin gets stolen, you are shit out of luck. The government isn't going to pay you back.
If a hacker gets into Coinbase they may be able to bypass 2FA. It has happened before (not at coinbase).
There are massive benefits to software wallets and I highly suggest you stop storing your coins in an exchange. That is just asking for trouble.

What percentage of the world population do you think holds bitcoin? As of March 2017 Coinbase had 15 million wallets. [Source](
Now it is extremely unlikely that each wallet is owned by one person, but for this demonstration let's assume that. Since it is impossible to track down exactly how many bitcoin wallets there are, let's just assume that Coinbase holds just 1/10th of all wallets. That would give us a total wallet count of 150,000,000 worldwide. 
The population of Earth is 7.442 billion. That would mean that only 0.2% of the population of the world owns bitcoin. My 150,000,000 wallet number is just a guess, but you can see what my point is.
There are PLENTY of people to buy Bitcoin. I don't know why you're trying to make it seem like there is a shortage of buyers.
As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and more companies take it as payment, more people will be turned on to Bitcoin and will buy it.

Also, using being gay as an insult means you're either 12 or you're an antiquated bigoted piece of trash. I'm betting on the latter.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:02
The numbers and letters is the wallet address, but that doesn't help.
If it was a software wallet and you don't know the seed you're fucked.
If it was an exchange then you'll need to remember which one, then login. Maybe check old emails.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:22:33
You should be able to export them from the old wallet, then import them to the new wallet.
Make sure that each private key is on it's own line, and there is no other text
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:42:43
This is one of the shittiest scams I've ever seen.

You can purchase whatever dollar amount you want including cents.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:46:16
Yeah this is the right answer
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:17:50
I think the guy you responded to is more interested in shitting on Bitcoin than he is in seeing how versatile it is.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:08:04
First of all do not use PayPal for that. Only accept either cash in person or a bank deposit.
There are instructions on lock bitcoins for selling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:39:24
You can get higher buy/sell limits on coinbase. Go to the verifications page and it'll tell you what you need to do to increase the limit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:17:33
no begging
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:32:47
How long ago?
There have been more than a few times where Coinbase gives me my coin before my bank subtracts it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:01
Just because you don't understand the point of bitcoin doesn't mean it has no point.
Have you read any of the extensive whitepapers out there? They clearly lay out the intention of Bitcoin. Educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:54
It isn't hard at all to spend Bitcoin...
You can load it on what is essentially a debit card and use it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:23:56
If you.want 2fa yes
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:00:07
Because you don't control your private keys, Coinbase does. If Coinbase got hacked all of your coins would be gone forever. If you control your private keys it is much safer.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:52
Possibly an electrum seed then

Fuck no. I'd buy that shit up so fast

Someone give that man a seatbelt!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:27:19
By 2040 technology will have advanced so much that mining should be MUCH cheaper. That, along with mining fees, should offset the loss of the block reward.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:11:21


Because they might not have tens of millions of dollars in their USD wallet at any one time. If there was a big run on an exchange and there were no limits it wouldn't be pretty.


So you think banks keep enough money to cover everyone's accounts? It is the exact same thing. I can't convert $1mil bitcoin to fiat in the same way you can't go to your bank and withdraw $1million. It doesn't mean they don't have the money, it just isn't readily available.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:00:13

There will probably be a price correction. But maybe not. Who the hell knows.

There is really no point in mining bitcoin.
Breadwallet and coinbase are both pretty good, but if you're serious about crypto you should store your coins in a hardware wallet like a Ledger
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:39:58
Hard to say, as the Chinese government hasn't released any official statements yet. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.

Step 1: Don't look like a weirdo and annoy people by calling them "normies"
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:58:48
It's only ok to hold $50 in an exchange if you're ok with the possibility of losing that $50.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:52:02
I'd prefer they be made into food.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:46:15
I'm sure there is some kind of pressure, but until there is official word it is just rumors.
No I am not in China.

@_date: 2017-09-14 20:09:08
It seems to have stabilized at 3400 for the time being. But well see what happens when China wakes up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:50:12
But that is my point. Until there is wider adoption we're still beholden to having to care about Fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:25:17
Well if you bought low you could sell now to make some quick profit, but that is dangerous if you want to buy back in. Who knows if this increase will continue or if it is a dead cat bounce.
When in doubt, hodl
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:57:46
Ledgers cost about $100 usd after shipping.
A software wallet like electrum is not as good as a hardware wallet, but it's better than keeping coins on an exchange like coinbase.

As long as cosebase allows you to trade in brazil, yes
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:32:37
Were talking about two different things.
Yes BTCC said they will stop trading at the end of the month, but there has been no official announcement from the Chinese government saying that bitcoin exchanges will be banned. Right now that is just FUD and rumors.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:03:23
Bitcoin isn't an investment it's a commodity. That being said there is no guarantee it will go up. My personal opinion (based off facts) is that it will continue to rise. How fast I can't be sure, but it will. That does not rule out the possibility of crashes though.
Buy Bitcoin only if you can afford to lose the money you put into it.
I bought $120 worth of coin about 18 months ago and now it is worth ~$1200.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:19:30
Yeah go check out Some people have been charged upwards of $17,000
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:45:46
At what price are you going to buy back in?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:58:01
The ban isn't even officially confirmed and you're asking how long until it's lifted?
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:03:37
They don't have access to my bank account, and I don't have any bitcoin in the exchange, so how could they "claim other assets"??
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:25:22
Exchanges are exactly what they sound like. They are websites that allow you to exchange your btc for Fiat or vice versa. So when you buy from an exchange you should move the coins out immediately. Some people.keep coins in an exchange because it is easier when you want to sell; you don't have to take the step of sending from your software wallet/hardware wallet to the exchange. But anyone who keeps their coins in an exchange is a fool.
Exchanges do not have a wallet seed because the exchange owns your Bitcoin, not you. Software wallets like electrum have wallet seeds. So the coins live in your software wallet, but if you lose access to the wallet you can just put the seed into a new wallet and you'll get your coins back.
Technically a hardware wallet could get hacked if the PC has malware, but a hardware wallet is still very secure.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:26:45

I'm not buying or selling anything right now. Too much volatility. The price has gone down like $600 in the last day. I'll wait until the downward trend stops until I buy more.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:16:59
This is what I keep telling people who are screaming sell.
When the price plummeted in 2013 people were screaming that bitcoin was dead, sell now, blah blah blah.
It'll go back up. It could take a while, or maybe not, but it will go back up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:47:50
That is what everyone was saying at this high too. "If only I had bought it at $300 back in 2015-16".

Does that sound like a legit deal?
I am kinda nervous about fake money though. Anyway I can verify it's real without one of those special pens? Or can I buy one of those pens at Walmart or something?
Or would I just be better off selling on kraken for the market price and waiting the 1-5 days for bank deposit?

Hey I'm trying to understand this graph and I have a couple questions.
1. If you change it to 'All' at the top of the page, it shows that in May at the peak there were about 187,000 transactions. That is more than 8.5 times more tx than right now. Why such a huge discrepancy?
2. A global mempool is not a thing, so is this just the mempool from one node? So these tx totals do not reflect the state of the entire network, correct?

A coin is a string of numbers and letters called a private key. When you have coin in an exchange they own the coin because they hold that private key. Exchanges own the coin, but when you hold it in a software or hardware wallet you have the private keys therefore you own the coin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:11:56
Yeah it's a shame, but people shouldn't be investing more than they can afford to lose.
The only reason I'm hodling is because I bought coin a long ass time ago, when it cost about $350 a coin. If I lose some money it doesn't really matter to me.
I just saw a post on here from some kid who said he got a job, worked all summer, and invested $11,000 into bitcoin when it was at $4500. Doing things like that is just foolish, but I do feel for that kid.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:32:37
Were talking about two different things.
Yes BTCC said they will stop trading at the end of the month, but there has been no official announcement from the Chinese government saying that bitcoin exchanges will be banned. Right now that is just FUD and rumors.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:45:33
Nothing except for the fact that the guy is a ghost. 
Well its hard to say how much coin he has since its spreqd over thousands of  addresses, but be probably has about 1mil coins. But even if he is still around he wouldn't do that. He talked extensively about Bitcoin and blockchain being open source and for everyone. He could have sold blockchain tech and been insanely rich, but instead he released it for free to the world.
If it is one person then Satoshi is a modern day Einstein. Seriously he would be a literal genious. The tech is incredibly sophisticated and nothing like it had ever been created.
I personally think it was a group of people. No idea why they haven't touched any of their coins though.

They didnt double the bitcoins, but pretty much every major exchange split them. 
What exchange did you have your coins in during the split?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:13:41
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:53:10
There are two types of fees
1. Exchange fees: this is what you are talking about. Exchanges take a percentage of the buy amount. That's how they make money.
2. Transaction fees: this is what I thought you were talking about. There is a fee you much pay for each Bitcoin transaction. This fee is given to the miner who mines the block.
But the fees are low. Especially on coinbase.

The key also holds transaction information. So if you have the same private key in two wallets they will both hold the key and all the info that goes with it. If you spend from one wallet the second one will receive the transaction info and update accordingly.
I wouldn't recommend storing the same keys in several wallets though. That gives hackers two points of entry to steal your coins instead of one.

If you leave your coins on an exchange and the exchange gets hacked your coins could be stolen. When they're in an exchange you don't control the private keys therefore you have no control over your coin. That is why people say to never hodl coins in an exchange.
Even if you keep it in a software wallet it could be hacked. You could download a virus or malware that keylogs and steals your password or wallet seed. Or you could get hit with ransomware. That is why a hardware wallet is the safest, because those things cannot happen.

It was the first cryptocurrency but more importantly it invented the blockchain. It was created by a person (or group or people) that goes by the online handle Satoshi nakamoto. The thing is, no person with that name exists. 
Satoshi released complicated and extensive whitepapers on how blockchain technology and Bitcoin works. There is a wallet associated with Satoshi with thousand or bitcoins. No one had touched the account in years. No one has heard from Satoshi in years either.
Over the years there have been many people claiming to be Satoshi, but it always truns out to be fake. The only way to prove youre Satoshi is to access his wallet and move coin, which so far no one has done.
It really is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century. How could one person create such a complicated and sophisticated system? Was it even one person? Why haven't his coina moved in years and why has no one heard from him in years? Is Satoshi a powerful group or people? One person? The CIA/nsa? No one knows. And we may never know.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:25:17
Well if you bought low you could sell now to make some quick profit, but that is dangerous if you want to buy back in. Who knows if this increase will continue or if it is a dead cat bounce.

You really shouldn't keep your coin in exchanges like coinbase. It isn't safe. If the website gets hacked or if the operators decide to run off with the money (both of these things have happened several times to the tune of hundred of millions of dollars worth of stolen coins) then you're fucked.
It is much safer to store in a software wallet like electrum. Even safer is to keep it in a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:15:59

The same thing happens when you lose the wallet password and key. The bitcoins are stuck in the wallet forever.
In theory if every single person lost all their seeds then yes bitcoin would be dead, but that would never happen.
No all Bitcoin will not be taken out of circulation eventually. It doesn't matter if coins are lost. For example, say there were 100 coins total and 50 get lost. The price of Bitcoin would adjust to make up for that. 
There will be 21 million bitcoins total, so there's enough to go around.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:57:48

If the ledger is public and decentralized there is no issue; even if the company went under the coin wouldn't be worthless. BCC is an example of this. Even if the company that made BCC died, the coin wouldn't necessarily be worthless. Coins only hold the value that we all agree they hold.
But if a company had full control over the ledger and it was not public then the coin could be worthless if the company goes under.

I'll just name some of the worst ones. Ill call him Ken.
- Ken rented a room from a wealthy gay man by hitting on him (Ken was also gay but pretty closeted). Moved into said house and stole over $10,000 from a safe and convinced the owner and police the maids did it.
- A friend of mine got him a job landscaping. Ken got fired for being crazy and unpleasant after a few months. Took his personal car to a gas station where the job had an account and charged a tank of gas on it. Gas station called job, job called Ken, Ken told job that the friend who got him the job did it and lied to him about it. Friend gets fired because Ken lied just because he wanted free gas.
- Ken got in trouble with the police. Ken became an informant and bought a large amount of weed from a friend of mine. For some reason three months later (before friend got arrested) Ken decides he feels bad and tells my friend he snitched on him. I was there when he told him and Ken was going on about how he didn't have a choice, is really sorry, making himself sound like the victim. We leave and he follows then assaults us in the middle of a busy downtown area. We kick his ass and he runs to his car. My friend had a bloody nose and cops came out of everywhere. We told the cops what happened and they found Ken, running through alleys with a sock and a roll of quarters he had gotten from his car (to kill? us with). 
- Ken is gay and has a weird complex with his straight friend where he acts like they're dating.
- Ken gets blackout drunk and throws a 90lb girl against a wall a party at his own house. Gets bottle smashed on his head. Ken lies to the cops. The cops find Kens bowl and he say it wasnt his. Ken's friend gets arrested instead of him even though it wasnt his bowl.
- Ken (who is 28) gets into a road rage incident with a car full of highschool sophmores. Ken flashes a replica glock pellet gun at them and is promptly arrested while pulled over and trying to stash the gun in some bushes.
- Ken robs anyone he can (duh) including breaking and entering into his old job at a sandwich shop and stealing $2000 because "they owe me this for all the work I did. They didn't pay me enough".
Honestly there are so many more. I could go on about this guy forever. It wasn't just the bad things he did, but the ways he did them. Always trying to convince people of things that are just a web of lies and manipulation. Truly the only person I've known who I would call a true sociopath.
But in the end (about 3 years ago) Ken became hooked on painkillers and xanax and overdosed in his sleep.

Right? He may be a lying sociopathic con man white milk toast piece of shit, but I don't give a flying fuck if him or anyone else buys drugs with their coins.

I think he said that because Coinbase has been known to shut down accounts that have been linked to sending money to DNMs.

Well the easiest way would be through localbitcoins IMO. They're usually a little bit marked up, but if you want to get bitcoin with cash fast it's probably the easiest way.

Sounds like it got disabled for some reason.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:29:18
That's fine. You let free money go to waste while I happily accept it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:10:54
You'll have to read the press releases from each exchange. Most are disabling it though.

Why does it matter who hosted their servers?

I just moved some coin from Coinbase to Bitstamp with no issues. Took about 10 minutes for 3 transaction confirmations.

The fork is happening whether you hold your new bcc or not, so I don't see how holding it is bad. That article also makes a lot of assumptions and uses questionable data. They state they are using worst case scenario and their entire scenario is based off of subscribed users on Reddit subs.  You still haven't made any argument for why you shouldn't take the bcc except for your emotional argument of "not being in it for the money".
If you want to take a loss on your Bitcoin just because your pride won't let you take the bcc that's your perogative.

Since when is moving coin from coinbase to ethereum stressful?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:25:41
That's a little confusing. How will that tell me when it forks successfully?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:14:17
I sent some about an hour ago with no issues. Better to do it sooner than later though.

The Electrum devs specifically say to not install ElectrumCash on the same machine you have your Electrum BTC wallet on. ElectrumCash is an open source 3rd party program that is not made or verified by Electrum. It might be safe and it might not.

I think that's a pretty ignorant attitude to take.
Who cares if BCC is just another shitty altcoin? If you can make some money off it simply by holding Bitcoin then why wouldn't you?
Don't let emotions get in the way of making money.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:07:19
Yikes. Did you report this to google?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:02:18
Without account authorization? Tough to say.
Bitstamp has pretty fast authorization.
