Buying from a single dealer is insignificant in my eyes.  Poorly disguised advertisement.

Its a bot most likely.  There are bots ran by Satoshi Dice that are rigged to win these very low probability bets in order to increase the amount of players.  Quite clever actually, and once a week or so someone comes along to post the results to this subreddit and well as on the bitcointalk forums to spread the publicity.

it could have been, i stand corrected.

Thanks for the tip!  Haha I see what you're saying.  I wasn't considering the personal management aspect, I was more thinking of the transactions themselves but I do agree.  It is much easier to look at the balance of my wallets than to scramble around my room looking for change, and checking all my bank accounts.  And keep the dirty car change, I got plenty of that in my couch d:

No concrete evidence, but a while ago on this subreddit (if you care to search for it) a different example was posted where a sub btc bet returned thousands, someone tracked the wallet's history and the account had been making sub-btc bets and other random bets every 10 minutes or so on the dot for days (or weeks) on end.  It was unlike any normal human gambling schedule/pattern.  It felt quite robotish... if you will (:

i wouldn't know, i'm not very savvy at programming, but i do believe it is possible.

I believe its because that is not the stake they are trying to make in the business.  Bitcoin gains security through the fact that many unrelated parties are running hardware to increase the strength of the global network.  They could just run all these chips themselves, and they could potentially turn a huge profit.  But that is all speculation.  By selling the hardware, nothing is left to speculation and they are guaranteed quantifiable and predictable returns.
Butterfly labs is backed by venture capital, and you can bet the backers want to make the money they've invested back without this speculation.  Butterfly labs (before Avalon) had a monopoly on this new wave of ASICs, and a solid game plan to turn a steady and lucrative profit.  Despite the fact that their units have been delayed is not enough in my opinion to change their entire game plan to start mining coins, they have commitments to their investors and the Bitcoin community.  I bet they are currently running some of their boxes, in order to generate coins for a personal investment, but straying off from the game plan leaves too much up in the air.  After all, a sudden crash of Bitcoin in an avenue no one could have predicted is still a concern we all face.  Butterfly Labs does not have to worry about this, because they will be making their money either way.
Hope this helps.

They are.  A traditional commercial transaction is going to store to buy groceries, paying your bills, and buying snacks from a vending machine.  I could be wrong though, what is your definition of a traditional commercial transaction?

They could I agree, and rereading that post always give me the chills.  I went with Avalon for my ASICs, but I suppose I just go with the mindset of innocent until proven guilty, even with a track record as questionable as that.  I hear ya though, will definitely NOT be ordering from them.  Pirate 2.0 perhaps?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:34:01
really?  I think they definitely would offset in my opinion.  satoshidice is up a few hundred thousand coins at the moment.

i didnt say it was 100% a bot, there is a chance its a bot run by someone else or not a bot at all.  I was just speculating from the repetitive posts of lucrative winnings that I personally believe there are many bots rigged to win big on the big betting sites.

Are you from Seattle hence the 206?  Also, lending coins just for the sake of lending to gather "reputation" is pretty shady.  The only reason I could see you doing this is to scam people in the future once you've built a transaction history of zero substance or purpose.  Good luck though, becoming the new pirateat40?

I don't believe its a scam, although it does carry some perks of a scam.  The increase in value of coins from when they starting taking down payments, to when the units are actually going to be shipped (if ever) has been massive.  If they were to refund all of their buyers today, they would make out with a huge profit, has BTC has increased almost 33% since that point.
I honestly don't believe its a total scam though.  Just a bunch of overambitious investors and developers who have too much pride to take responsibility to say they goofed up, instead of taking responsibility, and really letting their customers/investors know what is really going on/causing these setbacks.
