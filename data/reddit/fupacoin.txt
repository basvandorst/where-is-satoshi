Lambos huh...  I really don’t know much but, I’d recommend leaving one of your buys on the exchange to buy and sell some alt coins. Might help you get to your 1btc goal a little faster, but you can lose it just as fast...  
Cheers, welcome!!!

Agreed... in this case copper, metal, aluminum, and silver will make you gold...  Only trying to help.

Is anyone else still not able to get on binance?

Yes, but we just recently had a crypto meet disguised as a live podcast and everyone loved our ideas so much we met our funding goal. It’s surprising because we haven’t  even released the white paper...

Ok, it sounds like you actually have a life, I don’t.  I “like” Blockfolio and TabTrader.  Blockfolio allows you to keep track of buys and sells.  TabTrader I like for their charts all in one place without having to log in to my accounts.  I’m using iOS for some reason... There are much better options for Android. I’m in no way affiliated with these apps just a way to manage multiple coins relatively easily.  I think I’m so stuck on this alt coin thing is because I have a friend that devotes a lot of time into shitcoins and has gotten very lucky.  Key word there is time though...
Pro tip : fupacoin is at a 3.5lb increase for the last 3 weeks

Thank you. I just saw this but still. I got on my phone and a friend said the same thing that day.
