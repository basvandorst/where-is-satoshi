The Confidant rocks. Got one myself and going to get another. 
These guys love the product they built and it shows! These guys are pro bitcoin all the way and their passion is infectious. We should ALL support these guys and buy a confidant ASAP.
Real deal entrepreneurs here folks and they made their product with love!

That is where WE as a community come in. 
No one team or company can get Bitcoin into the mainstream on the street. It must be a concentrated effort from the entire community.
We now have the tools to do it. The living map will show us in real time who is accepting Bitcoin and it it gives us the feedback loop to see our progress and the tools to sign up merchants easily.
We all need to go to these merchants and ask them to begin accepting Bitcoin. If they want to try they can do so on the spot by making an account right on the site. We are using the same system to signup merchants that anyone of you can use and now you will get credit doing so.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:48:11
these guys have a great wallet!
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:57:00
Everything will be fine.
We are dedicated to supporting the merchants and making it easy for them to continue to accept Bitcoin. We'll deal with whatever we have to to make bitcoin grow.
Lawsky has said that the exchanges are their main focus not merchants and customers. Bitcoin is winning and will continue to win no matter what.

hi, easybitz here.
our website is pretty new. we don't take any cc info or vital info over the site yet so we didn't get ssl but we just put an order out. that is a must have going forward.
we're gonna post up our mug shots soon and an address. just our apartment but every little bit helps yes. this is a trust based thing big time.
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:18:58
lol yeah. that is bad btc etiquette
We're gonna really focus on polish now. so much support coming in. tons of merchants want to do this now and want videos done.
gonna be a Brick n Mortar Bitcoin series.

pure class from BaronFig. the best notebook on earth as well!
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:38:31
wow so awesome!
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:12:02
the orders go thru our wallet so we can get the callback , log it in his ledger and send him the sms, and then we send the btc to his personal wallet on blockchain.info
easier than us doing a ach deposit. works out great. Kay is awesome

a new address? so he needs a new QR code  for each sale?
please explain
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:13:48
no settlement yet. all up in the air, could be awhile.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:49:42
Hi, yes that is Kays wallet with us EasyBitz,
 but please do NOT donate to it.
Instead Donate to Kay's personal wallet here 
qr code here  
His Easybitz address is only for orders on the street so we can send him the sms messages and keep a record of his orders for his register. Please send him donations to his own personal wallet we setup for him at blockchain.info.
Thanks guys. we're all just getting started. we just put that video up for a friend to see a rough cut and never thought it would get out like this.
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:24:56
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:35:03
ah yes, you are right of course. this is why bitpay etc. has an app that generates a new qr code for each transaction....
this is more secure yes but not feasible for merchants like Kay, not now at least.
our goal was to get Bitcoin's into merchants hands right now and with maximum ease of use. This is the best we could do. No way around it as far as we can see. please correct us if possible.
What are the dangers of using the same public key over and over?
@_date: 2014-07-20 08:24:54
We just do brick and mortar business and we are helping a lot of food karts in NYC right now. working with the Street Vendor Project.
What accounting software do you use? quickbooks?
Please email us support and we will walk you through it all personally. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:29:21
we're just trying our best to get brick and mortar merchants to take it. the ones we spoke too seemed so scared. we're not pro's just bitcoin geeks trying to make this work and get the ball rolling for merchants taking bitcoins.
we want to do a series with all merchants in nyc.
We will be redoing the whole website in a few days. please bear with us guys. we didn't expect this much support.
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:46:44
we all need to work together to support these guys. that means the moment they begin accepting Bitcoin we send a small army of bit coiners there to shop there!
And we continue to support them.
this is whys e built the living map on easybitz.com so that we can see in realtime who is really accepting Bitcoin now!
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:26:05
hi, We are new. just two guys trying to help local merchants.
we want to turn this into a series. really let the world know about all these great local merchants supporting the peoples economy.
the more advice the better, we are new to all this having been bitcoin geeks for a while we were looking for a way for us to add real value.
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:13:30
no idea yet. case is pending.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:28:35
yeah we see this alot, it was like pulling teeth for a while just to get one merchant but once we did it became a flood. We're working on really making bitcoin a super viable method for brick and mortar merchants like credit cards but better.
We're working on a wallet as well that apple cannot ban to bring it all together. it is tough to make this happen now but it is happening. Won't just be a novelty soon.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:25:02
this is true, the tuff part is making is easy.
we really worked hard on cutting out steps and speeding things up.
Now takes on average about 5 seconds, as we insure the transaction on the very first network broadcast, no need to wait 10 minutes for the heart beat with us.
we have many merchants world wide now using easybitz.com
brick and mortar merchants are like a big family and they need a support network, we're working on it.

You guys are real leaders in the space and the reason why what was once worth .000 cents is now worth $475 bucks.
And the notebook is the best I ever used!

Buying bitcoins instantly and safely is a tall order still.
I got my first coins on coinbase and now use circle for buying coins but I am now legit and verified with them which can take days.
The very first time I had to buy bitcoins was a nitemare because my girlfriend needed them ASAP for her cryptolocker virus and it was torture. I tried ebay and localbitcoins and got scammed three times. I finally found a local seller who sold me coins for cash.
If you want to buy bitcoins fast and with a cash deposit to bank or paypal my cash then check out paxful.com they are a peer to peer exchange and u can find some awesome hardcore sellers there with good reputation scores.
If you wanna do a long haul trading system, then get regged at the top exchanges like bitstamp bitfinex and coinbase etc..
Summary: If you want to get bitcoin instantly head over to  and look for a buyer in cash near you. You'll prob get matched with a bank deposit. You can have your coins in under 3 hours or less.
Good luck and remember to check their paxful rep score and feedback comments first!!!!!
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:31:11
Paxful.com you can buy with cash deposits, gift cards, online wallets like paypal or even with debit-credit cards
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:02:02
you can try lbc or paxful.com marketplace you can sell your bitcoin for amazon gift cards for 20-30% cheaper. be aware of scams
