Central banks give stability to fiat currencies, which allow them to actually be used as currencies, which will never happen to any cryptocurrency. Another funny thing about all of this is that all of the 'investors' in bitcoin measure its success in terms of regular fiat, the thing they are supposedly so opposed to.
Let me ask you, how much gold is a bitcoin worth? Can you buy gold with bitcoin yet?

Wait are you saying you shorted bitcoin, where did you do that?

Or you cut your losses, see the price plummet down and are glad you have saved some of it.

The fact you actually researched it and made an educated decision based on that research impressed me a lot. Kudos dude, I hope your venture has been a successful one.

You do realise it's more expensive and a lot slower than what's currently in place, and that's even before mass adoption. It will only get worse as the number of transactions will go up.
People are just selling this glorified idea of a secure ledger to eachother, and it's working because it's all cool and mysterious because there is a cryptographic hashing function involved and it *is* a get rich quick scheme at the moment. 
I mean, don't get me wrong, I think someone will find an actual use for blockchain stuff, but currencies is just not going to happen.

Ah I see, I was just confused because it seemed like you were saying you made 6 figures *because* you saw the crash coming, and I just took that as you might've shorted it. But nicely done, good call.

Can you tell me exactly how?


What is exactly the security infrastructure that is currently in place? How much higher is the cost, and what freedoms are exactly lost?
I honestly want to know.

How is a decentralized payment system a direct competition? Who is going to give you credit if not credit card companies?
