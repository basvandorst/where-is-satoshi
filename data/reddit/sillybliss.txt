Agreed. He’s in a bit of a catch 42, as he believes it will succeed but is hard to stomach the risk, especially if he is married and his wife has any say. That said, I do believe if he feels so strongly about it he should put at least a portion of it to hedge the “risk”. 
I’m very skeptical it will happen within his lifetime enough to significantly harm his savings, but hey, it’s anyone’s guess.

Last I checked most people don’t profit off of weed. Profiting off of Bitcoin leads to taxes (or tax evasion / fraud), which makes it a much more realistic that you’d get screwed over. Governments follow the money (assuming they enforce the rules), so you’d better either keep all your bitcoin in your wallet or only use it for small purchases. Just sayin.

Selling weed is far more illegal than consuming it.  You’re also far more likely to get caught if you sell weed than consume it. The problem with bitcoin being made illegal is that everyone who profits off of it (significantly so, there would be prioritization) would be the equivalent of a drug dealer in the mind of the IRS. People who lost money (ie BTC at 19k) or broke even would likely be left alone. Because of wild price fluctuations, that would make owning bitcoin risky, as your upside potential (making money) would be an enforceable event for the government (if caught). 
Just speculation though.

People here are a little too critical on Goldman. Their price targets have been pretty close to spot on over the last several months, and it would be silly to ignore them entirely. Thanks for sharing.

Goldman's predictions have been pretty spot on so far, so it isn't as outrageous as you'd think. Just passed their target today.

Yeah. It has happened before, and while we are at peak curiosity, prices are determined primarily by people making high/rapid transaction volumes. when you reach high prices, and even a slight drop, people are more likely to sell to try and maximize their gains at the peak. this creates a domino effect, though all those people are likely to buy back in at a lower price. it is a short term adjustment, as long as those people keep buying back in. the people making the most trades aren't just buying and sitting. They are playing to the "waves", and most of these guys take analysts like Goldman more seriously than Reddit speculators. Its silly, because it ends up being a bunch of self fulfilling prophecies, in my opinion ��
