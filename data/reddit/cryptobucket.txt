I don't spend money on bitcoin. I said "bitcoin I've earned"

I watch people surf in Tofino BC, The days I've been there have been relatively small waves.. This shit in this video is nutso.
All I gotta say is even being in the surf that this guy rides would scare the fuck outa me.  Not because I'm a pussy, I've never surfed and I know the power of the ocean. One of those wave would prolly drown me.  lol
Awesome footage!

It runs on php with a social network library.  It was a quick way to get up and going with the basics covered.  Now the modifications to make it fit with cryptoland begin. :)

yes, a very sad one.  lol
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:40:17
lol, exactly!

10k users isn't that hard to believe.  I ran a dogecoin faucet that was seeing 7k users/day at the beginning of the year and I didn't even have 5% the exposure that ChangeTip has.  I had a couple reddit posts and couple tweets to my no-followers.. lol

Since we're getting into clearly crazy legal mumbo jumbo, I'd like to add my own.
By reading this thread partially or in full, you agree to pay an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to the address: 17WNsB9gqjjzSM483wkGChVF2U6gf44653
Failure to comply will lead to additional unprecedented legal mumbo jumbo.

Someone needs to redo the subtitles on this video for these circumstances.. :p
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:32:17
Thanks for the mention!  Looking forward to serving the crypto community!
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:13:06
I'll double that!   40k to the first person that can prove I own 1000btc!  :p
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:14:16
...to be clear, I don't, don't try to hack me.. it was a joke.  my 200k satoshi's won't get you far. :p

It's not marginal, it's not even there because you're waiting for a block like everyone else.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:02:47
Possibly under a second faster to get added to the block that takes the same amount of time whether he/she had submitted via fullnode or not.  So there's is no advantage.  Won't get confirmed any faster.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:26:40
1) Your full node isn't mining tx's
2) It's confirmation from the network, not just a single client.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:50:01
yes, that is what it means.  Virwox requires verified pp and they start you with smaller deposit amount limits and they grow over time it seems.. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:55:14
virwox.com also does it.  Paypal in, then convert usd/sll the sll/btc.  You'll take a bit of a hit but it's fast and it works
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:56:30
sorry didn't read iWillDoItForBitcoin's virwox reply..   :)  
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:03:00
