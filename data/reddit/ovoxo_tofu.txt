This is the stupid questions I live for.

I really would like a sticky showing us how to get the fuck away from Coinbase .
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:55
By transaction do you mean between usd and btc ? The goal is just to have btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:59:54
Think of btc as not a get rich quick scheme but more of a non central bank currency. So if you are okay with prolly losing money nowbbut making money in the long run welcome. All these naysayers just don’t understand what btc is trying to do

The first fucking sense are so fucking annoying that turned shit off
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:39
Stfu. Trust me .

Like they been told this for years. By everyone. And by not listening to others they did well. Bitcoin’s core principle is letting the people decide. If you are such a naysayer but put your money in crypto you are actively hurting the community.

“It’s gunna crash and I can’t wait to see people crying.”
“People hodling are parasites.”
Yeah. I remember that telling people that is very rational and great way to get people interested in crypto.
Like can you stop ? Like you can’t say one thing and being doing the complete opposite.

“Coiner cultist” boom. That separates you by your own words. You literally just said you are here for the money. So it’s the reason why you shouldn’t tell people anything about bitcoin. Because you don’t believe in it. Which means you are part of the problem. So please do what you want with your crypto and do what you want with money. But please if you don’t believe in bitcoin then stop telling people it will crash. For the sake of those who do. Because it’s the same people who are helping you get money. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:47:34
I came here for the money I’m staying cause I believe in the tech and believe in the principle wants I understood it.
So my polite request to do what you want but let people make their own decisions was too much huh? And you are telling me that the people who believe in it are parasites right.
Anyone reading this thread please see the type of person that doesn’t want you to get into crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:10
No buddy I think you should look up the definition. So the rational approach is just telling everyone “it’s gunna crash lolololol.” Like you realize your history is public. We can see what you say about bitcoin. Like are you crazy man. It’s like crying wolf and then saying it’s rational but then people telling you to stop crying wolf and you call them parasites. Like please just stop. And you have an issue with me telling you to stop. You’re not being informing if you simply just say “it’s gunna crash.” Informing would be presenting the true ideology of bitcoin. But no you are saying “we are here for the casssssh”
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:04:51
Yeah like huh? Impossible by cryptography. In fact it’s a core principle on bitcoin . If this was even possible then bitcoin wouldn’t be where it is now
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:17
“Time to sell out” implies you don’t really understand crypto currency and the point of bitcoin. 
I saw in another comment you said bitcoin will crash and burn. So why would say get back in but say it will crash and burn.
When people like you and the media tell people who don’t understand bitcoin “it makes you a lot of money but nothing is backing it so IF it crashes there is no safety net.” Where is the implication of it crashing? Besides the people who print more money when they need it creating hyper inflation telling you that it will crash. And then in turn you telling people that it will crash. Creating a fear in the people who are interested but don’t understand it.

I’m fairly new to the game. Couple weeks. I mean not saying I can’t do the investigating but I would love to watch a YouTube on how to do this ;). If I figure out how to do this I will make the video and I’m sure it can get money. So race you there 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:43
1) sorry my network is shit and posted twice 
2) half baked is equal to me calling you out for being toxic and saying that is rational based on your opinion ?
3) good riddance. Honestly my fairytale would be you accepting that you are being toxic instead of acting like you are giving rational and informed opinions. Saying “it’s gunna crash and I’m gunna laugh when people cry” does notttthing to back the credibility of the previous statement.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:11
But just be prepared if you get now and want to hold for a while you are gunna have some heartaches but it will bounce back

I don't think it's that. Is that nobody ever wants to think the bad thing will become of them until it happens.
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:30:37
This person didn’t read the white paper. Don’t bother haha

Dont forget to catch the falling knife

Nope what I’m saying is coin values would dip. And then already start raising in value. And then a week later they would report. It was almost like poetry. A day would happen where a big dip. And then days later people when the value is come back would be “I heard bitcoin is crashing” and I was like that was days ago.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:29:04
Oh I forgot it’s a mistake to say bitcoin crashing when it was on the swing upwards like a week later. It’s a mistake accidentally calling bitcoin cash “bitcoin.”
Pls stfu dumbass
