Well that's gotta hurt.

$14k to $15k is only 7.15% rise people. Calm down.

Ya, still making my monthly contributions.
However, I'm going to switch it to weekly. Sigh...
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:25
It can go the opposite way too.

So....should I sell my Bitcoin Cash I got for "free" and buy more Bitcoin or nah?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:17
Ya. I was in the no bubble camp, but now I'm for sure it is.
I've only got $2k into this since May and still making my contributions.
This is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:45:48
So move to GDAX first?

Apparently, I'm supposed to have some Bitcoin cash, but Coinbase is still not showing it to me in my account even though they said they would.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:36:47
I simply buy my monthly allotment.
I didn't even know what's going on until I do my once a month log in for purchases.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:39:44
I'll get my annual bonus in January. All I know is the entire thing is going in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:44:39
I'm new to this. Explain what a Trezor does.
I know it's a hardware wallet, but does that mean I will no longer see my values on Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:13:49
This is the fiat establishment trying to fight back. They see the writing is on the wall.
BTC will win.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:41:48
You should hedge. I would do half and half cash-bitcoin.
Safety is important.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:22:27
It's more money than you had yesterday.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:59:58
Am I the only one hoping this will crash?
I'm looking forward to a 90% drop in value. I'll be making a massive (relative to my fiat means that is) when it does.
For now, I'll keep DCA'ing my little monthly investments.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:09:44
Wouldn't your insurance cover most of the roof?
This is a bad strategy man. Your cash is for stuff like this. Beyond that, it's for investing in coins.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:04:20
Ya, I was going to buy it at $50, but was waiting for a little pullback (it was $51 when I looked at it).
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:34:13
I was going to buy my monthly allotment (along with my Ether), but damn, this thing has taken off.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:46:16
Ya, I am. It's only $100 a month per BTC and ETH (been doing it since May this year), but still.
I'm thinking of adding Litecoin this month.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:49:05
Fuck it I'm in with 3 coins. Was going to buy 5 coins but Coinbase got limits on me until next week.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:06:11
Can you even withdraw that much at once? 
Coinbase will only let me do $10k per week.
