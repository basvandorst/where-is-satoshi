These apps only exist because Apple can not block the iPhone's browser. Their reasons will have to block native apps for bitcoin wallets, but there is only one conclusion, the losers are users and developers.

Could include in their contracts, which are not responsible for such losses. And what about Apple computers if he will be liable for the losses of the users?

small blocksize?
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:24:26
2 updates more is a lot? okay  
2 minor changes that not affect anything? only secure the network, ajust of dificult and checkpoints, they would be unnecessary, but... you cant say bch not born for increase the blocksize?  
The necessary change is a big increase the num of tx in a block. Core is failing here, and cannot work as currency, as a cashmoney.   
Selling "Peer to peer store of value" and Blockstream products.

Too many info. You can win a ban (or shadowban) with this answer (or less) in and not only downvotes.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:51:11
*Technically?* The hash applied for mining the 1º block is the same for btc and bch.

@_date: 2019-09-18 21:41:49
nosense is we can talk about increase the blocksize in 1$ fee is not the idea of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:35:06
But can all governments in the world do this? 
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:07:03
Today, I'm waiting the 1º confirmation for more than 9 hours, for 2 transactions with and without fee.
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:26:02
i sent btcs with automatic fee, and another without any fee. The 2 transactions from blockchain.info
Now all is ok
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:46:41
BCH born only for change this parameter blocksize, before of years try to increase the blocksize. is it false?
With the time the 2 forks, btc &amp; bch get diferents ways. But never you can compare the changes of other alt or fork, with the only petition of incresase the blocksize from 2014 in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:12:38
stress test?
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:19:14
The open source code of BTC and BCH on block 0 is the same for both. And bch born to change only 1 parameter in this code: blocksize.   
Clams have **alot** of changes, not basically the blocksize. They merge BTC, LTC and DOGE for example. BCH only want a simple and easy change: increase blocksize to increase the num of tx in a block with the consequence of less fees.  
who does a worst comparison? Why 1MB? Why Adam say increase the blocksize years ago?
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:21:56
0,0001 for a transaction of 1 btc, i used a automatic fee in blockchain.info. Finally more that 12 hours, for the first confirmation in the 2 transactions. 
The transaction without fee has taken the same time for confirmation.
@_date: 2015-11-25 22:47:40
Mtgox has taught me in a very clear way to turn my bitcoins in a paper wallet
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:12:02
yes all is fine. Microtransactions? Bahh nothing.
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:13:23
you underestand 1MB is a shitcoin with crazy fees?
