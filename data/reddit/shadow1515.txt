I've got at least 12 from 2010 somewhere. I mean, I say "I've got" but honestly they are irretrievable.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:34
Also pretty much the first thing you should learn to do is to move them out of an exchange. "Not your private key, not your bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:53:46
Yeah it's silly to take your  money out of a website vulnerable to hacking. It's not like people lost millions of dollars in the past several years by doing exactly that.

Where it gets hairy is how are they going to know what my profit is? If I bought 100% from Coinbase that's fine but what if I have 10 BTC form somewhere else and then put them in my Coinbase account to convert to USD?
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:11:20
You mean I can *be* a currency?
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:15:21
Well where else is a 10-year-old at an apparently shitty school going to learn stuff?
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:21:37
If they let you close your account...
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:08:12
Even better, they'll beat the would-be thief to death in their anger and then I don't even need to worry about a repeat offense.

I wish he would typo the number and tip me enough to pay off my student loans.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:21:49
I never knew, and now love, that "1 beer" is a unit of currency now. This is exactly why crypyocurrencies need to never die.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:13:01
Interesting...the reason I thought that is because someone replied to me with something like that once and I never got the message from the bot. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:56:53
That's a good question. Bitcoin should not be tied to the USD in that regard so it may or may not be affected by shifts in USD value.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:44:09
Does it have to be bitcoins? Is there a reason they can't just create their own cryptocurrency only for this and make the blockchain public?
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:40:55
That would be the central lie behind our society.
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:53:36
I still have only a basic understanding of bitcoin, so if I restate what this means can you tell me if I'm correct?
So I give out this stealth key, and everyone in the world can look at it, but if someone makes a payment to it the payment will not actually show as going to that address in the blockchain, so there is no way for anyone besides me to ever see how many payments went to my stealth address?

It could well be that a bank teller job is the product of networking and was the only thing available.
Unless you live in a city, and even then it depends on which one, there aren't exactly vacant jobs sitting around waiting to be filled right now. It might take a lot of networking and personal contacts (which not everyone has the luxury of, and which is harder to do when you are already unemployed or employed but poor) just to get that shitty job working the counter at BoA or Chase or whatever.
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:40:43
In that case, it's so I can use tap &amp; pay instead of having to swipe my card.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:09:37
Also if you know what a currency is and what PayPal is you would never choose PayPal.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:05:01
For the majority of people right now there isn't really a choice of what job they have.

You're "out" the interest in the same way you are every penny of rent though; at least the rest of the mortgage payment is building equity (assuming the housing market doesn't tank, but sounds like OP bought an inexpensive house so that's less of a potential loss anyway).

Totally false, teachers write negative (and positive) commentary on papers all the time.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:09:56
That is exactly the definition of ignorant.
@_date: 2014-07-05 10:37:29
Back in 2009, when it was still less than a dollar, I had $250 that I fully intended to buy in with. Not as an investment, but just because it seemed cool.
Then I started reading about it, and it looked like I had to wire money to buy it, and it just seemed like a hassle and I decided it wasn't cool enough to be worth all that effort.
Feels like throwing out a winning lotto ticket by accident.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:30:02


Well, he is speaking on behalf of a company, so it's definitely this one. I've never understood advertising for this reason. Ok, I see that your product exists...but since the ad was made by the same company that makes money if I buy this thing, of *course* I'm not going to believe a damn thing you say about it without independently verifying it.
@_date: 2015-05-10 12:11:54
I mean, what else do you call an organization used to maintain order in society besides a government?
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:24:10
If you don't have a free checking account in the US you deserve what you get.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:08:06
Doesn't it, like, not actually happen if you don't type "verify" at the end?
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:21:09
I believe TOR browser actually has that on by default.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:10:53
Because depending on tone the implication could be that a person is *willfully* ignorant, which is entirely their fault and something to be ridiculed. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:59:43
Somewhere between "totally" and "not at all". 
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:28:10
Absolutely kills me...back when it was like 80 cents to a BTC I had $500 I fully intended to buy in with. Then I couldn't find anywhere to buy them from without wiring money, and never got around to sorting out the hassle. FML.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:39:40
The most pure purpose for a hardworking 'MURICAN.
@_date: 2015-05-10 12:28:04
But what maintains the socialization and economy? I just don't see society holding together without some sort of collaboration dedicated to making sure it does.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:29:23
Back when it was pretty new and like $0.06 per bitcoin I had $250 set aside that I intended to buy bitcoin with because I was interested in the concept. However, the only ways I could find to do it were by wiring money to Europe or something, and then I got into grad school and needed the money for a tuition deposit.
So...even just knowing about it might not have been enough. I feel like I burned a winning lotto ticket.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:25:16
I have family living in two different states who have the seed in a fireproof box, and have fully explained to them why it's important.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:07:50
Well, it did get me a nice career.  But the Bitcoin I had intended to buy would have been worth about $3 million today, so...
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:32:36
That's just because our writing style guides were written in the days of typewriters and never significant updated since. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:38:31
I'll second ddrescue. I used it for a different purpose (clone the drive my laptop came with onto a SSD) but it worked great.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:34:11
I've got a good $15k lost on an old dead hard drive in some land fill. Feels bad.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:28:07
Yeah I have 7 or 8 that are lost to the ether somewhere.
Feels bad, but it'll feel even worse in a few years.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:28:49
Your first paragraph is exactly why I didn't buy in way earlier than I did. I had cash in hand and wanted to, but I got too skeeved out by the process.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:39:36
I buy Bitcoin regularly not as an investment but because I think it's cool. Pretty much the only thing I spend it on is Steam games (still following the golden rule of course). I don't know how you judge "worth it" but it works out fine for me.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:22:29
Do you need to print? Why not just write it down by hand to minimize data transmission? Backwards, in a mirror, in invisible ink.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:41:16
Or even better send it to me.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:26:57
I mean, the US still mints pennies.

Eh, could be a job with an annual bonus. Since it's only once a year it's not part of the monthly budget that keeps the bills paid so you can do whatever with it, whether it be an extravagant vacation or tossing it all into crypto.
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:06:45
So if this only applies to selling bitcoin, could I legally obtain them by simply selling something I own in exchange for bitcoin without either party needing to have a license?
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:55:57
Hah, that's awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:14:01
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:50:38
I just lurk here and didn't know there were adorable units of bitcoin like "nice". Is there a glossary of all the convenient names for various amounts of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-06 01:25:37
Shit shit shit, I need to buy like, two bitcoins really fast!
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:30:26
MM is 2000. 
What is $10 2000? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:35:43


Do you have a source on that? I'd never heard there stated as a motivation for separation of powers before.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:37:39
I'll willingly wear that hat.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:20:45
We'll that's not the typical use of Roman numerals, so knowing about them wouldn't really help there, would it?
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:01:47
Now how does that work? I had Bitcoin before the last fork (and I still do, too) so I guess that means I have BCC, but how do I even access it?
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:54:22
My bank lets me link my coinbase account so I can see my balance in their app.
@_date: 2015-04-10 10:07:33
One of several wallet apps. I know Amex Serve and Google Wallet allow sending money between users, not sure about Apple Pay or Amazon Payments because I don't use them as much.

Good for them, always trying to find new customers to withhold money from.

So if my router filters all ads then this doesn't affect me at all?
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:50:30
The first time I decided not to buy Bitcoin it was like a penny per bitcoin (possibly even less, I can't remember for sure). It was back when you had to wire money to Europe or something and I just didn't want to risk my money disappearing to some fraudster.
And that's the story of why I'm not wealthy today.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:01:56
Am I just super cynical for not being surprised? If there is an opportunity to take lots of money without getting caught, it will absolutely happen.

His name is Thomas the Tank Engine you uncultured neanderthal.
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:16:46
Yeah there's surely no room for anyone else to manipulate that system.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:51:16
Yeah but then you got whatever rewards from your card instead of nothing. If you're using your cards correctly you never pay interest anyway, so this is a plus over buying with cash if you were going to buy it anyway.
