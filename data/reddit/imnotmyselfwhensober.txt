He is referring to one of his companies based in the UK. He also states he 'likes to think of helping millions of people', not claiming anything

What does hold mean though? Did you mean hodl?

How is it a scam though? I have no Bcash and don't it is the ideal solution to the scaling problem, however the lighting network take away the value of BTC because of the centralisation. My question is, how is this subreddit looking at this problem?

Ofcourse, but do you guys think lightning is the best solution? Because at this moment the fees are building up and I'm getting worried tbh

This either means John Mcaffee is going to eat his dick and BTC will hit 500k... or you just lost your wife

You have a point, but obviously the lightning network is a total different way of centralisation. The lightning network really gives blockstream the opportunity to invest with BTC like banks do nowadays
EDIT: please don't take me for a BCH supporter, I don't have any BCH and don't think this is the right solution

I've red the article and I can tell you it is hypocritical and the writers don't have a clue of either the working and the purpose of Bitcoin

Thank you, this is great advice

I have invested 150,- in BTC. I have some pretty decent profit by now but I defenitely want to buy more. Do you guys recommend a specific time? Like do you guys expect a dip soon. I know I shouldve bough a few days ago but I cant turn back time

If you personalize losses you're mentally destroying yourself over history, something you cannot change. I've been trading for a while and miss changes everyday. I've learned to stop thinking about it, and being able to do so is a sign of self controll.
