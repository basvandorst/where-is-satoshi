I don't want to pick sides, mainly because I don't like Reddit arguments. But in your defense it's hard to continually mine and not cash out at least some btc, to pay for electrical costs. 
Yet I agree with above guy that a lot of miners are in a strong hold state currently, especially with halving incoming. 
Lately I've been buying at $250/week unless price is $12k+ at the time of purchase, in which case I hold back and watch the markets.  
I don't think he was a trolling you though, honestly.

Man talk about putting in as little effort as possible. 
This would be akin to selling a car on Craigslist and saying;
"Here is car, you want buy?"

What's your kw price? Mine is $0.12

What's your strategy? Just curious

I got out of mining at the beginning of this year but man 3 years ago it was Uber popular (screw you bitmain!!!!!)

I've actually mined for 3 years (sold in January) and basically you'll be making minimal profits. Also you can't mine btc directly with any gpus, so you'll be stuck with a loud, although easily deployable, asic. 3 years ago when I was mining a lot of ltc and zec, you could mine around $40-60/day in btc, but that was 3 years ago, so here's my $0.02:
If you want to try mining, you can either mine with a gpu rig and convert whatever coins you mine to btc, or buy an asic rig and mine btc directly.
What your mainly up against isn't price or solely electricity like some others are suggesting, you're up against difficulty rates via payouts in pools (large or small)
Keep in mind bitmain, the primary source of asic btc miners, also has their own mining farms as well... Message me if you want more info
Edit: I forget to mention, fearing downvotes, you can also mine and just hodl btc, paying all of the electric costs out of pocket, with the hope that the future payoff of bitcoins price rises dramatically.

The fees!!!
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:54:08
$50k on a zcash operation :) 
Haha sorry I know that wasn't an answer
I'd do $50,000 into the coin directly. Not a fan of asic mining rigs.

Is this really worth $70,000?
