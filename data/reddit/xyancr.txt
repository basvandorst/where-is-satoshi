I was just thinking how pleasantly refreshing this positive discussion was for a change. Bitcoin subs are infested with trolls and assholes.

Because Satoshi didn't design it that way.

Bitcoin has many enemies.

Considering the multiyear sideways trend in the S&amp;P 500, the bond bubble, stock bubble, real estate bubble, and derivatives risk, 600 -&gt; 900 in 1.5 years in an asset fully under my control would attract TRILLIONs if it was a mainstream instrument. As it stands, if the poster had any basis for this 900 dollar figure, I'd be all in.

Except human nature being what it is, the college geek with 100k coins has already been tempted to cash out for $100 million USD. Few humans have the willpower to sit on even 100% gains without crashing out. Then the coins get recycled at a higher cost basis to new owners and the cycle continues.

Lol. I see what you did there.

Thanks. Getting called out on my shit is what makes Reddit great.

Nit pick. Perhaps I should have been more specific. It's been gang busters since 2007, but has been flat since the end of QE3. 
Your nit pick isn't central to my point anyway, so let me rephrase. In today's world of geopolitical uncertainty and massive central bank financial market manipulation, a 50% return in 1.5 years is a big deal. Nothing to be disappointed over in perspective.

I'm assuming by "everyone" he meant Bitcoin innovators and enthusiasts, not literally everyone.
