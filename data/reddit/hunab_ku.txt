I'm not leaving out any details, it's all pretty simple as I've explained. I did file a complaint with BBB. In process of selling out to exit, but I am not panic selling. Good point about Dwolla possibly being involved. I don't see how sharing my actual experience with them is "defamation". I'm just trying to warn the bitcoin community that it could happen to them too.

Update: The support website is back up, they mentioned on their facebook page that they hired some support people so things might improve.
My ticket got updated with "I have reviewed your account information and looks like compliance team is looking at your account. Please give it a week for the review to complete. In the meantime, you have FULL ACCESS to all your money. You can deposit / withdraw US dollars at any time through Dwolla without restrictions. The only thing that has been locked is outbound Bitcoin transfers. Hope this addresses your concern."
I don't see how locked outbound bitcoin transfers is FULL ACCESS, but I am glad to get some sort of response. Guess I have to just wait it out. I am already KYC validated with them.

At this point I have zero trust in them. Refer to this

Update 2: Support FINALLY got back to me with this gem:
"After an internal risk review we have decided to not lift the Bitcoin hold on your account. We recommend selling Bitcoins and withdrawing USD instead - there is no hold on USD withdrawals on your account.
Looks like you purchased your Bitcoins at $90 and given the current price you will make a good profit as well."
WTF !? EPIC FAIL !
AVOID CAMPBX.
Coinbase lvl2 in a few more days so I will be selling my campbx coins because I HAVE TO and then re-buy them on coinbase. At least I'll be able to get my money back out, but I wanted bitcoins since they are a bitcoin exchange!

This is a non-issue in this case. I have a solid password and 2 factor authorization. I have sole access to my account and have been selling off nicely.

1) Opened account on 2013-04-05. Not too long after I was KYC verified and happy.
2&amp;3) Moved around $32,000 total in USD to bitcoin. The first 20k was converted to bitcoin and withdrawn to my blockchain.info wallet. The last 12k was converted to bitcoin and then they slapped me with a hold on withdrawing any bitcoin. I wrote support and waited around 5 weeks for them to respond to the situation.
Currently I have 118 bitcoin that I HAVE TO sell in order to exit the clusterf**k that is CampBX. At least I will get my USD back out, otherwise I would be calling Saul Goodman and Lawyer'ing up.
I did nothing shady but buy bitcoin on a bitcoin exchange. 
Edit: I was using Dwolla to move the USD 5k at a time (Dwolla limit) every few days I would move 5k and buy bitcoin.

They randomly put a 90 day hold on withdrawing my purchased bitcoins and have been unresponsive to support tickets for around 2 weeks. They have no support personnel or a phone number to call. I am KYC verified and have been a customer for around 3 months with no issues. Then this 90 day hold rocked my world and they are ZERO help in fixing the issue. I would recommend coinbase for us customers. Campbx is amateur hour. I don't see how they can hope to succeed if they have no support for their customers.

10 days have gone by, still zero response from support (who were suppose to fix this in less than 7 days). I am looking into my legal options to sue them or whatever is needed to get my bitcoins out of there! I am getting really worried I'll never get about 15k usd worth of bitcoin out of campbx. That has to be some sort of felony to deny access to what I have purchased. CampBX SUCKS!

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. I copy pasted what "support" responded with. They gave no reasons. I used Dwolla, 5k transfer limit.
