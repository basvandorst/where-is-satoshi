Okay, another inappropriate question... what was the actual difference between what you through you remembered, and what it actually was?
You know, this question would be much easier answered if you just post your passwords here for us to see for ourselves.

The number of typos is impressive and they are commendably amusing

[This is hardly the first time QE has been used and discussed openly.]( Whether or not you agree with how central banks work, QE is a well-known process that is used to stimulate a struggling economy. Just playing devil’s advocate here, but you could argue that there is equivalent (if dissimilar) processes in cryptocurrency.

I cautiously second this view. Up until May-June I was easily profiting off regular pumps in all these altcoins. Now that all eyes are on BTC interest in altcoins is reduced and pumps are much more modest and infrequent, but once the bull run has eased and BTC has corrected, there'll be renewed interest in returning to manipulating altcoins. Some will never recover but it's probably worth holding most of your positions for now.

Technically, because they are Coinbase's coins, not yours. They need your ID because Government regulations insist that businesses that hold money on behalf of clients know their official identities, obviously for investigatory reasons. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and everything to do with the fact that you don't actually hold your coins. I hope you trust Coinbase!

i.e. Never. Not because we won't get there, but because when we do there'll be a new moon to reach :-)
