I sense anger in you Bitcoin...
Anger leads to FOMO....
FOMO leads to buying high...
Buying high leads to selling low...
Selling low leads to not having a Lambo....
Not having a Lambo , leads to fat chicks....

I’m just saying that bitcoin jump from 2k to 20k in a matter of months.... nobody really understood how to trade it... 
Now since the value has gone up to the 10k range, you can easily predict it will go down to a certain level , buy it cheap and sell within days to make anywhere from 500.00 to 2k...
That couldn’t be done when the price was pre July 2017 prices...
I’m sure that it’s not a bad game plan... set your loss limit and you can’t lose a lot...
In the last 3 months , this plan has been proven time after time...
Now moving forward to the next couple of months, the plan might not work... and you might have to hodl.....

Right now very confusing to buy more or wait....
I guess only hindsight will tell...

I think at the 6k level with bitcoin... day trading is profitable... you can buy at night dirt cheap and sell durning the day...
Couldn’t be done if bitcoin value was  below 1k.... 
get use to the new bitcoin trading ... hodling is the old way....
Sorry if I offended anyone...

Funny how Social Media like Facebook, Google, Twitter are banning crypto.... but with these latest data breaches... I guess they are in big trouble...

Good luck everybody.... I just close all my short and long positions.... I brought in June and rode it all the way in December... Bought some more durning the February dip, but I have some business to take care of.... I never sold durning the dip, only bought.. per say advice from my Reddit Hodler friends...
I will watch and wish that all of my Bit-coiner’s and HODLER’s make it to the moon!!!!
