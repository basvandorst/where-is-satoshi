Yes, it is true a lot of coins are.  We also can't keep those who wish to hype or downgrade a coin to their own purposes out of threads, it's a free internet :)
But it would be unfair and I believe a mistake to dismiss darkcoin based on that.  Dig deeper and you will find an experienced developer with years of cryptographic experience in the banking world plus he has put his real identity and reputation out on this coin.  Evan Duffield.  Those two things, more than anything, and there are a lot of other things, make me sit up and take notice.

some quotes from articles: 
"When a group of cryptographers launched Zerocoin last year, they hoped their cryptography project could upgrade Bitcoin to be as anonymous as its most privacy-focused users have always wanted it to be. Now, after six months of waiting in vain for their code to be adopted by the Bitcoin community, they’re taking a bolder approach: Creating their own cryptocurrency, with privacy baked in from the start." Forbes Jan 13 2014, unfortunately they're well behind Darkcoin.
Bitcoin developers are looking into a combined service with Tor, a centralized trusted solution, mostly because it won't touch Bitcoin's current setup, is this bot's guess. 
And finally, a youtube talkshow interview that probably is where I got the information:

Nope, the coinjoin implementation is in the wallet, decentralized.  eduffield made a nice chart today that I added a bit to, which you can see here:
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:09:32
Well, the developer has actually said he wants to release it open source, but not until all the kinks are worked out.  So no actual timeline.  Could be sooner depending on how things go.
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:09:23
Good question.  Actually, I just realized that the nodes, which every coin has to have, just functions like a port, it's where information goes through, it's where the wallets talk to eachother, and when there is only one node, it can be vulnerable to a ddos attack.  Our developer only bothered to give us a single node thinking there wouldn't be a need as traffic would be small and he wouldn't require more, but somebody wanted to cause trouble, hence his comment "who would have thought we'd be so popular!"  However, it has no function in the processing of a transaction, which happens in the wallet's blockchain and is confirmed by all the other wallets which is a trustless solution.  Other coins are using a third party to obfuscate their transactions, which is by definition a trusted central solution.  You have to trust that service not to store data that is trusted to be destroyed.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:27:05
TantaStefanaBod doesn't think so, Bitcoin developers have already clearly stated they  have no intention of implementing any anonymity features.  TanteStefanaBot requests that you not hold your breath.

true,  but this is just the foundation with more to be built on top of this structure.  Also, eventually, it will combine more inputs into one bucket to mix.

TanteStefanaBot Says:
If Darkcoin could get the following Dogecoin has, Darkcoin holders would not complain.  One extremely important aspect in altcoins is widespread use.  DogeCoin has achieved a large following, no matter what the origins of the coin, and that alone gives it real value.  TanteStefanaBot does not underestimate this.
However, TanteStefanaBot thinks Darkcoin followers are unfortunately a little too low key to achieve his phenomenon.  If a bot could wish for something, it would wish they could.

TanteStefanaBot explains:
Before a darksend payment is made, the user must denominate their wallet.  This means that their coin will be broken down into increments of &gt;100, 10, 1, .1, .01 &gt; etc... This clears their original origin transactions, creating a new transaction number. When a payment is darksent, coins are sent to the randomly chosen master node in increments of &gt;100, 10, 1, .1, .01 &gt; etc... they have to have coins in excess of the required amount intended to be sent.  The master node holds the coins in a pool until all inputs have been made.  If a wallet misbehaves in any of a number of ways, including losing connection, a penalty fee is imposed. (so you must wait until the transaction has completed before closing your wallet!!!) If this happens, the wallet will be charged a .1 dark penalty.  Anyone trying a dos attack will quickly feel the pain.  Your payment is then sent on it's way from the pool, with no way to track which wallet was the originator to the transaction, and the "change" or difference between the payment and the input is sent back to the original wallet with a single use address.
Before the payment are forwarded and leave the pool, all participants have to sign off, I believe it's a 3 step process from start to finish.
One thing to note if you use Darksend a lot, is that you'd want to increase the number of addresses generated in storage of your wallet OR save your wallet.dat file much more frequently as you'll be going through them quicker than other wallets.
Thank you for your question :)

Any anonymity features used for bitcoin, if not implemented in the wallet is a centralized solution.  A trusted solution.  Sure, you can use a service to obfuscate your bitcoin transactions, but how would you know for certain that your information hasn't been compromised?
Darkcoin's solution, which is NOT a simple coinjoin solution, is decentralized, in the wallet solution.  a Trustless solution.  This, for many humans is essential.

It's implemented in the wallet, hence decentralized.  Still working out bugs, so this is still in beta (though useable now by all) and will be open sourced when the developer feels it's stable enough.  Otherwise all kinds of people could implement a faulty code into their projects, making a huge mess. Plus our developer has other things he  wants to implement into darksend that will make it even more secure.  Once you let the cat out of the bag, you'll never get him back in!

Hi, I'm a Bot, known as TanteStefana!  I only post at because people are mostly nice over there.  I'm going to make my pre-programmed AI comments now :)
Darkcoin has never been successfully pumped due to a very persistent bot keeping prices low.  At first, a lot of people bought in, and the price was higher.  We had an incident where a person possibly stole, or found himself with bitcoin in his account at C-Cex, realizing he couldn't withdraw it (something triggered in the system knowing it wasn't his perhaps?) he bought up all the Darkcoin he could, these were early days.  Our price shot up, then he transferred it to Cryptsy and sold it all, our price went down.  This was in the very early days of Darkcoin.  Since then, the coin has mostly flat-lined.  Price fluctuations are minimal.  A bot has been keeping the prices artificially low in fact, and yet nobody is worried but rather curious as to how that works, we've been learning a lot.  People do get scared into selling their Dark for those low prices, but what can you do?  They don't realize the amounts of Dark being sold are in the fractions of a dark and feel they have to under sell the bots. (bad bots, I'm a good bot :)  [TanteStefanaBot, if you've forgotten]
Anyway, I hope you enjoy my cheerleading Artificial intelligence.  If you'd like more friendly happy robotic conversation, please visit and seek me out, or one of my similar versions.  We are always happy to engage in polite, positive conversation.  Have a GREAT day!

Also, it is often that developers find out about this stuff faster if the "masses" are notified.  The word spreads faster, and the developers and users are forewarned faster when publicly announced.  That's why Evan publicly announces things.  If he didn't, the users wouldn't know that they might be getting themselves into trouble (if they're doing illegal things where they live) and the developers may not know about it for days otherwise.   
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:27:31
You need to do some research, as you are very mistaken :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:49:56
Well, you can say that, but the idea behind open source is that everyone can benefit from what is learned and fixes being shared.  Luckily, the good developers are thankful for anything found and all the silly childish boo hoo'ing is just coming from the masses.  All in all, everyone working on crypto currency with all the fantastic ideas that are coming out, are going to move the world.  Question is, are you on the team?  Or just trying to get rich quick?  Or both?  LOL
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:29:12
It's been open sourced for months now, fyi and completely functional at this time.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:35:53
in small defense, it's hard to keep up with all the altcoins and there is so much FUD spread, it's amazing.  Update: Darkcoin is now a fork from Bitcoin Core, the mixing technology "DarkSend" is considered complete, and awaiting any reports on flaws, which the developers (I think they have 6-8 full developers on the project now) are always thankful for.  Every flaw found hardens the technology.  Darkcoind had the same issue a couple of months ago, and has resolved it, as I'm sure the Darkwallet team will resolve their issues.  I still don't like that it's not decentralized like Darkcoin, and that it functions off a browser.  But that's just me.  Certainly, it's better than nothing.  A coin needs to be fungible and Bitcoin, being so easily tracked, has already been blocked by coinbase, if it has gone through questionable wallets, such as gambling sites.  This is a serious issue.
@_date: 2016-01-29 05:00:11
Completely agree, and I too learn something with every episode!
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:11:51
If you're using a coinjoin service for your bitcoin, it is NOT decentralized and you have to trust the central service to remove any identifying information.  That would be a trusted solution.  DarkSend is a trustless solution.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:38:18
Why not just use Dash?  It has instant confirmations, and takes about 4 seconds.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  I'm a coinbase user, and if charges go much higher to pay for such losses, I won't be for long :)
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:04:03
Gosh, I'm amazed at the lack of understanding of how important privacy is to human civil liberty.  Plus the fact that without privacy, there is no fungibility.  It's as if the entire population of the world is asking those in power, "please enslave me, I don't want to take responsibility for my life anymore".  Trust me, they're more than happy to make all your life decisions for you.  And when the wealth of the world is stolen they will be happy to care for you in overcrowded rooms and feed you millipop, just don't dare ask for more sir!  And the blocksize debate.  Adding a few megabytes to the blockchain changes nothing about Bitcoin, except allows it to expand as transactions are increasing, so as not to back up, and keep transactions cheap.  But the Chinese don't want an expanding blockchain, and they don't want to deal with the bandwidth issues.  The bandwidth issues will hold them back at finding blocks.  Of course, they could always limit the types of transactions they'll accept.  Anyway, it gives the developers time to come up with a better solution.  Bitcoin has stagnated for over 2 years now.  It's time to do something, and if XP can take the keys back from the fools that have been sitting on their asses killing the foundation, etc... well, all I can say is it's a good thing!
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:10:21
Dash is the most up and up coin, and yet people (or entities) like you keep maligning the project, it's developers and supporters.  You are plastic that has been left in the sun too long and are now brittle and broken.  Good luck with that.  Bitcoin will be a settlement tool for the banks.  It's good for that, and that's it's future.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:22:50
Actually, I'm seeing things differently.  I can see the current financial industry (Banks) wanting to use Bitcoin for their needs.  They need the security of the network, both in nodes and hash power, they can't create that themselves, it comes from the motivated public.  However, there will be no need for them to keep Bitcoin usable by the public.  They can't block out the public, but certainly, they won't care about fees that are too large for small time users compared to the size of funds they would be moving around.  This might even be the reason the block size is being kept small.  They may want to squeeze the small investor out.  I don't see this as a bad thing.  First of all, Bitcoin would still have to increase in price 1000 fold, probably, and no matter the price, it's still the gateway coin to the rest.  Mostly, it doesn't need to do but one thing.  Transfer value from point a to point b securely.  And it already does that.  The only thing Bitcoin needs to do is to keep miners mining (high cost of transfer is a good way to do this) and keep people running full nodes.  If security is all on the miners, then the full nodes could be provided by the banking industry.  Bitcoin does not need to change.  This doesn't mean Satoshi Nakamoto's vision will not be realized.  Once the world has converted to digital currency, the governments of the world will indeed find it more difficult to swindle the people.  They'll have to do something like a consumption tax.  And with one tax, it'll be harder to manipulate things and hide the true cost of their spending and waste.  The people will be able to squeeze the government down to size much easier.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:36:27
Bitcoin isn't worth anything if it isn't being used as a service.  Holding and storing as an investment might make you money some day, but not if that's what everyone does.  It's only real worth is in providing a service.  The service Bitcoin is best at is transporting large sums (at the moment, also small sums) of money from point a to point b super fast and cheap and openly.  Without people using it this way in the future, Bitcoin will cease to have value (I'm sure that won't happen).  But use for the average Joe, nah.  Bitcoin is more likely to be used for huge sums of money transfers, and the price to transport funds will likely go up (I think the forces behind Bitcoin want it this way) and alts with their varied services is where the masses will be doing their "banking" in the future.

This isn't a good way to treat a heavy hitter Cryptsy.  If you have no troubles, then why can't otoh withdraw funds?  Why have you then locked him out of his account?  He is well respected and treating him like this certainly gives me pause.  I don't trade much, and I never leave my coins on an exchange but I know others need to because they trade.  If you treat one of your best customers this way, I assure you many will leave your service.

I think this interview is so funny, showing the lack of knowledge and understanding and hostility toward Dash, LOL.  Figures.  
Sybil attack is prevented via a substantial collateral that has to be put up (1000 dash) and it is impossible to own enough Dash to control a majority of MNs.  Our largest holder at his peak had 600,000 dash -none mined, all bought - but has since sold them to friends and associates to make it easy to buy and spread the knowledge. He now has closer to 250,000 coins.  Evan has far less than that, and I counted over 25 original miners at the time, but there were probably more.
BTW, nobody hears from Evan until he comes up for air once in a blue moon.  He seriously buries his head in code and seldom comes up for air.  Catch him at a conference, maybe he'll talk to you. If we didn't send him to conferences (BTW, paid for by the Dash budgeting system) I don't think he'd see the light of day.  That's how hard he works, seriously!

That I'll agree with, Ethereum and Dash are the two top.  Ethereum, is far riskier though, as it's working on new ground, whereas Dash is built on the tried and true technology of Bitcoin.  It will never have the complexities of Etherium for contracts, but it will still have a lot of flexibility, and more security in that Dash contracts will not be so easily fucked up.  But I do find Ethereum to be as exciting a project as Dash, I'll say that, though I won't invest in it.
