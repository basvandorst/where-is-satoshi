Tip - A bigger block size please.

That's a very restrictive view of what bitcoin can be used for.  Is that what you want?
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:29:42
is this not the big mover at the moment, the one item that would propel the price upwards?
@_date: 2016-03-30 11:18:34
Let's get real.  Expecting masses of emerging world countries to drive on the currency revolution is mistaken.  They don't have PCs, Internet, Bank accounts, etc.  It's developments like this that will bring on the popular use of Bitcoin.
Put yourself in Venezeula and ask around, who has even heard of Bitcoin?  Only the wealthy and the connected, and guess what the wealthy and the well connected don't need Bitcoin to get around the capital controls....I could go on, but my point is that expecting China, and other developing nations to light up the Money revolution is mistaken.....

The high, and increasing, volume of trades would seem to indicate wider adoption.  However this has not led to a move in the price, as one would expect.  could it be that the higher volumes are just Chinese buying bitcoin and immediately selling it for dollars outside of China?
It is staggering to think that the renminbi could be devalued by that much and that bitcoin would not move up.

Leaving aside the easter/jesus is risen rubbish, what explains the recent rise,
1) drop in Ether price,
2) chinese dwvaluation of the renminbi
3) relates to halving of miner rewards
4) other

the murder of Jo Cox MP?  sentiment has shifted on brexit after her death.  6 days to go though so that will revert to favouring brexit by then, hopefully/

Why such a slow response?  I thought that this would have gained 100 signatures in seconds!  And yes I knonw that the chances of walmart accepting bitcoin are slim....but that's not the point....
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:02:22
So why hasn't the price shot back again if the problems at Bitfines have been resolved?
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:58:12
Open a wallet with bitstamp, or whoever, and place an order.
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:44:12
Let's suppose that bitfinix is finished, closed forever, bankrupt.  What are the implications? What will the impact be on the bitcoin price?

Here's the bloomberg article on the same topic. The dance has begun....
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s government is considering measures that may inject as much as 40 billion euros ($44 billion) into banks, possibly by providing capital or pledging guarantees, said a person with knowledge of the talks. Italian media have reported that the government in Rome is pursuing a six-month waiver of EU state-aid rules, allowing it to shore up banks without forcing investors to share losses.

Actually thats a typo in the article. It should be 200bn. And thats only the loans that are recognised as npl. Theres as much more not yet classified as npl.
@_date: 2016-06-30 10:09:20
Yes. Italian banks are about to rip the eurozone apart. Botcoin rising accordingly.

You're a weak man. Try to restore your own confidence.  Hopefully you will gain the ability to communicate on an equal footing with others.

End of the year....really? That's a dangerously long time considering how much noise there is about high fees.  
If it works great on testnet, why do we need to wait until the new year for it to launch on mainnet?

Yes but now we have corexit..... load up load up....

Cool your boots my friend.  The perception was put out there that all things relating to LN would click into place once segwit was sorted.  I'm merely stating my surprise at the delay.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:12:08

It's done - about an hour ago.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:16:18
I'm glad to have allowed you some thing to vent your rage on.  You no doubt are aware that the high fees are a big problem and may erode confidence in Bitcoin if not resolved soon.
And if you think that was a rant you have alot to learn.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:32:42
Thank you.  So are you it will be a few months before LN will be implemented?

If it's higher than expected, Bitcoin Cash becomes more attractive to mine.....

Upcoming difficulty adjustment maybe?
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:53:10
But bitcoin cash is faster and cheaper.
