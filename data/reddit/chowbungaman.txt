Curious, why did you decide to buy? Was there a triggering event? As others have said, make paper wallets. It's a learning experience if you don't already fully grasp the concept of private/pub keys. And it is empowering to actually have the private key in your sole possession.

Was wondering the same: will brokers push the bitcoin etf? I had an older coworker call his broker and ask about investing in bitcoin. He said no, too risky, and he really had zero understanding of what it is (I listened to the convo). But I told my coworker to ask him again once the etf debuted and I bet he will change his tune.

I love the idea but according to what the Swarm founder said on the most recent epicenter bitcoin podcast, they legally can not reward equity from all the businesses in the swarm network.
So it seems to be just another kickstarter at this point (handing out gifts in exchange for donations to projects).
What information/resources are people using to decide if swarm is a sound investment? Why wouldn't these guys build some kind of MVP first to show potential investors before they ask them to fork over their bitocins for swarm coins? If it is going to be a platform that helps company raise their own funds, then why don't they use an MVP version of their own platform to kickstart themselves. Show us what we are investing in.

I completely agree. What do you think of the notion going around that Bitcoin works just as well at million dollars or 1 cent. I have heard Andreas Antonop say this and others. Yes it would still "work" as means of transferring value but it would have far greater utility if the system could transfer large amounts of value. So as you approach zero in bitcoin value you approach zero in blockchain utility.

Adoption primarily comes from people buying in on the speculation that their coins will eventually be worth more than what they bought them for. Once they are worth more than they spend them. Most of the bitcoins being spent are from people who have already gotten rich off them. This is how it bootstraps itself, until it eventually reaches a large enough price where big sells and buys no longer create volatility and at that point everyone is spending as they would with dollars. That being said, if good deals were offered (like 10% off on some eccomerce site) for spending with bitcoins than it would make sense for people to transfer to btc and spend without waiting for a btc price rise, and I don't think the postive effects of expanding the network through new user adoption would outweigh the negative effect on btc price from increased velocity. As the network grows btc inevitably becomes more valuable. So we can't just expect new adopters to just start choosing to spend with btc unless they have an incentive to.

Is it anonymous? If i download the app and create a wallet will any identifying information be associated with my public keys (like my phone's IP address)? Blockchain.info wallets associate an IP address with created wallets. Does this avoid that, since it is decentralized? I am looking for a wallet i can load and spend from without any way of tracing the transactions back to me.

I am not buying. I sold for the first time ever yesterday, and I sold everything. Gox did not phase me, China did not, and the fed auction did not--they had nothing to do with the btc protocol. But the 51% hashing issue is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed. Incentives are misaligned. A diving coin price will push this issue to the forefront and a solution will be found.

Bitcoin doesn't eliminate the need for people in a society to trust each other, it (eventually) eliminates the need for them to trust third parties when transacting value. If anything, Bitcoin creates a world that is more reliant on trust between people, since the third party trust provider is no longer necessary. Coinbase is to Bitcoin as AOL was to the Internet. We need it now, to onboard the masses, but once they are using Bitcoin, these third party trust providers will melt away and the peer to peer distributed trust protocol will remain.

@_date: 2014-09-26 15:30:09
-if merchants save on transaction/fraud costs they can pass those savings on to customers through discounts for purchases made with bitcoin. 
-microtransactions are made possible so new biz models will arise where customers will need to have bitcoin to participate (a cc won't work).
-customers don't have to worry about cc info getting stolen off of servers (Target) or worry about the waiter grabbing their cc info. Bitcoin is push instead of pull. 
-the elimination of cc fraud is saving that merchants can ultimately pass on to customers.
-in general when you get ride of a middle man (cc companies, banks, etc) the remaining two parities benefit. We don't know exactly how the merchants and customers will benefit but it seems inevitable.

I just don't see how these guys (banks &amp; officials in power) are going to all hold the line. If there is one thing we know for certain it is that the people in power always want more of it. Why take marching orders from Jamie Dimon when you have the opportunity to leap frog him? At what point does Jamie Dimon himself start hedging his bet..seems like he already sees the writing on the wall.

Great post! You summed it all up nicely. I basically arrived at the same conclusion, but what do you think about the argument that Bitcoin just does not solve a real problem or need? Yes, it solves the double spend problem etc., and thus allows for digital cash to exist...but do people need it? Grandmas found the internet to be very confusing, but they were willing to learn and try it because they really wanted to send their grandkids an email. People went to great lengths to overcome the technical issues of the early internet because the internet had so much pull, even if in just the form of pure entertainment and wonder. Personally, bitcoin has pulled me in, like you, but will it draw the masses in? Speculation pulls people in right now, but is that what will pull the masses in? Remittance use will pull some people in. Maybe savings on purchases if that becomes a big thing. What do you think?
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:05:18
I am surprised they were not a more slick in their attempt to scare people into spending. Why did they not propose that you can save some bitcoins and spend others? Or better yet, you can hoard all your current bitcoins, if that is what you already do, but when you want to buy something you should convert dollars to bitcoins at that moment and use the new coins to make your purchase? That seems like more of a win win--transactions increase without giving up hoarding.

After the auction news I bought, like I always do on "bad news". After a bitcoin developer publicly announced he sold half his btc because of his concern that bitcoin is fudamenally broken, I sold. Until it is made trustless and decentralized, I am out. There are many others who also care. This is why we are seeing a slide.

@_date: 2014-02-06 04:08:58
Thanks! Actually, it looks like their estimated $1300 per bitcoin figure is based on an estimated market cap of $15bn, which includes bitcoin being used as a store of value in addition to being used as a means of transferring money digitally. If we ignore its use as a store of value and assume bitcoin will only be used as a medium of exchange than the market cap is estimated at $5bn (for B2C e-commerce) + 4.5bn (means for payments) = $9.5bn , which works out to a coin value of approximately $700-$800, which is where we have been hovering.

I find it strange that the interviews are quality but the site is so sketchy. It seems unfortunate because people researching Bitcoin will find these youtube videos and will then link to Success Council, which will make them question the legitimacy of the interviews and Bitcoin too. Just ruins the credibility of the guys being interviewed. I wonder if these guys getting interviewed know they are being associated with Success Council. What is Success Council even trying to do? I did not bother reading past the first two lines. Is the interviewer even associated with Success Council? 
edit: did a little more research. it looks like the interviewer is indeed part of Success Council and that they try to sell Bitcoin starter kits? Really surprised that legit trusted figures in Bitcoin are associating with them. Are these guys not legit figures?

A concern I have is it seems there has been a bit of a brain drain from the btc community. Some of the early tech adopters have moved on to a belief in blockchain tech and not bitcoin and are waiting for or working on what they think will be the blockchain that prevails. Personally, I think the bitcoin network effect is undervalued and that until any of these other blockchains get any real traction they should not be considered potential successors. I think the pendulum will swing back toward to bitcoin when the brains who have moved on to thinking about blockchain tech realize how important the existing network is. I hear lots of concern about a lack of price stability and that the winning blockchain will need to have a stable coin , but I think that ignores the foresight that Satoshi had when he designed bitcoin to bootstrap itself through speculation.

Ask yourself what problem crypto solves— censorship resistant value transfer/storage. Then invest in the coin(s) that is and like will do that value prop the best. The key is the censorship resistant part. Bitcoin does that pretty well “so far” but it lacks privacy/anonymity/fungibility built into its base protocol layer which is required if it intends on remaining censorship resistant as blockchain analysis tech improves.
