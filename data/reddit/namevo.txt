This is a cliche, but the reality is that having money can indirectly lead you to all these good things in life, especially traveling the world. Having a lot of money lets you see the world in a different way that can help your relationships and people gravitate towards money like men gravitate towards attractive women but still manage to have fulfilling relationships with them.

If the crypto market ends up crashing before I am able to cash out a good amount of money that I can live on (frugally) for a few decades, this will be me.

I am an electrical engineer and to be honest, people tend to overestimate what electrical engineers earn in general, aside from a few inventor geniuses. The real high paying engineer jobs tend to be more in civil engineering.
Also even if it had been a high paying career, maybe he just hated it, so working a job that he hated for a lot of money wasn't worth it to him.

I have personal experience with these feelings too and have known several people intimately who ended up taking their own lives (through a community for depression and suicidal people), and I can say that reasons for suicide are very diverse and depend on the person. You can't make those assumptions about someone else.

Sure... 1 time. If you want to have a life filled with these things though...

I'm not... I fucking hate my life.

Not sure if that was really an illness, I can empathize with him.

This would severely fuck with me too.

This is just **me** and I don't want people to take it wrong, it's not a suggestion in any way *at all*, but my brains would be on the wall if I had done that. I am much more careful with my money though... but if the crypto market as a whole were to crash...

I did the same fucking thing but I day traded altcoins. After months of gains in BTC and altcoins I somehow still end up with roughly the same amount of $ value in crypto. At least I didn't lose a lot of my initial investment like some other people. 
I keep telling myself to just hodl some good crypto's, but I see those price movements and keep thinking to myself "damn I could make a lot of money off this". Yeah no.
I have quite a bit of money invested in cryptocurrencies. Thinking of taking it out now that the 2X fork is upcoming. Too much of a mess with developers, miners and corporate executives fighting for who gets to control Bitcoin.

Bloomberg or whatever news agency only has to fart in the wrong direction and BTC plummets 30% in a week. How can something like that ever be considered a legit payment method? I'm not trying to shit on Bitcoin, I'm genuinely curious how it'd work.
