It would be simply a centralized digital currency.

The government is not going to sabotage themselves.

I guess it's been working great so far...

You don't have to go to the extreme to justify your opinion. You showed your weakness.

We don't need the investment from the government to develop the crypto-infrastructure.

I am afraid "Libertarian party" has been hijacked.

Removing those automatically lead to the solution you are looking at. For example, you won't have a government that spends on wars and send soliders to get killed if you have a smaller government.

Is the information current enough? I always am afraid of getting any books about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies of any kinds that are evenly slightly published a year ago or so because the super rapid advancement of this field makes a few year old knowledge obsolute.

You just need to buy one bitcoin 20x higher price now. The price used to exchange will be recorded.

The paper also does not address the issue of private information over cryptocurrency industry ironically that seems like the authors expertise. Basically everyone knows about the stock market. Evey single adult knows about the stock market and many of them keep track up the price of their portfolios and many of them do online trade here and there. The information on the daily market get reported in everywhere, every media. So every day the well analyzed information on the stock market is shared among the whole market participat population or most. In case of bitcoins, the population who know about the bitcoin and the industry only grows every day. If somebody learns about bitcoin today, he will not forget tomorrow. He may not open coinbase account but the article about bitcoin starts catching his attention more or less.
Suppose 60% of U.S. population are in any way aware of the stock market movement today, the same 60% of U.S. population will be in anyway aware of the stock market 3 months later. On the contrary, when the bitcoin was rising, suppose 5% of the entire population are in anyway aware of the price movement and the technology and the industry then in 3 months 10% of the population have become aware and learned about bitcoin. This drives the demand go up just because there are more people who know about it. 
It is actually very embarrassing.

Bitcoin price will never come back up. It is a simple economics law. You have more and more substitutes (altcoins) which necessarily has a negative impact on the price of bitcoin because people like to diversify by selling bitcoin to buy altcoins if they stay in the crypto trades. Otherwise they cash in to consume something or buy other assets that are more tangible. Altcoins that get released always have improved features over bitcoin, so people will rather jump ship on them and it is expected to be more speculatively profitable. The similar argument goes for etheurem but the negative effect will be smaller because it has a better features.

This just applied the existing finance economics asset pricing model used everywhere to the bitcoin and utterly impractical and useless. It completely ignores the fact that the bitcoin has so many substitutes as an asset such as ethereum and many other altcoins which have improved features than Bitcoins. In the real finance, it is not easy to create the new underlying asset for example you cannot suddenly start mining aluminum and issue various kinds of securities underlying the real intrinsic value of the aluminum that would be dug, processed, distributed and used in the manufacturing of consumer products. Another example is the foreign currencies. You dont see a new nation pop up every other week and start issuing it's own currency. When the price of bitcoin was shooting up, people only knew about bitcoin but as the information about crypto projects and blockchain projects became widespread, the speculators would sell bitcoin and buy other altcoins because they usually hold the very features that the paper assumes the value embedded in the bitcoin such as scaling issue, speed, and so on everyone in this sub knows and therefore the return would be expected to be higher than holding bitcoins. The paper fully and completely ignores the rapid technological improvement that helped the rise of bitcoin and that also helped the massive decline of the bitcoin value and the way information is propagated and shared.

How do you short BTC?

A good example of how government imposed regulations are not intended to protect consumers but rather to create the cartel-like industry structure where only politically connected people can make money.

You probably want it to mean that the ability of government to borrow funds from themself.

Do you know diamond and water argument? Diamond is praised useless but expensive more than a glass of water which is essential to human to survive. Without water you die whereas you will be fine until you die of age without diamond.

You may actually get this.
