Yes that is one side bc investors are worried that recession is on its way but by doing that there is an opportunity cost of missing a ride up on the stock market.

CashApp is convenient but the spread of buying or selling bitcoin is huge.  There are no fees but they make up the difference with the spread.  For example, if they current rate of bitcoin is 10500 USD (us dollars).  When you try to purchase bitcoin through cash app, they'll sell it to you at the rate of $10800 USD but when you try to sell the same amount back they'll buy it for $10300.  On the other hand coinbase pro has a 0.15% fee which I feel Los lower than that spread, so buy with coinbase pro.  The only downside is that the approval process and getting your USD on the exchange takes long.

Well the whole world isn't doing that well either.  And US stock market tends to do better than the rest.

How am I a liar? I said I haven't seen it to do that.

I have only explored the charts, does it show where the money coming from? Ex China
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:46:50
I guess I should say I haven't seen this within hours
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:15:18
It's fine, just buy a little by little, expect to spend more as it goes down.
