So you’re saying that stupid people is the reason to why bitcoin prices will increase? Hmm
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:04:48
People read what they want to see I guess
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:02:44
I hope not! I think we will hit 10.2k next within the next 63 hours
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:14
I choose fiat currency!
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:26:43
Do you mean hide that
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:53:32
I do. I was about to buy into bitcoin when it was at 10k and this drop has scared me into buying into it. I will be avoiding in the future because of its volatility and I no longer think that we will go past 11k. Many of the people I spoke with as well share the same sentiments. You are right in that no one gives a damn.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:51
I am hodling for the ceiling at 100k. Didn't investors predict this this year? Lez go!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:13:03
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:51
Why are you selling at $0.30?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:00:37
If your autobuy is $1000. How many bitcoins will you be buying at 0 dollars per bitcoin? Fuck I can’t do math. What’s 1000/0. Somebody help.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:35
i think the ceiling is 10000k so keep hodling k?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:56:02
gotcha thanks. that makes sense though with risks spreading. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:08:33
For laughter
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:45:47
No, not talking about bans. What are the incentives for a government to institute bitcoin over the current systems? Why would they? That would throw their leverage away if they were to adopt crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:08:48
Same. Keep it really simple, boy
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:20
That may be so But China sure as hell ain’t gonna allow bitcoin to become their main currency 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:51:20
This has got to be the most regarded post on bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:24:04
Based on your stupid logic, what happens when price of electricity drops?

His net worth

They aren’t gonna kill it. They just won’t use it
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:03
I mean there are currently 99% of people who do not hold bitcoin. And the government have in the past shut things down they don’t want. I’d say it’s the bitcoin holders who don’t have a choice. The governments have already started regulating bitcoin. What choice do bitcoin holders have? None 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:24:34
Good cause I can pay my bills with feelings
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:40
What happens to their leverage if they allow for crypto currencies? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:02
can't lose if you don't ever realize your losses!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:29
tru especially when we hit 1000k!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:50:20
He’s trying to equate that people are allowed to take gambling risks but not the risks in startups. 
Yeah it doesn’t make any sense for his argument either. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:21
But we're predicting it to hit 1000k so keep hodling!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:10:01
that i nearly shot myself in the foot
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:59:14
Will it move at 0?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:38
I don’t think that will happen at all. It’s all hyperbole from you.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:13
I don’t know where OP is getting that either. It is purposefully deceptive and written to push for bitcoin over money. No one is stopped from investing in startups if they want to. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:31:10
U mad
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:20:47
Lol really piss poor example
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:28
I along with 99% of the worlds population never held bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:41:26
The world isn’t gonna go crypto. The governments won’t allow that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:33:30
Under the 1000k prediction so we're still ok
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:47:24
Oh we treating analyzing bitcoin cycles like radio wavelengths now? So just keep buying? We at the trough yet? 
Ffs people you can’t even do any sort of analyses on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:53
Utility doesn't equate value. There are many forces at play which determine value. 
You are taking a very naive viewpoint. 
"We're all down today. Tomorrow, who knows?" - isn't that what someone buying the lottery would say? and it is unethical when people are propping a value of a commodity up, trying to get others to invest in it... so they don't lose money, or to try and profit off the gullible. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:46
Tell that to those who invested in Enron in the 90s lol 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:06:47
You’re wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:05
Oh shit
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:36
Tell that to cryptonick pls

? I’m celebrating coming up from 8.5k and hitting 9k! I’m not celebrating lows......... 
Very very very soon we will hit 100k! Gogogo hodl!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:48:44
oh? where do you see this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:05
Don’t hodl
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:08:56
I never said they’d ban it. But my guess is currency will remain the dominant way of transaction.
And there is no battle. If I, as a citizen along with the 99%, do not want to transact with you using bitcoin then I would say your bitcoins are quite meaningless. The US dollar is backed by the government which makes it valuable. Bitcoin is backed by an ideology, which to me has no value. 
Quit with the hyperbole. Battle. Ya right lol 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:36:36
Many stock exchanges choose to reduce market transparency by allowing traders to hide some or all of their order size
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:54:06

If anyone actually knew they’d be rich lol. Why aren’t all of billionaires getting into buying bitcoin then?
