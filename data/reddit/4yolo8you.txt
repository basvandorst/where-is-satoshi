Yes, I wasn't sure how strawman-ey my argument became. I wanted to convey the idea that rentier capitalism/wealth multiplication is a terrible, destructive goal for civilization, much worse than a world full of paper PhDs (not that these are mutually exclusive, at all). Maybe we can agree that there's no golden bullet, and, with some wisdom, a lot of both lending and education efforts are beneficial, if not for individual/society's wealth, then for other measures of well-being and development.

Premined altcoins are bad, because the only new thing they bring to the table is a requirement to give unproportional amount of value and trust to some old fool who happened to start a particular copycat Bitcoin.

Or maybe boom and boost cycles? Regardless, it seems to me this is another of those "spartans hold"-mindset posts.

Well, an example of one cool feature that no other medium has are brain wallets.

Apart from the long withdrawals issue (I myself waited a month for one), which is improving a lot... After April's crash people were eager to place the blame on something, a crapton of anger got thrown at MtGox for having lags and outages under an unprecedented load.

To clarify, is it really your opinion that in the long term, increasing the human capital is usually a waste of time, but lending money for anything, say a fireworks company, is usually worth it? Isn't this the broken window fallacy?

I understand your enthusiasm, but Bitcoin is only an improvement to the existing economy and its viability and uniqueness remains more or less speculative. Maybe the mainstream will adopt different, commercial, centralised solutions, as it happened with Facebook vs. Diaspora. I don't want to promote anything, but for example there are now solid startups for sending remittances.

Your ISP or anyone else in LANs or WLANs (not any kind though, switched and public only) through which your unencrypted traffic may happen to move.

If we simply talk about just a single person selling 10000 coins, major markets have the depth to easily carry such a stupid order. On Mtgox USD this would bring the price down to ~$820, on Bitstamp to under $600, on Mtgox EUR to 600€. Obviously this would induce a panic sell, but no one knows how'd it play out, and obviously it would be wiser to sell that much coins in portions. 
It's not a ponzi if Bitcoin has features that other mediums of value do not. Understand that in very many circumstances it's better to have $5 of value in Bitcoin than in any other medium. It shouldn't fail just because of early whales cashing out. When it fails it's most likely due to a killer alternative, IMO.

Free market is inefficient as well, and I don't recall it giving free education, or healthcare for that matter, while being more vampiric than any government.

You have a lot of small inputs, and transaction size fees may eat most of what you got. Unless you wait for a couple of years when they are much lower than today. YMMV, but faucets and mining seem to be really not worth it.

Don't forget people may hold their bitcoins in mining pool and exchange balances. I would guesstimate that number is one, two orders of magnitude lower, but still.

But seriously, psychology research clearly shows that once your basic needs are secured, more wealth doesn't bring happiness. Better relationships do. Cue back to OP's point about not ruining your relations because of BTC.
