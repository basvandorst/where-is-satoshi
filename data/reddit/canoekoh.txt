lol we have pepperoni-faced white boys still living in their mom's basement while jerking off to porn defending their precious bitcoin from one of the greatest investors in history.

although this crash isn't over yet, from the looks of it, many of you guys who are suffering losses have reason to be relieved. right now, it's holding very well at and above $500. china, which was the prime cause of this bubble, first garnered interest around late october/early november when it was only around 280-300. the current state of affairs suggests china's totally out of the picture now, yet if we come out of this $500&lt;, this will be a very good scenario as much worse may or should have happened. it would also be a testament to how much the general sentiment towards bitcoin has strengthened positively over the past few months since coming out of this $500&lt; would suggest there is simply a sizable number of people who believe in the long-term fundamentals of btc to the point of hoarding $500=&lt; coins when just a month ago, $500 was seen as very expensive. 
so my advice for those who bought at high prices? hold.
