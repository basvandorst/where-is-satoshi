Yes I have lived in Asia for a few months. This might be a good idea, however my father is ill, not terminally, so I would feel extremely guilty living there while he is struggling. It is a good advice though. Thank you.

Thank you for your input. I currently live at home even... I want to move out and I probably should, but the fact that my father is ill and I am my parents last child living at home make it hard for me to do so.  I dislike spending money other than essentials, I spend around 300-500$ a month maximum, some months lower some months higher.
I currently have $7500 in bitcoin.

I know I totally agree. I truly hate myself for the person I am and that I even have these thoughts. I acknowledge this I again I agree with you. I have tried fixing my life and thoughts around, many times, but I just have not been succesful at it. My apologies if I have offended you.

Thank you. But what stops countries from just making their own digital currency which also has this features?

Because I got lucky with earning this. I didnt work hard at all. I was lazy. Let a lot of potential slip. I have friends who I was with in the same situation few years ago and they are worth millions. So even though 125k is a lot of money, I could have made a lot more by not being lazy/unprofessional.
I absolutely dont deserve to be in this situation at all (I mean the good part of the sitiuation).
Thanks again for your input.
