I agree that waiting for confirmations in this situation was a worse experience, but that doesn't make bitcoin a worse system. It was due to a lousy decision on the merchant's part when setting up their bitcoin payments. Analogous to an online merchant requiring that I call them in order to make a credit card payment, and wait on hold for 20 minutes when I should have been able to fill a credit card form with lastpass and click done. Both examples are policy problems, not something that makes one payment system fundamentally worse than the other. I believe 2ndEntropy's point is that as merchants get more knowledgeable, comfortable, and experienced with bitcoin they will make fewer policy mistakes like this.

Miners only do computations involving your coins if you spend them. Since you lost them and can't spend them, miners do no computations concerning them.

Most people of the ages you mention are in that category. The idea of tech-savvy kids is a myth.

I wouldn't say it's shrinking, but it's constant or barely growing. Kids, as "digital natives," aren't automatically technically literate. I work with several kids who understand technology. For each of them, there are scores of others who are clueless.

Can you provide a link to the blog post explaining dropping bank deposits? The only comment about it I found on the blog was that there were unspecified "problems." Maybe you could find a better partner for bank deposits.
I used both moneygram a few times and bank deposits several times. Bank deposits were easy and moneygram is really tedious. I don't want to talk on the phone. And I definitely don't want to call in 3 times because the order doesn't get processed correctly and doesn't show up in the store cashier's system until 45 minutes later -- which happened the last time I used moneygram. I would rather click a button and wait 3 days for ACH, which is what I do now.

I use armory, it's great! Thanks for your work. This reminds me to send a donation.

Laws vary by state. In a number of states, including California, I believe, such clauses in employment contracts are illegal. In any case one should always review employment contracts for these unacceptable terms and remove them before signing.

It's always negotiable. It just depends how badly they want you. I have stricken it from "non-negotiable" contracts in the past.

10E24 and 10E47 are also exponential notation, just base 10 instead of base 2. Using base 2 for this problem is more convenient and trivially verified in your head because the bitcoin address space is exactly 2^160 .
Using base 10 doesn't help people understand how big those numbers are anyway. Humans don't do well with large or small numbers. You have to relate it to our experience by one metaphor or another.
