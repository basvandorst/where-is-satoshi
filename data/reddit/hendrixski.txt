I like this theory. The IRS are already going to be getting a flood of tax returns this year showing people buying coffee with foldapp or diapers on purse.io or hotels with expedia or airfair with cheapair etc. etc. At some point they'll say "uh, this doesn't look right at all".
In reality though, it's more revenue for them, and they have big computers. So, they'd probably keep it coming.

Nope. I'm not concerned about credit card fraud when I use Purse because I see them weed it out all the time during my purchases. Give it a try and you'll see it in action yourself, you'll see attempted frauds canceled left and right.
I see that your account is 18 days old so I'll assume you're new and I'll give you a tip: "don't believe most of what you read on r/bitcoin". There are armies of trolls here who will post "scam" and "fraud" and "evil corporation" whenever you mention some innovative bitcoin companies. Don't believe them. Colu, Purse, FoldApp, Blockstream, Coinbase, Circle, Gemeni, etc. but especially "private blockchain" companies. None of them deserve the bad wrap they get from some members of this forum. Just ignore anybody who tells you any of those is a scam, or some kind of front for credit card fraud.

They're currently using cash to evade taxes just fine.
Listen it would be awesome if they could replace cash with bitcoin. So we have to offer their customers educational assets in how to use bitcoin for purchasing just like with a credit card. Then give them a payroll system that goes out of their tc wallet at regular intervals. Then give them resources to help negotiate with landlords to pay rent in btc. We aren't doing any of that, we're talking about how USD is bad even though it's currently saving their ass. Reality needs to sink in and we gotta do stuff outside of sitting on this forum.

Yeah, all are good but numbers 6 and 7 scare me the most. The lack of governance is a huge risk to dissuade potential investors. I want to invest in cryptocurrency not cryptoanarchy. And if an altcoin with better governance shows even small signs that it can overtake bitcoin then the investors will flock to it. Hence number 7.

Paxful is another option. Sell your bitcoins there to people who are mostly new to bitcoin. Some aren't quite sure how to pay winth paypal and how to accpet bitcoin so you'd likely walk them through the process. 
The reverse works too you can buy bitcoin with paypal.
Either way be careful because paypal cam be reversed but cash and bitcoin can't be.

I've not used windows for 10 years but generally pgp can import/export a "keypair". Look for that option. This means both public and private keys. Obviously don't show this to anyone because it contains the private key. Sometimes to import a key it has to be in an "armored" format. Meaning it uses letters and numbers and you can copy paste it. Look for that option. 
Out of curiosity if there were armor service that could help you get up armored running with pgp, nd help you practice a bit, perhaps using screen sharing on Skype or g+ would you pay for it?

I rather like the ability to just send to the same address from coinbase rather than having to copy/paste the address between the two services each time. In fact, if I can just name an address something like "myPurse" and type that into coinbase instead of copy/paste some llllooooonnnnggg ID then that would be a really cool feature.
I mean, I get it, you're doing something illegal and want to stay anonymous, so you want a new address each time. But, for the rest of us, it's not such a bad thing.

Thus is the nature of being a newer entrant into a market: you need to be significantly better than the incumbent.

Yeah you're right to avoid that stuff. I don't personally think bitcoin is revolution nor that it will change anything about the system. I personally like the system  (go  ) so so certainly don't give potential users any of that B.S. they don't care about how money works.
Tech is my passion. I tell people about electric cars without explaining the engine or about 3d printing without explaining the chemistry of plastic. I answer questions about bitcoin to many smart people and not a single person asks about how it works. They ask why To use it. I show them savings, remittances, gambling, easy payment, and fintech. It works great to get them to think about it positively but not enough to buy. That That I need help with.

I was just wondering about Purse this morning. Doesn't it increase the price of bitcoin if you buy through Purse.io? As compared to using merchants who instantly dump bitcoin for fiat?
Because people are buying your bitcoin at a 25% higher rate with purse, putting more "new money" into the bitcoin market than merchants that try to dump it low enough. In other words, isn't it 25% less "sell pressure" on the price of BTC if you buy with Purse.io?
And... if it really is stolen credit cards being used to buy your orders, then that's bitcoin being purchased which wouldn't be purchased any other way, again, driving up the price. In other words, isn't it 125% new "buy pressure" that drivew up bitcoin?  Right or did I miss something?
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:56:19
Yes, that's what I meant, Purse seems to create 20% less sell pressure than buying with a regular merchant. Right?
And, if it's actually a stolen credit cards that power purse.io, then isn't it creating 120% new buying pressure. Right?
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:54:40
YES! I've emailed Circle and coinbase about this before. I'll email them again with this update about FB. Please join me, friends.
If not PGP, then maybe they can send emails encrypted in the way that tutanota.de does: where the email is just a link to an encrypted page that is only decrypted in the browser by entering a correct password. It's pretty brilliant, actually.
Also, if you don't already PGP, then here's a brief tip: sign up for keybase.io to back up your private key, to share your public key. Anybody can encrypt messages to you using they keybase website, even offline.
Check out mailvelope for doing PGP in your webmail. Or if your inbox isn't too big then try whiteout.io (it works on desktop, Android and iPhone phones, and browser). Or if you prefer a mail client then get Thunderbird with the  enigmail plugin. Also Adroid users can use a combination of APG+k9-Mail.

I'm so torn between upvoting you for pointing out the hidden cost of insurance, and downvoting you for the method you presented it.
On further thought, downvote because you actually make people *want* to find a reason to disagree with that fact, so you're doing a net negative by disincentivizing people from thinking/learning.
Also, downvote because many of the new exchanges are insured, and because not all credit card transactions are covered (Visa probably won't refund your identity theft if you used your card for a dark web purchase). And because the OP was talking about the cost to the merchant not to the consumer, and because... etc. etc.
Yep, Downvoting and feeling good about it.

Train some NLP models to have conversations as intermediaries for a very specific kind of service. Maybe something like Purse.io-style swap automation, or escrow dispute resolution, etc. Something with very limited scope that a very basic AI can handle, and can charge for. 
Then automate the process by which the system pays for server time using the bitcoin it received.
Finally set up a genetic algorithm to it which tries new services from time to time (e.g. for the AI to explore new revenue streams). Then just sit back and watch it grow itself from pennies a day to millions per year.

I tried a few times to get a free cert from a CA. It had issues every time. Basically the free ones (even free options from CA's that sell paid ones) aren't trusted by anyone else. The CA model is busted too. And still nobody uses it (outside of businesses with IT departments and their own cert authorities), even though it is built in natively to many popular email clients.
Let's just say that something is better than nothing, instead of waiting for the perfect solution to fall down to us from heaven. Don't poopoo PGP, encourage people to try something/anything.
Plus, mailvelope is starting to make PGP easier because of PGP webmail. So are whiteout.io and Thunderbird/enigmail.

I don't think Tutanota offer most of those. Many of them (like flight/ticket extraction) are things that you would use Tutanota because you do not want it.
But the ones Tutanota do support (like search) they handle in-browser rather than on the server. This works well if you have a small number of emails, but would probably get annoyingly slow if you had many many emails.

I gave some of them demo's where I donated to Wikipedia live, showed my savings on purse.io, tipping with changetip, p2p lending on btcjam, and banking with coinbase. Everybody was amazed by the rich ecosystem and by the the savings.  Not a single one has bought any bitcoin yet. 
My local coworkers are always pooling or splitting lunches. I always ways list bitcoin as my preferred method of repayment but cash is how I get the most payment followed by Google wallet. Not once bitcoin, especially not from my coworker who was burned by Mt. Gox. I work in silicon valley btw.
I've shown my family the cheap and instant international transfers, and the savings I get on purse.io. They got a great introduction to bitcoin from the professional people at the bitcoin embassy in Warsaw (before the mafia shut it down). They just came to visit me for the holidays and we tried foldapp together. They are impressed by the savings again.  They still haven't bought a single bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a form of international cash created on the internet. Bitcoin allows you to own the value on your phone or computer directly instead of having an account with some other service whom you credit money from.
PayPal or ApplePay are built on top of a money infrastructure designed for previous decades. Bitcoin is a new kind of infrastructure built for the internet, and empowers entrepreneurs to create the next generation of PayPal or ApplePay without paying off the gate keepers of the previous system.

See, this is exactly what I was talking about.
2FA = Great advice. Keep telling people about it! :-)
"idiot" = Bad wording. Poor manners. Uncouth. Really not appealing. Very unsexy.
There is a lot of bad advice on the internet. 
About the guy who got robbed, he did read some manuals, let me tell you. I bet somebody told him that TAILS/TOR makes him more secure. He's not an idiot he was able to get lots of privacy software set up. He's not lazy, because that stuff isn't trivial. He was just misinformed, or given bad advice. Why be a dick to him because he followed advice from someone else but not the advice you would have given? How does that help? He thought he was doing the right thing. Why rub it in that he read the wrong tutorial?

Nice. Even outgoing messages is a great start. All the stuff that these exchanges send every time I make a transaction would be great to have encrypted.  Mailing them with encryption is lower priority.
@_date: 2014-10-11 21:38:47
I can understand why they request the added information. Especially with the risk of chargebacks being so high.
Still, BashCo has a good point. Circle really should allow one to upload their PGP public key and to do all email communication encrypted. It's sssooo easy now. Either Thunderbird with the enigmail plugin, or for the vast majority who prefer webmail, there's mailvelope which is a plugin for firefox and chrome that allows you to write PGP encrypted emails in a couple different webmail platforms.
If they do chat support, they should allow OTR encryption too.

Good question.
Not like Paypal at all really. More like transferring cash. Except that instead of handing somebody paper you send bits to a wallet. 
Paypal isn't truly global, bitcoin is. Paypal sits on top of other protocols (like credit cards, bank transfers, and now on top of bitcoin as well). Bitcoin is a protocol. Some of the wallet vendors are kind of like paypal, some of them are totally new unlike anything before. There is so much innovation in this space that there are vendors for every kind of personal preference.
Welcome to bitcoin :-) I hope you enjoy it. You can buy some bitcoins and experiment yourself with sending them between different wallets. It's great fun!

My son is 19 months old, I've been getting discounts on baby gear with bitcoin.
Buy diapers on amazon using brawker, name your discount. Can easily get 6% off
Get 3% off on cards bought with bitcoin at gyft.com some of those are helpful for parents.
Most nannies are from abroad, tell them about bitcoin and how they can send money to family back home without remittance agencies taking 17%. Maybe, just maybe, they may accept part of their pay in bitcoin. Seriously, try this.
Set some bitcoin aside, but transact some too. It's not going to go up for a few more months most likely.

Hi. I wrote one if those popular posts about how people should use bitcoin more. I see your point. I hope I didn't make you feel pressured or coerced. 
On the flip side I honestly feel that We do have a unique opportunity as a community to show that bitcoin is a good medium of exchange as well as a store of value. I encourage people to seize the day, I hope my post made you reflect on your usage, but certainly your choices are your own.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:17:08
Just complete the verification process in coinbase and this enables instant purchases. Then there is zero delay in receiving your bitcoin. You click "submit" and you have bitcoin that very instant. Once you have bitcoin in coinbase you can instantly spend them. You can move them easily before the price even fluctuates. There is no "holding period" before you can withdraw from coinbase.
It's your money. It works as you would expect.

Hey I'm sorry for your loss. This must suck. You did a really good job on protecting your privacy but missed protecting your security. The thief had no idea who you are. That's privacy. The thief was able to steal from you. That's poor security.  
You should keep using tor and tails. That's awesome.  You can improve your security by taking a few simple and easy steps.
1 enable 2 factor auth on everything ever. Check out refactorauth.org for a list of where to enable it and how.
2 install the HTTPS Everywhere plugin on all your browsers. Also a good VPN will encrypt your traffic.
3 Generate a different password for every account and make it 20 characters long. Use a password manager like lastpass to store all the passwords.
Hope that helps. Keep up the good work on privacy. But please think of security as a prerequisite for privacy.

Everything always has its detractors. Rat turds may be an accurate description of how people see changetip today.

Because of 2 bots on mtgox that artificially drove the price up. If this theory is correct that someone is lowering the price then it possibly means that a similar manipulation will drive up prices again. So in a few weeks I would say start buying.

Welcome. There's a lot to try and a lot to learn in the bitcoin space. Print a paper wallet (my favorite is the hobbit theme) and try some btc services. Try buying from merchants and never get discouraged by price swings. Also secure your computer, browser, email, set up two factor, and sleep well knowing you are in control of your security. And have fun.
  Hope you enjoy your time with us.
@_date: 2014-08-26 02:02:38
Excellent response. Thank you for taking the time :-)
I Didn't think about the licensing for accepting bank transfers. So a user needs to buy btc in their country to donate. I should take a look at your user flow from the perspective of a user unaware of btc.
My question that was confusing at the end there was about the macroeconomic effect of services that get people to buy BTC (possibly for the first time) and pays the vendor (or crowd fund project) in BTC; versus merchants who dump the btc for fiat. let me elaborate. 
 
Lets say My favorite Norwegian heavy metal band is crowd funding on bitpieces. I've never heard of BTC but I love this Norwegian band from my home in let's say Poland. So I'm driven to buy, as are other fans. The band gets BTC and possibly holds them, or spends them. (Right? Or do you pay them in their local currency ). Didn't this create buying pressure,  and new btc users. So successful crowdfunding and charity that drives new people to buy btc would raise the price of BTC, yes? 
Sounds to me like this kind of service (which creates new buyers) should be bigger news in the community than merchants accepting bitcoin while driving down the price.

Also. Lots of people are hung up on it being a store of value and are resistant to also building utility and make it a medium of exchange. Once we do that then we can make it a unit of account and then it becomes a full fledged currency

It's a store of value on some level. Maybe not a good one yet but give it time.
We're at the beginning of the "medium of exchange" phase. This will make the store of value stronger. In a few years we'll go to the "unit of account" phase.
Do not confuse a step in the process, for the end result.

Yes, you're right. A better example would be to say socialists love it because it brings powerful financial tools to the working class, no longer the exclusive domain of expensive financial instruments accessible only closed group of people... or something like that. I'm not a socialist, I'm trying to come up with an example to prove the point that there are reasons for those on both ends of the political spectrum (and everything in between) to like bitcoin. So it's not surprising that one party or another would like bitcoin, there's something _good_ about it for every political viewpoint.

The non-idealistic truth is that Bitcoin will get regulated and it will coexist within a regulated world. Either the regulation will be favorable, or it won't be. 
Remember that laws and regulation are purchased by the highest bidder. I am optimistic that cryptocurrencies will be adopted by a major corporation or a bank, and bitcoin will have the best lobbyists helping it navigate through congress.

I bought 15 BTC at around $600. I'm not buying more until there is some good regulation put in place. Most people don't want BearWhales and Fractional Reserve Chinese Exchanges to screw them. They won't start buying in droves until those things are regulated. A that point, that's when I'll buy because the price will SLOWLY go up. Maybe not to the moon, but definitely not down like this shit lately.

Yep. Softcard. They're doomed. It's a partnership between a few mobile carriers and a few credit cards to harness NFC for payments. But it's kind of hard to use because I wanted to set it up with my Visa card (which is issued by a credit union because fuck banks) and they only seem to directly accept Visa issued by Chase or Wells Fargo. Otherwise you have to set up Amex Serve, which I expressly do not want to sign up for... So I can't figure out how to use it... and I've used Google Wallet, Bitcoin, Venmo, PayPal, etc. 
Also, after the rebranding NOBODY knows what softcard is. So, needless to say they will not survive the new competition from Google Pay, and they are already less well known than bitcoin.

Thanks for posting that article. Long ago, in a college course on ethics in the information age there was a debate about people using filters to limit themselves to views they already agree with. We didn't have data like this back then so it was highly speculative and it was long before reddit and just before Facebook. I don't doubt it will continue this way. Just that people will donate fractions of pennies to someone they agree with, or a YouTube video of a music cover they like.
Whether this is good or bad for democracy is an interesting question. I suspect 99% of such donations will be over pop culture not politics. Just like in Brave New World, our dystopia will come from entertainment and ignorance and not from imposed government evils.

Converting to fiat costs under 1%. Debit cards take 1% plus a flat fee plus the risk of fraud. Credit cards take 2 or 3%, plus a greater flat fee, plus have an even greater risk of fraud which the vendor is on the hook for. That's why vendors save percentages with BTC. some even pass a percentage off to their users. This percent savings for buyers and vendors is called the "killer app of bitcoin"... now if only more vendors did this.
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:11:25

Yes. Much of "coding" has nothing to do with actually coding. 
There's testing:where you install and run the software and tell the dev's where things break for you. Easy, right?
There's documentation, where you run the software, figure out how to use it, and then write about it in a wiki. Easy, right?
Translation is even easier if you know multiple languages. Either take documentation that others have written and rewrite it, or even easier take the words on the app itself and translate them, then let the devs know what to put in those fields for "foreign language versions" of the app.
Offering kind words and donations is easy. Go to github where this software is written. It's like facebook, or google+. You can use changetip there to give tips to the developers. You can write comments, fill out bugs, be supportive, you can combat trolls, etc. etc.

Start securing your communications on the internet now and take back the web.
* Email encryption using Thunderbird (with the Enigmail plugin) or using the mailvelope plugin on firefox and chrome
* Chat over Facebook, Google, AIM, etc using Pidgin (with the OTR plugin) or ChatSecure on your phone.
* Use HTTPS Everywhere on your browser.
These things are easy to use. Just do it.

Don't go! Now is the most interesting phase. It's moving from the speculators and hodlers and being embraced by the spenders.
The volatility you talked about will go away as more and more market movement happens (e.g. people using it all the time to buy things). The network effect *is* happening. New users are adopting bitcoin every day. The technological innovation of altcoins are worthless if nobody uses it. Bitcoin has a bigger innovation now than any altcoin: merchant acceptance. Yes.
So don't go. Our team did alright in the "store of value" game, next we're playing the "medium of exchange game" and just wait until we reach the "unit of account" game. Oh boy those will be fun to watch.

Hey It's ok. The difference is not easy to understand. I'm sorry that this was an expensive way fir you to learn. But now you'll be more secure in the future.
 When you type things online they can be seen by everyone. That's why https helps, by encrypting your communication with the server. However sites often have non https versions of their site. There is a good plugin for this called HTTPS Everywhere. I recommend it. Also. A VPN will encrypt all of your traffic as well. Hth
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:50:58
To be fair here, it kind of does exist:
* Only a handful of banks will encrypt things that they send you. And usually that's just encrypted PDF's.
* Don't some online banking sites have non-HTTPS options, or even worse use those non-HTTPS defaults?
* How many banks offer two-factor authentication? How many offer it for regular accounts?
* Is there even a single bank whose representatives are able to work with PGPG encrypted emails? Or OTR encrypted chats?

Dont have to fool the market. We need to make a market.

Bullet number 4 is "get security":
* Make sure your web traffic is safe. Use Firefox or Chrome. Install the "HTTPS Everywhere" plugin. Also, Ghostery, FlashControl, AdBlock, and Mailvelope are good ones.
* Make sure your passwords are safe, use 2-factor authentication everywhere! Use LastPass to store lots of unique and strong passwords. Change them often.
* For bonus points, encrypt your communications. Especially when talking about bitcoin and finances. For email you can use a client like Thunderbird with the Enigmail plugin installed, or you can use webmail in the browser with mailvelope. For chat you can use Pidgin with the OTR plugin (or Adium on Mac, with OTR enabled), or ChatSecure on your phone.
* You may want to install anti-virus, get computer updates, use a safe operating system (avoid Windows, try Linux), etc.
Hope that helps.

To the naysayers about these kinds of things, think of it as packaging. You can sell the same thing in many different ways simply by packaging it differently.
Worried there's a middleman taking profits? Yes, good on them, but they're also doing some work in order to get paid: SALES. Yep, they sell this to people who otherwise wouldn't buy bitcoin without this kind of packaging.
Just because it's not for you, doesn't mean it isn't a way for somebody out there to get into bitcoin. Let's not poo poo a new way for people to first hear about and get invested in the success of bitcoin. :-)

Hope this helps, but if you bought 97 Euros worth of US dollars, and the next day the dollar dropped in value relative to the Euro, then you might have 93 Euros. You'll still have the same number of US dollars, but their value in Euro would be lower.
The same thing works with the value going up. It's possible that in a month or few your 97 Euro's of bitcoin can be worth several hundred Euros. (or zero Euros).

You're right, Bitcoin really is the future. I'd like to think I have some authority on what the future is. I live in silicon valley where the future is made, I work on wearable technology, I drive an electric car, I use Linux and tinker with early stage open source stuff, I try out lots of apps and geeky services when they first come out, and a bunch of other futuristic things. Out of all of the futuristic things I try, I'd say bitcoin has the most future-wiz-bang-WOW factor for me. Bitcoin blows everything else out of the water in my opinion. You're not alone in the sense of adventure you feel, it really is palpable.

OP here. I obviously disagree, but i feel that i have good reasons so hear me out.
Bitcoin is great for daily purchases because it is great for consumers not just merchants. Vendors often pass savings on to the customer. I mostly buy diapers and groceries at a discount with gyft, overstock, or from shopify vendors i learn about on here (tea, sauerkraut, etc.) In the same way, i buy gas with cash and save money.
Home depot, tarhet, etc. Do not have my cc on file. If thete is a data breach then i do not worry about identity theft. At first i didn't even think about this but i kniw 5 people who told me they went through hours of hell after those 2 data breaches. 5 people. Many hours. This is a damn good benefit to me as a consumer. 
Remember the father who called target angry that they sent his young daughter ads for maternity stuff. Then he called back to apologize because he found out she was. Target knew she was pregnant before her dad knew because her buying habits matched that of pregnant woman. That is creepy as fuck. I used to grt ads after cc ourchases. Now i have things ship to a pseudonym at my apartment complex, and im in private browsing so fb and Google dont serve me ads... because if you buy mostly diapers then you get girly ads even if you are a guy.
I find coinbases new checkout easier than credit cards. Click checkout, a popup shows up showing my wallet and i click accept. 
I use bitcoin to split the bill at restaurants instead of venmo (which is 3% plus the card takes 3% +$0.20 so venmo costs $1 to pay back $13. Bitcoin is better for the everyday consumer here too. Free 
The list goes on. Bitcoin is better for day to day consumers.  So the call to action is valid. Use it every day because it is good.

Some people find social tipping to be a good way to spread bitcoin.  Changetip allows you to send small amounts of bitcoin (like fractions of a penny) over twitter, reddit, github, etc. etc.
Also bctip.org allows you to pring out paper bitcoin tips that people can collect. Can give it to your friends. Great for including inside of a birthday card, or to give with a wad of cash when you repay something you borrowed from a friend for lunch money etc.
There's bitcoin crowdfunding, like bitcoinstarter or rushwallet. You can make a funny youtube video and do a kickstarter-like campaign to... buy a coffee, get a haircut, or to but lots of food for a homeless shelter... whatever. crowdfunding reaches people and they can donate with bitcoin.

You're right that the winning scenario will be a Russian competitor to SWIFT. One possible scenario is that a Russian business using bitcoin can rise to the occasion and scoop up a small fraction of the market during a period of confusion. Such a business could compete with SWIFT on price and speed. If it's well funded (like millions of dollars, funded) with an army of salesmen it can probably achieve 0.1% of Russian international money flow, which would still be many millions of dollars.

I've been online for about 20 years now. I've seen the good and the bad. And seriously, there's no good reason for the bad. It doesn't have to exist. StackOverflow, Ubuntu, Pinterest, etc. they all did a great job at creating positive communities. The internet can be a very warm and welcoming place. Bitcoin can too.

Sounds like many of us are just buying regularly every month, spending some of it, betting some of it, and hodling the rest. 
That's what I do because trying to play the market is a fools errand. It will go up or down and people smarter than me cannot predict it. One day the price will start climbing rapidly again, and if I wait to buy then I will have missed it. You might miss it too if you wait to buy. So I just buy a bit every month, spend some on groceries/shoes/baby-diapers/etc, play with some in predictious/btcjam/changetip/bctip some, and hodl the rest. every month. It's fun. I recommend it.

:-) In the case of the thread earlier today, he was not lazy. The guy was super into privacy but was simply uninformed about security. He kicked butt using tails, and I think we should congratulate him on his commitment to privacy. The problem is that he didn't know that he needed security in addition. It's not intuitive, it's an easy mistake that anyone can make.
I think he deserves our compassion and support, not our ridicule. Certainly after this expensive lesson he learned the difference between privacy and security, but holy shit were we mean to him. Let's vow as a community to never ever again treat somebody like we treated that poor guy.

Hard to tell. Today's price isn't driven by adoption it's driven by market manipulation. Mass adoption and larger volumes make manipulation harder. So we know we will get less volatility but we can't guess the price.

I think more positive comments started to show up after this thread appeared. I replied to 3 people for saying they had "no sympathy" or that it's "his fault" before I started this thread. The guy who got robbed even made a reply to one of two of them himself saying he didn't appreciate being attacked. I'm very happy to hear it turned around, since I haven't checked it recently myself.
So... :-) Good job to the bitcoin community members who had good advice and shared it in a helpful and constructive member.

Oh yeah, and the limit on the total number of bitcoin is to prevent inflation in the long term. There is only ever a limited number of coins. No bank can print more of them. This is why it's called a "deflationary currency" compared to others which experience inflation when a bank prints more currency causing it to devalue.

Bitcoin competes against an underlying infrastructure that cannot send money on weekends, takes 3 business days, and costs insane amounts of money to transfer internationally. How competitive is it? send bitcoin any time to anywhere for the same low price of about $0.04 in about 10 minutes time.

Also. u/cryptoceelo had a great point. TOR is great for privacy but security is different from privacy. I see it this way: the  thief didn't know who you are that's privacy; The thief couldn't steal from you that's security.

Benefit: micropayments. Using changetip a consumer can upvote comments on twitter, google+, reddit, etc. Fir fractions of pennies even. Cannot do this with credit cards.
Benefit: fungible. When it dawns on the average person that thhey can use social media whuffie to buy real world goods, the benefits of bitcoin will be clear without explanation. 
Benefit: international. Consumers cannot easily pay for products and services internationally. With bitcoin they can.

It's probably not his first rodeo. He's probably seen Russia change from an isolated place where people had to use gold to subscribe to american magazines, to a pretty big economy. He knows what big change looks like. His experience may be that yes there is a big change coming, but this is still the early phase of the change and the end result will not be it's current phase.
Just my guess.

Op here. In my post i covered this. The value will not go up if nobody uses bitcoin. The press will cover it more as transaction volume goes up. Investors will invest more when they see it is a successful technology for purchasing. And business analysts will say it is a growing trend poised to take over the market. But for this to happen we must use bitcoin in addition to hodling a little. These 3 things will help drive up the price if iur investment. So we owe it to ourselves to use it.

Cool. So did I understand that correctly, it is taxed like a commodity, yes?
I know the price is pegged to the dollar so it doesn't fluctuate, but you purchase it at a discount and sell at a loss (to encourage buying and spending but to discourage selling). Does that purchase of discounted dollars count for anything in taxes? Is that a capital gain?
Thanks for taking the time with my n00b questions, I'm new to bitcoin and currencies, etc.. :-)

This is an article intended to be a goto resource for whenever someone asks "what are the benefits for consumers using bitcoin?"
* Discounts - Many merchants pass the savings on to the customer
* No surcharges or merchant fees - Surcharges on credit cards are legal in the 40 US states. Avoid overpaying by using cash or bitcoin.
* Privacy - No creepy algorithms analyze your life if you shop anonymously with digital cash
* Lower risk of identity theft - nobody will steal your identity and payment details from an online store where you bought something once if you use bitcoin.
* Splitting the bill - Paying back friends with bitcoin is faster, more fun, easier, and costs less than Venmo
* International - Instant, thin spread on currency conversion, and no SWIFT fees to purchase abroad, if paid with Bitcoin.
* Easy to use - Can be easier and more hassle free than some common alternatives
@_date: 2014-11-23 15:31:07

Hey I understand times are tough now, and that you recently sold off your bitcoin at a loss. It's easy to get bitter and to make snarky posts online, but I'd like to encourage you to hang in there and to be awesome towards others.
Many people here are on the same boat. Many are underwater on their bitcoin. They're not all bitter, they still believe in the technology even if they've divested.

Yeah. There's a lot of great sites out there now showing people how easy it is to take a stand against mass surveillance. That's a good one too. EFF lists these things as well, the Guardian Project, etc. etc.
I think that if you're into bitcoin then these sites will appeal to you.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:24:40
There is a chicken and egg here. More people will join bitcoin, and more vendors will stop dumping to fiat, only after we have significant adoption as a way of purchasing things. Once more people start joining in droves the price will go to the moon.
You're right, the onramps to buying bitcoin must be easier, but also there must be a reason for people to want to take those onramps. Being able to buy things is one important aspect of people wanting to get into bitcoin. We just happen to be in a phase of merchant adoption. Sorry, price will go down but we are buying something with that lost value: utility.

Exactly. Encryption is to keep the "bad guys" away from prying into our lives. 
Sure, encryption keeps "bad guys" like thieves out of our conversations about our bank accounts. It keeps "bad guys" like competitors out of proprietary information and insider trader information. It keeps "bad guys" like scammers or even overzealous advertisers away from databases of private information about us which these bad guys would use to exploit us.
But to your point... one of the "bad guys" that are on the list of "bad guys" who are foiled by encryption... IS THE GOVERNMENT. For exaple the "bad guys" who might work in a government agency, and happen to dislike you personally, or randomly chose you as a target during an episode of one of many widespread mental illnesses, then snoop your personal data, find or fabricate some crime or another, and then ruin your life for the lulz. Psychopaths can exist anywhere, including in places that have your unencrypted data. etc. etc.
It's short sighted of James Comey to think that someone who works for him isn't also a "bad guy".

:-) Hey I can see that you've put a lot of thought into this. 
So first here are my credentials: I'm a linux-only user, have an encrypted hard drive, use lastpass with seriously long passwords, keep my bitcoin in both paper wallets as well as a multisig vault on coinbase, have encrypted backups both onsite and offsite, have 2FA on literally everything I could find on twofactorauth.org, use encrypted emails and chats with friends and family ESPECIALLY when talking about finances and bitcoin and computer issues etc., I'm at that age where porn is not exciting anymore, and I have HTTPS Everwhere plus flashcontrol installed on my browser. My phone is likewise locked down, with antivirus and remote lock etc. etc. So I'm near the top of your scale.
I could do two things from this position. I can say "everyone who is not like me is retarded". I'd feel very smug thinking that. OR I can challenge myself and be helpful to others who do not do these things. I can help them care, I can show them how. Most of all I can create an environment where they feel safe learning about security without feeling ashamed and running away.
Most people are never going to use linux, understand https, avoid porn, perform backups let alone encrypt their backups, and understand that their communications can (and often are) read by humans who either hack into their accounts or at various different companies and government agencies (and that these people can be thieves as well). This is not a bad thing. This is an opportunity to make them your friends and to teach them in a way that makes them open to learning.
TL;DR  I'm with you but I have sympathy for people who don't know about security. You should too because it will make those people more open to understanding security.

Just because the idea won't go away doesn't mean that bitcoin won't go away. Bitcoin may die but then years later the idea of a low-cost global finance protocol may be implemented by JP Morgan, or Apple, or Comcast.
For the sake of all our investments, let's hope Bitcoin is the idea "done right the first time" and not an "opportunity lost" by taking too long.

In general, if you have bitcoin on your computer or online then don't forget to take sensible steps to secure your computer.
* Check that you do not have any big vulnerabilities such as shellshock! One early adopter recently had 750 BTC stolen because of shellshock.
* Install AntiVirus on your Phone if you use bitcoin on your phone. Pick an antivirus that has "remote lock", and "geolocater" capabilities in case it is lost or stolen. Avast has these features and it's free.
* Install the "HTTPS Everywhere" plugin on your browsers.
* Get LastPass! Make sure all of your passwords are super secure. Change them regularly.
* Enable two-factor authentication on every service where you may possibly talk about your bitcoins. Check this list if they support two-factor auth: twofactorauth.org
* If you want to have some fun, then encrypt your communications when you talk about finances/bitcoin. PGP encryption on email is easy using either Thunderbirt+Enigmail, or using the Mailvelope browser plugin. Also, you can use OTR encryption across facebook chat, google talk, AIM, etc. etc. using Pidgin + the OTR plugin, Adium on Mac, or ChatSecure on your phone (these all work together). Encrypt your phone calls using Redphone (called Signal on iPhone).
* Always have all the latest updates. Install AntiVirus (even on Mac and Linux). 
* Get secure backups! Ideally back up to at least one off-site (in case of fire). Make sure to back up your bitcoin wallets!!! Back up your wallets on your phone and on your computer.
All of these things will secure your computer files, including bitcoins.

Prediction markets can predict events pretty damn closely if they have enough market depth. I have a few mbtc riding on the no vote. Let's get more people on predictious.com and then it will be more accurate... maybe nate silver may even write about it and that would be good for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-10 07:04:35
This is where the argument can be made that bitcoin is not a replacement but a new option to work side by side. It has no advantage to buying in store yet. But If you want to buy abroad, or send remittance, it has advantages. If you want to make micropayments (for example sent half a penny over twitter with changetip) it has advantages.  If you want to bet on predictions markets (like predictious.com), it has advantages. If you want to buy drugs online, or nude celebrity photos,  or other illegal stuff, it has advantages.  Some stores pass the savings on to the user but not most, so it doesn't have advantages there.

It won't get you in trouble but you will confuse people potentially interested in bitcoin. We don't have a clear answer to "will the transaction volume be enough to be worth accepting bitcoin" and we reply with "look at all the other cryptocurrencies you can accept with even less transaction volume. Did you know this altcoin changed one or two settings from bitcoin. Wow ". It overwhelms newcomers. Altcoins are awesome,  but as an advanced topic. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:21:18
What is "winning"? If bitcoin "wins" by being the foundation for a majority of online value transfer technology and nobody outside of financial software programmers know what it is, then I'd say Bitcoin has a _90%_ _chance_ _or_ _greater_. If "winning" means that every consumer in the world knows about bitcoin and the freedom that it brings them then I'm gonna say it has a 0.0001% chance.
Source: I was there for the linux revolution. Linux didn't win because normal desktop users adopted it for freedom and price. It won because companies hid it deep inside their servers, clouds, phones, wearables, embedded devices, supercomputers, DVR's, etc. because of easy licensing and low price. Bitcoin will win in the same way that Linux did: People won't care, bottom-line-driven corporations will.

Having worked at a "Health 2.0" startup, and having learned a lot of the insane things that happen in the healthcare industry because insurance is what it is in the USA... I can safely say that neither bitcoin, nor revolution, nor Jesus himself, could fix a single thing in healthcare.

Not sure why that got downvoted. Agree tje article is crap. Hodling doesn't give bitcoin any value. It becoming a successful technology that vendors want to take the time to accept gives it value. It being a POPULAR technology that investors want to but their weight behind makes its value go up. It sitting there makes people think it is useless.

Please do. It's got the convenience of not having to store my details with each new merchant, and it felt competative with paypal for ease of use.

Bitcoin prices were "testing a new bottom". 
I just bought some tea (with 30% off for shopping with bitcoin) and between clicking the "buy bitcoin" button on coinbase, and the "buy" button on the tea site, bitcoin jumped from $406 to $410, I checked back a minute later it was $415.

I was considering getting a BTC loan as a way of "shorting" Bitcoin (kinda) ... but, I honestly think that it will hit another upward trend in late November again (even without mtgox bots artificially driving it up). Maybe I should stop worrying and just do it as a form of almost-hedging?

In reality, bitcoin will never put central banks out of business. Realistically, the "success of bitcoin" would take the form of lowering internal costs for banks. Maybe even banks passing some of that cost savings on to the consumer.

OP here. I disagree that use drives down price. It increases awareness, broadening the user base, driving up value.
Usage will drive up price long term. Hodling will kill bitcoin.

Hey hodldown. I hope this isn't another trolling attempt but what you are saying is that people blame the victim to avoid blaming bitcoin. If that's a factor then I see it as being a very small factor.
The same problem occurs with other security issues. It is not unique to bitcoin. It was rampant in the Linux community. Look where it got them. Linus himself now says he wished that he was less of a dick otherwise desktop Linux may have thrived.
Neither is victim blaming unique to bitcoin. Are people trying to make sex look less bad by saying" it was her fault she wore sultry clothes"?no. It's ignorance. Same thing with bitcoin.
The main factors I see in play are culture, ignorance, bravado and showmanship over the difficult topic of security. We can do better and promote constructive criticism. If we make a culture out of being awesome to one another, especially to victims then we will be better people and have better bitcoin security.

I like that quote from the article. 
Also the point about how prices tended to be higher at the beginning of the month but low towards the end. If that holds then yesterday was the best time to buy and next week will be the best time to sell. But from the chart it looks like people caught on to this trend and it didn't hold the past 2 months.
He may be right that it's an altcoin which solves the problems causing bitcoins drop this year... I just worry that the altcoin will be made by a big bank and also remove some of the features we associate with bitcoin today.
Good article thanks for posting.

Hey. OP here.
Yes I am more concerned about the method of communication, because unlike these companies I cannot hire security consultants to prevent my financial emails from being read by hackers.
I do not however believe this is impossible in the USA. There do exist email providers like this. Snowden used one. That email had run for years without being shut down nor even having any requests for personal data. If the government really wanted that info they can get it from coinbase. If criminals want that data it better be damned hard fo r them even if they do sew my email 
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:05:06
Not sure if you're a troll... but I agree. $275 is not where the BearWhale stops. There's another one or two steps downwards before this the next uptrend. I will buy heartily then.  No point in being caught in a bull trap right now.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:06:03
You are right. I misspoke. What I meant was that hodling is not enough. It is important for bitcoin to be a store of value and hodling is critical for that. But bitcoin has a unique opportunity now to also become a medium of exchange. We should jump on this opportunity in order to make our hodling more valuable because of their utility. If we fail at medium of exchange then we may negatively impact the store of value. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:27:17
:-) Yes, this is a thread about *how* to tell people what they need to hear. Thank you for your contribution. Yes, you're right it's tough to deliver this information to people, and easy to come across as a dick. But we are early adopters, we rise to challenges like this. We don't say "it's too hard".
My point is that we should communicate the need for security in a compassionate way ESPECIALLY to victims of theft. Let alone victims who were taking some steps but not all steps, needed to protect themselves. We should go out of our way to be nice to them. It's a teaching moment, not a "incompassionate dick" moment.

I would agree. Bitcoin will win but not in the way we think of it. Linux won, but not in the way anybody expected. It's a good comparison.
These kinds of breakthroughs don't win by competing directly with established players, they win by carving a new path where the established players haven't dominated yet. Smartphones, supercomputers, and embedded devices didn't exist when Windows was born. Linux dominated the competition in those. Desktops already existed when Linux was born. Linux failed hard on desktops.
Lots of financial services exist today and bitcoin can't compete with the momentum they have (even if it can compete with the technology). Bitcoin will win in markets that don't exist yet, just like Linux did back in the day.

Great article, thanks for sharing. The cycle with bitcoin seems to be: lay groundwork,  spike in interest, lay groundwork, spike in interest, repeat.

I've had this thought for a disaster charity. Fly in just as the press are getting there and give victims a q code on their lawn or their Ferguson protest poster. Etc.

Huge brand name growth for bitcoin and huge help for disaster victims.

That is actually a fair point. 5 Years in terms of adopting and maturing a new financial instrument is a pretty short time, and it's easy to lose sight of that when comparing it to technology adoption of like whatsapp or wearable tech.
The counter argument is that one sign of maturity that people look for is regulation. I've heard this from many non bitcoiners. They all seem to be waiting for regulation before dipping their toe in the water. I think now I understand why. They see regulation as a stamp of approval of maturity. I'm now inclined to believe them.

Oooh, this is a good opportunity for me to ask a question that's been on my mind for a while:
Doesn't a "bitcoin crowdfunding" business have a smaller potential market than an "international crowdfunding" site?  
By this, I mean everyone knows what "international" means. It's cool because now they can fund something abroad like native throat singing rock and roll in Mongolia, or Hebrew rap in Israel. Not many people know about Bitcoin (outside of 32 year old Libertarian males, apparently). It's not cool because it's just a bunch of nerds like us.
Instead of calling it a "bitcoin crowdfunding" service, what if you can also take bank transfers to certain accounts in exchanges all over the world? Then send BTC to the artist/maker/author/entrepreneur/etc.
Also, wouldn't a service that takes money and creates bitcoin (even if unbeknownst to the buyer) cause upwards pressure on the price of bitcoin? So... win/win?
Thanks for reading my long rambling question. It's been on my mind for a few weeks now and this is a good chance to ask some crowdfunding peoples.

This is one of the better answers I've read on reddit in days. 
I would like to add, that when I evaluate relative opportunity costs of investments I also consider non-monetary benefits in addition to the cold hard percentages. If I have a choice between making more money investing in a technology that crushes cute kittens for profit, or making less money investing in a new gadget that will also save the whales, then I'll take the latter because of the non-monetary benefit I perceive in it. This is the case with bitcoin. Given it's risk/reward ratio I can _easily_ find better places to put my money. But I am also investing in changing the tech infrastructure for payments in the same way that Linux changed we-server infrastructure. This tips the scales for me.

Yes 2fa is the solution. But.. No sympathy to victims of theft? How can I best encourage you to be awesome unto others? This guy put a lot of work into privacy, but not into security. How about you tell him how awesome it is that he is so privacy minded. We need more people to do that. But then gently tell him that security is different from privacy.

I understand. But let's keep this in perspective.
Security bugs are hard to notice, and security expertise is hard to hire. It's especially hard for startups to hire engineers with security experience because their recruitment competes with large companies. 2-year old companies like this have to chase shiny new features that are promised to investors or potential business partners. The new features often take higher priority than making the old features work right.  None of this is unique to Blockchain.info, I wouldn't be surprised if their competitors have the exact same bug for the exact same reasons.
It seems to me that it would be unrealistic to expect Blockchain to be perfect, and that realistically they are doing pretty well. One might say they're successful for the stage they're at. I'm happy for them and want to see them continue to do well.

While OP has a great idea to get backpagers to also increase awareness of bitcoin among their customers, I do have to wonder whether now is the right time. Accepting payment in bitcoin is yet another level of complexity as buying it in the first place.
A better strategy may be to plant the seeds now and harvest them later.  Say "You know, once you get the hang of this you can have your customers pay you in bitcoin. I'll be here to help when that day comes" and leave it at that.
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:20:08
Wow. How come I didn't hear about snapcard before. That's basically how I use bitcoin in coinbase. I buy btc then spend it on places that give bitcoin discounts. From their front page, it looks like snapcard automates that process at the time of purchase. Is that right?
How long does the setup process take on snapcard? Could it be used by people who are new to BTC and need some bitcoins instantly (like,  backpage users)?
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:02:45
Not 100% true. In some states businesses are allowed to charge the customer extra for credit card purchases. Though with some contractual restrictions. Also many places will give a cash discount if you ask.
Also like you said many businesses just price it in to the product so we pay more. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:57:55
Just ask your parents to give you bitcoin. They let you have cash, right? And a debit card and paypal. What's the difference. Ask them to set up their own coinbase account and to give you 0.1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:14:48
True. Coinbase isn't bad for beginners though. Circle is good too.  Just that I worry about newcomers being turned off to bitcoin because they hear that the option they want to start with is wrong. Conflicting advice is bad. The onramp needs to be clear and conflict free.

production and earnings are not the same.

Coinbase is great... After you've verified a bank a credit card and waited 30 days. That setup sucks but it's worth it. You can buy bitcoin instantly and then use it for online purchases like on purse.io or other places that give you discounts for bitcoin. That way you don't get exposed to the price volatility.

It's cool that there are many services popping up helping people onboard to bitcoin. But why hasn't backpage internalized such a service?
Has anybody submitted their bitcoin-laden resume to backpage telling them "My bitcoin experience can help you get customers to pay for ads using bitcoin, simple and worry free. That's why you need to create a position for me?" If not, then there's a great idea for the unemployed.

Right, you're saying it's $20/hour to give a man a fish, but I'm saying is it's $20/hour to teach a man to fish.  After you help a backpager with a bitcoin purchase once, they can do it again without help.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:37:25
People tell me that they get 25% discounts all the time. The truth is that you have to wait a long time for a discount that high to get accepted, and it usually only works for first-time users trying to build reputation. First time users can only buy $50 or less.  Very often with those you will see the order come back several times because they were canceled for fraud.  Basically, you have to work for it to get a 25% or 30% discount.
If you want something ordered for you within a day or two and it's above $50 then I find that 19% discounts work pretty easily.
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:15:19

I'm relatively new to the service, but I stayed away from it for many months because of trolls on reddit posting about the risk of police banging on your door. I finally read up on it, found the information you just posted, and decided to give purse a try. Since then, basically all of my purchases have been through purse.io in one way or another.
I'm full of regret that I didn't ignore the trolls earlier and try using it sooner because I had a bunch of big expenses (I have a baby boy, and diapers are expensive) that I could have saved hundreds of dollars on if I had tried it sooner. Fucking trolls.

This bullshit has to stop.
The guys at purse created a business that could ONLY be possible with bitcoin. It's truly innovative: purse creates a market for otherwise illiquid assets (like Amazon credits from mechanical turk or corporate credit cards) while giving us a place to buy with bitcoin that doesn't instantly dump to fiat. So what do we do on reddit? We take a shit on some bitcoin-entrepreneurs hard work.

That's a very professional response. 
I was curious about the risks associated with helping on Paxful. The fear of scams like this has prevented me from joining up and helping backpagers to join the bitcoin ecosystem.
I think that if you guys provide the materials you mentioned to educate wannabe traders like myself about how to safely help out, then I might actually jump in. Ideally before Thursday.
What I really want to know, is how do the pro's keep from getting scammed? Do they do something with the gift card balance so that it can no longer be taken back? Like cash it out or buy something with it ASAP?
Can this happen to every kind of gift card on every platform? Like, if I buy Whole Foods gift cards through purse.io can that card be canceled before I get to buy groceries?

Not so fast. The article clearly says that the order only restrains the sheriff from further defunding efforts and does not require credit card companies to resume doing business with backpage.
What that really means is that he can't go after Coinbase or Circle for doing business with backpage. This is good news because now potential advertisers may not have to go to paxful/bitQuick/Localbitcoin/etc. to buy coins, but it will be safe for them to click "instant buy" and draw from a bank account.

yes. The default is for coinbase to do business with anyone with a wallet. If coinbase want to NOT do business with someone that takes work.

@_date: 2015-07-27 06:04:36
Correction. Coinbase has instant purchases. My usual routine with them is I buy a bunch of bitcoin, then make a purchase with it right away.
What you meant to say is that until your account is fully verified then they do not give you the bitcoins until the bank transfer is completed, and bank transfers take about 4 days. But if you provide a bank account and a credit card, then 30 days after your first purchase you are able to buy bitcoin instantly on coinbase.

Welcome to your new home.  :-)
I did the same thing a few years ago and I've never been happier. Silicon Valley rocks. In retrospect, New York is great too: I love it, I grew up there. But it's the second best city in the world. San Francisco is sssssooooo much more amazing.
Like others have pointed out in the thread, be prepared for sticker shock. Things out here are expensive as balls, but for a good reason. You get what you pay for.
The economy out here is off the rails.  If you can write a line of Java, Python, or Javascript you'll find a job in a startup within a week (big companies take longer). If you know Hadoop you'll have a job lined up before you can say "big data". Since you're new and since nobody else will tell you this: reject any programming job offer that pays less than $140,000 because they love to hire gullible newbies for cheap.
Not many places accept bitcoin anymore, they've all shut down their bitcoin ATMs and stuff. But, there are hella bitcoin jobs.
Take time to explore the city. Rent is cheaper in the sunset district, and the girls are fitter in the marina. Palo Alto and Mountain View are overpriced. Walk/bike the golden gate bridge, see Coit tower, but avoid Fishermans wharf. Oakland is not bad but you will be required to make fun of it. Everybody loves Berkley. South Bay is more family friendly, easy, and boring. Go to tech meetups but avoid VC events unless you're in BizDev. Please don't feed the homeless.

I feel like the reason you're right is that something like a VISACoin could create an inferior product with better marketing. Their marketing could focus on segments that target for example: soccer moms, a segment targeting retirees looking for coupons, and then a segment that targets teenagers playing games online. The current bitcoin community can **never** reach these segments. Here's why:
Look at yesterdays thread about women in bitcoin, the general sense is that "I don't care. It's their fault for not getting in on the bitcoin opportunity". Marketers for VisaCoin would eat our lunch because they would say "it's our job to get those people to use our product." And VisaCoin would get those customers, bitcoin wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:49:29
That misses the point entirely.
It doesn't matter whose fault it is that somebody chose to adopt or not adopt bitcoin. It matters that the price suffers as a result. There are also many other benefits to diversity. So we should not complain about posts that celebrate women in bitcoin, we can go even farther to be more welcoming to them.

That's AWESOME!
Welcome to bitcoin. It's all very new and exciting, but some of it is also still work in progress.
Personally. I really like coinbase.com for my bitcoin needs. If you need to accept bitcoin on your website/service then they offer merchant services, just like you're already used to with credit card processors, or paypal. etc.  Also, you can buy bitcoins through them from your bank account. It takes 30 days before they "trust" you, so you start off not being able to buy many coins. But after that, you can do "instant buy" for quite large amounts. It also makes buying online with bitcoin a one-click operation. The downside (as I'm sure others here will tell you) is that it's not anonymous. Other similar services include Circle, BitPay, and SnapCard.
If you want to buy bitcoins anonymously, then check out paxful.com and localbitcoins.com. On these sites can buy bitcoins using just about anything from paypal to amazon gift cards to bank transfers etc. Then load it into the wallets that people are telling you about here.
Other fun things to look at when learning about bitcoin:  
   * Purse.io: name your discount on all amazon purchases. Usually around 20%
   * gyft.com: giftcards for almost everything, and you get 3% off when buying with bitcoin.
   * Predictious.com: futures market, to bet on sports events or elections, with bitcoin.
   * rebittance.org: send money to friends/relatives abroad for a fraction of the price of western union or bank transfers.
   * ChangeTip.com: if you like a video on youtube, a comment on a social network, a picture somebody posted, etc. etc. then you can put bitcoins in their tip jar. Tips can be from pennies to many dollars. It's kind of addictive.
   * Many many more
Hope that helps :-)

Not personally. But I can share with you what I do when I go job hunting. I do the following:
    1) Find a cover letter template I like. Usually paragraph one is "I heard about you from here and would like to help you with that". Paragraph 2 is "Here is what I can do for you, and my experience has helped me achieve similar things in the past." paragraph 3 is "I'd love to hear back from you, here's my contact info". Short and to-the-point (where the point is "what's in it for the employer, and why the employer can trust you).
    2) I have family or friends give it a once-over to make sure that I don't say anything unintentional. Or sometimes, things that I write which I think are a good idea they look at and are like "that's lame, I wouldn't hire you if you submitted this".
    3) GRAMMAR AND SPELLING! I don't think a long-term subscription to grammarly is worth it, but if you're sending cover letters then grammarly is worth every penny. Sadly grammarly don't accept bitcoin (yet).
Hope that helps.

I think it's too early in their education process to expose them to such nuance. For now coinbase allows them instant purchase of btc and to purchase stuff that credit cards and PayPal don't. Win.

Hypothetically, a for-profit enterprise wouldn't invest $10Million on a customer base of 10 people world-wide. Those 10 people would die.
Hypothetically, if a product costs less in one market than it does in another (like the inhaler in this article) then there exists an opportunity for arbitrage. In this article, an artificial scarcity was created and arbitrage was only possible through illegal channels, like Silk Road.

Can't all that identity information be handled by onename.io or Keybase.io? Should be easier to Integrate with than to Implement it yourself. And those two did did a great job on implementation. 
At the very easiesr you can have a field with a link to a Keybase.io profile and then have the user sign a message using their Keybase.io key so that we know it's them. Then either we can copy and paste the signature into Keybase.io to verify it's them, or you can make your app call the Keybase.io API to verify it.

If it were true that it's mostly credit card fraud (which, it's not) then a few things are worth considering:
 * Poor Joe is insured against fraudulent charges, and gets his money back.
 * The supposed thousands of transactions on Purse being credit card fraud would have caught the attention of the FBI long ago. The staff would all be in jail. But they're not.
 * Either illiquid amazon credits or stolen credit cards, it's new money that comes into the bitcoin ecosystem raising the price. Compared to payment processors which dump to fiat, which lowers the price of bitcoin.
 * 20% creates a huge incentive for people to get into bitcoin.

International credit card orders make a killing on the exchange rate. Granted, I believe the customer has to pay those. Also, makes it very likely that the card will be cancelled due to fraud detection.
Then cashing the money out of the tipping service anywhere in the world would be another problem on the traditional banking system. The implementation cost of doing that in every country isn't practical, hence a company couldn't have been built using it.

You bought 0.22 bitcoins, the display said the transaction is 0.2 (not 0.200 right?) and the wallet shows 2.315. Were there any other transactions that deposited into the wallet afterwards (like a referral bonus?) It looks like the transaction has different displays at different decimal precisions (which, doesn't sound right, but is my best guess). There's more bitcoin in the wallet than you bought, so you probably have an additional transaction depositing into it.
With each transaction there is a tiny fee (usually a few pennies) so that may have taken a little bit out of the total that landed in your wallet. But, not 0.01 bitcoin. Maybe enough though to contribute to a change in rounding?
Those are my best guesses.

You do understand that it's hard to get cash in exchange for credit because the credit can be returned to you but the cash can't be returned to its owner when you do this. Same applies for digital cash. The best way to buy bitcoins is with Coinbase,  circle, or best of all get it with every paycheck using bitwage. For more anonymous options use localbitcoins.
If you're looking to use stolen cards to buy bitcoin then know that it's not just anonymity you're looking for, it's  dark Web services for theft. Because most of the bitcoin ecosystem is now following regulations to protect against that kind of fraud.
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:21:19
Not necessarily. Something else can happen that would lower demand... like volatility. :-p
Some of these factors could simply produce a spike in demand. I think MMM is a spike, and the FBI bitcoin auction is a spike. We may see the price lower again because those run their course. But Gemini and the EU tax ruling are long-term growth. They'll be joined by other long-term trends. Personally, I predict we'll stay in the 300s for a while. But I'm just as likely to be wrong as anybody else.

The problem with credit card or paypal purchases is that they can be canceled after the transaction is completed. This is called a "chargeback". 
Imagine I send you $100 on paypal and you're like "cool" and give me $100 in cash. Then I cancel it on paypal and I get my $100 back but there's no way for you to get your $100 in cash back anymore.... unless you dispute it with paypal (good luck). You're screwed. That's a chargeback. That's why you can't easily buy cash or bitcoin using paypal or credit cards.

PLease stop looking for a single smoking gun. Trends like this are usually  from a confluence of factors, rarely from one factor alone . 
Yes, MMM is driving up demand and is having an impact on the price.  But not a 50% increase in demand over a week or two. Gemini is increasing demand a little. The new EU tax ruling which treats bitcoin as a currency is also driving demand up. Bitcoin being featured  on the cover of 3 major publications at once is driving up demand. Capital controls in China are driving up demand. Etc. Each of these are tiny  tiny tiny. But with their powers combined they are the spike in price that we just saw.

I wonder why everybody here is so against private blockchains. It's a way for a consortium of financial institutions to have a fast federated ledger where they mix the security of the block chain while lower the necessary cost of mining by mixing it with the security of pre-screened and regulated mining pools (e.g. "mostly trustworthy actors following the rules"). It gives such consortia things that a shared database can't, as well as things that using the bitcoin blockchain can't (like, controlling the coin supply or limiting access, or controlling fees, etc.).
Maybe people think the blended security model is not as good as the pure security model, but business isn't about purity, it's about the bottom line. So maybe they don't like offsetting the cost of hashing by a non-mathamatical solution of governance. Or maybe they don't like that it would give bankers the controls which bitcoin promises to take away from them. Or maybe they just didn't think it through? I don't know.

 * Only order things that are not urgent. Like "oh, I'm gonna run out of toothpaste and paper towels next week, let's put it on Purse."
 * Support is annoyingly slow, but it does eventually solve your problems. Have patience and you'll be happy.
 * Gift cards are the most useful and the most problematic items on Purse. But I think it's worth the hassle to shop at Whole Foods for a 25% discount (it's like, a regular priced grocery store then).
 * Don't order several of the same thing at once because you won't always know which of your orders just arrived, and whose bitcoins to release.

Yes. Great. But here's a different way of looking at it. Most people are taught to ride a bike by somebody and they have training wheels.
If you start on something, you start with help. You can start bitcoin by having a service that holds your coins and doesn't accidentally delete them, or forgets to back them up. A service that abstracts away things like miners fees, or that can also send to email addresses in addition to confusing bitcoin addresses. Coinbase is like training wheels. 
Once they get the hang of bitcoin then they can take off the training wheels and go as far down the rabbit hole as they want. But for the love of Satoshi, don't scare people away from bitcoin by going full retard on them with USB sticks and backups etc.

Buy stuff with it. Grow the bitcoin ecosystem  while cashing out. 
You have things you want on amazon so use purse.io for a discount, or buy from  overstockcom.
You have vacations you want to take. Cheapair.com and Expedia. 
Help others. Changetip. Donate to charity. 
Go to the movies. Find restaurants that accept it.
This will keep businesses wanting to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:30:12
Yeah. Discounts can be the killer app of bitcoin.
I can't wait for *everything* to have a purse-like interface, where you can buy anything in the world at a big discount for bitcoin. I mean, we can already buy takeout, hotels, airfare, movie tickets etc. for bitcoin, but imagine getting all those things and more at a 25% discount using bitcoin.   Epic win.

This article sounds pretty close to the vision of people working in the private blockchains space. Nobody in corporate-land talks about the whole political/freedom/liberty argument but rather about the application of bitcoin technology to their existing inter-bank clearing problems. The security of the blockchain is respected but a blended model is seen as more cost-efficient: e.g. contractually pre-screen your miners to lower the necessary cost of mining. 
And the bitcoin revolution will be driven by corporate interest, just like the Linux revolution that came before.

I almost couldn't believe my eyes. It's thousands of people who are being tricked into "30% returns per month" simply by "mutual helping" or some B.S.   and in order to put money into the system they need either Bitcoin or PerfectMoney.  And these regular schmoes are buying bitcoin.  I've watched a few of these videos (for science) and nobody was complaining or saying "look out this part is hard". No, they are all like "just click here, buy bitcoins there, and then send it to the scam by copying and pasting here". All of them.  WOW! Bitcoin *is* easy.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:08:36
:-) Thank you.
You're right, in general, but if I may however nitpick one tiny thing on your response (sorry, can't help myself). The "private blockchain" implementations I've seen being developed in Silicon Valley not about one company like Microsoft setting up their own blockchain and controlling it from the top down for their own use. It's about a company (like Microsoft) selling blockchain solutions for a group of companies who kind-of-sort-of trust-each-other-but-not-really. These companies in the group each run the solution they purchased, and thus share a ledger between themselves which allows them to clear inter-company transactions with an efficiency that they currently can't match. And it allows them sell the clearing service to their partners.  But like I said, everything is you said is spot on.

This is the right answer.  the billboard *is* the research that people are doing. You can judge them for it and wish it were otherwise but it doesn't change the fact. The advertisement is the research material.
your original point is valid and missed the point. Branding bitcoin makes people think Bitcoin is one company. Instead of advertising the individual bitcoin companies. Social media didn't take off because ads for social media, it took off because ads for Facebook. Nobody advertises "Credit Card" they advertise Visa or Mastercard.  But you know, you could have said that in a way that people would be more receptive to instead of calling them stupid. :-p

It is however a solution to other real world problems. I have a problem with the outrageous prices at Whole Foods. Bitcoin solves the problem by letting me buy Whole Foods Gift cards at 25% off, which makes Whole Foods the price of a regular store.

Tails is an important project. But it's not important when showing people how to get started with bitcoin. No live boot is important to using bitcoin.
I mean, if they wanted to get started on political activism, or the dark web, then yeah show them tails or other live-boots. But not if they just want to learn about bitcoin. Circle or Coinbase. Period.

I'm really amazed by MMM.  It's like normal dumb schmoes that are being taken by this, but in order to put money into the system they have to buy bitcoin. They're not bitcoiners from and they're not libtards or moon-rocket guys. They're all new to the system, and they're buying bitcoin like it's no problem.  Amazing. Bitcoin *is* easy.
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:11:35
haha. It doesn't even have decent grammar.
Right it's a pyramid. But for people to buy in they have to either buy bitcoin or PerfectMoney. My point is that these people who are getting into the ponzi, have never heard of bitcoin before, and they're buying bitcoin and paying into the MMM ponzi. No problems. Nobody is like "I don't get it" about bitcoin, they're all like "it's easy, just do this, and then link it to your MMM account. done".
I'm very re-assured about the ease of use of bitcoin after looking at MMM... though, I'm not very re-assured about humanity after looking at it. :-p

Right right, I don't have sympathy either for people that fall for a ponzi and lose their, ahem, "investment", they know they're looking for the greater fool.  But my point is simpler than that. In order for them to participate in this obvious ponzi, they have to do so with bitcoin. And they're not having any problems from what I can see. The point is "look at MMM from a distance to see how easy bitcoin actually is".

True but not everybody is securing themselves against the NSA. Some are just satisfied to secure themselves against corporate big data, and against malicious hackers. For that, Tutanota with a second "insecure" channel is more than adequate.

It never occurred to me to cancel a transaction after somebody ordered the product. Does that cancel the Amazon transaction? Or does the buyer have to manually cancel it? What if they don't log in for a day or two and I receive the order after the transaction was canceled?

There's an app for that. Several actually. Check out the list of featured apps built on the Coinbase API  and you'll find several tax apps. They spit out your tax filing and you're done.

Coinbase are available in lots of countries. They're an easy on-ramp. Non-coinbase countries often have localbitcoins and local exchanges.
and ... yeah seriously, WTF is up with the tails USB. It's important, but it has nothing to do with getting started with bitcoin. This is why we're not hitting moon-rocket adoption. Because we over-engineer an nerd out on useless stuff instead of keeping things simple for new users.

You can still use PGP inside of Tutanota using Mailvelope, or old-school copy/paste from commandline (no joke, there are still assholes who recommend this). But seriously, Mailvelope rocks.
Tutanota have an option for "emails" that are really just links which require a password to decrypt in the browser. It's encrypted up until the very second a recipient enters the password. You can send encrypted emails to people who've never heard of PGP. Just gotta send the password via a different channel. The user replies in the encrypted page, and it's encrypted on the page and sent to you. Sounds pretty good to me.

Isn't this an educational opportunity? We can show them how to buy things online with bitcoin, or how to invest or gamble with it? Maybe then it doesn't all get dumped on the market by MMMers who cash out.

"Simple"  Yeah. That's the word.
I work as a product owner so I'm always simplifying processes. Here's my advice. Just walk them through circle or coinbase. Done. They have bitcoin. Period.

For me, it's a hobby. I also have hobbies like playing Settlers of Catan. Why would I want to get people started on playing Settlers? Or I like Game of Thrones. Why would I want to get people into that? Or I like Hillary Clinton, why would I get people excited to vote for her.  etc. etc. 
If you love something you get joy out of helping people get interested in your hobbies.

They're buying bitcoin for the first time. It's pretty amazing to see their videos. I didn't see anybody say "Ok, this was hard", or "watch out this is confusing" when talking about how to set up a bitcoin account. They were just like "yup, click here, copy and paste there. Done".
Bitcoin is only one of their payment methods though. I think PerfectMoney and bank transfers are more popular.

MasterCard and Visa don't put big ads advertising "Credit Card". They  advertise Mastercard and Visa. This ad is the equivalent of "credit card" instead we need more ads from Coinbase, Circle, Gemeni, or even Purse.io.

Can we please STFU already with the "stolen cards" meme about Purse? It's annoying as hell to keep hearing the same not-funny joke about it.
You wanna talk about lingo that scares away users, then accusing everything a scam or fraud (when you don't know shit about it) is certainly scaring away new users. So please, please, please stop with the retarded purse meme. Thank you.

Was not always like this. When coinbase and circle first came out they hadn't implemented all these controls. It was easy to sign up. Today once you sign up It's very easy to use,  but the sign up is is a bitch.
The 25% markup from localbitcoins is the price you pay for anonymity. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:27:34
I would imagine that's hard for the same reason that buying bitcoin with credit cards is hard. The vendor is exposed to charge back riak.
There are ways to buy things for other people and those people give you the value of the purchase in bitcoin. That puts the fraud risk on the vendor. For example purse.io  . I'm not aware of anything that pushes the risk elsewhere.
