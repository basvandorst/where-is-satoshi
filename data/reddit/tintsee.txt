Fees can't ever be zero in the face of **unbounded** demand (Greg Maxwell's words, not mine) because assuming a block size limit exists, be it 1MB or 1EB, there will be more demand for transactions than there is available block space.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:17:00
But how could you have exabyte block sizes without creating hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, each transaction requiring a fee (demand is unbounded, and unbounded is a larger unit of measure than 1 EB surely)?
Even assuming the fee were a single satoshi, it would easily add up to 10 BTC or more in block rewards (and potentially much, *much* more). With so much demand for transactions, that would add up to a lot of BTC buying pressure, wouldn't it?

In [Capacity increases for the Bitcoin system]( Greg Maxwell claims "the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is **unbounded**".


I'm not defending BU, but if you believe Greg Maxwell's theory, then it actually wouldn't take a "galaxy": stock, options, and futures traders usefully embedding their data in the Bitcoin blockchain could very well take up that much block space. If Bitcoin had the need for exabyte blocks, Bitcoin would certainly be a planetary wonder, and with that much demand for transactions, the price of BTC would have to be stratospheric.

This subjective hoopla crap doesn't matter in the *least bit* to the economics of mining. Give Bitcoin's competitor exabytes worth of fee-paying transactions, and Bitcoin will become irrelevant. There will be no one but die hard fans securing Bitcoin's blockchain with whatever paltry hashing power can be scraped together from Esperanto speaking idealists.


It's time to get over the fact that nodes are unpaid. If exabyte blocks are what it takes to dominate global currency markets, then prepare for onchain scaling or prepare to become the Esperanto of currency.

 &gt; No blocksize increase can accommodate such a demand unless it's run on a handful of super-computers
Handful is very doubtful. Satoshi Nakamoto suggested Bitcoin would scale to mainstream popularity with clustered full nodes run by specialists. Startups commonly deploy multiple remote machines to serve high traffic websites, so running a Bitcoin full node farm isn't out of the question, even assuming BIP101.


Let me guess: you've never compared a permissionless blockchain to a distributed DB. Let me cut to the chase for you: there is no one in charge of the permissionless blockchain, anyone can join and leave the network as they please by permanently depositing arbitrary data into the blockchain's coffers, and this is exactly what [Counterparty]( achieves. Let's see you do permissionless InTrade or permissionless E-trade *with a bank*.


Speaking of geniuses, how about Satoshi Nakamoto, who said in no uncertain terms that Bitcoin should scale to mainstream popularity by having specialists run all the full nodes in datacenters.


That's a great plan in a world where Bitcoin has no competition. Unfortunately, Bitcoin has competition and so investors can't afford to take your word over Satoshi's vision.

Chicken and the egg. How would we achieve exabytes worth of fee-paying transactions without extremely high real world demand to use Bitcoin?
Bitcoin would be no more "centralized" than the *internet* in this case. And Bitcoin would *need* to be an internet scale currency because in the free market, other coins would want to become internet scale and in so doing they would grow larger than Bitcoin, usurping Bitcoin's network effect and destroying any logical reason to hold BTC as opposed to some other coin that would be rapidly appreciating in value.

LN doesn't require Segwit, though. If everyone runs a full node, as envisioned by Greg Maxwell, LN would work *just fine*. Perfectly well, in fact. It'll be even *more* decentralized, because you don't need a third party to tell you when the counterparty to your LN transaction is cheating you out of your money.
It's truly a match made in heaven.
Of course, Bitcoin investors may not be interested in running full nodes on home desktop... And they may also not like the fact that determistic wallets can't restore LN transactions without saving *something* to disk, and then it's *your problem* to make sure you always have those receipts with you otherwise your money is gone. Which isn't how any of the good wallets work today.

You're overcomplicating it. If Blockstream's investors had instead traded $76M for BTC, they would've at least broken even by now, if not made millions of dollars. But because they broke rule  of Bitcoin, now they're forcing BlockstreamCoin's philosophy on the market. They're just trying to do it under the guise of protecting full nodes on desktop, which has never been why Bitcoin has had value. All because they broke rule

This is a problem for Bitcoin because bitcoin is a currency built on a blockchain secured by miners. If exabyte blocks will be full of fee-paying stock trading transactions, and Bitcoin chooses not to incorporate those blocks, its miners will be paid less than miners of a system that does not forego those blocks.
Since Bitcoin would not have nearly as much security or network effect as its exabyte block free-market competitors following Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin full nodes being run in datacenters, that would doom Bitcoin to obscurity; consequently, Bitcoin would become the *Esperanto* of currency. In theory, it would be the best currency, but *in reality*, it would be pretty damn worthless.

Who said anything about competing with VISA? Do you realize Ethereum is *regularly* doing 20% of Bitcoin's daily transaction volume? And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Imagine what would happen if we were turning down literal exabytes worth of fee paying transactions out of a misguided sense that we were "preserving" the value of Bitcoin. **Wake up, Bitcoin investors**. Currency doesn't work that way...

Satoshi's vision wasn't a "different" view until a bunch of assholes poured $76 million into breaking rule  of bitcoin, which is investing in products built on top of Bitcoin instead of investing in BTC itself.
Blockstream's investors are $76,000,000 in the red and they need to break even, which as anyone in Bitcoin should be able to guess, is really fucking hard to pull off. And useful idiots on this sub are too fucking clueless to even realize it. Why do you think they're going against Satoshi's vision?
They're trying to hijack Bitcoin and turn it into BlockstreamCoin, and all you can do is tell Roger Ver to make *his* own coin. Well sorry, I guess we wouldn't want to rudely impede on Blockstream's investors.

Once you make a confirmed Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain, you can shut off your computer, then come back to check on your data 20 years later and it will still be there without you doing anything.
In addition, you can start up or shut down a full node and connect the node to the Bitcoin network without asking anyone for permission.
Distributed DBs fail on both counts. Conversely, **anyone can join or leave a permissionless blockchain at will**.


That sounds suspiciously like vaporware, but regardless, if Bitcoin can't compete against digital currencies managed by banks, then that's a huge problem for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:50:51
Oh *sure*, laugh it up. But while Greg Maxwell herds powerless idealists to a cultish slaughter by competitive market forces, *Roger Ver* is defending Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin's mainstream success by putting his money where his mouth is and funding *real* onchain scaling innovation.

While Satoshi wasn't omniscient, I'd take SN's opinion on scaling over Greg Maxwell's any day of the week and twice on Sunday. This is only going to become more and *more* apparent to Bitcoin investors as Bitcoin's competition ramps up. Investors are going to do the math here and they're going to realize most people don't run full nodes, that nodes are enterprise-driven today and that's at a ridiculously tiny block size of 1MB. What do you want us to do, slash it to 300kB?
Full nodes are NOT going to be run by the majority of investors of ANY digital currency. It won't even be half of them, it will be a tiny fraction of mostly enterprise users, and if you insist on denying this practical reality of how digital currencies work then it is not going to end well for Bitcoin.
We know how to scale Bitcoin mainnet to mainstream popularity, and have known as much since SN laid out the plans in the early days. Whether Greg Maxwell's reasons for standing in the way of that are good or based on his massive conflicts of interest with Blockstream, the bottom line is he IS standing in the way of that, and this is going to see its day of reckoning on the market, probably through competitive pressure because everything in this system has ground to a halt.
