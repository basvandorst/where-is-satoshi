Roger is a good debater when it comes to debating-as-a-sport rules and techniques. He is very good at making the opposing persons points seem like his own and blunting undeniable facts not in his favour.
 That aside, he give his true motives and thoughts away in every interview/debate I have watched with him present.

What is he trying to take from you?

Yes it is. Regardless of how you pay, the BTC amount is held by the middleman until that payment has been received successfully.
However, do bot use PayPal or any other payment method that can be reversed after the fact.
