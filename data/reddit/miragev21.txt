Well in what context are you even presenting this question? It’s like saying “how’s the internet different from religion?” or “how’s telecommunication different from religion?”. It just seems like quite an odd thing to ask. You can find similarities and differences in almost anything if you look hard enough.

Why did you open “several” tickets? One is enough. It just causes further backlogs for their support team and reduces their response time.

I can’t really comment on the CoinCheck hack as I don’t know much about how seriously they take their security. I know Coinbase have a dedicated security team though. Things were a bit different when Mt.Gox was hacked as it was one of only a few big exchanges available and it was run by a couple of adolescents. Regardless, there really shouldn’t be the need for a discussion on how safe Coinbase is. Coinbase is an exchange. Not a place to store crypto... that’s what offline wallets are for. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:27:57
Regarding their high fees; you know you can just use their trading platform GDAX and pay hardly anything in fees? Not sure why you would use Coinbase but not GDAX considering you just use the same log-in details and your money is available across both platforms.

You know it’s not the SegWit2x fork right? It shares no similarities at all with the original planned SegWit2x fork. Different blocksize, different block time, different developers etc.

To be honest I think most big exchanges available in the UK already pretty much gather the info required for this as part of the verification process.

There is absolutely nothing to suggest any sort of “rejection of bitcoin” in this article or any other articles posted on the topic of the uk regulating exchanges. Pretty much all of the big exchanges used in the UK are already compliant.

You can use a transaction accelerator such as  basically it’s a mining pool which will push through a certain number (I think it’s 100) of specific transactions per hour into the next block they mine. Make sure you submit your transaction ID literally on the hour or other people will beat you to it. I’ve used it in the past and i only had to wait ~1 hour rather than potentially days!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:13:13
Plenty of buying opportunity ahead then :) HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:47:47
What btc/kB did you use as the fee? If it’s over 0.0001btc/kB then try  .... basically it’s a mining pool that will get your transaction confirmed in the next block. They only permit a certain number of transactions per hour so try pretty much on the hour and it should go through.

I’ll copy and paste a reply I made to another user the other day.
“I’m not sure you’re right about BCash being the real Bitcoin; considering the more centralised nature of BCash (from its big blocks) and the solution to scaling it brings being only temporary. The benefits from 2nd layer scaling solutions such as LN outweigh just a bigger block size in my opinion (which should be implemented on BTC and LTC next year).Which is why BTC is supported by people like Szabo and Charlie Lee rather than criminals and liars like Roger Ver and Craig Wright who have a very different agenda.”
Ultimately it’s your choice.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:05
Better reduce your 8mb blocksize then :) 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:28:33
Because that’s when coinbase releases everyone’s BCash which they are going to dump straight away ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:33:02
Yes they’re both legitimate. Coinbase is probably the easiest way to buy BTC although the fees are a little high. I live in the UK and have used them quite a lot in the past.
If you plan on buying a decent amount then it’s worth moving your crypto out of the exchange to a hardware wallet such as a ledger or trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:39:14
Be aware that it can take a couple of days to get verified. So it may be worth signing up now if you haven’t already and are planning on buying.

What he meant was that the idea of being “rich” is relative to an individual’s circumstances. Eg someone living in a 3rd world country may very well be financially rich within their community from 0.1 BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:40:49
That programme is terrible.. It’s titled “How to Get Rich Quick”. I’m from the UK and was casually watching Channel 4 and when that programme came on and mentioned crypto currency I immediately turned over to save me getting frustrated. It’s the kind of programme that appeals to people who are absolutely clueless about everything.

@_date: 2019-08-12 13:21:13
Back when nobody knew about BTC in 2011 he was calling for $10k+ in a few years and eventually $100k+. To be fair he’s generally been pretty good at gauging where it’s headed.

A short bear is usually something like a Koala bear or a Malayan Sun Bear. When people talk about a “long bear”they are usually referring to a Brown Bear or Kodiak Bear. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:12:19
Not really given that one of the benefits of crypto is that it allows users not to be forced to put trust in 3rd parties. Therefore if people hold their crypto on exchanges rather than in cold storage and things like this happen then it’s tough luck given the opportunity exists to protect yourself from it. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:48:14
“Dr” Craig is actually a really stupid guy. Have you read any of his “papers”? Pure plagiarism - he shows very very little understanding of cryptography or computer science, and when questioned about any of it he can never directly answer the question. Him claiming to be Satoshi is an insult to Satoshi’s intelligence. I seriously cannot believe people are still falling for Craig Wright’s blatant lies. Mind boggling.

Because BCash is an alt coin backed by conmen (Roger Ver, Craig Wright, Jihan etc) created essentially to attack Bitcoin. They claim it’s scalability is improved, which it is in the medium term with its 8mb blocksize. But big improvements are planned for bitcoin in terms of Lightning Network to implement 2 layer solutions to address current scalability issues.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:15:57
So? Bitcoin is a store of value.. if hashrate shifts to bitcoin gash for a while, so be it. Let's face it, we can be patient and wait a little longer for transactions to go through if we have to (without panicking). Bitcoin will remain decentralised (unlike the other coin) and will continue to rule crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:20:30

Answers are yes, yes and yes respectively. I’ve been pretty much up to date with his antics since that first interview he had in 2014 with the BBC where he couldn’t prove he was satoshi and said he didn’t want any fame or attention...yet he’s still here..So my opinion has been formed (and grown stronger) over the course of 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:51:15
It’s not going exponentially higher though is it because the amount of BTC you’ve got is the same. The value is just increasing at the same rate as the value of BTC is increasing..(unless you’re buying and adding more Bitcoin).

The dumb money won’t, no. But the smart money will, as we’ve seen previously. I’m not in denial about anything, I don’t necessarily think we’re at the bottom. But I believe the risk/reward on a multi-year outlook is pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:54:37
No, I generally mean the people who can see the market cycles for what they are and start building positions when others are in capitulation/anger/despair phase. “Smart money” and “dumb money” are generally well understood terms in trading.

Pretty normal market cycle for BTC to be honest. Seems crazy to me that people seem to find this price action scary considering it’s been the norm for BTC over the past decade. We’re entering text book accumulation zone now/next few months. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:12:13
Looking at the timeline of his past posts it looks like he fomo’d in somewhere around 13th Dec, so ~$17k. Then it appears he sold around the 17th Jan taking a loss of ~33%. I think he’s quite bitter about it now and trying to make himself feel better by spamming us with FUD. Not a cool look!

So Bitcoin goes to 20k and the price drops when a few people cash out? At that point only those very same short sighted people I referred to in my previous response complain like you are doing right now. 
Your comment could also be applied to stocks. Calling BTC a Ponzi is just stupid.

How would a government confiscate something that is decentralised? The only way they can confiscate someone’s bitcoin is if the person willingly gave them their private key.

Who cares what anyone else says? People have their own brain to make their own minds up don’t they?... I was just stating that this market cycle isn’t out of character for BTC, as has been demonstrated time and time again over the last ten years..Generally speaking, people who came into crypto to make a quick buck will get scared at times like this because they lack understanding of the fundamentals and can’t fathom a long term outlook over mid term price action.

Bakkt allows institutions to legitimately invest in Bitcoin futures. Bakkt uses physically settled futures rather than cash settled futures (like CME and CBOE) so for each contract that is bought/sold it means the equivalent amount of BTC is actually bought or sold from the market, having a direct influence on supply and demand.

Yeah. There is a lot of evidence to suggest Nick Szabo is Satoshi - perhaps in collaboration with Hal Finney.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:31:54
Well I’m sure that’s what people also said in 2010,  2011, 2015 etc when the same thing happened then. The only reason normal people get scared with these kind of boom and bust bitcoin cycles is because they look at it on a linear scale rather than logarithmic. But being realistic, in my opinion we won’t see big parabolic moves like last December until 2021/2022ish (after next halving). 
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:56:46
Not in my opinion. Seeing as the environment is entirely different now and it’s gained a massive amount more traction since then. Back then people legitimately believed “this is the end of bitcoin”. Now the infrastructure behind crypto is growing much quicker than back then and let’s not forget that sure, the general public have heard of BTC now but they still don’t have a good understanding of the actual fundamentals behind it and what it offers over fiat. That will still take time. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:01:38
Yeah I understand what you are saying. But just to clarify the risk was massive to buy back then. nobody knew it would take off like it has and gain the adoption and attention it’s gained now. The only difference is that you could buy a greater chunk of the total supply for the same amount of money. If it’s going to zero then then the amount purchased is irrelevant. 
Like I mentioned before, yeah everybody has heard of bitcoin now. But I still think very few people in the general public actually understand it and how it’s a much more sound store/transfer of wealth over fiat. Considering it’s fixed, deflationary supply over time. 
It’s still a very immature, small and illiquid market. So we’ll just have to wait and see how it all pans out. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:13:35

To be honest it says “eventually” not by end of the year. Also, it says cryptocurrencies, not bitcoin.. So a trillion dollar market cap isn’t that far fetched given the total market cap was at 800 billion in December/Jan.
