TailsOS is better suited for crypto wallet than Ubuntu. It also runs on a USB stick (which can be plugged in any computer). Persistent storage is fully encrypted so if you have a good passphrase, nobody can bruteforce into your OS long term memory (seeds). I have multiple copies of the same USB stick lying around many places and losing one doesn't stress me at all because of that encryption.

It's also crazy that most of all Canadian's insured mortgages are insured by the government through the CMHC ([ In a crisis, most loans that would default are the insured ones. The only solution for Canada in that situation is to print and lend more to keep the fiat monetary supply train going.

Largest bubble since 2008? It took 30 days for BTC to go from 4.5k (in Nov 2017) to 19k (in Dec 2017). Economic bubbles don't take 30 days to inflate. It was just a 30days hype and low supply on exchanges. Almost no-1 bought at the peak. 
Want a real bubble? Check out the Canadian real estate market.
In August, the price for 1 BTC will never have been below $3200 for the past 2 years.

I don't know if what you want to say is: 4% is a lot compared to fiat. Anyways, just want to let you know that money supply growth for Fiat is above 3.8% (the actual BTC inflation rate). And next year in may it's being reduced to 1.8%.

Bitcoin's uses are linked to it's only mission: making a block of data every 10 minutes.
People can then use it as they are pleased. For me, my use is to liberated my assets from the inflationary Fiat system. Hoarding is my usage.

New money is created out of thin air everytime local banks make a loan. It's the basic principle of fractional reserve. Technically, no they don't "print" it. But since only 2-3% of all fiat is in paper, the printing part is almost meaningless. They do issue new money which affect the majority of the monetary supply and inflation. By law, they need small capital reserves thought.

It protects the consumer which is good. I got "frauded" by a car rental company last month. Told visa the story and the company now has to give proof that he was right about it. That's something you can't have with BTC (for payments). I love BTC as a store of value and money sending overseas but for my daily purchases? Credit card is much better.
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:14:29
It's not really governments' budgets that make Fiat worthless.  It's the monetary inflation (fractional reserve, QE, etc) which is controlled by central banks. Most central banks are not controlled by the governments.

Once two or three banks get hacked and can't repay back the BTC, people will realize hodling themselves is more secure. Not your keys not your coins. The bank would need to give a very attractive interest rate for people to deposit funds in their vaults. And since they now can't loan more than they have, it will become a very unlucrative business compared to Fiat old times where they could loan a least 9 times more value than they actually have.

Is that statement correct: Over the long term, only 12.5 BTC per 10 minutes needs to be purchased and hodled (not funded to shortsellers) for the price to hold it's current level. $43k USD per 10 minutes is tiny considering there are more than 7 billions people sharing this Earth.

Install TailsOS on a USB stick. It is a Linux distro focused on privacy and unhackability (unless you ignore warnings and do stupid stuff). It's fully open source unlike some hardware wallets. Electrum is built in. You can get encrypted storage. Get multiple copies and use a strong encryption for your persistent storage. That way, even if you lose your stick, the finders can't brute Force into your storage. You can give a stick to family members or even hide one in the ground as backups in case you lose yours.

You do write down seeds with Electrum. Not doing so would be stupid.
- install tailsos on multiple USB keys with storage encrypted with strong password
- create wallet on Electrum and write down seed. Put the paper sheet somewhere safe.
- If USB  and USB  and USB  are corrupt (or if you forgot encryption password for tails), use seed to restore wallet. 
That method is much safer than your ledger imo

Yep, it's hard to transfer. Hard to verify. Hard to split. Somewhat hard to hide. And Central banks already own tons of gold which they manipulate at ease with paper contracts. Soon enough, scientists will find cheap and fast ways to create gold from other metals. Gold can be easily confiscated. Just look at what the UK did with Venezuela's gold pile.

If cryptography is destroyed you have much bigger problems than Bitcoin. Think about sending a $100000 wire of the internet and then suddenly the recipient has changed to a Bangladesh dude. Without cryptography this connected world is doomed and you better buy guns and food for your shelter. Saying BTC is going to be hacked by quantum computers is like saying your bank, your government, your fiat, your stocks, your emails, your ...... , They all going to be hacked before or at the same time Bitcoin will.

I think sending data to satellites is much more complicated and hard to scale. GPS for example is passive and the satellites only send data and your phone does trigonometry with the signals. With the current blockstream setup, there could be millions of listeners and it wouldn't cost a dime more to operate. For someone to send data, he could just get a SAT Internet hotspot for 1k$ and the problem is solved.

Same as Gold (which is not used as a currency). If gold was priced only in it's "inherent" value (computer chips etc), then it would be worth 10-25$ per once. Most of valuable things around us are based only on demand. Bitcoin is no different.

this \^. USD pegged coins are very centralized so easily censored by Gvnt agencies. Let's say i send 10 M stablecoin to ISIS. It won't be long before the US gvnt closes (and even seize) all USD dominated bank accounts for the company that issues that coin. That would make your stablecoin pegged to nothing.
Also, most shitcoins operate from a company that holds most of it's supply and/or it's control. That is the main reason why BTC is so great and powerful. There is no company, no king, no nothing behind it, except code and concensus.

Cash is like 2% of supply. The effect would be minimal. The most of money creation is made from banks (with fractional and loans) and the best way to make them loan more new currency is by paying them to do so (instead of charging them a low fee of 2% which is the situation right now)
Edit : In a 100% cash society, your suggestion would work perfectly.

Lol, inflation is the main stock market drive. Look at what most countries did in '08 -&gt; '18: they printed a shit load of money with Quantitative easing. Look at the returns for the past decade.

When you buy Bitcoin you don't pay for the Mining costs. 
The only choice a miner has is: Mine or Not mine. They can't raise the Tx fee because they aren't profitable anymore. They just unplug and wait for better days. You seem to think Bitcoin mining is like a big company that would charge customers more because their bottom line is too low. Think again. Bitcoin is decentralized as fuck. No decentralized asset has ever existed before Bitcoin. You should try it.

If BTC completely replace currencies, the price of 1 BTC will fluctuate on usefully things like: 
- guns and bullets
- food
- shelter
- slaves
- energy (oil, electricity)
BTCUSD would be irrevalent unless paid cash (paper can burn and keep you warm).
Edit: to answer your question, I think 1 BTC would be the value of everything 333 people need for an entire lifetime (7Bpeople/21M BTC).

You should read more about Bitcoin before making such statements.
It's the user that decides what fees they put on a Tx. Miners obviously include Tx with highest fees in the blocks they find. 
More people using the main Bitcoin chain = more Tx in the mempool = if you want your Tx to be blocked fast you can put a higher fee.
So no, fees don't go up because miners aren't profitable but because there are more Tx on the mempool.
Higher fees = higher adoption on the main chain.
That's why Bcash has such low Tx fee, no1 uses their centralized coin.

What I made is an encrypted USB stick. One family member has the stick, the other has the encryption key. Neither know the Identity of the other.
If they lose it and didn't ask me for a replacement, too bad for them. In case of death, they have the instruction of asking people I loved for the missing part. They will then have everything to decrypt the seeds and other stuff I left in there. If one of the family member dies before me, I just replace it's role with another one. If my will change (new wife etc) I just move the BTC to a new wallet and make a new USB stick.

Because you want to buy BTC with FIAT which is centralized and controlled as fuck. So controlled that they want to know what happens on exchanges (even the peer2peer like localbitcoins...

The dollars or bolivars that you own, the supply is inflated by the banks. Yes you can withdraw it in cash, but overtime you will lose buying power at a rate that is unknown and can be extremely high if things go bad (pakistan, iran, argentina, etc). With BTC, the supply inflation rate is fixed and halves every 4 years making it scarce. I was a Fiat investor in '08 so now I don't trust banks and gvnmts handling my money supply. You can give them trust, I don't really care. BTC is a revolution because it is the first real competition to Fiat. 
Also, good luck sending that 250k to someone in a remote or sanctioned country. Bitcoin is permissionless. I can send a billion $ in value anytime to anyone. No one can stop me.

Past generations were lucky for others reasons (discovery of new land/continents, credit expansion, industrialization, etc).

I personally think that it's bad to specify what people should be doing with Bitcoin. Some are investors, some are collectors, some are making purchases, ... Everyone finds his usage.

People that are not satisfied with the result can fork or sell for another crypto that suits them better.

Best answer. 
When you get to 1 Bitcoin you want 2.
When you get to 5 you want 10.
Then at 15 why not go for 21.
Why stop at 21 when you can have 42! Presently, only 414 000 individuals or businesses can reach that amount at the same time.

There will be less BTC on the sell side. The buy side (USD) will stay the same. Supply and demand. Less BTC for sale for the same demand. Price goes up. Think about it to the extreme: If there was only 1 BTC on sale of Bitfinex but the amount of USD bidding stays the same. What would happen to that Bitcoin price?
