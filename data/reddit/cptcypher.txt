If you hold them through the forking you'll simply have coins on both sides of the fork.
However be prepared for the possibility value of the Bitcoin tanking, if you need that money consider holding it in fiat. Although if you buy back in after the fork you'll also need to choose a chain.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:23:42
Yep, sorry my bad.

First off, thank you for taking time to talk with us in this thread. As you say groupthink is real.


Multiple Bitcoins? Multiple main chains? I'm sceptical, this could only be achieved with merge mining or a different PoW for both main chains. A split of the market cap would also happen as another $6 billion of market cap could not materialize out of thin air, which means there is major economic incentive against this.


It's not the only answer sure, but it is an easy win. Capacity increase without block size increase and as a soft fork. An easy win, and great first step in scaling.
I don't think anyone disagrees with you about the the need for a hard fork sooner or later. Adam Back proposed 2-4-8, for lightning to scale to everyone in the world it is estimated we'll need a blocksize of 133Mb. 


I understand what you're saying, but I thought development was working much better when we were all in one team.


I think he's just making an analogy to a small clown car packed with an impossible amount of clowns, that it's impossible to pack everything into a primary layer. I don't think he's trying to say anyone is a clown or anything derogatory.

Well the counter arguments carry little merit, so what am I supposed to conclude? 
People are literally saying fuck the core devs, fuck blockstream and that the devs should be fired, I think this mentality can cloud someone's judgement.
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:27:35
You do realize there are sha256 altcoins?
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:07:05
Maybe you're right and there isn't going to be two coins. After all there's massive financial incentive to prevent this as both child coins would tank badly and at the very minimum divide the market cap.
But the idea of the "losing" side (which will probably be core by zerg rush) "simply joining" is even more [unlikely]( Also [this](
But why quit when you can fork? Why quit when you can *bitcoin* Bitcoin? For many it's not just about personal profit; it's this elusive dream of a P2P digital cash where nodes are run on personal hardware completely out of reach of the state; this gives these individuals extra endurance.

It's not that simple. The problem is not the type of POW, the problem is mining pools i.e. one pool one vote, rather than one CPU one vote.


Thank you for letting us know your honest thoughts.
Valuing efficiency higher than decentralization is a belief I see emerging in the Bitcoin community over the last year. My guess is that it is due to the changing demographics of Bitcoin as more mainstream comes on board.
I'm sorry man, without decentralization Bitcoin loses everything. Your suggestion of the core devs moving to a more decentralized altcoin is eerily prophetic.

Hmmmm tough choice, I think I'll go with developers as they specialize in the technical side of Bitcoin, they do the testing, research and modelling, I defer to them although it's my responsibility to read the literature they put out
This is like saying Science and natural law is magically rewritten when there's a "superconsensus" (what's that like 110% consensus?) that includes every type of laymen/workers/politicians/businessmen
The idea that development in centralized is a new meme, anyone can write code and submit it, you just need to be a competent and be able to back up you code with reason, the devs all coddle together because that's what you do in an open source project, it's collaborative. Even Gavin and Jeff are part of Core.

Yep, when it came out I naively thought it would end the split since everyone gets more of what they want.


First it was it was that it had to be deployed as a hard fork. Then Luke-jr figured out how to deploy it as a soft fork.
Then they said that it was too complex compared to a 2MB hard fork, which is [not true](
Now they are saying it requires way more testing, even though it's been in testing for a while now and is less risky then a hard fork, especially a contentious hard fork.
I think they really just don't want to accept a solution from Core.

Bitcoin's true value is in doing things other systems simply can't do, this comes from it's decentralized architecture.
I believe the dark net economy and non-state manipulated deflationary store of value (and with that speculation on the deflation) are the two greatest uses of the currency so far, by far.
We need to focus on more use cases that bypass the state for more utility and therefore more market price.
A lot of people forget that if the rocket ship is ever going to land on the moon it will land on the dark side of the moon.

I understand it is not support for a proposal. But do you not realise that the quick impression someone gets from reading this is that Classic has the simple solution, Hearn is a matyr and Core is using heavy handed tactics (when Core has nothing to do with discussion forums) and has no solution, do you not understand that the censorship has nothing to do with the technical debate and only serves to emotionally color it?
At the scaling conferences that didn't talk about how forum censorship effected the number of transactions per block.

What if there is no "losing" side? Sometimes a divorce can be mutually beneficial for both parties that have opposing goals and values in a relationship.
Some Bitcoiners want to escape the banking system, others want to *become* the new banking system. Subtle difference.
Is decentralization, fungiblity and privacy most defining of Bitcoin? Or do you think mass adoption, "legitmacy" and high efficiency are what are most important for a new global currency? This in my humble opinion is the split in what is most important in Bitcoin that a hard fork may be inevitable.
A "loser" coin could still maintain itself with a different PoW and it userbase. We'd be splitting the biggest crypto-currency by far and a remnant could start over.
One thing for sure is the dark net economy is going to chose the more privacy focused coin.

Erik why don't you do a nice short in person video interview with some prominent core devs, about the timing and prerequisites of blocksize hard forks and both censorship by unrelated private third parties and toxicity in the community towards developers.

You know man, when I read the first SegWit articles on up to double transactions in 1Mb blocks I was ready to double down on my holdings.
I thought "the war is over" everyone wins and can be in harmony again. Both sides demands are met. I thought this chapter in community disagreement was over and we were moving forward as a community.
But you have to understand the solution came from Core not Classic; so then the goal post has been moved. Remember it was a 2Mb increase that was demanded (Adam Back for example gave 2-4-8 as a compromise), now that it's changed to the order of the solutions, a rapid hard fork **must** come first, there is no trying any other way.
SegWit is well within testing and on schedule to ship. This is way safer and *faster* than coordinating a hard fork, but for whatever reason it is being resisted. What are the Core devs supposed to do, stop testing SegWit and immediately focus all resources on a hard fork. Give me a break.
The other side leaves very little room to be wrong in the event that SegWit is even a moderate success. In a few months SegWit could be out and working well, fees discounted, no malleability, a more all round elegant system. What scares me is that the other side may get desperate seeing SegWit emerging and to force a hard fork through in space of a month, this reckless act would be a systemic threat.
After all I've heard comments like fire the core devs or fuck the core devs. Try telling someone like that to try SegWit first and see how it goes.

But it will come at the cost of the great hard fork crash, and the sum of the two resultant coins will be much lesser than the value of Bitcoin before the fork.
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:03:13

@_date: 2016-01-27 00:13:01


Terrific argument.


Without libsec, IBLT, segwit etc... even a 1Mb blocksize increase scales quadratically among other issuses. These optimizations need to be done first then a blocksize increase would be reasonable.
SegWit by itself increases transactions levels and it's already in testing.


You've lost all credibility, Adam Back for example has explicitly condemned censorship.

Coin distribution equality could be one, convince people that more coins in the system will cause a "fairer" distribution of wealth.
The idea of universal basic income, once Bitcoin is centralized and all users identified and KYCed you could roll this out.
Maybe the lack of a fee market causes a collapse in hashing power after a halving and the Bitcoin creation rate is frozen to prop up the system.
Anything that can appeal to the mob's greed, anger or fear. Remember people are prioritizing things like adoption, "legitimacy" and efficiency over decentralization and privacy so it's definitely possible IMHO.

SegWit is not a cure for scaling sure, but ultimately optimizations like SegWit and the abstraction of new protocol layers is what is going to scale Bitcoin which is what Core is proposing. Ironically blocksize increases will inevitably be part of this.

I hope you're right. But social engineering the masses (the social 51% attack) and hard forking Bitcoin to hijack it's network effect and infrastructure would be more profitable.


I mean no disrespect, but I think it is naive that there are not individuals and groups in the community right now that want to centralize Bitcoin either consciously or unconsciously.
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:02:04
No, I'm making a reference to PC Principal from the new South Park season.
There's definitely some dots that can be joined though. The fact that Hearn was with R3 and XT, promoted blacklists, kill switches, anti-TOR yet no one questions the political and centralization implications of users losing physical control of node hardware just boggles my mind, no one even blinks, it's sad.

[Core: We'll increase the blocksize together, you go in slowly on the left...](
[China: I'm increasing it NOW!](
[Core: No China! NO! ..NO!!](
[China: Arrragh!!!](
[Count VISA: As you see my scaling powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.](
SegWit is already well within momentum, long fuelled by all the malice, hatred and venom directed at the core devs; it's already reached the testing stage. Core can literally do nothing to make it's critics happy.
What is Core supposed to do? Completely drop SegWit testing and start coding the blocksize hard fork? Absolute insanity; and even if they did that's still a much longer ETA than the deployment of a SegWit soft fork.
As mentioned there are around 1000 nodes running 0.10.x or lower! What utter recklessness to forcefully roll out an unprepared hard fork to "solve" a FUDed up non-problem that is not even ultimately solved by the solution! If Bitcoiners of just a year or so ago knew that Bitcoiners of the future where trying to shove through a Leroy Jenkins style hard fork just to prevent fee pressure for a short period of time they would be astonished and confused.
And what is this moving the goal post shit? I thought we were getting somewhere as a community but my faith is obviously misplaced: 
First it was an insane 20Mb--&gt;8Gb vs 1Mb, then 8Mb vs 2-4-8Mb compromise and then finally 2Mb vs SegWit(2Mb) + 2Mb from the scaling conferences. Obviously the scaling conferences meant nothing and were a pointless exercise in community.
You'd think that by coming to agreement on the *exact* same amount of increase we could just move forward with development; but noooo, now the goal post has been moved and it has to be recklessly rolled out as a pre-mature hardfork, NOW NOW NOW!!! as if the sky is falling and we're all going to die, Bitcoin has faced so much worse.
This is the most important project in economics and human freedom since the invention of the internet and it's being treated like a popularity contest or who "wins" whatever that means. The enemy is out there not in here.
It's sickening to read all the big blockers getting off on Chinese centralized control just because it challenges Core's roadmap. If this situation gets any worse Core devs are going to tap out like they've said and/or it's take your market cap off the table it's Keccak time.
@_date: 2016-01-26 04:02:12
Great last paragraph, my thoughts as well.
I'm noticing three new memes forming 
new meme 1: segwit is very complex (when really it's just separating out signatures)
new meme 2: if segwit is deployed before a 2Mb blocksize increase it is being "rushed"
new meme 3: hard forks aren't that much more dangerous than soft forks
Holy shit, the mental gymnastics just to continue the antagonism and wrestle power from veteran Bitcoin developers.

You shouldn't be holding your coins on an exchange anyway.
Interestingly in the event of a hard fork crash (which [I predict there will be]( if you hold you coins through the fork you'll have much less valued coins but on both sides of the fork, and if you sell before the hard fork you will have effectively shorted a lot but will have to choose the correct fork to re-buy your coins on.
I have no plan for what I'm going to do, I'll probably pussy out and hodl on both chains.
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:22:12
But sidechains do work, just need to add them to the mainnet... and Bitcoin dosen't scale linearly... and even if it did that would still be terrible as I'd need a machine 10,000 times more powerful to verify the transactions of 10,000 times more people.... and Satoshi didn't expect it to scale linearly... and wtf man, wtf
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:25:07
Because they need to beat SegWit to the punch, even if it means a dangerous 75% hasty hard fork.

Hi, thanks for your views. I hope you're right on there being a lot of talented devs ready to step up.
I'm unsure if you can simply pick and choose features to port over as many features will rely on other dependencies, lightning cache for example has a few prerequisites that need to be implemented first.
If it were really that simple I would have expected some features from altcoins such as ring signatures being included in core already.

Perhaps in order to have a free currency you need a free people.
I also hail from the early days of Bitcoin, back when it was just crypto-punks, miners, libertarians etc... 
With more adoption though the demographics of Bitcoin have shifted with more mainstream people coming in. These people have a different priority ordered list of values. For the first time we have people that are willing to compromize on decentralization, privacy, crypto-anarchy and chance to expand human liberty through digital P2P cash. You hear is all the time "Well I was sold on it being a instant free transaction payment system to replace credit cards on the internet.", we're far gone from the days of "digital gold".
With the increase mainstream demographics there's building centralization and comprimize pressures.
A contested hard fork is like changing the constitution, if it's changed once it's twice as easy to change it again, and again. Should we forget our constitution and run Bitcoin like a democracy? Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
If the Orwellian named "Classic" fork succeeds it would be like the fall of a constitutional republic. What choice will we have but to secede and I see only the PoW counter phoenix fork as being able to do that. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 04:18:52
Why didn't you spend a tiny bit of space next to the classic proposal that core also plans to do an increase to 2Mb? No mention of SegWit and that it increases tps and can be deployed faster as a soft fork or that the contention is now petty on the order of changes, hard fork vs soft fork etc... 
Hearn is kind of martyred, no mention of gigablocks XT and him writing his piece whilst working for R3.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:47:59
Quadratic shmadratic! stop using overly complex words, we need to just increase the blocksize! forget about fancy schmancy optimizations we can worry about that later we need capacity now dammit!
Signature hashing? Does that have something to do with hashish? Let me tell you about this Toomin guy.
Anyway got to go cause me and the classic folks need to get this hard fork thing done in like a month before segwit rolls off the testing line. Shit, didn't expect it to be completing testing so soon.

Because you're looking at this from a rational point of view. A lot of base emotions were appealed to in this mass social engineering.
* Fear: If blocks become full all hell will break loose.
* Greed: If Bitcoin's tps doesn’t increase it's price won't increase.
* Anger: Core devs are crippling Bitcoin for their own financial gain.
* Laziness: People actually not reading core devs road map and rebuttals.

*"...we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto*
Censorship resistance is one of the defining properties of Bitcoin. If you compromise censorship resistance you no longer have Bitcoin.


*"...in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations." - Wei Dai, B-money*
*"I think it [Bitcoin v0.1] achieves nearly all the goals you set out to solve in your b-money paper. The system is entirely decentralized, without any server or trusted parties." - Satoshi Nakamoto*

Also there is a relationship between "anti-fork" talk and price. For example that nice up spike we saw between the 4th and 5th that took us to around $385 coincided with blockstream's $55M funding announcement.

Hard money Libertarians were the first to even believe in this digital gold and get people on board, they were being laughed out the door by the mainstream whom ultimately dosen't give a shit about the core principles and politics that Bitcoin embodies.

You do realize that side chains are using  bitcoins transferred to and from them. It essentially gives us more blockchain type space without compromising the decentralization of nodes.


Sidechains use the Bitcoin protocol.


Nice FUD, sabotaging the Bitcoin project would be financially catastrophic for them as sidechains need Bitcoin as a reserve. They also have time locked Bitcoins.


Main chain will function fine and will continue to be upgraded, after all the more Sidechains you have the more demand you have on the mainchain.
Sidechains are completely modular, if they are as bad as you say people will not use them. There are also other layer 2 solutions (as this rocket to the moon is necessary a [multi-stage rocket]( such as Lightning which is essentially write cache for the Bitcoin blockchain, no sidechains required, or services that mass settle on the blockchain such as webwallets and change tip.
From your post it doesn’t seem like you actually know much about Sidechains other than what you've learned in your own echo chamber. I recommend watching [this video]( for a good run down.

I primarily use Bitcoin as a inflation proof and counter party proof store of value. This all relies on Bitcoin being kept out of reach of the state and nodes kept out of the corporate data center. I am irresponsibly over invested in Bitcoin.
If things got this bad that the Bitcoin project could be HF'd away from decentralization via a social engineering campaign and demographic shift I would rage so hard. 
To the point where I would probably fanatically support a Keccak counter fork of the Phoenix and restart my 4 x 7950s rig.

Bitcoin is P2P digital cash without a trusted third party.
If you can't run your own node you now need to trust a third party.
If nodes can only be run in cloud data centers then they are centralized enough to comply with corporate or government polices.
Governments like to inflate currencies and freeze funds.
Bitcoin loses its unique value proposition and VISA/PayPal is the superior system.

Good point, as blocks get fuller the market will be more incentive pressure to create payment channel solutions. As such I expect fee to rise logarithmically rather than linearly.

Actually network total validation resource requirements scales at O(n^2). So a 2mb increase requires 4 times the resources not just double. This is why we need many of the items in core's scaling roadmap first before increasing the blocksize limit.

Sure but they can't be un-invented for Bitcoin, in fact their deployment is inevitable even if not by blockstream.


Two straw man arguments
Is that you Roger? It's not about hard drive space, it's about bandwidth and the quadratic n^2 scaling of verification and propagation. This betrays an ignorance that you are not even familiar with the very basic level of this debate.
Side chains are not a trusted 3rd party. That's like saying the block chain is a trusted 3rd party


Crippling is the word you're looking for. Regardless if this is all true then it is enough to overcome the network effect of Bitcoin and we will all switch to a new un-crippled coin.
In reality increasing the blocksize will lead to private node operators losing physical control over their node hardware and having to rent resources in corporate cloud data centers. This is a very dark future for Bitcoin and is one blockstream and many others in the core dev community are trying to prevent.
The software is open source so anyone can compete with Blockstream, hell Coinbase could create it's own microtranaction side chain, Gavin could implement XT as a side chain, Hearn could implement BanksterCoin as a sidechain. But the black bone of the system (i.e. Bitcoin) will remain decentralized and free. 


If people find value in using a centralized service, that's their choice, they are not being forced by definition.
You seem to confused about sidechains, you're getting more blockchain space with a sidechain and still using the same bitcoins not an altcoin. If you claim side chains are altcoins you are either ignorant or wilfully spreading misinfomation. Because the entire Bitcoin system (which includes sidechains) has more blockchain type space the fees when using sidechains will be lower.
It's actually really simple once you take the time to get you're head around it.
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:21:18
The debate is not even about hard drive space, but about bandwidth costs and quadratic scaling.
Anyone who has spent just 5 minutes to look into this debate knows this. But nice propaganda mate.

Wow, Greg has contributed so much to Bitcoin. Especially in the last few years. It would be a tragedy to lose him. That being said if you have a look through the links I've posted it's not just him but an entire dream line up of Core devs.


Err... what?! There's constantly new threats and innovations that we need cryptographers for, quit smoking the Toomim brothers' blend.
Look at cryptographic innovations like confidential transactions that will likely now never see the light of day due to this socially engineered 51% attack.


Funny, all the actual optimizations are coming from Core: SegWit, secp256k1 followed by newer network level optimizations that will make a blocksize increase much safer. If you want optimization it's not coming from classic. Increasing the blocksize is not an optimization.

@_date: 2016-02-01 17:34:19
Pretty much my answer: (response)
On top of this 2Mb will cause more issues than people realize due to quadratic propagation issues, that's why core wants to get some more network optimizations out the door before doing the hardfork. A hardfork needs a bit of preparation to say the least so we can do this whilst the hardfork is being prepared, but what would they know right?

Option 1: Somehow Roger Ver is completely ignorant of even the very basic level of the blocksize debate and has not read or listened to any of the arguments from the core developers outside his echo chamber. This would be a great example of how ignorance is spread over a mass via memes.
Option 2: Roger Ver does understand that disk space usage is a straw man argument, but would like his audience to believe it is a valid argument against the scaling roadmap and will increase the hatred and animosity towards the core developers. This would be an example of social engineering.
Given his history with public [low info judgements]( I think Option 1 is probably correct.

I think secession via PoW change is an important option to always have on the table in the event that Bitcoin is forced to betray its first principles.

I used to buy into the Andreas-Antonopolous-esque "Bitcoin is invincible" rhetoric. 
But this last year I've never had a stronger sense of Bitcoin's mortality with the realisation that reason and cypher punk ideals can easily be drowned out by the low info hordes.

Miner centralization is a different problem to node centralization. We can solve mining centralization with things like P2Pool, or worst case scenario changing the PoW. Other solutions are also being looked at.
But if nodes become impossible to privately own there's no going back.
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:23:35
You're right, increasing the blocksize doesn’t solve the problem, it makes it worse due to the quadratic scaling function.
What does solve the problem are optimizations such as SegWit and ultimately the evolution of new protocol layers in a Bitcoin stack as only Core is proposing, they are at least 5 steps ahead in their thinking.

I don't know about you but IMHO if Bitcoin ends up in a Microsoft data center, doing tax reporting services, alongside R3 blockchains serving mega banks, then this has all been a completely pointless exercise.
I much rather Blockstream's vision of Bitcoin, with full nodes being owned and controlled all the way down to the physical layer by the people; and *the* Bitcoin blockchain being the *one blockchain to rule them all* where all sidechains get their reserve backing from. P2P digital cash, with **no trusted third parties**. 
That is the dream anyway.

Meni, what do you think of Myriad's solution to mining centralization?
I think it is an improvement on Guy's proposal.
5 simultaneous proof of works mean that an ASIC miner, a GPU miner and even a CPU miner can mine the chain at their own difficulties and a pool can only possibly take 20% of the hashing power preventing 51% attacks.
For Bitcoin we could do scrypt (to attract scrypt miners) and some Keccak variants and seriously help miner centralization and 51% attacks.
