Hi everybody, i was watching the Genesis Block and found that this address sent almost everyday the same amount of BTC, this for more than six month every single day.. what does it mean?
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:22:20
But why sending everyday to Satoshi’s Nakamoto wallet from block zero?

Usually countries that don’t respect the citizen and his privacy ban bitcoin(iraq, venezuela,egipt, ecc).. countries when instead are given rights to citizens usually allow this currency, if not completely at least partially. So you can measure the status of a country according to where is legal or illegal bitcoin or other forms of money

You could donate to Andreas Antonopoulos, one of the best speaker and free-mind bitcoiner in this world, you can search his public  address on internet and also listen to some of his youtube videos or speeches :)

You are not forced to pay the high fee for the next block. You can set 1sat/byte fee and wait some days(4cents). Also cripto credit cards have high fees everytime

What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:17:12
I would take now 1BTC, because what is sure is what you have now, maybe in future will not be the same, and you won’t get an entire btc.. or at least try to take 0.5 
Then at least you have half, and you can decide later to buy only the last half
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:50:27
You have to search for free on internet by your own, if people do do the job for you there’s no learning
