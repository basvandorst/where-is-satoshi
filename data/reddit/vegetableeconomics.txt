It's not disingenuous at all. When the time is changed in other coins it's known trade-off of speed vs security. Ethereum has good systems to mitigate the issues of 15s blocktime in various papers. Also it's not a bad thing to be less secure. Less secure does not mean insecure.  
The the point I was making is that: *the block time is not arbitrary*, which is what your whole statement above rests on.  
And the counter-argument that I was making was that DAG and Holochains have the same speed-of-light limit on state communication to overcome; that block based coins have.

This isn't an infographic, it's an article of someone's opinion. There's no data at all.

The block time is not an arbitrary setting, it is set because of the **time related to achieving consensus**. That is, it related to the time it takes for a message to get from one end of the globe to the other and then the time to resolve a discrepancy across that distance.  
If we had people using Bitcoin on the Moon, **the block time would need to be 1.5 hours** in order to achieve consensus. As far as I can tell DAG, and Holochains have the same problem and haven't solved it.

Price doesn't go up because of volume. Nor does it go down due to lack of volume (as implied by your statement). 
If sellers simply put their prices up, then the price of bitcoin has increased.  
A trade requires a willing seller and a willing buyer. If fewer people are willing to sell at a low price then the price goes up.
