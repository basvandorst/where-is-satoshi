Is there a beta of 0.16? or can someone guide me on how to build this myself with segwit added
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:20:54
I think the big change will happen once Bitcoin Core wallet has Segwit integrated. They really should've already had it out by now.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:54:51
Thanks for the reply but don't I need the public key of the X address? Which I wont have.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:43:33
So the transaction wont be on the Blockchain? What's stopping me from sending the same BTC to another address. Also  says it would be possible to spend them?
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:48:11
Can someone confirm these exploits are only if your running in a virtual environment? What's the effect on non server machines?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:38:35
You guys acting like this is bad for the price when it's probably good. Microsoft probably didn't keep any of the BTC spent on their website, they exchanged it into USD which would slowly drive the price down if lots of us spent BTC there. BTC being a store of value is best case for it going up in value. LN will kinda change that but the good thing about LN is if they want to withdraw the funds they will need to pay a fee so it maybe best to just keep it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:57:39
But will they offer daily USD bank transfers? That's the only one good thing about Bitpay compared to others like coinpayments
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:26:43
LN transactions are off the blockchain so what will they be selling? What if I want to close the payment channel and put the funds I buy on chain
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:33:57
Is it possible that one day we wont even ever need to leave the LN? Only million, maybe billion dollar+ transactions will be on the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:39:45
So this would let me send 1BTC to Bobs Bitcoin address and what would happen then? It would confirm and Bob wouldn't be able to spend it until Block X?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:53:21

BTC needs more forks! They say Bitcoin is in a bubble, nope the alts are.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:07:16
Does Antpool still keep the fees from blocks for themselves? or do their miners get it now.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:46:17
Ok great. Trying to figure out how to test it now, how can I send send a transaction using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:42
Of course not. They only lasted so long because of Bitcoins huge rally last year.

@_date: 2018-01-04 23:29:55
Ok so say I want to buy BTC that's currently on the Lightning Network to avoid fees. Could they not do that? If so how would they separate them on purchase? Just a tick box?
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:05:03
People in the ETH community actually think things like Wrapped Bitcoin are good for ETH. ETH is being turned into a BTC sidechain.

When are people gonna realise these decentralised social platforms all suck. Plus they never actually are decentralised otherwise there would be loads of spam, child porn and other horrible things. Good example is Dtube people think it's decentralised, go post a LEGAL porn video without marking it as NSFW and it's gone from their home page. Sure it's still out there and accessible if you have the IPFS link and if anyone is actually seeding it but no one is gonna see it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:29:26
At 12:20 that reporter asking about Bitcoin saying it's "become very popular among white nationalist groups" well that's news to me. Dumb-ass questions.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:21:15
Too many. IMO he is a risk to Bitcoins value
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:44:56
Only way that happens is if everyone dies. Someone will keep a copy of the blockchain but will it be worth anything is the question.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:38:45
That's true. If something takes over then crypto can never be a store of value because xyz will come along and take over that eventually. Other than coins like Monero who have better privacy and Eth that allow for more advanced smart contracts I don't see anything of value in the space. Don't see anything competing against Bitcoins store of value.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:48:46
I don't think it's obvious Bitcoin is worth more than $12k otherwise it would be. People who think like that never want to hear when we are in a bubble (not saying we are, yet.)
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:10:14
"That's criminal activity" hackers don't care. They do far worse. You can't assume it will always be a few hundred $. If the business has really bad protection you could bring them down for just a few $ a month. So yes it would be worth it.

Yea what has Charlie done? Please don't tell me you're a BCH supporter they have real trust issues like fake Satoshi, no segwit because of mining exploits, far more centralised and a stupid toxic community backing it.

@_date: 2019-07-12 15:57:33
I feel like them only giving $60,000 and making it public feels like a joke. They make billions every year.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:15:02
LN will hopefully do both and we can see alts be totally useless which I think will happen in time but Monero privacy is still better than LN right now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:23:57
It was the first to add Segwit, I don't think it has LN yet but it maybe the first to.
Bitcoin probably wont be the "first" to add new features which is a good think imo. As long as we don't have to wait too long.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:34:23
Well ask them why. Sure transaction fees are high but unless the funds are being withdrawn from 15+ addresses a $10 fee should be plenty.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:09:37
I don't see why people keep posting these like it's some kind of victory. The people shorting don't do it because they want to see Bitcoin die they are just trying to make a quick buck like the rest of us. I'm sure they would rather it just continuously go up and long it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:31:09

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:02
No one knows for sure but I would wait. I don't think there is going to be much money in the first few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:53:58
Or maybe just think about that in advance? If I was to give away any BTC I would keep a copy of the key myself for this reason
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:03:07
Thanks for the heads up. I'm sure the bcashers will be the ones calling it a failure.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:48:09
No they don't have that any more. It was never every block or 10 blocks.
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:44:50
Reality: Altcoin 'masters' think their shitcoins are better because they can process 1000tx /s
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:47:17
Ok, not sure I would prefer a sudden burst in CPU usage rather than a spread out process even if some get checked twice. Would depend how many some are.
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:08:07
Firstly what does that matter? and secondly you're wrong. On Jan 1 Monero was 0.025 BTC and right now it's 0.016 BTC.
Guess you've proven yourself that Monero is a worse store of value? lol
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:27:25
Awesome can't wait to see the apps created on LN that kill ETH.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:05:12
I don't understand how it's down 36% when 152 (6.33/hr) bcash blocks have been mined in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:12:21
I guess you're too stupid to realise that if it's value to BTC is lower then it's value to USD is lower too.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:15:18
Oh guess it must be true then.
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:48:14
Yes but the difference is it's detected in other coins.
Also there's a reason why projects use BTC code as a base, it's the most tested. Monero has modifications to it's core which will allow for more vulnerabilities.
Exploit found in BTC = Huge dump, most exchanges probably detect it right away, fork and price correction over a few months period.
Exploit found in Monero = Hacker slowly dumps coins, people may suspect an exploit but without any proof nothing is done. Monero slowly goes to &lt;$5 and you all make a hacker rich.
Also BTC is a better store of value even if there are never any exploits.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:42:27
For $5k? not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:06:52
Why? Never say never firstly, and secondly I guess just because of fees? What when that is fixed.
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:37:26
I looked into this deadman switch thing before but gave up. Seemed complicated.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:26
They had zero incentive to add Segwit too. They lost their 30% bonus exploit but you know how it was added? Core threatened to change the mining algorithm on Bitcoin so all their hardware would be useless.
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:49:59
Most of us can't verify the code ourselves but there are hundreds if not thousands of programmers out there that can. All it takes is for one of them to find a bug and make it public or contact the Bitcoin Core team to fix it.
It's Linux Vs Windows. No one can fully verify if Windows is secure apart from Microsoft but with Linux there are thousands of people and companies verifying the code for security purposes.
For guys like us we have to trust the community consensus not the software distributors.

@_date: 2018-08-04 14:25:03
Is the bank open? Do they approve the payment? Have they actually got your funds? These are two different systems. Banks have way more limitations that affect it already. What's your point?

Blockchain.info has crashed
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:21:36
Few reasons why I think BTC should remain at the top
1. It's the only crypto community that's got a proven track record of being resilient to multiple forms of attacks.
2. I truly believe the majority of smart people are in BTC. When I look at alts I just see people who just want a quick buck and will shift to the next best thing as soon as they see it.
3. It has the most invested in it. There is probably close to $20b just in hardware equipment to mine it.
4. If some new tech comes along which is better then it will just be forked into BTC.
I think it will be a store of value mainly because it can't be taken from you, you can prove the limited supply, you can always have access to the funds anywhere in the world, it's the most secure crypto (there can be only one true SHA 256 crypto) and also it's track record of changes. BTC is one of the only coins out there where you know you're not going to see some crazy change forked in.
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:44:00
How much does this reduce CPU usage by?
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:28:38
What's useful? Monero for privacy, Eth for smart contracts? What else. LN will get both of those.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:08:41
Wrong how? I don't really see a way crypto makes it without BTC being on top. I can maybe see how the whole crypto space dies out.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:03:55
How does the confidential asset transaction work? Is it like Monero where you don't know the total supply?
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:33:24
Yes they proven it was not used but the only way they did that was by knowing the exploit to check "allows for the creation of an unlimited number of coins in a way that is undetectable to an observer unless they know about the fatal flaw and can search for it." There could be another exploit right now that someone is abusing and no one will know about it for sure until they find it and test for it. How can that be used as a store of value?
I like Monero for it's function, it will offer better privacy than LN so it will be one of the few coins that LN doesn't eat up.
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:18:22
It's a terrible store of value simply due to it's complete privacy. Last year there was an exploit found that if abused would allow someone to create unlimited coins without anyone knowing. If that happened in BTC it would be detected right away but the only way of knowing would be seeing the market crash completely and any smart hacker would surely slowly dry it out.
@_date: 2018-08-27 23:58:58
Holy crap just looked at block stats and it's going up huge in the last 24 hours
Wasn't the theory of BTC not going below $6,000 based on the miners? Guess that's increased to $6,500 now.
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:09:03
I love it how these investors say stuff like "diversify with alts" yet if BTC dies I'm certain everything else will too.
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:26:20
All you do day in day out is talk shit about Bitcoin yet you clearly don't fully understand its features.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:05:26
2017 was the year of shit coins and ico. There is no diversification in crypto. It's BTC or nothing. If BTC fails the market fails.
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:34:11
Except you forget BTC has only just recently became near unprofitable to mine. During the $20,000-$7,000 bull market all miners where still making profit.
Now you have to invest in something that may not even return your initial investment.
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:35:39
BTC ETH monero. Rest shit coins.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:52:49
I think this was the right move. Some of the bcash shills will realise now why BTC developers are better and why they don't rush things and make unnecessary changes.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:26:39
Don't forget a lot more transactions get batched too now. We may get schnorr within a year too that will help greatly with batches.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:57:50
This is all because of Bitmex maintenance? [
Bloody traders.
  
Edit: It's back up price swinging more than my balls [
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:23:45
The only way I see BTC failing is if the community slowly moves to something better but the thing is if it's better BTC will just fork it in.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:44:49
I think my mind may change if I see the major developers in BTC move to something else.
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:57:33
Whichever Coin is a store of value will be worth the most. If we just keep flipping every 5-10 years because this new coin is better in some way then crypto can never be a store of value because there won't be trust something new will come along. Also you bring up the markets yet everything is still backed by BTC. I don't see anything even competing with BTC yet. They ask have drawbacks for their advantages in speed etc that they don't even need yet.
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:16:51
Bitcoin in it's current state is not better, it does have some advantages though. The main one being it's empowering as stated above, no one can seize your BTC so for a store of value what is better? It has it's drawbacks sure but all Bitcoins current problems can and will be fixed with time.
As I also stated above it's programmable, right now the price is pretty much based off speculation as to what this can become one day, which it should IMO.
If you listen to credible Bitcoin enthusiast they tell you to invest what you're willing to lose as their  rule. It's not for everyone **YET**.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:29:39
TBH it's not very hard when fake Satoshi and Roger are the two main speakers and promoters. All the competent developers are in BTC, BCH is just full of FUD and shilling.

@_date: 2018-08-24 19:46:30
"immature bickering" ??? Bcash is literally scamming people into thinking it's the real Bitcoin. People buy that thinking they are buying Bitcoin. Bcash is failing and slowly dying I don't think it's immature for people to point that out. Sure it depends how they approach it but I wouldn't say most are immature.
"come together" I think we kinda already are. I would rather see bcash win than see crypto completely gone.

@_date: 2018-08-28 02:27:29
BTC hash rate is increasing on average 5-10% every 2 weeks even over the last few months where BTC has been hovering around $6000. There's a pretty solid theory on why BTC can't drop below $6000 based off miners profit. This is increasing as the hashrate does.

Waiting doesn't fix it, just cause him to mine longer be broadcasting the new longest chain.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:06:38
But you can actually say the transaction details with speech and sign language. It will be painfully long of course, then they would be relayed through other forms of communication to others. Blocks could still be mined and broadcast in one way or another, the blocks wont be anywhere near full remember so even radio waves could do it, the current system would be completely broken though of course. I don't really think this argument has much point though the internet is rather distributed already. No single country can bring it down and the one with the best chance is probably the US and I really don't see that happening. Also if that happens I think we have a much larger problem than our money being useless.
@_date: 2018-05-04 18:05:29

@_date: 2014-07-31 00:15:36
Bitcoin will keep going down.
Why? simple...
Big companies that are accepting Bitcoin are selling it instantly! until they start keeping a decent chunk of it prices will keep steadily going downwards.
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:49:23
Anyone who thinks Bitcoin prices will go down gets negativity.
I don't think they will keep going down forever but I can't see Bitcoin going back over $700 before the end of the year
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:39:21
If companies never keep it then the price will keep going down until we get more cash to investment in Bitcoin (the currency) than the daily amount sold by exchanging it into fiat.
I think the big companies will only start keeping it when that starts happening. While the price is dropping there is no incentive for the large companies to keep a % in Bitcoin.
Personally I think Bitcoin will keep steadily losing value but eventually there will be a huge boom when these companies keep a %
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:57:43
As a store of value why would you go with anything other than BTC? It's by far the most secure and has it's future development visions most secure.
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:36:46
Obviously it only includes their services being hacked. They are not going to cover the costs of anyones stupidity.
I don't know how the insurance will work in the future but it will eventually be figured out, this is programmable money meaning any problems we face today will eventually be fixed. People need to understand right now Bitcoin is 100% empowering of your own funds, this is a great thing IMO but it opens up so many different scam opportunities.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:35:54
My argument is basic supply and demand...
The large sites cash out instantly and there is not enough people buying Bitcoins to cover the amount they are cashing out.
Is it really that hard to people to see this is the cause of the price slowly dropping?
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:29:09

Until these large companies keep the Bitcoins exchanged prices will not go up sharply.
Once large companies do however keep a large % of their holdings in Bitcoin the price will shoot up. However I do not see that happening any time soon.

Same way as it works with banks today but on exchanges. If the exchange has 10,000 customers each with 1BTC they should have 10k BTC in their cold wallet but what if they only have 1,000?
You obviously can't do this if everyone hold the BTC themselves but I don't see that happening any time soon.

Decentralised platforms wont work IMO. They will be full of spam, porn, illegal substances (whether you think they should be on not do you really want to see them?).
One current example is dtube - The give the illusion of decentralisation yet they can censor a video to the point of it only being view able if you go DIRECTLY to the videos URL. Just like a YouTube video being listed as "unlisted".
Decentralised doesn't always mean better.

It's 1:1 it doesn't matter what the purchasing power of the USD is. If a loaf of bread costs $1 today but $100 next year then I guess you can just presume BTC will be worth 100x.
USD purchase power does go down every year (inflation). Hodling 1,000 Tether is worse than holding $1,000 a bank account, for trust reasons.

This farm was not responsible for any delays in fact it's hashing rate is less than 0.5% of the total hash rate (presuming $10m of hardware was lost). Even if 50% of miners stopped we should still get blocks on average 20 minutes until a difficulty adjustment. Sometimes these long blocks happen, then again sometimes several blocks get mined in a few seconds.

Well short term I disagree. This was only 50% hash move? If it was 90% and they didn't come back it could take up to 140 days before the difficulty adjustment to change with a block average of .6 per hour
Also is it not possible for a huge catastrophe event like a solar flare to destroy most electronics? If that would happen it could take years (guess we wouldn't really care in that scenario though)

Even if we had large block sizes BTC would still suck compared to other cryptos due to 10 min blocks. BTC is literally the worst on chain payment processor (FOR SMALL PAYMENTS) due to no alt coins having block times of more than 10 minutes + majority of alt coins having the same or &gt; then 1MB limits.
BTC is in it's own niche of being the gold of crypto with having the most secure on chain transactions by far. LN has it's problems but they will get fixed as you can see from most of the FUD being spread last year is already fixed.

1) For someone who has been in crypto for so long how don't you understand the HODL mentality? 2) Most people that trade lose money, if you sold at the top and bought back in at a low congratulations. It's not recommended for most people so they best option is to HOLD through these ups and downs 3) It's easy to say "it was obviously the top" with a reddit account 1 week old and what's the point of having multiple reddit accounts?

I run a full node and a pruned node. I am very happy with the pruned node and was wondering if there are any other disadvantages other than the following? 1) Not being able to handle extremely deep reorganizations 2) serve old blocks to other nodes 3) rescan for old transactions that may affect your wallet after importing an old address/key.

How does Yang's idea of VAT work? Because in EU which is what he said he's basing it off firstly companies can claim VAT back and secondly it's mainly consumers that pay VAT so giving people free money doesn't really help.

@_date: 2019-09-09 19:18:24
Surely it means they need to sell more. Higher hashrate = more competition = less profit so instead of selling only 30% of the BTC to cover costs they may now need to sell 50%+.

"Consumers do end up paying slightly higher prices for goods, but many of those goods are things like electronics" In the UK VAT is added to everything. If you buy a loaf of bread it's added and 20% isn't exactly a slightly higher price.
If everyone has more money then things will just go up in price to factor that in, which is why things are more expensive in large cities. Feels like it will accomplish nothing, if you're worried about health care then why not do the VAT system but offer free health care for all from that, then the money wont be wasted.

This is what I don't understand. Why do they need to reserve x Bitcoin for me? Why can't they have 100 BTC on their main channel and just relay 1 BTC to me if I want to purchase that amount? and the other 99 on other customers.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:31:11
Profitability is based off hardware cost + hardware speed + total hashrate not just the hashrate. I can remember people complaining 2-3 years ago when BTC was around $200 that it was unprofitable even for the Chinese. Also we know what will happen already, hash may drop, not by much but that doesn't matter as the network is far too over-secured already.
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:15:46
1) A lot of people here have seen BTC below $1,000 so they are happy with the current price.
2) Rules 1 in BTC is invest what you're willing to lose.
3) HODL. Don't look at short term. Once you invest you shouldn't even think about selling within the first few years.
4) People like to tell themselves whatever makes them happy.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:14:09
"How do you expect new money to end up in a channel without a tx?"
When exchanges allow you to buy BTC already on the LN this maybe solved?

I think it was unprofitable 2 years ago? or when the crash from 1,000 to 200 was.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:43:02
Yes but the costs will likely shoot down too with competition. Your first comment was "We need to know what happens when mining becomes unprofitable" what do you think will happen? You posted above it looks like hashrate will just continue to go up.
I was just using 50% as an example, doesn't really matter if we go up or down just as long as it's not in a short time period like this recent increase was. Some say we will get a 51% attack if we go down in hashrate (which will only ever happen if mining becomes unprofitable for an extended period of time) but I don't think we will ever experience that attack vector.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:09:20
What competition? All ASIC are manufactured by one company right now.
51% attacks wont happen because:
1) They will only screw over one exchange (and they may even fail and lose their BTC while attempting it)
2) All the hardware after the attack will be worthless
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:12:48
As more people use it there will be more channels linked which is more liquidity?
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:09:22
Bitmain is really the only choice for value right now.
Not really. Look at their order book, &lt;$100,000,000 could be stolen and then how are they even going to withdraw that?. There have been examples of large exchanges being hacked and causing the value to dump on that one exchange to $1. Others will take a hit but no where near as bad. Even if they did that on all exchanges the price would just pump all the way back up.
There are cheaper and way more effective ways of attacking bitcoin than wasting a few billion $'s to cause short term panic. Attacking Bitcoin social is probably the best.
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:17:02
They have 300 employees? I thought most exchanges have &lt;20
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:19:43
"the energy consumption increases, which means more money needs to be spent on energy" I don't think BTC has reached the point where it affects energy prices per kw/h. I understand how the algorithm works. What do you think will happen then if we lose 50% hashrate over the next few months? nothing other than slightly slower blocks until it evens out.
Also isn't other manufactures coming into this market now? I think one is Intel? so who knows what will happen once there is actually competition in the ASIC market.
@_date: 2015-10-07 11:52:25
Why? Bitpay will sort it eventually and credit the account. Payments to Bitpay have not been lost it's just their system not automatically recognizing/approving them? or am I wrong

People love to throw around the "smart contracts" crap. That will be built on top of Bitcoin through side chains. There is NO reason a coin should have billions of dollars in value just because it can do smart contracts, especially when no one is even using it (talking about ETH).
LN can do some smart contacts already.
