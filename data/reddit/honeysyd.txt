Yes, it is hard to confiscate BTC. However, it is possible that major governments (e.g., European Countries, US and China) announce BTC transactions or possessions are illegal, leading to no way to liquidate or purchase BTC. This will definitely lead to a big drop in the BTC price, which would never be recovered as there is no chance for BTC to move into the mainstream. As would be expected, the same can happen although such governments ban BTC not simultaneously. 
I personally possess some BTC, so I wish that this does not happen with BTC. But, I agree that government policies are important for the future of BTC.

This site is a BTC music store, which is similar to WatchMyBit. Great idea!!!

Yes, this is what I understood about 51% attack so far. What makes me confusing is this: nodes will not propagate invalid transactions and therefore miners holding 51% hashing power cannot manipulate the network (because miners do not take 51% of nodes, but hashing power). 
@_date: 2019-03-18 07:43:01
Does it meant that 51% attack is possible? 
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:01:14
Thank you for the reply. I understood about 51% attack in the same way as you explained. From my recent reading, miners cannot propagate invalid transactions to the network because miners do not control the majority of nodes. So, I wonder how a miner holding 51% hashing power can perform 51% attack without controlling the majority of nodes. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 07:58:30
Thank you for the great explanation. 
From  my recent reading, 51% attack is not practical because a miner holding 51% hashing power does not necessarily take 50% of nodes. So, if a malicious miner holing 51% hashing power sends invalid transactions, then majority of nodes will not propagate such invalid transactions. As a result, 51% attack is theoretically not practical. 
However, it is not consistent with what I understood about 51% attack: which is that a malicious miner holding 51% attack can create the longest chain, in which the malicious miner can manipulate his BTC holding/transactions.   
When thinking nodes and miner (or hasher) separately and miner (or hasher) do not control the majority of nodes, I am lost.

Thank you for the reply. Did you mean that 51% attack can be achieved without propagating invalid transactions? It makes sense to me.  The attacker can send valid transactions to the network until his chain becomes the longest one. After his chain becomes the longest one, he can start propagate his chain to the network. Then, nodes will accept the longest chain (his manipulate chain) as valid transaction. I wonder if I understand you correctly. 
In this case, how nodes can detect the attack? To their view, everything would look fine and normal.

Would you please give me an example? Did you mean that If I send btc from a native segwit to a non native segwit wallet, sending btc would not be a problem but receiving btc in a non segwit would be a problem?
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:06:52
If i have a wallet supporting the two segwit, but my friend has a support only one segwit, then can I transfer BTC to another segwit between my wallets and send to my friend?
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:02:23
Thank you for the information. Native segwit and segwit are compatible? What I mean is if btc can be transferred between the two types of segwit.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:32:04
Thank you for clarification. It is a great help. Then I should use a wallet beginning with 3, as I weigh more on compatibility.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:15:57
The story about me and my friend was just an example. I worried if btc in a native segwit wallet wallet cannot be sent to non native segwit, or the other way around. Then my btc will be locked in a wallet if no one use that wallet in the future.

Now I understand the mechanism that guarantees a profit using a large difference between the spot price (lower) and the future price (higher). 
Thank you for the help :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:33:41
Why is that so? As long as I understand, ETF does not need hold the underlying asset (i.e., Bitcoin in this case). Furthermore, many people would buy ETF than actual BTC as ETF is easier to access for not tech people such as old ladies. 
As I do not have deep knowledge in finance derivatives, the above statement comes from nowhere. Please tell me if I am wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:45:41
Thank you for the great article. In the articles, the follow paragraph is included.
"But it gets worse. As said above, if you bet on gold future prices by either buying or selling a futures contract (checking out gold futures charts), the bookie might just be a bullion banker. He’s now betting against you with an institutional advantage; he completely controls the supply of your contract."
Would you please elaborate little more on how bookie is able to bet against you, and what it means? Does it mean that when you are the only only trader in the future market, the bookie will not buy your short contract or not sell your long contract?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:17:34
If the difference in price between the future market and the spot market is large enough to make a guaranteed profit as you given, it means they are not correlated at some extent. If so, isn't there also a chance that the difference is getting larger at the time of the future contract maturity? 
I do not know much about the future, so I am asking but not stating. By the way, thank you for the good posting. Your posting helps me a lot to understand the situation.

Would you please share your experience with GBTC? I was once interested in it, but I gave up after reading that the price of GBTC often involves 30% premium, meaning that its price is 30% more expensive than BTC price in exchanges. 
What about risks of holding GBTC? If the GBTC provider goes under, then we lose all investment? 
Any comment on GBTC would be appreciated.   
Thank you.

Therefore, even though 80% of miners support BIP91, there is a chance for BTC to split if some of that 80% miners do not support the 2MB block size increase?

Yes, I agree that people in a mining pool can withdraw their hash power anytime. I did not consider this factor much as people in a mining pool never know the intention of the pool before the pool executes reorgs.
Does it cost more money/electricity for reorg than for a regular validation? I supposed it is not, and therefore I thought the cost for reorg would not be a matter as there is no additional cost.
Yes, I will do more research on 51% attach. Thank you for all the valuable comments.
EDIT: Is the cost of reorg for BTC much higher than for BCH?

I agree that it is not practical to build a new mining business and dominate 51% of BTC hashing power. My concern is what if the current mining pools conspire to reorganise BTC blockchain in their favour.
It is possible and they can make profits by doing so. For example, betting on a BTC short heavily in the future market, and then manipulate the BTC blockchain. The media will report the manipulation and the BTC price will drop and their betting on short will profit.

Thank you for sharing your opinion. My concern is the fact that the immutability of BTC is in hand of few people. We never know what they have in their mind and it is not safe to give such a big power to few unknown  people. 
If it is true, as I said above, no one wants to use BTC in serious business, which may interrupt the wide adoption of BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:35:03
Shorting on the future market and manipulating the BTC blockchain was just an example. There may be a way to profit from manipulating such a big network of BTC. 
My point was that if the immutability of BTC is in hand of few people, it would be hard to expect a large adoption. Especially, no big institutions and organisations and high net-worth individuals will use BTC for serious business.
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:59:12
Currently, 3\~4 big mining pools take more than 51% of the total hashing power. As they can decide to reverse transactions, it seems to be true that few people can damage the immutability of BTC.
Please note that I do not understand fully the technical aspect of BTC. So I wonder why 3-6 confirmations will safe from reorgs. As far as I know, if few large mining pools (with more than 51% hashing power) decide to keep manipulating the network for a long time, then more number of transactions will not save the immutability.
