I think ALT coins are coins trying to be currencies that offer nothing really new or advantageous over the security of Bitcoin.  I was a firm bitcoin pureist for a long time, but I realized there is a huge difference in Currency and Utility tokens.

Recurring Subscriptions on the blockchain.
do you understand what a protocol is?
I don't think you do.. i'm arguing with a neanderthal. 
Bitcoin enables peer to peer transactions...
ETH enables peer to peer protocols... The "Block" in ETH is actually a little tiny computer that runs on the internet forever processing computational functions.
One is not like the other and you must grasp why this is revolutionary to understand where we're going.  Right now its only use is shitcoins and crypto kitty type games.. These are what in the engineering world is known as a Proof of Concept.  We've built out a test version, a POC, and we're testing it.. We've discovered some flaws in this process in scaling and other things in both BTC and ETH.
Over the next year or so you're going to start seeing peer to peer protocols launch that are going to change the way the internet operates, but most importantly give developers the tools they need to build dapps that give users the same UX they would expect from a high quality web 2.0 app.
The reason we aren't there yet is because we're not done with building the infrastructure layer..  You are expecting things to happen over night. You thinking we should be able to build apps to the same quality we do on web 2.0 is just a misunderstanding of where both BTC and ETH are in their development lifecyles. We can't even take SaaS style subscriptions and are missing so many key building blocks.. We're in the infrastructure stage, not app stage.
To put it another way, we're in the GEOCITIES era of the internet. Not FAANG.
But i get it, it's easer to attack and dismiss something you don't understand. Just like those that don't get BTC saying it's a ponzi etc. ICO's are not the only thing ETH enables. I personally think they both will change the world... but to each their own.

@_date: 2018-06-17 11:35:05
your ignorance is showing.. you might want to stop here before you get rekt. Modular decentralised, trustless, borderless, peer to peer protocols... but it's probably far to advanced for your little pea brain. 
You probably can't even tell me what the major difference in the BTC and ETH blockchain is and why ETH is just as revolutionary as BTC is.
I too was a Bitcoin maximalist for a long time. But have recently had my mind firmly changed. It's coming and it's far more than ICO's and crypto kitties. I've had the pleasure of integrating one of these protocols in the past 2 weeks and had my mind firmly blown.

@_date: 2018-06-17 11:29:30
Because the Layer 2 Protocols aren't built out yet.. People are putting the cart before the horse.. you want dapps, but the infrastructure isn't built out yet. You want web 2.0 quality apps built on Geocities infrastructure... cool your jets a bit. The blockchain doesn't fully enable Dapps, it's a Layer 1 protocol.. It enables the facilitation of dapps, but there is an entire world of shit we need to replicate before we're ready to deliver web 2.0 quality apps. There is so much that needs to be built out on top of ETH before it's even remotely viable to build the type of apps people are expecting. For instance.. Recurring Subscriptions, large high speed data stores, etc..

Because Ethereum is just as important as Bitcoin... Bitcoin gives us a money layer.. ETH gives us an application layer.. Just because ETH enabled shitcoins doesn't make it a shitcoin.. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:47:16
I did answer the question...
Modular, trustless, borderless, permisionless, peer to peer protocols. You answer the question.. what's the difference between BTC and ETH blockchains?
And why are they NOTHING alike.. In fact will work harmoniously together to create a beautiful decentralized web3 world.
Bitcoin is a currency.  Ethereum is not.

Learn about what's called "Use it or Lose it".. The government has a program called Use it or Lose it. What this program states is that if your department does not use your entire budget this year, next year your budget will be smaller.
Because department heads never want to have a smaller budget, they will spend every last cent in the budget to make sure they get a larger budget next year.
This means we upgrade completely viable network hardware at nearly 5x the actual MSRP cost, and then we destroy it the next year and replace it with new gear.. Why do we destroy it? Because it had government data on it. Can never be resold. We would buy Cisco 3560G's one year for $10k each and destroy them the next year and replace them with Cisco 3560X's for $10k each.

does not count as an outage as while not performing at peak performance, is still performing. no one anywhere in the IT industry counts degraded service as an outage in their uptime calculations. SLA rules are very strict in what is considered an "outage".

@_date: 2018-04-18 15:35:33
I assure you if PayPal is having payment delays they're not going to count that as an outage.
Twilio defines an outage as such:
2.1 “Unavailable Time” means the Twilio API is not available for use according to third party performance and monitoring services contracted by Twilio at its sole discretion (the “Monitoring Service”). The Monitoring Service reports of availability is currently available at status.twilio.com; provided that service issues or outages relating to any Exclusions (defined below) shall not be deemed as Unavailable Time.
2.2 “Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of continuous 5 minute periods during the Service Month in which the Twilio API was in a state of “Unavailable Time” as identified by Monitoring Service
NOT AVAILABLE FOR USE.. The network was certainly available for use. You just chose not to partake because it was to expensive. Read up on SLA's and what constitutes an outage in the IT industry.
You don't need one when taking a cab either, but it existed... the network was still working, but if you want to get mad and say it was offline to make yourself feel better go ahead and do so. Generally when people resort to name calling it's because they've got nothing left. Have a good day sir!
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:04:07

If you're sending crypto to coinbase be VERY careful. They're going to screw americans sometime soon. Every transfer to my coinbase account shows up as a line item for "Payment for Goods or Services"
Which has got to be some kind of wrong for them to be determining what type of transactions things are. My business partner also received a 1099 from Coinbase for his shift card for 40k........ He was claimed to be a contractor? When he was just buying groceries..
Taxes are so messed up right now around crypto in the US.

It took 6 hours to rectify, but at no point did either fork stop working until consensus decided one should be abandoned.(i know because I was busy shitting pants wondering whats about to happen to my hodlings). Meaning that both networks were working. What happened was hashing power was moved to the 0.7 fork to accelerate it past the 0.8 fork. After that the 0.8 fork was abandoned.  Again, not an outage and if anything, looking back on it now I would say working as intended. Consensus at work.
