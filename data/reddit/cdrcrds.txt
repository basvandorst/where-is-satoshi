Property is the intrinsic longterm holding for the average person.
Pick a growing city with a stable middle class. Use wiki.
Back in 2012 on my first speculative play I trippled an investment and used the proceeds as a down payment. Back in November of 2015 my speculative play from March doibled and Im making my second property purchase. The equity on my first home helps me establish a reasonable down payment along with the bitcoin.
The way I see it, although my leverage is in equity that has to be tapped with a line of credit, being able to pay the mortgage theough investment ventures in a hoghly educated city with a strong service sector, enables me to double up in the long run with my high risk venture. In the mean time this lets me pay off my mortgage while I continue building a solid foundation with securities.
With the advent of automation property that's owned will at least cater to a petite borgouise.
The key to financial independence is taking chances and sewing the foundations of financial indepence within long-term timeframes.

As someone who works in the financial industry I was happy about it 5 years ago. It was a great medium of exchange for the SR days and although the novelty has warn off sociologists are starting to develop studies indicating that in North America the application to use this form of exchange to acquire illegal narcotics actually helped accelerate the decriminalization. Also there is a generation of people who have never had to buy drugs on the street now; quality has increased due to social formats that cut out the middle men and maintain higher profit margins ensuring high quality.
In spite of this I eventually started spending on things that I wanted to see succeed; such as DIY comics and most recently technology. I pay less in orders for say the raspberry pi3 than I would using my VISA or Mastercard and also avoid exchange rates and administration fees. 
Part of this is due to what happened last november where the price ballooned exponentially and I cashed out to take in profits, however this experience was no different than what I do with the U.S dollar; where by at times where the currency appeared to be heavily undervalued I speculated that the adoption of major institutions including my bank would stabilize the price and increase its value as transactions reached critical mass.
SO I suppose its worked well as a savings account. I take out what I don't need in it but always keep enough to levy an opportunistic purchase. 
I never dabbled with mining; by the time I understood it I found the machines too unreliable and unreasonable in contrast to organizations that made it a full time business. I think that after 2013 individuals who speculated would have done better than individuals who may only have been able to have a modest home system.

Well to me it seems more to sustain a certain status quo regarding the morality in the use of illicit substances. So even though we know that harm reduction programs and education in using substances safely doesn't appeal to an old condition of prohibition and morality.
As people begin to understand that brutalizing drug users is ineffective and naive those laws will change.
In a way its partly about controlling the perceived understandable elements of the society. Opium/Heroin is was banned to undermine asian immigrants. Pot prohibition was used to undermine the mexican south american and black cultures and luckily the permissiveness of our liberal culture is beginning to understand that race played a role.
Take note there are two types of cocaine users, two types of heroin users. The one with a high social pedigree and the one who was born into poverty. In most cases the poor are brutalized by the system.
The mexican drug war is a good example. It's the poorest who get caught up in murdering each other for territory. But the mexicans work well with italian and asian factions in canada. Like on a corporate level where you can buy drugs through brokers and most disputes are not between wholesalers but rather smaller gangs in poor communities.

That nefarious tone is quickly disappearing don't worry. The large players now include Richard Branson and Mark Zuckerberg.
Also in Large Cities actual boutique exchanges handle the processing of bitcoins so you don't need cash or bitcoins to get them anymore not to mention that its established that certain markets facing turbulent money issues are using bitcoin as a means to protect their financial interest. See Russian expats in Cyprus who fear the banks are gonna hold their funds have dumped millions into bit coin or how Syrian factions use bitcoin to purchase commodities for their domestic market place as foreign investment has left due to civil unrest.
Bit coin is here to stay and economic undergrads regurgitating their professors inability to make sense of the way bitcoin actually works can suck it cause bit coin is kind of like a tech stock rather than a currency and with JP Morgan starting the underwriting process to establish a regulating body for it its inevitable that people will prefer a bit coin transaction that costs no fees to make an amazing purchase over a paypal fee that gouges vendors.

What is this some kind of libertarian loser?
I mean inflation at least helps the people who borrowed pay back at a better rate due to the greed from lenders. Ok so it sucks that the dollar is diluted but trust me if you are not a saver and you are involved in pratical equity building such as home purchases you could ended paying your debt back faster and also rewarding yourself with more purchasing power since you have invested your money in a market place that rewards you for inflation.
I'd rather have modest inflation at %5 than a deflationary Bush era catalyst disaster like a deflationary period. God damn at least the inflation right now will reward those who managed to survive the worst era in post generation X history.
Yes I know that things could be better but from an anecdotal position his argument would harm far more people in the long run. I'm not saying we should have inflation at the rate that it exists in Russia or Venezuala or several African countries. I'm saying this is better than nothing.
The private sector could do more to help workers by letting the minimum wage go up though and help them become borrowers. That's the part of the economy that could do better with having the opportunity of earning more and eventually buying homes since all they do now is rent.

Coolio ty.
I will try all of them out and then come back with a review. So far I do appreciate that Canadian Bitcoins pays attention to social media outlets. I think I complained on every social platform and they responded to all. But the solution model I find is merely engage advise and educate but from a net promoter perspective there is a lack of empathy.
For instance being from a financial sector a lot of people tend to do dumb things and as insincere as it may be perceived if someone is complaining that their experience was crapped due to ignorance it still helps to begin the engagement with something like "I'm sorry to hear that we didn't meet your needs...[then educate] this is what you can do to prevent that from happening in the future."
Without conveying empathy a company no matter how large risks burning a bridge and repeat business. 
Not me though I will hold the grudge until the day I die.

On your second point you can base the US greenback as the currency for terrorists, drug dealers, and child pornographers.
Money is money and although gold as commodity makes sense the reality is that the capitalist structure that pervades the world means that consumers will desire a simple and accessible medium of exchange.
I could carry around a half ounce of Gold and want to buy the latest iphone model but its more likely that an apple store with a QRcode bitcoin address  provides me with my consumption needs where as the half ounce gold in my pocket would be declined as a method of payment even at a store like apple.
Lets face it Bitcoin is easy and practical. It's not about hedging those bets for most people. It's going to be about can I pay the least amount for transaction fees and still get what I want.
If the illegal (in most countries) elements have proven anything its that as far as digital currency is concerned one can agree on the value despite its volatility.
I think that the general population shouldn't be underestimated when it comes to its desire to consume. After all most of western society has been indoctrinated with material need. If bitcoin makes it even easier for them to get what they want it shouldn't be that hard for them to adopt it.
Besides there are more cell phones in peoples pockets than there are wallets and cell phones if anything will be the futures wallets. Bitcoins potential for growth is worth the risk considering how cheap it is. Just buy low sell high and don't bet the farm on it, perhaps if you hold onto it long enough you'll be using it to offset your early retirement needs.

Idk how many of you missed your chance to make some coin. Last november was amazing for me and i only dumped pay checks into it in march. Before i was mainly just chucking a few bills here and there. I guess back in 2012 when i had put $60 in 2011 i learned my lesson because all i used those gains for were on silk road for weed a potent ounce if i do recall and heroin but that was good too but only a couple of points. Which is funny because weed is so legal in my country now.
Im not a genius either. I just work for a bank and know that our insitution is testing block chain shit in the wild and they know this transaction method would get rid of a lot of over head. I.e service workers and paper pushers. Which if you think about is good. The interesting part is how it has the potential to undermine their market share in the way homemade porn undermines studio porn marketshare.

Anyway.

I bought 5 years ago kid.
You pull out a little. Put it in and spec stocks (maybe %20 of assets) like $mnkd and beleave pharmaceuticals. Maybe you meet a mining salesman and he tells you about a place in Timmins Canada called Kirklandlake. Sudenly its now and you've learned to live on leverage pay less taxes than the average shlub and developed the kind of complex revulsion toward human beings. I mean I like people but I have contempt for the inhumane aspects. The kind where your boss is trained to train you by acting like your best friend. Its like please don't patronize me. I probably would kill myself if I wasn't in business for myself. If I didn't get lucky. But how lucky was I? In terms of context. I am born in the now and we are already all lucky. Inheriting the evolution. What we have access to is the evolution revolution. So to speak. Timing was good. I had seen google blow up from $70 and held facebook based on that notion. Its not like I had more than 10k in assets. As per college debt I probably was negative 5k on that. But I was young and had noticed cultural inflections pass me buy. I enjoyed the allure of narcotics and was there in the silkroad era. But amusingly the access made me less interested in illicit goods. In fact in my country with the advent of silkroad the goods I would procure have since become decriminalized or legal or will be legal in less than a year. Its amazing being part of that. I liken it to being in the Rolling Stones in 68 not realizing that in 69 you have already made it you would tour the midwest and be associated with a cultural revolution. Thats what btc kind of really is. Its a medium of exchange of information and information is so unqiuotus and valuable that we take for granted how important encryption is. I saw that then bt couldn't put it into words until I had diversified my portfolio.
But I only ever sold bitcoin by buying things with it. Raspberry pis, Ramin Nazer books legal tender Including stocks. Eventually the stocks pay in cash. Or gold. Or uwti.
Whatever's hot or was hot.
You hold it and it still grows. There will be others. But you can't take for granted the brand. 
I also hold lite coin. Same amount tbh
Yet it only grew 1/20th of what btc did and you know why?
Because they are like vhs tapes against beta shit.
I dont even understand it other than a necessary means of transmitting information. But the average consumer only needs a certain level of information to be seemlessly used; right now. Maybe when im dead in 1day or 39 years There will be others worth what this is worth and pacing at its rate.
But until then i say do yourself a favor. Drop a few grand. Bet you it pays for your meaningless college degree in this bulshit planet we live on.
Edit: I went back and edited. I developed insomnia and a fear of missing out. I haphazardly post. But in no way am I endorsing reckless gambling. Im saying devote yourself to understanding the world that interests you. I mean I missed out on NVDIa because I took for granted how they cornered the VR market. So there are always opportunities to invest out there. The trick is to be patient and occupy yourself with a life. In the mean time I shed a bad relationship and enjoyed my paradigm shift. I found someone that complemented me in a manner that improves my perspective and challenges me to think beyond my own selfish musings. So its not like I am saying sell your soul and furniture for 5k and sit on a warm sandiego bench until this thing gaps up another %500. Im saying keep your mind open for the new thing that fits into the current consumerist world. Throw a $1 at it on monday and $2 on tuesday maybe $4 on wednsday and $8 on Thursday. Maybe try that monthly to start. Work your way up to biweekly then weekly then daily and so on. 
I kind of hoped for ethereums model to catch on because people could get paid at the end of completing a task or the day of accounting for inventory. It would probably threaten money stores viability.
But i digress. I went back to edit because the people you work with will probably be the biggest assholes. But its a nice feeling tendering your resignation and not being inclined to explain anything. Just keep your nose clean tow the corporate line and then *poof* you are free from this endentured nightmare most humans call a life. You can focus on stop motion animation and maybe nano bot farming. The future is creative.

These are tripple baggers.
Good legal teams.
Yes but these have the best scaling capacity.
Legalization will provide a 7 billion dollar market; if you cant selll under $2.00 a gram youll go out of business. These listed do that except vodis whos model is rental space.
Edit:rumor is liberals are delaying legalization for more campaign leverage in the provinces. But analysts hope for an April date. I give the time frame a wide range of April to October for legalization. I expect dissapointment ain spring with good buying opportunities. But right now these ones show tight share structures where owners are buying into their companies. Probably because they have liberal party lawyers on their board of directors. The latter is speculation about cultural cronyism but Ive been proven right before on an investment with bombardier. So essentially ease into it like a hot bath. The swings are extreme but all of these companies are runners.

GTo date I have a small bitcoin position but 4 years ago it was a considerable one and it doubled my investment. It allowed me to invest in other commidities such as gold which again doubled up and then I was diversifying in utilities and banks which improved majorly through obama's tenure finally im an income bracket i never thought possible in the face of undergraduate economy students regurgitating their professors bull shit that this was a ponzi scheme of sometype the same people who were telling me not to put my money in facebook and so on so if bitcoin was a paradigm for me it must have been a paradigm for many of you who put their money where their mouth was and i salute you in congruency as a professional investor today i want to invite you put your money into the canadian weed sector in particular the company beleave , supreme pharmaceuticals, aphria, canopy growth and vodis pharmaceuticals; there are others but they remain behind in contrast to licenses and development.
Good luck to all!

Now its our vested interest to create bitcoin businesses to encourage more commerce a more efficient commerce. Don't worry btc will work along side plebian means of exchange like vISA or to a crude extent pay pal.

There is good debt and bad debt.
Im a bitcoin investor simce the 4th year of bitcoin existence. I made out alright and diversified. The process let me leverage my investments. Meaning i borrowed money increasing my purchasing power. A 6 figure trade in a nasdaq stock earned me 6 figures in 90 days enabling me to pay back the margin.
Then i have a skillful accountant that advises on how to ise my margin to keep my income down. As long as my stocks stay in conservative companies like utilities or banks my dividend pays for itself and instead of worrying about tax issues i just spend about %2-3 to the bank for the margin. Substantially less expensive.
The. There is real estate which helps too. Thats good debt. I could out right pay for the houses but its better to keep the mortgage at just the right level for minimum cost and then tapping the equity to grow my businesses. My business in the end help me defer income tax. Over all its a whole lot of paper pushing out of the way of taxes but eventually if i keep growing my capital will grow.
If i stop growing my businesses with debt it could affect employees and so on. So its like a double edge sword.
You need to make debt work for you. If its just consumer debt. That audi r9 you drive around isn't going to mean much. But you could lease it instead and pay less in the long run for consumer goods and then invest in growing businesses with debt.
I am not an academic. I went to school for philosophy and went to law school until i realized working that hard to be in the service of people isnt worth as much as recognizing we are all entrenched by capitalism. Lets not swim against the current. I plan to retire in my 50s and if the market crashes put a bullet in my brain.
Good luck!

Trying to tell me how it was a ponzi scheme because of what his economics professor said.
It's like fuck man. You get to college you learn to take beliefs with a grain of salt. Determine your future. Recognize what has value. I couldn't even begin to explain that the technology alone was something that would exist in part with current mediums of exchange. That as technology improved so would the demand for its use and although it may not dismantle the whole structure as we know it it is more likely to afford us things we couldn't do before. Things that we will one day take for granted.
Wasn't going to waste my time. I just held onto that shit until i diversified. For practical reasons.
But anyway.
For things like this. Our attitude should be not to acknowledge it. I still have some coins in my wallets. The way they gain value speaks for itself.
It allows us to see a market that we didn't want to acknowledge existed.
But i digress. I should be studying.

In march i speculated that the peice was too low and it would have a noce pump. This was based on this one time i bought $60 worth of bitcoin in 2012. I forgot about it. A year goes by and was dabling with tor and sr is there and i check my wallet and i have something like $400 . Weed and heroin arrive in the mail shortly there after.
Probably the purest h ive ever come across. But what do i know im lucky enough to be an aficionado of sorts.
Months later i read that botcoin goes to some crazy price point. I cant believe what i missed on but take solace in that i technically still made money.
So this past march i finally have a career going and a good pay and i dump a few thousand into based on passed dreams and expectations. Also i remember old acquaintances from the facebook ipo blab to me that fb was a bad investment because it was litterally myspace or something plebians say after reading drudgereport headlines so ya this november the money i put where my mouth was paid and i got a nice little home going just on that. Best part is the income wasnt taxed because i used a retirement savings to defer the initial profit. Naturally i have to pay that back but the equity from the home will suffice unless my city has a catastrophic economic or natural disaster. So basically sure bitcoin is speculative. But so was facebook. I didnt have the money for face book during that ipo but i understood its merits. One of bitcoins merits is that it works. Maybe not perfectly but the proof of concept is appealing to major organizations. I say dont bet the farm. Just ride it out and have your accounts that can exchange Bitcoin to cash ready. So you dont suffer so much from the hedge companies put in place when you want to exchange.

You're definitely not sober.
Yeah I mean I love the technology and work for a financial institution who has chosen to stay out of this. We are also in the top ten but not the top 3 FI (In Canada) but the top FI's have gotten involved on some level. Culturally there is adoption. It threatens the archaic wire transfer models so the technology will get to a level where people wont even know they were using bitcoin to send money to another person in a large sum (over $5k for email money transfer). This is good. This is what I anticipate. 
Anyway I bough my position in march. I'm unloading when major FI's announce earnings post christmas. 
I'll sell on the rumour and reposition when the currency settles down. 
I put in a reasonable amount. Less than %1 for what I make in a year.
But the gains are inherently an average persons wage for a month. That's not bad in my books. 
But its all a speculative play for something I understand matters for the future even if it has no solid footing right now. 
I did this out of experience too.
In terms of technology investments that is how I view bitcoin. Its not a stock but a technology. I missed out on investing in GOOG because I was too young and I missed out on FB because well I had no money yet. But even though I know I have made other investments which provide me a reasonable living I think in contrast to say TWITTER stock. I'm likely to do better with TWITTER than with Bitcoin. 
Having said all that. Bitcoin speculative plays are a lot more fun.
I would have lost %5 of my investment if the chinese hadn't devalued their currency.
I couldn't have guessed they were going to do that. I just put what I wouldn't notice at the end of the month and thats what I would suggest for anyone with little capital.
Learning to use the software to buy things with the currency is also great. We shouldn't be intimidated. Younger people will naturally learn how to use it. Especially those who don't get to have credit cards or even bank accounts to horde their minuscule wealth.

But trust me our FI is all up in Fintechs business and we wont make the mistake (canada) that taxi companies did keeping the archaic technology until uber showed up.
Cryptocurrency and the blockchain is ingenious and will work alongside for consumers because although younger people easily use alternative banking means the status quo for some god awful reason is intimidated by fintech. But as it evolves all the major banks right now are poiring money into two things.
Improve customer service because its easy to switch.
Improve fintech models of business to reduce overhead.

I never invested four years ago. I got some for $20 and used it to order $60 worth of weed from a (now) legal dispensarie in Colorado after ignore it for a year.
Then i saw the price and was thinking.
"damn first i missed out on google cause too young and then facebook because its for old people and how they actually make money doesnt make sense to me and i thought i missed out on bit coin but inside the thought was thinking damn its cheap now lets see what happens."
So since its lowest point ive been tossing shit at it here and there and making social media deals with great comedians like Ramin Nazer who sent his books after a bitcoin haggle (totally worth it btw i suggest picking up his after you die book) and well im rambling but just really want bit coin to be a mainstay in future transaction services.
As a banker by trade this is a great technology and i wonder what else it can be applied to. Its very rudimentary but if at some point exchanges can seemlessly trade from a major fiat currency and then back to bitcoin and then back to fiat then welll fuck that changes the whole game and can see consumers having a better choice in the digital market place.

I got a ticket for stunt driving. Vet cop was really upset and his minx of a partner stood near rear passenger door sizing me up. I wanted to tell them I was just excited because 5 years ago I invested $5000 in bitcoin. Not all at once mind you. It took about a year to buy up to those levels. People telling me the same thing they did about facebook. Its going to flop. It wont do well. Its a ponzi scheme. Im just glad I ignored those conventional types. Ended up diversifying into a number of securities. 
But yeah. He gave me $247 ticket and a short monologue on the dangers of turning the red as hard as I did. According to him I was on two wheels. I felt in full control. Soft tires on my 2009 sonata. A beater i like to drive because im sentimental about my first car and my gf was working so she takes the suv. But it didn't even hurt. The ticket. Nor the threat of my insurance going up. Bit coin has made me into an arrogant person. But man was it worth it to horrify on lookers. The kids loved it. Even though I meekly said "yes officer" money changes you. Especially if you didn't have it growing up and your father was the type who worked hard and never had anything to show for it.

so you're in denial that the construct you bring up had not imposed the perspective that women didnt deserve to not only earn a viable wage and seem to ignore the utter dehumination within the capitalist model because it is patriarchal.  just because women and abolitionists strived to improve the conditions for women themselves doesn't provide a basis in any way shape or form a romantic view to the current structure which is going to continie to crumble under its own unsustainable weight. 
womens right improving has more to the fact that women confront the patriarchal establishment and arent satisfied with the paltry advances within the structure.  in fact it only gets better because it loses viability and so the status quo evolves to adopt forms of organization that dismantle its patriarchal subjugation. 
just because prisoners receive an extra slice of bread doesnt mean the prison has become better because it answered a few demands from those born into the prison.  quit deluding yourself urban decay is rampant and it is the deconstruction through socialist endeavors that enables some people from certain intelectual classes to seperate themselves from the proles but man youre deluding yourself if you think the economic model is not as shitty as it is because its foundations werent steeped in patriarchal entitlements. 
the irony is that at least if you can code,  finance and own property you can do well but if you rely on service jobs that are going to be automated in the near future capitalism and its basic premise to produce at cost will require corporate heads to fire people. 
maybe thats a good thing though
because the inadequacies of the patriarchal structure will finally. give way under its own unsustainable weight and people will completely lose faith in the status quo that subjugated and enslaved everyone on earth.

What i like about bitcoin is that in terms of limited wealtu it makes sense to use the medium of exchange for the smallest of transactions.
While some people mostly in north america percieve it to be too complicated for plebian use i give poor people more credit than they are given, seening as their ingenuity has propelled other elements of planetary culture.

This nerdy Canadian looking hipster is touching upon the insights of philosopher David Hume. He once posited the concept that passion is a human trait however human beings should not be driven by passion but rather use rationality as something that can tame passionate ideas for reason, as reason is far better than evolving into sloganeers who want to advance inane political aims.

You live in a world where [boko haram]( takes women as slaves and our civilian government would rather get involved in a military conflict with Syria.
Economic enfranchisement eases the plight of the objected &amp; subjected but its still going down. I'm not having a problem with minimum wage workers being indentured into the system (as we are born into the structure) but man its naive to think that any improvement on the conditions were because of the goodwill of the structured patriarchs. It has been direct confrontation and the dismantling of things like "traditional values," "the protestant ethic." which advances civil rights. But to sit on your hands and think because predominantly white women are doing a little better because of the romantic ideals of neo-liberal thought is a crock of shit. It isn't good enough because the structure attempts to co-opt the liberal ideal, it creates collaborators, but it doesn't cede control the way it should because the only way is it's inevitable destruction.
Amusing though, I am in finance. It's what verifies the perspective and the view is this. Some people know and understand what you have to do to survive, but there are those who will not subject themselves to become sloganeers. That is to say that in spite of the ideal it's completely rational to be a part of the system and the system does give a fuck if you are white cis entitled male and you as a black educated woman still has to work twice as hard any man and receive half the compensation with little credit to the merit she has. The system does know and just because a bunch of white under educated men in the nobody gives a fuck part of the United States reassure themselves that the system has betrayed them it is rather a symptom that even within the lack of achievement in their ideal that they didn't become as wealthy as they thought they would or have as much meaningless sex as they were taught they were entitled to these men, the young men from reddit and mens rights groups and most of the white libertarian men resemble the disenfranchised and humiliated elements of society that would be the first to subject indignities to anyone who isn't white if there wasn't so much risk to the inequity of the structure accelerating the unsustainable nature of it's own self inflicted demise.
They just don't get that in terms of culture their softness, their weakness, their lack of merit and inability to compete with other individuals has a lot more to do with the entitlement men received for centuries that now, in this era, those who are women and those who are not white develop an ethic that sets them apart. I mean you ask anyone in the lost generation what their educational background is and if they can do math, or program or even speak another language, they don't. Yet there are so many immigrants coming from even more unequal backgrounds that they know that in this prison system we live under you got to be able to know how subjugated you are to be educated and be disciplined so that the life you choose can be liberated with some economic reward. If the situation was reversed, in an instant every single cis misogynist white man in this forum would have starved to death by now, holding their greasy circumcised penis, still wanting and wondering why all they could ever amount to is being a wanker.

Try going to any  coin direct this Holland based broker service partners with a variety of banks around the world. I'm in Canada. I had a terrible experience using Canadian bitcoin. It was slow, the service representative was condescending and its like they bank on the current limits with bitcoin processing however any direct coin was amazing. AMAZING it's like a great example of how awesome bitcoin or a variety of other cryptocurrency purchases can be. It can be easy.
So try any direct coin. There are referral programs and I found after I went the through the verification process the bitcoin are in my wallet immediately.
It was even fast verifying. It took 20 minutes at most unlike the deplorable system employed by canadianbitcoins who took a week to verify my documents.
I'll never recommend canadianbitcoins just stay away from that predatory and lazy service provider. Give any direct coin a shot. I'm confident your experience will be good and when you verify you documents you will be buying everything from bitcoin litecoin and even doge

Also there is nothing sexist within recognizing and scrutinizing the patriarchal structure. The scrutiny that the patriarchy is under is merely holding the structure accountable for the systemic death it unleashes on people through it's justification for inequality.
It's why wars, happen, it's why exploitation happen. So we have our calm fortunate life, it still only means if you happen to have some affinity with people due to your class you avoid the ever present indignities that most will suffer.

As someone who is professionally affiliated with the financial industry the main consensus at least with my institution is basically this.
"What is Bit Coin? is it Money? It's not money it's a technology you say? How do you sell it? You don't sell it unless it goes up in value? Who backs it? Nobody backs it? Why would you buy it? Why not just use credit cards they are insured? Why not just use debit that's real money? What what it doesn't make any sense this is too complicate..."
But in anycase these are generation X types who struggled to get into executive roles because well it's tough, a lot of Baby Boomers clung to their positions in life for as long as possible. Understandably so. That generation is completely coddled anyway and if they're white oh man don't get me started on the general entitlement they have.
In any case Bit coin for middle management staff is kind of a novelty. I'm just being real about vices and ethics. Most people who work in high powered professions have to be immensely social to rise and so with this comes a lot of drinking and or drug abuse. Within it dabbling in illicit trade is the equivalent to someone blowing their bonus on Carnivale, Sex Workers and hunting slaves on an indigenous island somewhere off the coast of an insignificant island within territorial waters controlled by the Portuguese government.
It's there. It's understood that it is there. It makes sense because of the intuitive understanding that if you  have a consensus on value you can exchange something with the medium.
So it is the future. But it will be different. It will be Do you want to use the Iphone app that connects you to a cloud to make transactions or do you prefer this versatile wallet based system that can be used from everything like a wallet sized raspberry pie running ubuntu to the next android flag ship model.
It's also relatively cheap and efficient to access. Not any less troublesome than applying for a bank account at a bank or applying for a credit card and waiting to 2-4 weeks to find out if you're approved. It also enables you to access things you never thought possible.
For instance I bartered with a Local Comedic Celebrity in Arizona named Nazim Razer for his books and well it worked out for both of us because I got the books I wanted at the price I wanted and within the same day the volatilty of the currency increased to his listed price for the books.
Early adopters seem to be people who are small business vendors who are reamed by the fees banking and credit institutions impose. If one more alternative leads to a sale that retains the integrity of the sale, at least with a fast enough time to turn into the local fiat currency then I think it will be a reasonable alternative amongst the methods people already use. Especially with the acesibility factor. One can't take for granted how many people have phones in their pockets. Some who live in parts of the world where they are too poor to be allowed bank accounts. In a way this allows them some storage and access to funds and enables them to begin participating in the broader avenues of commerce.
But I digress. The establishment fears bit coin because it doesn't know how it can benefit from it yet. It means the contingency in place right now is hold the course until the demand within society makes it necessary to impose the structural changes to adopt the new paradigm.
I think we should teach women more about this. In my community I talk to reporters all the time about this. Mainly for my purposes. But lets not be so ethno centric with this technology. There is half the population that would also reason that something like Bit Coin can empower certain individuals.

Puh-lease it just validates an immature conquest game that reinforces hyper conformity. The idea stemming that being merely there entitled one as a man confined within the conditioned gender to sex with a woman. It is dogma. It is lame. It merely is a demonstration of the limitations within the mainstream conditions which continue to perpetuate patriarchal servitude and limits people to live within the confines of societal scripts.
It's changing though and 50 shades proves nothing other than that very fact in which most people don't even realize how they are conditioned to behave.
tl:dr: It's kind of like how people use the beatles as an example to what a great rock band is. Selling a lot of books or records within the confines of the structure only reinforces those who dictate what is good and not what actually is. Let's be real general society is conditioned to consume a lot of crap to make itself feel involved but its not doing anything to advance society in any way when it fails to scrutinize the commodification for the shallow purpose of consumption. But I don't expect you to understand anything. You'll continue to be white and safe and eventually you'll get fat and this brief anecdotal example you had will have faded into a tit for tat because you're the refuse that lines the intestines of society. Eat, shit validate a fuck and that's just about it.

This is pretty hyperbolic. Houses can generate income if you're in the property management business.
Speculators who flip do so because of demand so it's not so bad if rates are at all time lows.
This is a Canadian perspective. For the last ten years they've warned housing will implode however nobody really wants to settle anywhere outside of the major cities. Vancouver and Toronto so it's reasonable to consider why on a broad level housing is a viable 5 year investment. With growth rate at %20 to %30 in profit those are margins worth working with since they are on par with the stock market.

Don't be like that man. Reddit is already associated with being a place full of loser heterosexual guys who have no consideration for women. Its unnecessary and demeans you both. She probably doesn't care about vanity and thats fine. We should judge individuals by the merit of their character and not the colour of their lipstick.

Isn't it more likely they just incorporate Bitcoin and back it?
@_date: 2013-10-03 12:11:39
Yeah. Considering some drugs are legal in some parts of the world I think bit coin is here to stay. A bitcoing exchange just opened downtown toronto.

In Canada 4 of the 5 banks are accepting the transactions with out complaints.
The only straggler doesn't even seem to be aware of the technology.
Maybe right now its a policy issue due to the anti money laundering regulations banks have to abide by?

If it makes you feel better 2.5 years ago I bought bitcoins as a gag. This summer I looked in my account and was like woah. So I spent $1200 and smoked and shot *not illegal things* into my veins.

If you are addicted to opiates it was reasonably cheaper to go to heroin from say morphine or oxy.
So there is that instance that some drugs are only used as a result of the expense the legal ones have especially if you don't have a drug plan.

Oh thanka for reassurin me. I had just learned the process and browsed from flash drives and coffee shops.
I wanted to get a hold of 2ci it used to not be illegal. I even had them administered at my church.

On the tornet there is a group that will get this back for you but charge you a %50 mercenary fee.

If a good crypto lawyer represents him he can beat most of the charges. They'll get him for money laundering tho. Maybe plead out to tax evasion and then employ him to help undermine the measures he created but by then it will be too late.

Are you a potato?

It was called the church of 2ci. In early 2000 2ci was legal in Canada. You can make a donation to the church and you'd recieve for $10 a small bag of 16 or so pills. When 2ci was designated as contraband the church of 2ci disbanded.
