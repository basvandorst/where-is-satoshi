Yap, probably 2018 and 2019 will be boring... I think we'll see some serious action after halving starting in 2020  and a peak in 2021 around 100.000$

That's one of the reasons that mining fees are important, you need a lot of transactions in each block to pay the miners in the future, or else each transaction will be incredibly expensive. That's why a 1mb block will be to small in the future IMO,  but I do not want to enter this discussion...

Using this analysis, probably during this year and the beginning of 2019 we can have prices even lower than the current one, just see the bottom line, it is natural to hit it again. IMO I think the estimate curve line is too optimistic. But overall I think the graph is correct, and makes a correct estimate of the future BTC price.
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:28:13
True! :P
@_date: 2018-08-01 10:29:28
I think the projection of the price will not be a line, but a logarithmic curve, based on a logarithmic (non-linear) regression.

*Everyone wants to hate on me. This is the result. If you’d left me alone, I would have sat on my fucking money and you wouldn’t have to worry. And the biggest whale ever has to dump because he has to pay tax. It’s not a transfer. Florida has an estate tax. Trust me. This is not an outcome I would have liked. I own a lot of BTC. Dave should have owned 320,000 and I should have had 800,000 and now it’s 50/50. At the end of the day, that’s not a good thing for BTC.*

True, but you can also think the other way around, if you have 1 million dollars and spend it on a average live style, without any other income in 20 years you will be broke... Actually people who receive the lottery   
typically go broke in much less time...

There is no magic formula to trade. It's impossible to be sure that by trading you will win. Trading is always a game against the other traders. You can win, but you can also lose. For example now, no one knows if the fiat value of bitcoin goes up or down. It can go down... but it can also go up. 
I do not understand you guys :(
1 BTC IS ALWAYS 1 BTC, THE VALUE DOES NOT CHANGE!

Yes, its just a naive projection, only time will tell.
I will continue to update the graph in this thread in the next years.
The upper limit has very little data / confidence, anything is possible, probably a lower line would be better I don't know, but the lower limit has some solid ground.

If I buy a watch, using this definition , the watch has value for me, and I can hold it forever. But with a currency I do not understand how we can apply this definition, is what we can buy with the currency that gives value to the currency. If I can not spend the currency, then it has no value to me. A Bitcoin is worth what I can buy with it now, and eventually it's worth what I can buy with it in the future.
