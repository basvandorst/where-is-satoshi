You're right. Once they pegged it to gold at Isaac Newton's proposal did all those great things happen. Conversely,  China didn't get off the silver standard until 1935, and their wealth devalued by over 70% because of that.

The same way they do it with gold. They give you paper gold. So 5 people own the same oz of gold, but none of them have it physically. This is impossible if you hold the private keys or hold gold physically.

The devaluation of their wealth only topped at 70% at that time. It was a gradual process and had already devalued substantially before any cultural factors had an effect. India was also one of the last to get off the silver standard and also had a massive devaluation of their wealth. The first countries to convert from silver to the gold standard saw the most out of it, such as Britain being able to conquer most of the world.

If there is no electricity, that means credit cards won't work, and physical cash being less than 10% of the total supply is going to lead to much more problems than thinking about Bitcoin. Also you can send Bitcoin through Blockstream's satellites and also through SMS and radio waves.

It's the day the Genesis block was mined.

The movement is meant for noobs who joined in this year. Most of the people who joined in the last year haven't heard of My Gox. It's just for them to realize that if they don't hold their probate keys, it's not their coins.

They take the BTC and instantly convert it to $ or whatever else. The point is you've sent it to the person, and it's up to them to do what they please with it. Obviously I agree with the white paper as you do, but not everyone shares that view. This might change in the future, but this is the reality that we live in now.

Why would you leave your coins on a centralized third party? That's exactly what Bitcoin is against. Not your keys, not your coins. And who cares what happens to the exchanges? You pay them fees for every transaction so they are getting a test run on their systems for free on January 3. If you're against this movement, you're against the white paper and everything Satoshi stood for.

If they fork, it just becomes another shitcoin. Only when the nodes come to a consensus is when things are set in stone. If all the nodes coordinate a hard fork, they will move to the new chain and sell off all their coins on the old chain. Without everyone doing that, any fork is destined to fail

This. To anybody who doesn't understand, I suggest reading "The Bitcoin Standard". Great book about monetary history, gold, and of course, Bitcoin.

I agree with you man don't get that wrong. But there is a long way for adoption to go and you can't expect people to accept their wage in Bitcoin when they have to pay their rent in Fiat currencies. That's the only point I'm bringing up. Adoption is just a matter time.

Yeah I agree. When the artificial money comes crashing down, people who are tired of getting f'ed over by the elites will look around for a hard, sound money alternative. And the best option is Bitcoin.

You mean it's not popular yet. There's no one to trust with decentralized exchanges.
