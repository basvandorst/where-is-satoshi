Good to know you will be doing another challenge as I missed this one! :(  I hope the next challenge will be significantly different so as to not give the solvers of this one an advantage?

Its a stupid article written by some clueless guy, stop spreading this around. he didn't even interpret the article that he linked to as his source, properly. The article says that the govt might allow crypto, but it doesn't say anything about fiat-crypto exchanges, which is what the central bank has clamped down on, yet the author makes this claim, making the title of this reddit post invalid as well. So, I mean... reading comprehension please... writing comp... sigh...

Lol.. the guy who didn't read carefully asking me to do so, even when I explained clearly, explicitly what is wrong with the interpretation and title! Let me repeat: the title says "likely to lift ban on crypto trading", however the economic times article talks about the govt allowing crypto, not necessarily fiat trading on exchanges. It is invalid twice: because the eco article does not talk about lifting any ban, and certainly not that of trading. The govt hasn't banned crypto yet so the question of lifting it doesn't arise. The only thing being banned is fiat on crypto exchanges by the RBI, which the govt did not mention today. Is the distinction clear yet?

Precisely why the statement by the govt that they will allow crypto is a meaningless one, meant for PR and a deflection tactic from the other more meaningful news today about the central bank's incompetence.

Because India doesn't make shit. If they let people import everything there will such a fantastic trade deficit like no country has ever seen. Plus, the govt is massively corrupt so they justify yuge import taxes in the name of patriotism and eat up all the tax revenue. And, the sheeple are so destitute that they have more basic things to worry about.

That will only make it worse, because if the price then collapses, then they will be worse off and intensify all the problems. Note, that if the price collapses it doesn't mean the tech dies. The dot com bust did not end the dot coms. But, the price can get high and correct significantly. Even if the bitcoin tech is the future, no one knows what price is right and which companies/currencies will be the winners. Difficult to predict in 2000 which internet companies would do well in the long run.

They changed their license from proper open source. They used to be open source, but now it seems like they only allow code review.

There is a chance that the govt being so stupid may just ignore it not knowing what to do, like it ignores certain sectors like IT and biotech, etc.

I don't understand why they would shut down miners. It would be better for the state to just take them over (maybe even in secret) and in fact ramp them up even more. Is it not? And, in fact, it may have already happened, we may not know about it at all.
