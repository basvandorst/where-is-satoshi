There's no telling whether it will drop to 2k in 4 weeks or soar to 30k. Everything you do is just a lucky guess.
The assumption that makes it feel like a safe investment is that one day it will be worth 50k after steady climbing, we just don't know when.

Not standing still, sure. But bitcoin follows innovation, altcoins are the frontier in that regard. All of the new tech was implemented in other places first.

Started the year with a bunch of dogecoin I had forgotten about. I put it into LTC, rode the initial wave above $10 all the way to 35ish. Then proceeded to trade back and forth to bitcoin. If I had held, I would have 18 LTC right now. If I had expertly traded the dips and rises. I might have had 20k worth of crypto. Instead I turned my 18 LTC into 12 and gave up trying to get ahead by trading

Whatever people are willing to accept them for. Bitcoin got popular as an anonymous currency for black markets, it'll do just fine even if btc itself is banned. Honestly it would be too hard to police to ever effectively shut down.
I'd do the same as what I do today. Use it to buy digital media, things from online stores, etc. Maybe they won't be able to openly accept it, but it's easy enough to message a seller and ask.
Though this whole argument is hypothetical. Bitcoin will never be banned, because at the end of the day it functions more as a commodity investment than a true currency. It would be like banning the sale of polished rocks in gift shops. Sure, they have 0 objective value, but to ban the sale of something so harmless would be a massive overreach of government.

There's a value in being at the front of innovation, even if you're only paving the way for something bigger. Bitcoin 100% would die if new blockchain tech stopped being developed- people would lose interest and move on.

People would just move their farms to countries that allowed it. Even if every country banned cryptocurrency and started religiously shutting down ASIC farms, that would just result in a decrease in mining difficulty. Handling transactions doesn't require a massive amount of processing power, and there would be plenty of people running single miner setups, basically undetectable by government.
