Essentially, the national debt shouldn't be seen as a measure of how deep in shit are we, like your regular credit card debt.
It should be seen as a measure of how much trust and potential people value the American economy and stability. 
Here's an example I always use: 
Say you have money you'd like to invest. There are 2 potential people who are open to taking investment money.
First one is Johnny. Fresh out of college, only 50 bucks in college debt, has a job at Starbucks making 5 a year, has 5 bucks in assets.
Second one is Mr. Brown. Investment banker for 20 years, currently holding 5,000 dollars of other people's money. His only job is investing that money. He's got a fancy car that is an asset of 100.
So Johnny is 40 bucks in the red, 50 - (5+5)
Whereas Mr. Brown has a 4900 debt, 5000 - 100
Who would you give your money to? Johnny, who judging from his significantly lower debt, should spend money better than Mr. Brown?
Not Johnny of course, the logic is simple.
Now let's add in the fact that if you funded Johnny, he'll make you 5 bucks a year, flat, because he can now afford to move to a bigger city and get a better job that pays 15 a year.
But if you funded Mr. Brown, he'll make your investment grow twice as much a year, only taking 10% of that as his fee. Also Mr. Brown has never, ever, lied. He always kept his promises. And he always pays on time.
Johnny is the other countries out there. 
Mr. Brown is the US. 
Everyone trusts the US economy. That debt doesn't mean China or American citizens and businesses can collectively force the US to bend its knees to any and all demands of the creditor right now. It doesn't mean the US is gasping for money. It means that 20 trillion dollar is waiting to be paid out, every single time they come up. And the US government expects to have made more in benefits of many forms than the initial value of the debt it took on by that time.
This is oversimplification but the gist of why the oft-quoted trillion dollar debt scare is a fallacy.

Yah, that's why the US is one of the weakest countries in the world, its society bordering on complete and total collapse, and the Dollar is not even worth an eighth of a yuan right now, and nobody in their right mind ever invests in American industries, hence why NYC is a dead city and Wall Street is mostly known for its hookers.
My model was terribly wrong, I pulled it from a bad publication of "100% complete market knowledge handbook"

Gold is stable.
There is virtually no chance gold will gain or lose 10% of its value overnight. BTC just did several times in the past week.
I'm not saying gold is lucrative. I'm saying in the event of your local economy crashing, moving your money to gold is one of the best ways to save your rear.
It can be very predictable, and its changes do not affect you significantly like cryptocurrency can.
A useful analogy would be a savings account vs a high risk VC.

Depends on the severity of such erosion.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:07:25
Of course not, you can never bet on something perfect.
But in terms of a responsible, intelligent investor of a national size, the US is arguably the best there is. 
I wasn't saying put all your money on the dollar. I was saying, using an eli5 analogy, the 20 trillion dollar debt is *not* something an American should be afraid of, like a looming credit card debt about to expire.

I didn't say trust as in trust the government will not spy on you. The trust here is trusting in the stability of the market.
If the dollar swung 10% of its value either way, multiple times, like BTC did last week until now, we would have had a few global recessions turning depressions right now, and gold prices would have rocketed. Or if any random billionaire can stash his billions away and manipulate the value of the dollar, like a major BTC player could.

So in a eli5 level analogy, would it be like a bank "test" moving money by moving a bag of fake cash and try to account for the fake money amount, verify that the amount is correct, then do the same procedure but with real money instead?

Fleet of Rolls Royce for grocery and fleet of Bugattis for when they need to do groceries *fast*

Oh no I pulled it out of a publication. It's just the publisher is my ass. That was all sarcasm. And I am pretty sure nobody takes my model at face value, but the concept it represents, so honestly arguing with you would be a waste of both our time. Let's leave it here.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:13:28
No? You're not trustworthy. Unless you're Roth, then sure, here's some money.
If you miss the point of that eli5, IDK what else to say

I'd move my money into real estate, gold, or another stable currency actually
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:14:38
If the US economy crashed, I think currency would be air tickets to Russia lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:08:32
Which is why it's safer. You don't know exactly how crypto will be, whereas real estates have models and trends and data for you to use. 
Obviously, blindly buying prime real estate is dumb, just like blindly buying cryptocurrencies.

I mean, if you wanted to dump your lifesavings into BTC because it's a much more stable and secured currency than the dollar, which it obviously is, be my guest.

I suppose general street smart *is* more appropriate for making financial decisions that have large impacts on your life.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:06:22
If you think that 20 trillion dollar debt is a problem of the USD, you shouldn't be investing in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:26:38
Yeah can't let pesky customers cash in on their property now can we
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:55:24
No it means the US will forever be under the whims of Trump and co., immediately right after the tax plan officially passes, and there's absolutely no other more reasonable way to understand this debt.

Ignore the retard, replying to scum like him is a waste of your energy
