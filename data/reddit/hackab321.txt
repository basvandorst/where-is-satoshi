A stock analyst , coming outside the community, is describing Bitcoin as a "safe haven like gold". Wow
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:35:53
Private blockchains will always be more expansive than Bitcoin. Whereas Bitcoin blockchain has a currency (represented by new bitcoins created with any block) to remunerate the service , banks will have to charge users for that.

This reminds me the first years of Linux kernel during the 90s. At the beginning no one believed IT companies would have used it. People used to say: "why big companies should use this hackers os? They don't trust it. They will make a "private" copy of it and will use their own linux-like version at most". But Linux was there: it was innovative, powerful, open and free mantained by a wide group of talented coders (exactly like bitcoin). And you already know how this story has finished.

This has always been the right thing to do. Asking miners for permission before was the big mistake because now looks like we are changing our mind only because we can't get 95%

With SW's release and Classic dropped out like XT, price will recover
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:12:04
Mining has never been so centralized. Bitmain is the "master of puppets" behind these new pools (Viabtc, BTC.TOP...),  come out of thin air. It provides to them hardware, they support big blocks BS in return. Bitmain is directly or indirectly controlling more then 50% of bitcoin HR and this is the biggest threat to bitcoin now imo

ELI5: Which are the steps we have to do to activate Segwit as a UASF?
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:16:48

They will only if we accept their fork (BITCOIN ~~XT~~ XFILES)

Voting should have a cost to reduce multiple votes , for example  sending a certain btc amount to a verifiably unspendable address (proof of burn) and using OP_RETURN to express preference.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:44:44
Have to persuade antpool and the others. Not an easy task
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:41:50
miners. Without 95% of them no segwit, unfortunately
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:15:51
Fud? We are at 25% and should get 95% before year's end...
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:51:15

@_date: 2017-03-04 17:35:37
UASF ASAP
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:47:44
Anyway if you prefer the question is: IF segwit not activated can we have TMF+LN and scale without hard/soft fork? Thanks

please stop all this BS about hard forks. Bitcoin it's not Vitalierum, I don't want to receive a forked and cloned shitcoin in my wallet. Let's activate segwit and LN and simply go to the moon. Miners have only to gain by this

He wants improve bitcoin's capacity by blocking  a ready-to-use improvement to bitcoin's capacity. Sounds logic
@_date: 2016-11-23 07:19:30
Without segwit we have no LN. And, since big miners (Antpool&amp;Discus) want HF proposal as a condition to vote pro Segwit, we need the proposal to have segwit. So all bitcoin progress is stuck as long as core devs release this code. Forget activated segwit within Christmas
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:27:34
that's nothing news, Core should release the code within January according to HK deal

BS debate shows how a fundamental bitcoin assumption was   false. The assumption is "miners have economic incentive to do what users want because doing so they increase their revenues". Actually some miners are acting against their profits only to take control and gain power since it is surely demonstrated that segwit adoption would lead to a huge price bump

Simple math: 
A) bitcoin market cap is 150 billion, global GDP is 75k billion: so bitcoin is 0.2% of global GDP.
B) Bitcoin mining consumes 35 TW/H, global energy consumption is 23k TW/H: so bitcoin is 0.15% of global consumption.
A+B=C) bitcoin is 0.05% more efficient than the rest of human activities.

Why should they do that? Maybe China but not Eu and US. Bitcoin is now not only a commodity and a payment network, it's also an industry. Coinbase, Bitpay, Xapo, Kraken....the hundreds companies around bitcoin have created jobs, pay taxes, create value and so the many others that  will come if bitcoin will keep thriving. Governaments can get a lot of money from there.
