When futures trading was introduced in the 70's, gold price went down for a couple of years and then exploded. 
Bitcoin moves 4,3 times quicker than gold according to that article

3 to 5 years is like blinking twice.

My prediction is that it will settle at 18k for a while, 
or it will go down, 
or  up. 
Edit: [Charts]( 
Edit 2: wow, thanks for the gold! Sweet!

I like how people who know someone who went to Japan turned into experts of Japan and Japanese people.

I'm launching a bitcoin youtube channel in which i'll use a lot of words to say absolutely nothing. The competition is tough in that market but i'll work hard on it.

Is buying bitcoins from an atm a better option than online? I live in Tokyo and there are a few near me. It's around 6%

ETA on the moon landing date? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:46:54
I might have missed it but i do speak french and i don't see any praise for it, only a short explanation and some link to some guidelines on transactions safety 
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:46:59
It doesn't. Atms here takes at least 5%
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:49:27
I'm satisfied. Thank you.

It would be only 21 billion because people like us would have moved to the moon for a long time already

Make sure you start with "you don't have to buy a full bitcoin" 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:27:48
I was asking if buying coins from a bitcoin atm is better than those ;)
