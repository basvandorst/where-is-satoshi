It's free, but they have [rate limiting]( 3 requests per seconds)  
When your in advanced just set "Execute this script every..." to 60 or something and your more than fine.

If you don't want to do anything with apple script simply do this:
  
*Example with ruby file, had to chmod +x the file for permission* . 
  
    tell application "Terminal"
        -- Get stout from ruby script
        set x to do shell script "~/test.rb"
    end tell
    return x
Then the ruby(or python/bash/C executable) file just can display the result you want to catch to stdout:  
  
**test.rb**  
    
    puts "Hello World"
This way you can do the logic in your preffered language and just fetch it with applescript into BetterTouchTools.
