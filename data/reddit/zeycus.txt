You are right, 12 words is impossible, 24 impossible squared, in practice it's the same.

I could not agree more. I've never sold, just bought some from time to time. What I do regret is that sometimes, out of fear due to volatility, I stopped buying, and it was a mistake. It's interesting how one of the best strategies is also one of the easiest to execute: just put some extra cash periodically, not paying attention to the price, at all. This sustained strategy has historically remained profitable, except for a few short periods. If 12,000USD seems high today, so it seemed 1,000USD some time ago: it hopefully will become a bargain in a few years. So, slowly, patiently stack your sats.

Andreas Antonopoulos gave his opinion about tainted coins [here](
Basically he is saying it makes no sense to consider a coin tainted only if in a point in the past it was controlled by a 'criminal address'. So, a number K must be decided so that after K transactions the coin becomes clean. But then, it is straightforward to move your coins among addresses you control so that in the end they become clean.

I think interest rates do not make much sense for a BTC, given there will never be more than 21MM. You are lending your coins, hoping they come back plus interest, which sounds great... but risking to lose them all. Not your keys, not your coins.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:10:57
I would add it's painful when corporations get away with paying laughable rates but the people with a salary receive like 60% of what the salary is supposed to be, because the rest was taken as tax.

Not real crypto, in fact firmly against Bitcoin. Considers it "too disruptive", a threaten to the stability of the system. If only she knew, to what extent...
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:37:47
Yes, all transactions sent to that address would be under your control, but you should not reuse addresses. For privacy reasons, it is better to generate a new one for each new payment.

I'd say that when Trump enters "our turf" and tries to bash Bitcoin, it is fair game to go for him. A powerful person making ignorant remarks about Bitcoin, I would be surprised if there was no answer.
On the other hand this Reddit is not just about technical stuff. Did you not see it flooded with Vegeta memes when price suddenly goes up, stupid coins in a rollercoaster going up or down... Lots of people here show different attitudes. I don't like all I see, but accept the different angles we have, all around our common interest: BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:10:26
I think the idea is that as quantum computers show progress, new addresses and quantum-resistant encryption will be added to the BTC protocol. We'll have plenty of time to move our BTC to new addresses. Only those under the old protocols, like Satoshi's, will be there for grab.
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:51:02
Best cryptographers feel quantum computing is at least 15 years away from any serious chance at trying to break something like secp256k1. Meanwhile, quantum-resistant algorithms are being researched. That's why this is not even a priority in the current development of bitcoin core, there are other enhancements that should go first, like increased privacy (that would be a fair criticism on the current state of BTC) and improved scaling.

There is the mortal danger that you made a simple mistake one day, and kept repeating and reenforcing it ever since. Unless you repeat them in front of the written words.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:52:37
When you have a regular exchange account, and your crypto is there, it means you lent it to the exchange, they are holding it for you. They may choose not to give it back, or receive an order to freeze your accounts.
Ledger, trezor or any hardware wallets are a way for you to store your crypto. You control the keys, no one, even the state, may take them from you.
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:44:02
If I had to memorize them I would use some mnemotechnic rule, like inventing a short story containing the words in order.
But I would never keep them ONLY in my brain. Human memory is amazing, but storing exact specific info is not its best suit. And you never know, a hit to the head and you could be struggling to remember lots of things.

The best speaker for BTC in one of his greatest talks. Amazing! Now he not only has the knowledge, but is good at using humor, (and geeky jokes).
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:03:08
Yes, it has happened to me with one transaction to myself, because I underestimated the necessary fee, and set it to 1sat/vB in a high-fee week. As I understand it this is a completely normal event, you are responsible for setting a fee high enough. That's why some wallets let you "bump" transactions via RBF. I think after 3 or 4 days in the mempool nodes tend to drop those transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:28:45
Because good developers are scarce, prioritizing becomes vital. First privacy, then scaling, other aspects later.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:03:29
I think the golden rule is to assume that there is always a hacker seing your monitor, saving your keystrokes and what you do with your cellphone. Even this way hardware wallets are safe, provided  your 24 words never take digital form.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:40:45
I would say there is no point in forbidding a behavior you cannot enforce. Like "having dirty thoughts", you can ban it all you like, but how are you going to detect it? With BTC to some extent is the same: if we use Tor and other precautions, it cannot be forbidden in practice. Same as Torrent.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:06:27
I remember Andreas saying that to split the words in two parts is a bad idea. If you get one half, brute forcing the other half takes only the square root of the time it would take the whole password. It is a dramatic decrease in safety.

Fees, together with block reward, btcusd and electricity price determine the profitability off mining. 
The average fee needs to be high enough, so that mining is profitable. There is an economic equilibrium, users try to set low fees, but when they are too low they might to RBF transactions. The system works by itself, it's a market, no need for intervention.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:07:11
Agree, among BTC developers it seems it is divided, some say it'll never happen, others that they would be surprised if practical quantum computers are a reality before 15 or 20 years. This is what Poelstra said recently.

Well, maybe the 300/20 is a bit aggressive, but being alone you can afford it, just shows a high risk appetite. The one thing you cannot do now is lose your nerves: if BTC/USD halves, don't do anything. If it halves again, keep cool, do nothing. Keep the bet until the very end.

@_date: 2019-07-25 14:37:58
People that changed currency understand this at once. For instance in Spain we used peseta, then moved to euro. In the beginning you always had to convert in your mind the new euro price to familiar peseta prices. I'd say that in about a year your mind flips. Then if someone talked about pesetas you had to convert to euro to get a feeling, whether the price was reasonable or not. Sadly now, not two decades after that, the current prices converted to peseta are utterly ridiculous, due to inflation. Welcome Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:04:16
Yes, when you own two kinds of money, you tend to spend the one you consider worse, and keep the good one in your pocket, for the future. In times like these, when fiat is so clearly overprinted and devaluated, the choice is all you easy.

@_date: 2019-07-07 19:18:06
I agree all this about 'tainted' coins make no sense. But regarding coinjoin, I read people expressing exactly the opposite idea: that by coinjoining, your are almost surely putting your coins together in the same transaction with some coins that are tainted, therefore tainting yours. If we coinjoin often enough, pretty much all coins would be tainted in this sense, defeating the purpose of whomever decided to try to block 'tainted' coins.
@_date: 2019-07-22 11:11:48
Thx, I don't know where I read 3-4 days, I might have misread.
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:09:36
There is no mark in a transaction that says it is a coinjoin. The chain analysis criteria can be very simple, and consider that taint spreads among coins in the same transaction.
On the other hand if course I agree there is nothing wrong with coinjoin. I use it for most of my BTC, not caring if some will consider them tainted.

@_date: 2019-07-25 14:09:05
That's right. Recovery services may help you if you forgot the password to your wallet and it's very simple or you remember a pattern, so the number of possibilities to try is manageable. But no service can help you reversing a sufficiently confirmed transaction.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:37:58
With shorter times I think that there would also be more natural forks than now. Cases for which different blocks are found within second and each of them is accepted by some nodes of the net. The tire is resolved by the next block.
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:31:27
My point was that if you split it, anyone who finds just one part may be able to bruteforce the other. But as others pointed out, from 24 words that is not an issue in practice.

A part of it may go nowhere. When you were saying a derivative was worth X, and in the end you admit it was closer to 0.20 X.

I have two hardware wallets for the same deterministic wallet. Set up the first and put my BTC there. But then I just had to be sure that I knew how to restore the whole thing from words+password, and sure as hell did not want to experiment on the device that was actually accessing the crypto. So bought the second.
Some months ago used the second to create a new wallet and coinjoined each coin in the first, sending the mixed coins to the second.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:32:31
I've lost crypto in dumb ways ( far less dumb, though!). These mistakes help us realize how irreversible transactions are, and use due diligence when dealing with crypto. So, positive lessons.

I agree. A sizeable base of miners is one of the strengths of Bitcoin. Would be even better if no pool was too big.
@_date: 2019-03-01 07:21:48
I did the same in Spain, left some money in an account in Bankia and forgot about it for like 8 years. One day randomly I found the account, and discovered I owed them 200 Eur. Because the basic fee had eaten all my money in some years, and since then I was paying extra rates for negative balance. I called the regulator and they said that it was legal. I had to pay to cancel the account! 
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:30:55

@_date: 2019-11-01 06:36:47
"Beware Trezor owners"!? Trezor did nothing wrong here, you just handed your BTC, doing not one, but two really stupid things: clicking in a random site, and then entering your seed words. Two things that should never be done. If you know (and you do) that you are the only one to blame, don't spread FUD like that. Tell the story as "things a btc newbie should never do".

It has been on sale for a while.
You use an SD card. In your computer you create a partially signed transaction, put it in an SD, insert it into the Coldcard, sign it creating a new file, put the SD card in a computer, finally broadcast transaction.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:13:52
You can use Coldcard without ever connecting it to a computer. AFAIK ledger and trezor do not work like that.
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:41:56
In 2140 it could be true, but not yet!
@_date: 2019-08-07 05:56:56
I heard often that those lost BTC in old addresses will act as a Honeypot for quantum computers. As those progress we will be able to move coins to addresses guarded by faster encryption, but older (and maybe Satoshis' coins) may become vulnerable to quantum.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:20:06
I did exactly that.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:05:15
One Satoshis equal to one dollar cent would be good enough.
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:05:16
That would not be transferring Bitcoin to your bank account, it would be liquidating your Bitcoin. Not until you can open Bitcoin accounts in Banks, I understand  a few are already trying, like Revolut, but with serious limitations.
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:01:54
Utter lie. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:05:07
Sounds pretty bad. It is not clear to be what you actually have in order to try to recover your crypto. If you had them in a wallet of your own, you would need a file with the keys, or the n-words. If you had them in a custodial wallet, you'll need your login/password for it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:57:08
I might consider it if there was something like the FDIC. As it is, even if BlockFi had the best intentions in mind you are risking all to earn a bit, moreover the interest rate is not garanteed.
Of course the idea of earning sats by doing nothing at all is extremely tempting, but I would have problems to sleep every night!

Of course I assume, it's just a guess. We need to make guesses to understand/interpret the world and people around us, every second. I make the guesses that seem more likely to be correct, like thinking that is a woman's hand. I may be wrong, it may be a man's hand, or a wax model, or an alien ear. I'll always make guesses, in this case vote for the woman's hand. Never forgetting, though, that there is a chance being wrong. Not making guesses is giving up the interpretation your environment, you be my guest and go that way but that is not for me.

My educated guess is that Karen run away with OP's Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:22:34
Another angle not mentioned yet: bitcoin is absolutely fun to use and play with! If you have some understanding about cryptography, privacy and networks, it is impossible not to be in awe at the very idea of bitcoin. Sending from one address to another is fun, coinjoining and reading all about it, you get another kick from it. Lightning? Sure thing! I feel I am moving wealth, and for the first time not through intermediaries, nor using vehicles issued by intermediaries. Before Bitcoin I did not even think that would be possible. So, no matter how hard are the times to come, and how low BTC/USD might get manipulated, I would stay in bitcoin (or its evolution, if it were to come). Because the alternative of staying with the clumsy fiat system is just unacceptable. Bitcoin is too good, now that it is out of the bag the old fiat system has nowhere to hide.

@_date: 2019-08-26 05:22:17
For an EMP to be devastating for BTC it would have to be global and huge. If all computers in the world are destroyed, the chaos that would follow dwarfs the bitcoin problem. On the other hand, if you are the worrier type, nothing is safe. For instance, gold? Do you know the estimate of gold (and other valuable metals) in the asteroid belt? It is so much that this is a "when", not an "if", space mining is going to be awesomely profitable. Moreover, we might learn how to insert a single proton in an atom cheaply... and there is MUCH lead on Earth. So, everyone should choose his poison, but let's do it rationally.
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:03:47
I don't understand the fee argument. Fee market forms when it becomes necessary, in a natural way.

You entered Bitcoin in the worst moment, because of FOMO. Stopped buying after the dip (!) and so are still negative, and think because of that Bitcoin is a bad investment!? Up to you. If you had used a consistent dollar cost average strategy to buy you would be in the positive side. I won't tell you how positive it has turned for me, just for investing consistently. Not to mention the really early guys.

Since you are now slightly interested in a price drop, don't you think what we should do is take your advice with a  huge pinch of salt? Even if the drop is coming I would not know when, or how long, the safest move is to stay aboard and not care for the peanuts that might be collected now.

@_date: 2019-06-20 19:15:07
I used to have paper wallets, but migrated to hardware wallets, and in fact that improved my peace of mind, to be honest. I'm no expert, but I was never too calm with paper wallets. With hardware wallets I am entering my PIN very frequently, I know I have not forgotten it, but that is not the case with my BIP38 passphrase. Also, the day you want to bring them online, the moment you sweep them seems very risky, you need to trust the wallet you use for that (you are giving them your private key, just like that), and if you do anything wrong all your crypto could go in smoke just before your eyes. In fact recently I swept with Coinomi an old BCH paper wallet, wanted to get both BCH and BSV (it was pre-fork), but the BSV were somehow gone that instant. I took seconds between both sweeps, but nevertheless somehow it seems I was swindled. With the hardware wallet the private keys do not leave your device, that is priceless for me.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:51:53
Sold my BCH for BTC two weeks ago. From the fork.

IMHO with a hardware wallet it is harder to make fatal mistakes. Rather cheap, good decision in the long run.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:51:35
In fact, I don't think even the existence of a solution is guaranteed. I understanding it is usual procedure to modify the coinbase field of the block, thus building a new block to go on mining when no nounce was found for the original block.

Don't think we should try to red flag any transactions, it is a very slippery slope. Then we start talking about 'tainted coins', and so denying bitcoin fungibility. Better to accept the uncensorability of transactions, while being damned careful with our coins.

That is your bet, you are welcome to play it. But maybe what happens is that institutions are realizing the future role of BTC, together with the FOMO.

@_date: 2019-06-20 21:00:50
I was a bit pissed off, it is true I did not investigate much, but I keep the addresses to do it more calmly. I installed Coinomi, created both the BCH and BSV wallets, then went to the BCH one and swept my private key. I got the funds, and half expected that in the BSV wallet they would be there as well, but that was not the case. So at once I tried to sweep, and got the message that there were no funds there. With a blockchain explorer for BSV I could check that yes, a transaction was already in the mempool moving those coins.
But you're right, in the weekend I'll try to take another look, maybe I overlooked something.

Each coinjoin round is pretty random in time, like BTC blocks. Maybe 2 hours, or a whole day. For 1 BTC, it depends on the chunks in which it gets divided. I would assume ten 0.1-ish coins, so you would need ten rounds. 2-4 days I would say.

It is the the best interest of the people that already sold, to convince everyone else to sell as well, so that prices go down and they can buy back with a profit. They are trying to get richer at our expense. So, my natural reaction is exactly the opposite: hodl even harder.

Thank you all for your good suggestions, if I had followed these instructions I would not have lost anything. Now I checked the BCH and BSV blockchains and I see what happened: I created the BSV wallet but did not change the derivation path. So, when I swept the BCH, no funds were shown for BSV. Then I made the mistake: I sent the BCH to Kraken to exchange them for BTC. After that I tried to sweep the same address for BSV but it was already empty. The BSV went to the same Kraken's address. It was my fault, and a valuable lesson, a bit expensive but nothing life-changing. I contacted Kraken just in case, but it does not look good, but I don't blame them at all, nor Coinomi. It was a delicate step, I knew it but did not use the due diligence, and this is the beauty of crypto: you pay instantly for your mistakes, and irreversibly :-D

I remember an interview with Andrew Poelstra not long ago, he said they see the possibility of quantum computers endangering current BTC encryption as very far, 15 years away in the most optimistic scenario.

It is understandable but you need a plan B, in case BTC goes to hell. I think a pretty decent strategy is to invest in BTC a fixed ratio of your monthly savings, ratio depending on your risk appetite, but I don't think ratio=100% (as you are doing now) is prudent.

I wanted to insist on this, the possibility of screwing everything during the sweep.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:44:58
In future contracts you agree to sell/buy a quantity of BTC at a given price, fixed when the contract is signed. You may for instance agree to sell a BTC for 12,000 USD in one year, that you already have. This way you are sure to receive that amount of fiat, no matter what really happens to XBT/USD in a year. On the other hand you may choose to speculate, doing the same operation but without currently having. This means you'll have to buy it sometime between now and the contract expiry, obviously not knowing now which quote you'll get.
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:02:32
Exactly this. Privacy and fungibility are already a serious issue. Scalability could become another anytime, in fact the current state of affairs prevents Bitcoin from becoming massive (current throughput is simply far from enough). So, I agree these topics should be dealt with before worrying about something that realistically nobody expects could happen in at least a decade .
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:48:57
That headline is complete nonsense. If someone tries to buy a noticeable fraction of the total (bitcoin, or any asset) price starts going up. In fact, I don't think two thirds of the total amount of Bitcoin are for sale. Not even if you paid 1000000usd per BTC.

If you already checked that the transaction took place and your wallet is empty, nobody can help you, it's lost for good. That's why cold wallets (for instance hardware wallets) are the way to go.
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:54:02
I can't imagine any system that would not suffer from what you are pointing out, in the world there is a bunch of ultra-rich and well advised people that control pretty much everything. BTC is not well distributed, nor is fiat, or property, gold, you name it. If you invent a new form of money tomorrow, even if you managed (somehow, though it seems pretty impossible) to give an equal share to every human, those strong hands would very quickly buy most of it from the rest. Because they would have better knowledge about the potential of that system, and most people would be less informed and eager to sell at once for not much, and live to regret it later.
The only real solution to that would be a real redistribution of wealth, and that I don't think is something that just the money technology can give you, it is more in connection with money policy, taxes, income limits, etc. Now, it's in the hands of individuals to decide to slowly invest on and try to use bitcoin, because of its obvious advantages over fiat as a technology. Therefore I would expect a slow adoption, with ups and downs, driven by people, also enterprises. Central banks will probably be the last to arrive.
But hey, nothing is guaranteed, there is a serious risk in bitcoin \*as investment\*, anybody denying it is a fool. On the other hand for the tech minded it is such a cool technology, when you start to grasp how it works, that it is hard not to support it, invest some amount, it's fun to use, learn and tinker with.
@_date: 2019-09-01 09:09:04
I agree with most of what you are saying, and we can't just go "let's stay with BTC... because I have some of it!". However it seems hard to achieve (and yes, probably I lack imagination!). What you call BTC 2.0 should be superior to BTC in every aspect, and even if the protocol were safer, scalability better, etc., it would have to compete with the huge hash rate in the current BTC chain, that provides its best feature: immutability. That's why I think in practice it is much easier to make BTC evolve than to replace it. I know, this way no redistribution happens.
Moreover, no matter how well you try to inform people, I can't believe the BTC 2.0 could be born very valuable. These things take time, and by the time it became truly valuable in terms of purchasing power, I'm afraid the people who really needed it would have been the ones to sell first, for a short term relief.
On the other hand, I see no reason why both ideas cannot coexist.
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:30:32
Check the receiving address in a blockchain explorer (or your own node, if you happen to be running one). See the transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:30:16
The beauty of it is that it is a free market. As a miner, you could choose the transactions with 0 fee, instead of the highest. As a user, you can build transactions with no fee. Try, if it does not end in the blockchain in a few days, it'll disappear from the mempool and you can try again, no harm done.

Andreas deals with this in his very last video. In short, use a 24 words wallet with a password. Write both on  pieces of paper and place them in separate locations.
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:52:42
Frodo said the same... but it is a HEAVY burden :-)

You are misinformed, BTC does not require constant internet connection, at all: just the instant you send a transaction.
I am not sure what you mean with "virtual". The colored papers called bills in my wallet are pretty virtual, nobody took them seriously when they were using valuable coins as money, it took a long time. The replacement of valuable coins by just pieces of paper took a while. A borderless, censorship resistant, public blockchain is a step further.
Fiat is very risky as well: you keep it in the bank, which may give it back to you when you ask for it... or not. They run a fractional system: they don't keep our money there, in fact they don't have enough money to pay all their clients, if all together would ask for what is theirs.
The wrong transaction "problem" is a huge advantage of BTC. If you receive BTC, after a few confirmations you can be sure as hell it cannot be taken from you. But if you receive a transaction to your bank account, how or when are you sure it won't disappear, because the sender said it was a mistake?
You are worried if you get hacked. What happens if your bank gets hacked? What happens if your country starts printing fiat like crazy, devaluating all the money you are storing? Which, by the way, is happening.
Anyway, BTC and crypto are opt-in. You don't like it? You prefer banks? By all means, suit yourself. Just leave the rest to educate themselves and make their own decisions.

But if you want to stay in BTC, it is possible to achieve a decent level of anonymity. For instance, with Wasabi's coinjoins.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:06:21
I don't think Bitcoin is an organization.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:04:04
I hope you are right, in that case I would have no criticism.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:42:30
I am not sure... First, because they are never the owners of any BTC (for not having the keys). Second, because probably no BTC moves anywhere when you buy in eToro, it is just a number on your screen. No need for them to write on the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:33:51
Because Internet is not a commercial platform, as some would like, nor a financial platform, as others would like. It is a medium for the people to interchange information, freely, that is what it was built for, that is what we must use it for. No guilty feelings whatsoever!
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:39:36
See a Andreas Antonopoulos in YouTube. If you are serious, read his first BTC book.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:25:09
Well, sorry to burst your bubble, the world is a little bigger than "your friends and family". BTC works worldwide, and of course in some countries it is a better use-case right now than in others. I live in the "Western World" and yet in my country during the past crisis it was made clear that only 100,000 EUR in your bank were covered by the state. The rest was up to the bank. If you saw what happened in Greece, you can have an idea of how banks behave.
You really said "Big banks will never have a problem to give you your money"? You mean, because they will be bailed out? Huge banks have been lately. Currently the highest systemic risk in Europe banking is Deutsche Bank, which by no means is small. The risk is so high that the merger with Commerzbank was recently aborted, considering such huge bank in such delicate situation as unallawable.
Allowing money-priting means destroying people's store of value. It means you cannot plan ahead because they will make it impossible... so you you go right now and spend your money in things you don't need, before it's purchasing value goes to zero. If this is your idea of avoiding stagnation, I have nothing else to say.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:34:49
It is very probably a good idea. Just be careful how you buy them, or do it in chunks. Too many people complaining about frozen accounts in exchanges lately.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:32:36
This made me wonder... What happens if when you buy BTC in a ATM the fee is so low that the transaction is never included in a block? After a few days AFAIK nodes remove it from the mempool, as if it had never existed. What do you do then?
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:12:05
Another issue is that any entity thinking about ETFs should be aware that BTC is evolving, and there are several changes being developed that increase privacy. So even if today's bitcoin seems traceable and so, allowable by financial regulators, in a couple years hopefully it won't. Developers and the BTC community are free as a bird, and will not agree to stop here. The effort invested in ETFs is not worthy.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:26:25
That 's as fair as it gets!
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:19:09
Not equally, but proportionally to the amount you hold. Very much like Proof of Stake.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:42:22
There is gratitude for you!
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:59:35
Most people today do not reuse addresses, which in fact is a good idea. So they may hold many BTC without having more than one in a single address.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:44:10
Attacks to exchanges all healthy: firstly, making more clear the risk of custodial solutions. Secondly, forcing exchanges to take attacks seriously. The fact that reorgs are not feasible is a blessing, from all points of view.
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:17:15
In fact, there are better option than Ledgerlive, like Electrum or Wasabi, both support Ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:43:13
I agree, but on the other hand no respectable web should allow you any deposit before those backing up were not done previously. In case they are dealing with newbies.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:52:12
I agree with Mark\_Bear, really, take just a few hours, see a few popular Andreas Antonopoulos videos. It is digital scarcity, which has a huge potential. Gold is valuable because it's scarce, and has been used as a store of value for thousands of years. Now we have something that beats it in every respect. Plus, unconfiscatable: it cannot be taken from you. No borders, censorship resistant... There are many reasons why it may ultimately fail, but I think the main risk is not that it would end up deemed as a stupid idea, or a fad. Probably the risk is that other technologies, even better in those aspects, replace BTC. Which would be good for humanity, only not so good if you bought BTC heavily.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:30:47
On the BSV chain? Maybe not that cool.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:38:40
People are complaining, it seems if the exchange deems your behaviors suspicious of money laundering, they must open an investigation. They are not allowed to tell you that you are under investigation, they tell you nothing and your founds can be frozen for a long period. This was not my case, but we've seen several people in this reddit giving details.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:50:11
I enjoy all Andreas' stuff, nevertheless I found this video specially clear and inspiring.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:11:17
I know that feeling! I convert a fixed amount of fiat to BTC monthly, so when it goes down I am sad on one hand, but also glad because my sats stash grows more quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:24:34
And each time just after buying btc, send to your hard wallet. Like this the maximum risk you have with coinbase will de 1000usd
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:47:43
Yes, you are right to point this out, things are getting really ugly, and this is another worthy fight, at least as important as crypto. It's our long term freedom what is on stake.
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:27:29
Wasabi's coinjoin to make btc hard to trace. A wallet with coin selection, like Electrum or Wasabi.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:55:45
Very good recap! It ends too suddenly, leaving you eager for more.
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:37:31
Kudos for your good sense in diversifying risk! Good timing and a bit of luck help, too. Nicely done, it is a good example of BTC management.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:18:08
You can restore your account with just your email. Doesn't this means it is a custodial wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:54:30
I disagree about "lowering the entry barrier". People would be entering something, but not in BTC. More so if those ETFs are not backed 1:1 by real BTC, and I don't think they would.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:29:31
I remember Andreas cleverly pointing out once that criminals run faster because they have shoes. Let's forbid those too!!
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:55:26
Twice the price of the 'vanilla' Ledger, for not much use. More memory makes sense if you hold several other crypto, it's irrelevant for BTC maximalists. If, it is just the Bluetooth functionality, maybe it's me but I see no problem using a cable and, on the other hand, strongly prefer that my ledger has no wireless connection capabilities, just larger attack surface.
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:06:40
Nevertheless, there is no reason to worry. After 3 or 4 days, if it did not go through nodes will remove it from the mempool, so you can try to transact again.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:41:30
My point exactly.
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:04:54
Yeah, I heard Andreas say that legacy addresses might slowly become vulnerable to quantum computers. There will be time to change the btc protocol before to a safer encryption, but old lost coins will remain there as a huge honeypot... Which is great to incentivize research, by the way.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:54:44
I feel for you man, that was terrible. Hopefully it will help others to avoid falling into the same trap. Thanks for putting your effort in such detailed facts account.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:35:09
You mention you have money (fiat) and want to buy BTC, there are different opinions on what is the best way. You could go to an exchange if you consent with the KYC, it will take a while, they will ask identity and residence proofs, etc. Most popular maybe Kraken, everyone hates Coinbase nowadays and probably for good reasons. Anyway the crypto you buy in an exchange is linked to your real identity, later you could use Wasabi's Coinjoin to make it harder to follow (in some countries the law forbids it). Or you could go a completely different way to buy BTC, and use a distributed system like BISQ. Or Localbitcoins. Those AFAIK have no KYC, you'll stay anonymous, but will have to find a counterparty that offers the deal you want. Then you are open to a different risk: if the other party tries to cheat.
About the actual hardware wallet, Ledger Nano is popular, although not 100% open source, for that reason some people consider it a poor choice and prefer Trezor.

There is nothing magical about owning ONE bitcoin. Own what you can, but don't get obsessed with irrelevant details.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:54:33
I wish they would forget this ETF shit for good, and just leave the BTC ecosystem alone. HoneyBadger don't care, why should we be paying attention to "maybes", deadlines, rumors and all that?
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:32:32
Yeah, this is a form of attack the system. The attacker wins nothing, except increasing the mempool size.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:29:56
This works even with more than 2 relatives. All of them need to xor their chunk to get the private address.

The fact that anyone trying to anonymize their BTC did not acquire it legally is BS. Privacy should be the default, and hopefully (with Schnorr, Graphroot, etc) we'll get close to it. But in the meantime it is our job to strive for such anonymity.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:25:36
I would add, set a passphrase. Print it and store it far from the actual written words.

If fact, he is explaining how he had ordered a paella in a small beach "chiringuito". When they phoned him to tell him it was ready to eat, he needed time to put on the swimsuit, etc., so when he reached the beach the tide was high. And he had to rescue his paella floating among rocks... something like that!
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:31:34
I meant, it can flood the mempool with transactions with such a low fee that are never selected. Makes memory requirements higher for full nodes, etc. And if you try to send a different transaction for the same coin, AFAIK nodes usually refuse it, so you are not able to spend it.
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:44:35
I did not mean you deserve any less credit for it, I just happen to think that luck plays a huge role in almost all our endevours, no matter how clever we are!
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:58:13
Use only wallets that let you choose the fee.

Troll of the day! There is always one.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:16:47
I thought with BTC, the strategy for believers was just buy &amp; HODL. No matter halvening, no matter if we are seing bull or bear tendencies. One advantage of this strategy is that it is damn easy, any simpleton with a dime can execute it to perfection!
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:36:31
There is anyways an equilibrium, such that mining is barely profitable for most people, depending on your access to cheap power. If rewards go down, maybe fees will go up. If they don't, some miners will shutdown, making it more profitable for the ones that keep mining.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:48:57
From your title I understood that in the article it was suggested "we need to ban crypto", but after reading it I find no mention to them. You point it as another case of how easy it is no launder fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:02:21
And the downside? Leverage usually can go both ways.
