BTC might not do it, but you can count on gold; it's the bedrock of  the true monetry system, thousands of years have testified for this.

Thank you; I'll make sure to read it.

I thought for sure FIAT is dead, and I have this relation that precious metals proved what we need for thousands of years, aand tbh I am not sure how "digital gold" will relate to this fact, but bitcoin is a great start for this era, I am sticking to it and will support the idea as I live, an idea that a new monetary system is inevitable and it's happening really, really soon

after the economy is already ruined, this move is inevitable, now people will redistribute their wealth and it'll be painful.

interest should be zero, if I lend you money then you are the one creating value and circulating it.

sounds a good name, we are up to something, it's time for FIAT to leave the stage anyways.

what time frame are we looking at?, I used to consider an inevitable crash is next door within 7 years; by now things seem to be accelerating

this is fucking dumb and selfish, only points that most of you are here for easy money, I am really concerned about your beliefs in decentralization and immutable money, which gold was the only to hold on. gold is going nowhere, it's literally right here; we should co-exist for the best of us.

 It's funny how all tradingview are bearish but suddenly they all set buy signal after this increase.
Also that death cross is absolutely not happening, this action proves this.

would this benefit me directly througb fees os sthing, or is it pure help towards making payments better and convenient for crypto?

everybody expectes a divine solution, BTC develops as more problems arise and becomes more immune, what's important is the community getting bigger and more educated.

TBH posts like this concerns me about the commuity ideology at what BTC promise, why are you here? for the technology or the fact BTC is top? you know if we see more like you BTC will just degrade and others will simply deliver their promise of what this technology can do?
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:51:23
aight, that's it, fuck everyone who ever says fuck gold, what about the dollar? is it still your sweety home when BTC makes you cry? cause I hope you end your BTC involvement before it wrecks you and others like you

I always hoped it'd just inflate 1% no cap whatsoever, deflation is wrong; can't we just mimic gold? it's not cabbed since in right conditions humans are continuously brought to life, others create value, simply put inflation is neutralised.
deflation assumes and favors the shillers always, and don't ever dream the world will accept that, I mean sure at first growth gets rapid as power shifts but then at equilibrium deflation is never neutralised, we end up unadopted, that's not a premise of life, and life never changes in essence.

ffs why do I have to struggle with 15% here in the ME...

As a matter of fact human time and creativity are the ultimate real value, represented by fair currency, commonly precious metals and soon to be crypto; your time is the true wealth! so never give it out except for others' time! through precious metals or eventually crypto. we are in a tight stage and should be ready for major corrections in the society.

yes, someone was looking to buy BTC, and they recommended localbitcoins, but the price rate of a seller 730USD was really high
