@_date: 2019-07-24 01:14:13
I'm buying and it's the most expensive price I have paid thus
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:24:55

@_date: 2019-07-12 22:30:10

@_date: 2018-05-19 21:49:43
thanks man . appreciate  the insight.
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:06:02
sounds like working for free 
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:34:42
lol elephant did his part today
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:12:36
I agree. I think hes reputation would be better served if he just shut his mouth and went on. he will still remain a very rich man regardless..gold isnt going anywhere.
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:44:22
hasn't he said the price will only go up tho?
@_date: 2019-11-09 17:12:56
it will get worse before getting better
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:35:51
are you betting or do you believe in bitcoin?
are you going to stick thru a bear market when half of your money disappears?
do you have an emergency fund so your not forced to sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:39:56
I dont think anyone feels that gold is going away
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:16:59
you're misunderstanding me. OP claims that by buying crypto the government wont be able to get it. even if he didn't give it to them, then they would just lock him up. so his logic doesn't hold up because yes, governments seize assets all the time.
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:42:25
he financial Interests like in precious metals... he has every reason to discount bitcoin so why do people still care about what he says
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:16:27
bitcoin really has already achieved what other coins will struggle to do nowadays-decentralization. sure you could argue it's not truly decentralized as well as it could be but you could never accomplish this so well in this climate. while I do believe there will be other currencies-government and private, bitcoin will never go any where . at the very least it will be a store of value as opposed to a true currency. 
as far as the dip... heres my method. do I believe in bitcoin right now at 8300$? yes. will I believe in bitcoin at 3000$? yes and did. 
when it drops, no fundamentals have changed with the exception of public sentiment or peoples get rich quick dreams getting shattered. there will be many more times people will think that bitcoins dead and it will be worth a lot less. when this is how people feel is when you need to grow a pair and stick to your gunss 
fortune favors the bold...if your not being bold theres probably not much fortune involved.
@_date: 2019-03-22 00:18:15
nah. if your logic hold up then he could just buy houses and the courts couldn't take them.
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:13:30
I think your placing to much emphasis on price and forgetting its power to change people's lives.
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:03:54
I never fear what bitcoin will do. low and slow
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:20:16
someone's gotta be right
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:33:56
chill down a little.
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:49:04
you consider your age sensitive information? the survey is fine nothing personal

@_date: 2019-10-11 14:12:22
hey op I'm with you. most people mentalities are really screwed up when it comes to money. it makes me think about tax returns here in the us-- adverts and people in general are like "what are you gonna spend your tax refund on?!?" as if it's free money. 
americans dont seem to save their money very well. I'm saving mine cause I dont feel to great about our economic future.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:28:37
this be bitcoin. we've all done it mate.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:37:27
maybe earn dollars by working?
@_date: 2019-02-16 03:22:42
yes. I happened to have bought silver at 19$/oz . still waiting...just like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:41:24
this just might be the worst place to buy crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:25:37
I'm confused about this comment ?
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:05:35
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:06:08
yippie ki yay
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:17:16
blockchain is too big to just have one crpyto. crypto is balanced so you'll have benefits and drawbacks across the board. your needs will dictate your crpyto of choice for that situation. but I dont know for sure I have graduated wizard school quite yet
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:58:49
blockfolio app?
@_date: 2019-04-26 02:22:34
I like unchained
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:05:01
I got it too
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:08:41
your dead
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:46:32
I care. I dont want him or them to be discovered it wouldn't do anything positive for bitcoin, it would prolly be a detriment.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:44:40
yes please
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:40:34
dont listen to technical analysis..nobody has any idea what its gonna do
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:09:42
yeah sure it's happened before but every time it happens it's more exciting than the last
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:23:36
nothings free
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:07:48
yippie ki yay basically sums up my feelings 
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:53:59
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:08:50
very exciting times! so many people still have no idea the potential blockchain has. I hope bitcoin can adapt but either way crypto is the future.
@_date: 2019-01-25 01:32:13
yeah no
@_date: 2019-01-03 00:02:54
not at all. I get the slight impression you dont fully understand proof of key day. just want you to be well informed.
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:25:02
if you have your crypto on a hardware wallet you do own the keys...
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:58:18
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:21:52
coincidence 
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:39:29
I'm skeptical 
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:58:24
relative to lots of other cryptos it is centralized . however there's some like xrp that take centralization to a whole new level . 
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:46:53
blockchain has far greater potential than bitcoin. it's a larger, further reaching subject . bitcoin I think has some potential as a store of value but lacks in many ways that other cryptos are better at like scalability and speed. however bitcoin is the leader so it wont be going away anytime soon. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:43:16
like if trump "banned" bitcoin would we still like him ?
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:51:27
lol Petro and bitcoin are as closely related as a monkey and Uranus.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:52:18
I'm pretty sure hes making a case for bitcoin not against.
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:18:22
I literally wrote him an email a half hour ago because the article was so poor. the article popped up on my Google feed .
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:00:46
I dont think it's about their safety. I just dont want to see it all day. we all own crypto were mostly all seeing the same returns anyway. I wonder if there is a stock market sub and if people post their retirement account balances
