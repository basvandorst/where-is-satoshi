So there is no solution to banks printing money, Turkish hyperinflation, Iran inflation? You are okay with being a stupid sheep that is robed every day. Crypto will succeed because of vide spectrum of use cases, tracking food, tracking cars, tracking expensive stuff, using in ID, borderless investing platform, payment.. Adoption has started, smart firms are fighting for it.
You know, there were people in the past being against cars saying why we need cars when we have horses. You think that being 40+ gives you credibility, but even the most stupid people get old.

Its not that point. Point is that everyone is freaking about and fuding about something that can be compared to a whale buying but nobody freaks out about 20 reposts and a paper thats proves nothing new, basically the same news we heard in January. 
No porpoise from paper except collapsing BTC from the key support. To be clear, I dont have anything agains BTC under 6k, I even would love BTC cheap on September cuz thats when I can buy more.
Im pointing to obvious market and social manipulation by paid papers and paid fudsters.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:02:51
Omg, you guys are paid fuders
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:43:55

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:22:30
Miners now selling to pay bills, im sure they have fiat for emergency. When we cross the profitable mining price, no more miners will sell and the btc circulation will fall what will drive the price up.
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:56:49
Well somebody bought back.. Go woz, the lost btc are nothing!
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:10:26

@_date: 2018-06-13 15:38:33
I was sarcastic but I see that I do harm..
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:11:08
There is a post explaining that the mcap of btc is not the amount of money invested in it. Its calculated with amount of coins and somebody willing to pay. Market is worth much less in fiat than the mcap is showing us.
Lets say that im selling now 10 btc for 20k, and you bought them cuz thinking its worth the money.. You didnt spend billions but the mcap will show that... So actually tether didnt provide value but interest only when people lost interest, on the dips. 
With less and less btc mined, a good amount of them lost, the whole world changing and adapting to crypto. Interest will come soon and thats why prices will rise beyond 20k.. Even if you look at the rising cost of mining, miners wont sell under the profitable. Btc is very undervalued.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:13:29
Haha yep, im not even mad if it happens
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:17:21
Follow macmac007.. You will learn alot
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:32:30
There is, altcoins.. But why I would price my btc in fiat when I wont sell. So for me my btc is worth one btc. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:15:21
And reposted 20 times
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:48:11
So whales.. How much of them? 10? 100? 1000? When u divide that by the 1/3 of the market you get not that impressive amount. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:19:34
So if everything goes well crypocurrency could be worth amazing amount when they dump all that bubbly suff and buy crypto.
Banks will print even more fiat just to buy btc. 
Just like tether ����  If BTC stays in bear market long enough for the bubble crashes, we could be rich. Right? Right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:41:51
Okay, still no need for social manipulation
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:29:07
Not news for btc but for the whole crypto
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:36:08
Just unbelievable. Thats why whales are wining, people cant sum 1+1
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:55:32
Okay fudders, this is the 5 post about this..
How that these kind of news comes out when btc is a key support level?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:54:22
Me, its sarcasm, not a argument.. Upvoters got it
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:18:31
It was posted 5 times already and clearly it didnt cause drop big enough so you had to repost
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:56:11
Now its 8 posts on btc and 12 on cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:46:08
Remember that this is not stocks, this is crypto.
Its x100 faster
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:12:13

Cya, good night
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:33:58
Then put that sell order right now if u dare.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:23:49
Why would I spend one btc on shit when I could buy 100x shit in 10 years with it?
I have fiat to live..
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:35:34
You mean BYUY!
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:02:23
Not 1 or 2 but 12 on cryptocurrency and 8 on btc!
Something is rotten!
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:37:48
Wow, tether fud worked.. Now all buy and rekt the whale
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:45:29

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:10:25
He isnt involved!
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:26:23
So useless paper gets published and 100 reposts on the day that btc faces the key support. Yeah, people wont buy btc when there is FUD and social manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:13:19
Lol, reposting the same post 9 times is something
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:47:28
Im not even worried. Shitcoins will die off, coins with partnerships and huge use case will prosper. Im asking what bear market? The biggest use case for crypto right now is tracking. Vechain, Waltonchain the biggest players there with Vechain less than 2b mcap? Next, Te-Food, Devery, huge partnerships, huge use case, Te-Food has over 6000 customers, mcap under 10mm.. 
Imagine Vechain being now in the position of Ethereum last year or two and other smaller coins that are similar to Vechain being coins like Eos, Lisk, Ark, Cardano and so on. 
Before year or two Ethereum became popular cuz dApps, look at mcap now, smaller coins followed.
Vechain now is being busy getting partnerships, deals, more and more use case. Before you know it, Vechain will be the Ethereum of tracking and the smaller coins will follow.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:58:04
Yeey another one
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:48:54
Where are we now?
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:38:29
Right now we are in the red. Clear triple bottom, a lot of people being bearish, selling, whales could turn this around fast and cause fomo.
The markets are like a pressured bottle right now, so much great news, adoption, exchanges, companies, use cases and still no reaction. Additionally some of the biggest investors are shilling BTC and predicting crazy eoy prices. People did notice but didnt react and they will but with fomo.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:43:06
I hope man, im gona rob my grandma if that happens

@_date: 2018-06-13 14:25:10
And look at that reposts and paid fudders.. You clearly see that someone wants btc cheap as it can get. I counted 6 posts on btc subreddit only.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:14:11

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:14:52
One btc is still one btc..
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:20:40
Its just like some whale bought all the dips.. What is the point beside fuding and reposting 10 times?
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:44:36
Paid fuders wana crash btc for they whales overlords. You can now find old bad news being posted as a attempt to fud more.

You are a skilled pain fuder.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:29:41
Then why are u investing in the first place. I know the risks and I wont sell my positions in the next 10 years. If it goes to 0, well I tryed.
For the info, my positions in btc are the lowest, im a low mcap guy, I mean under 10mm mcap guy.. Playing risky is in my blood
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:00:00

@_date: 2018-06-13 23:36:03
What research? Does it count to repost the same shit and fud 20 times? I know what has done tether, in fact everybody does!! One useless paper being released and reddit goes full fud mode. Holding because I dont want to stare at my pc screen for 24/7 to make 20$. I have other things to do, crypto is not life for me but a INVESMENT. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:24:01

Weird, right
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:15:02
Yes I didnt read it because u can make connections seems logical and still be wrong. Its clearly made to fud and drop btc prices down. 6 posts on bitcoin only, I can guess even more posts on the cryptocurrency reddit site.
I im not putting my tinfoil hat on but its annoying and draws suspicion. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:52:13
You got manipulated
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:49:36
When mtgox got hacket it dealt with 70% of btc volume at that time. If that didnt kill btc, nothing will.
Our job is not to shill you, its your job. I cant wait for September and I hope that I could buy btc for even cheaper, or Ven at least.
I lost 70% of my profit in this 6 months on alts, but I dont care. Buying more cuz this is world wide.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:59:08
