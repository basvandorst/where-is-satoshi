So essentially the entire crypto market cap is based on speculation that one day into the far future, these coins will be stable enough to have value?

I wouldn’t call his quote a ringing endorsement.

Thanks for the financial advice. I was looking for a discussion instead, but thanks anyway.

Yeah, store of value. I know. But doesn’t it’s utility as a store of value erode if no one is willing to use it as a means of payment? If it’s unusable for the purpose of exchange, what value does it have?
I’m not trying to be snarky.

If Bitcoin is going to become what those initial pioneers on the cutting edge thought it was going to become, the current price is just a fraction of what it will become when that day arrives.
If you truly believe in Bitcoin, there is absolutely no reason you can’t buy back in today. Especially if it’s not money you’re after.

But this volatility will never really go away, even with widespread use. There will always be external factors driving the price up or down.
At what point will that volatility be less than 2-3% per month? 
It’s a real chicken and egg problem because without the stability, widespread use is unlikely. But without widespread use, volatility is rampant.

But this will never change.
