Yeah, what amount do you reccomend?  Do you just go 10% or so cheaper than current price or what?

On the Play Store, I'm not seeikng Electrum ltc. I see the regular Electrum (and have downloaded it) and I see a few different ltc wallets but not that one.

Yeah, the native American story with her is fake. She never did what you're saying she did.

You both have points here, though I should have said: "as a rookie with no day trading experience".

I'm a new guy. I promise,  I aint going anywhere.  I look forward to a dip so I can buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:02:35
I think I already have the perfect mentality for this then.  I'm just throwing $10-100 a week in there and leaving it alone.  I'm in it for the long term.

Damn.  Oh well, more BTC for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:38
Early news!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:17
Vladdy has likely been buying it up for laundering purposes. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:04
So, I just went to buy a little of this because I figure it will skyrocket now.  I bought it, and it's showing up on my Bitcoin account and my BCH account is still at $0.

The mainstream accepting crypto will lead to their predictions being correct so I like it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:06:52
Hell, I wish I could buy more than I can afford.  I'll settle for just throwing in $20 a week or so.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:10:43
Why is Coinbase the one most used if GDAX is free?  Is it more complicated or something?

So far I have a massive $70 of bitcoin.  I think I'll just leave it on Coinbase and every once in a while when I have a few extra dollars, throw it on there.  I look at it as millions of people waste money on the lottery, so this is my lottery.

The best part was after these idiots broke their Keurigs, Hannity made nice with Keurig and they were all whiney on Twitter that he wouldn't give them new ones.

Nice article you got there. It'd be a shame if BC hit $15.5 again right as it comes out.

I love how welcoming this community is. I realize that it's partly that you all want us to stuck around so you keep your fortune, but I think it's also that you remember being  a confused been not long ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:57:41
You're lying about her telling a lie. What's that make you?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:17:43
It would be great for educational purposes though. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:28:56
Is Coinbase what you downloaded?  If not, go get that.  Set it up the same you would any internet account.  You have to verify two deductions from your checking account/credit card, photograph your driver's license then you just buy whatever you want.  I'm only ahead of the stage you're at by about a week so someone else will have to help you beyond that.

"My article is going to be so topical!....Shit"
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:52:13
Don't get cocky. That's still a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:35:40
Maybe keep a copy for yourself too. They will lose it, and when it's worth thousands they'll regret it.

Something tells me that a guy with a Tesla and a Bitcoin licence plate isn't exactly swatting away attention.

Question for anyone who's more knowledgeable than me (so anyone)  are you paying more in fees if you just do small buys ($5-$30) than more money. I just bought $20 the other day and now I want to throw money at it the same way people buy lottery tickets. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:45
I just bought in the other day for the first time. I'm going even smaller than you are. I'm just going to buy  whenever I get some extra cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:28:53
I know nothing, but that makes sense to me. Keep it until Christmas and then sell.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:35:38
Me too. It's fun. I see the attraction. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:06:16
I figured as much. I still think I'll do it this way rather than have it wait. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:28
If you're going to waste a wish, at least go back a few years to get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:31:45

Then take a screenshot of the reaction video and post it to Tout.
