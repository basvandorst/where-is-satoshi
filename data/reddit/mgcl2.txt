"Although you really might not like it then" ... if you happen to sell now??

Ok, so there is around 19k bitcoins on:
And we strongly suspect it belongs to the hacker.
So how can we now have the community helping in tracking who is going to try to consume it?
This should be way easier than with the Mt Gox scenario (where we do not know which set of addresses the stolen bitcoins were sent to, if I understood correctly).

Do we really know which public address the stolen bitcoins were sent to?

Can you explain more ?

Thanks Nic for this much appreciated feedback.
Glad to see some positive reaction here.
And very happy to hear that CSV downloads are coming back.

I didn't mean to open a best wallet debate. Had a brief look at Airbitz: I really like that it's both online (i.e. wallet can be retrieved from a server) and yet Airbitz cannot access the private keys (which is what I like with Blockchain.info). Will quite likely test it.
Thanks for the pointer.

I see. This is quite regrettable.
I always a great esteem of Blockchain.info, notably back at the time when Andreas Antonopoulos was working for them.
But here, I must admit, it feels like they failed me.

Just tested it Nic. It works great!
Very happy about this. And... truly impressed at how quickly you acted on it!!
Big kudos here.

Great link. Thanks for the info.
What's really frustrating is that once you have upgraded your Blockchain.info wallet you cannot revert anymore, and thus I totally lose the ability to retrieve my history of transactions.
Wish I had a time machine here: would have never pressed that 'upgrade' button. Grrrrr....

Great in-depth answers, thanks.
Well, hopefully at some point in the future there will be mostly only segwit transactions issued by wallets, making AsicBoost economically less attractive (as they would be missing on cropping the fees for these many dismissed segwit transactions).

Totally agree. You don't need rudeness when you have a point.

Very interesting post. Great bandwidth savings in perspective based on Pieter Wuille estimation.
