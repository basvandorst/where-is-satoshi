Just a warning, Trezor's bootloader is closed source. You can't be completely certain it won't steal your coins.
I suggest getting a raspberry pi and install electrum to do offline transaction signing (which is what Trezor does). You can have more peace of mind with a fully open source system like the raspberry pi.

Roger Ver is heavily invested in Bitcoin so it would be foolish for us to do something that would harm the ecosystem. Everyone in the company is paid 100% in Bitcoin and we use Bitcoin to pay for all the bills, we don't even have a bank account. Bitcoin is our heart and soul and we do our best to make it as usable as possible for everyone.

I don't like the idea of working for a scam. I'll do everything in my power prove you wrong and ensure that investors get a ROI.
I know our hashrate provider makes more than 1% profits. The purpose of the cloud mining revenue is to buy more mining hardware. It's ok even if they make 0% profits from cloud mining sales, it's like taking a loan out to buy more mining equipment earlier.
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:04:25
ASICBoost results in empty blocks. Bitcoin.com pool has not mined a single empty block so it is impossible that any of our miners are using ASICBoost.

@_date: 2017-04-28 00:55:49
Pricing could be subject to change when we launch to the public. It is normal for a cloud mining service to change prices over time for new users.
However, if you already bought a contract then none of the fees or terms and conditions change for your existing contract.
None of our beta testers have a connection with the company other than the fact that they mined on our pool before.
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:57:50
Not true. Our hashrate provider doesn't manufacture ASICs yet they still make much higher profits than 1%. ViaBTC does cloud mining too and they don't manufacture ASICs.

A currency is more useful if people use it.
The US dollar is useful in the US because the user base is the entire US population and all it's businesses. You'll have a much harder time trying to spend Euros or even Bitcoin there.

I have not seen evidence that we are a scam. Surely our customers would complain if we were scamming them.
We are not out to deceive. We put all the info right there on our website about what to expect from our contracts. We give you the hashrate you pay for. We display all the PPS shares earned per day on your account so you can mathematically verify that you are being paid correctly for your hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:22:13
I'm one of the Bitcoin.com Pool developers. Feel free to ask me anything.
Our lifetime contracts are indeed the most popular. We sold more lifetime contracts than the rest of the contracts combined. It was our hashrate provider's decision to have less stock for the other contracts, which is why they are sold out.
We just launched cloud mining one week ago, so it will take some more time to use the cloud mining revenue to increase our hashrate.
It's late in Tokyo time zone so I'm going to bed. I'll be happy to answer more questions as soon as I wake up.
Edit: To address your third concern, we may only cancel a contract if it reaches the expiry date or if it is unprofitable for 7 days in a row. The Bitcoin price would have to drop to a quarter of its current value and stay below that price for 7 days, or the difficulty would need to increase by 400% in order for our contracts to become unprofitable. The recent price drop still allows our contracts to remain profitable.

Hashflare's maintenance fee is 35 cents per day. Ours is 30 cents per day.
Hashflare points their miners to a pool of your choice. There may be connectivity issues and rejected shares between hashflare and your pool of choice.
We guarantee 100% uptime and 0% reject rate. You are allocated the correct number of PPS shares for your hashrate no matter what.
All contract hashrate is pointed to our pool. We are the highest paying mining pool in the world due to our 110% block reward.
Edit: I've been informed that ViaBTC cloud mining contracts pay out more per TH/s (although they are no longer for sale). I will discuss with our data center partner to see if we can lower our daily fee.

We're down below 100 PH/s because one of our partner data center is replacing all their old servers with new ones. Our hashrate will return in a couple weeks.
I don't know how a hashrate drop has anything to do with us supposedly being a scam. We are transparent and don't lie about our hashrate and pricing. We give you what you pay for.


The definition of a scam a dishonest scheme. We are honestly and openly sharing what your revenue potential is. We are the most transparent and auditable cloud mining provider in the world. We allocate fixed number of PPS shares per TH/s and show you shares earned per day so you can mathematically verify that you're being paid correctly for your hashrate. We will give you the correct number of PPS shares and pay you what we promised no matter what, even if our all our partner datacenters go offline.
We raised the price of the short term contracts some time ago due to soaring Bitcoin price. I will contact the person in charge of setting prices to lower it to be profitable again.
Edit: To address your point about Roger Ver


Roger Ver is attacking their ideas, not the individuals. They want high on-chain transaction fees, we want low on-chain transaction fees. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 21:45:32
Sure, users with poor connectivity may not be able to run a node anymore. But more businesses and individuals will start running full nodes as the user base increases. In the end, there should be a net increase in node count.
At the moment, the user base has no room to increase as the max block size remains the same.
