I think you're misunderstanding batched transactions. Some large custodial exchanges, like Coinbase, would send thousands of individual transactions to the blockchain, with batched transactions these boil down to just a few transactions hitting the blockchain but still paying thousands of different addresses.
So it might look like the on chain transaction count has dropped but the number of actual transactions taking place hasn't changed.
Although Coinbase haven't confirmed if they've implemented batched transactions yet.

Good luck verifying the security and integrity of the devices that your electrum, mycelium or other open source wallet is running on.

That may be the intended use case but once it's out in the wild i would expect your average Joe will just gravitate towards the path of least resistance and end up using it for every transaction

How do you get out of LN and back to on chain? Do you also have to exit via a service like submarine? Can you then exit to any supported on chain coin?

The book you used is available open source, the bitcoin tech that so inspired you is open source. Doubtless the other libraries and tech tools you used are all open source too. Why not give something back to the community?  Maybe you could document your findings and what you learned from your project alongside your code.
Regardless, well done and thanks for sharing.

Yes, it is true with LN all transactions are still sent over the internet but the key part is that they are not "broadcasted". With LN transactions are sent over the shortest (or cheapest) route from A to B, probably involving up to 4 or 5 intermediate nodes. So even accounting for the fact there will be more transactions required and the individual transactions on the lightning network will likely be larger than on chain, the overall bandwidth will be significantly less because they are not sent to every node.

Yes, thankfully I haven't had to use Fire for a while. I used to have to do a crazy dance through multiple accounts to be able to get my funds to an exchange without facing ridiculous fees.

I managed to connect it to a local instance of LndHub connecting to my own local Lnd Node.
I haven't spent much time testing it since though. I gave up after not being able to get it to pick up my existing Ln / Bitcoin wallets. It seems to specifically expect Bluewallet users as a layer above, creating wallets in LndHub. I guess that is the main use-case but not what I'm looking for.

In reality you're up massively from your initial "investment", you've lived a will ride along the way and the future if looking rosy. It's all good as far as I can see.

I guess you're talking about short term 'payday' style loans which are restricted on the interest they are allowed to charge. However, they are forced to advertise their rates as APR - ' Annual Percentage Rate ' - which is how much you would pay if you had the loan for a year, but the whole premise of these loans is they are to be paid off over a short term, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months etc.
That said, think they are a total scam and shouldn't be allowed.

I have it running locally on a raspibolt.
The only settings I changed in the config.js were the ip addresses, all set to [127.0.0.1]( and the username / passwords. I didn't set a password for redis, so it was set to blank and the username / password for bitcoind rpc are the same as set for the rpcuser and rpcpassword in the local bitcoin.conf.
Other than that I think the only other thing I had to do was open port 3000 to my local lan so I could browse to LndHub on my laptop.
When running LndHub in the browser it shows the basic details for my Lightning node,  with the uri, number of peers and channel details, just like you see on the homepage here - [

you can only port forward to one at a time.

My understanding is that you can, or you will be able to, run your own LNDHub and connect your blue wallet to your own hub  I'm not sure what benefits that would give you over just running your own full bitcoin / ln nodes with any other lightning wallet.

Eventually, but merchants and shop owners aren't likely to be early adopters. At this early stage, it's all hands on deck to build a network where the merchants and shop owners feel safe to get on board.
