Hah support and mt gox. I like you. Very funny guy.
Support won't get you anywhere, go ahead and send a ticket to make it "official". But I don't think theres much you can do till they release the statement on monday regarding withdrawals.

Its a threat when it imitates some of the more appealing aspects of bitcoin with the credibility and stability of the Amazon name. If they both play out equally, bitcoin = Western Union, where Amazon = Chase

When the whole global economy goes to shit over the next two years (who is to say it hasn't already) and bitcoin trading at ATHs, we'll see whos right about fundamental economic endangerment as hes holding a QR code under a highway asking for money and a job.

The context was behind the exaggerated comedy, not literal meaning. Yes a professor of economics is going to be standing underneath a highway next to a drunkard. 
However your arrogance to believe that we are not in a global economic downturn is beyond belief. I'm guessing you don't live in Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Argentina, Ukraine, Egypt, Portugal, Austria, Cyprus, rest of the Eurozone or in any of the countries that w/ violent protests and uprising (Do you even know about them?). Its sad how Americans are oblivious to anything outside their "perfect little world", and yes im an American as well. Who knows whether it will get bad enough for us to feel any change, but to countries that no longer have financial and governmental stability, a decentralized form of currency taking the dominant medium for exchange doesn't sound so crazy anymore. 
As for Mr.Bitcorn, well I'll just leave it at that name.
