Just waisted 15 min of my life listen to this lonely person!

Mate! We need way more than that! (Details)!!! We need the case, what country, how it happened, how much was involved, what currency, and so on.... otherwise it’s like I say! “I’m in love do you think she loves me back?”

Very true but it's annoying listen to him begging for attention! Also, not sure I agree with him that the entire media is Trump's support, at least here in the U.K. the only thing we hear is criticism, Fox News might be a big supporter but not a lot more. Within regards Bitcoin, although I agree with him in some aspects, we mustn't be romantic about the market, but at the same time he blindly defends other investments.

Better than nothing, give up won’t help either, see what they say and take from that! Worse case scenario, expose him online!

So cool seeing the community so positive about the dip!!! Then I open Blockfolio and.....the agony is back.... stronger than ever!����

���������� well done to you! We are just having so fun!!! But thanks for the advise! Thought of being personal advisor? ����
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:40:04
Depending how long you’re planning to hold it for?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:40:01
How I react during those dips! ������ quite sure you didn’t get the humour! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:31:56
Funny how we react! Market goes down we think “it’s the end.. “We sell sell sell, we finally agreed that stocks are way better, safer!!!! Crypto was just a dream, it’d never work! How did we get here???We even buy the Financial Times and considere purchasing some bonds, call work and apologise, maybe leaving the way we did wasn’t right, we didn’t mean to call the boss so many names and we definitely didn’t mean to call our co-workers those names. 
We were just going through some difficult moments. Well... it’s Friday they say.. come back on Monday, your desk is still there. We hang up the phone and feel a relief, at least we have our job back, living and learning. We feel a sense of personal growth, we feel humble, touched by this whole crypto experience. We feel appreciated by all the support from our former colleagues taking us back. You know... now taking, one step at the time.... long week ahead and, Monday is all back to normal, better get some rest! Be ready! Show the love in the office, shake everyone’s hand, ready for some mature talk.... we tell our selves” “I’m better now, I’ve learned my lesson!!” 
It’s Monday morning, marketing has been going up like never before! We don’t even bother call work! Life is back!!!! ��

Not sure the mkt is in such limbo because Coinbase added Btrash in such messy way! Look, Coinbase right now is pretty cocky, the like or leave attitude from the team shows how arrogant they’re, maybe even too big to fail, but this is not the reason for the mkt’s reaction. In fact, no one really knows what caused it. 
Coinbase allowed buy &amp; sell of Btrash this morning, at least for European customers, it didn’t affect the price positively “yet”.
Within regards the internal investigation, I find it surprising that anyone really took it seriously.

Deleted my Blockfolio, no point!

We'd most probably lose big time against them (lack of info, proof, etc...) but,  it'd also be a great opportunity for the community to make a lot of noise! Financing the noise wouldn't be as difficult as it used to be! ��
