I opened this thread about 5min ago and had a look at the transaction. It hadn't been relayed by any nodes indicating that there was probably something wrong with the transaction. Looked fine to me but I don't really know enough to say either way anyway.
Just checking again and the transaction has propagated correctly now. I'm interested to know what happened with it. What wallet are you using?
edit: i see murbul sorted it out. Can someone explain why it didn't propagate the first time? Was DonDuckys client just poorly connected? How does blockchain.info know about a transaction if it didn't propagate?

Basically the miners "mine" by randomly throwing inputs into a calculation and then checking if the result is under a certain value. A "block is found" when a miner finds a correct answer (lower then that certain value). He adds new transactions to this block and includes a reward for himself for the work he's done. Everyone else can check he's not lying by checking the same input he used to find the answer.
This reward is what "makes new currency available at a rate that resembles gold mined". Block difficulty is used to make the calculations the miner needs to do harder or easier depending on the total network speed so that on average a result is found every ten minutes.

The answer your going to get is no. But it can be. There's risk involved; what's the difficulty going to be, what's your electrical cost going to be, what's the bitcoin price going to be. Youll need to pay a couple of thousand four a low end miner that's still competitive

This sounds very much like centralisation. You're basically saying that you will dictate where miners can mine. You will have full access to everyone's miners that you are hosting.
What exactly are you doing to put miner ownership back to the individuals? All I see you suggesting is moving miners into datacenters and imposing restrictions
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:47:39

If you have a few ideas that you honestly think you can make money with and you think you have the skill to implement and support it, then go ahead.

Not really. Your example is different. It wasn't from a heist or fraudulent transaction. It was exploiting an early bug that allowed someone to create coins that shouldn't exist. They patched the bug and removed the coins that never should have existed.
The owner of black sheep market ran off with about 100,000 btc owned by users. If the "community" decided to return those coins there would be a massive fallout around bitcoin transactions being reversible.
Basically if you get scammed it doesn't matter how much you lost reversing that transaction would open up many worse problems to the whole community.
If you can reverse large fraudulent transactions why not small fraudulent transactions? Is it fair that someone be protected from fraud just because they had more money? What about all these smaller cases of fraud? Who's going to do investigate if the fraud is legitimate? Can they be trusted?
Tldr: reversing transactions is a stupid idea

You may want to contact some bitcoin payment processors like bitpay or coinbase. Send them an email asking about and i'm sure they'd be happy to help.

How cheap do you want it? That one is $645 if you buy the kit, which i would say is significantly cheaper than skyhooks $999. 
And you can probably go cheaper if you just build your own using your own parts. I'm still not really sure what you're asking for, i mean all these things are pretty basic and don't really consist of much more than what you said ("A tablet with a bill/Credit Card reader that accepts money and deposits Bitcoin into a wallet"). So if you can get the parts significantly cheaper you can go ahead and build one.

Don't use them. I've bought from them twice and it was an all round bad experience. Support was very slow, gave canned responses that normally left me with further questions that they just stopped responding to.
I had to repeat their verification multiple times. I did the initial verification on their site and was told I was fully verified and able to withdraw. When I actually tried to withdraw they told me I needed to do more verification. I did the extra verification and they manually processed the withdrawal. A couple of days later I tried another withdrawal and was told again that I would need to do the verification. They ignored me telling them I'd already verified and made me schedule a skype session in the next few days. In the skype session they didn't even end up verifying me again they just sent a message saying "oh, you've already done this? We'll just send your transaction now", like they couldn't have just checked that a couple of days earlier...
To be fair they did eventually resolve each of the issues I had with them but getting to that point was painful. Once you get your money out don't use them again, they absolutely suck.

You have tools for newbies because you take care of early adopters? You may take care of early adopters and have tools for newbies but I'm pretty sure it's not the reason you have them.

Mining by yourself it's extremely unlikely that you will find a block (unless you're mining with a few asics).
With a mining pool everyone works together to find the next block and the reward is divided between everyone in the pool depending on how much work they have done.

1. It's really easy to reverse transactions with PayPal. So when selling bitcoins for paypal you need to have a lot of trust that the other party isn't going to scam you by just telling PayPal they didn't get what they played for.
2. It's against PayPal's terms and conditions to buy/sell bitcoins. They freeze your account and the buyers account for buying/selling btc.
You might find buyers for bitcoin on localbitcoin but they'll probably by charging a significant premium because of these risks. And if they aren't then there's a reasonably high chance is a scam

They need power to run and that electricity costs money. New miners are far more efficient than old miners (use less electricity).
for example an old asicminer block erupter will mine at 336MH/s using 2.5W (134MH/W)
the new generation of ASICMiner chips will mine at about 11.5GH/s and use about 6W. (1.91GH/W) 
That's 1910MH/W compared to 134MH/W. Considering that mining is already very competitive with some pretty tight profit margins, running equipment that's almost 15 times less efficient just doesn't really cut it.

Disregarding the threats, it sounds like he'd already made a mess of it.


They'd only just opened, they should have had spare capital prepared for any unaccounted for costs that might have come up. Were they expecting to be cashflow positive straight away? Worst case he should have updated investors that this was the case and he was going to raise additional capital (before he left, not go silent then mention it after).
They seemed to have spent quite a bit on advertising, fullpage newspaper ads, magazine ads, several different tv ads. Then to get to opening and think, "well shit, we forget we needed money to run this place", it all looks pretty suss.
I think I read somewhere that customers were being turned away because they weren't actually ready to take customers yet, they were "just getting a feel for customer interest" or something. What's the point of having an official opening if you aren't ready to have customers? I'll see if I can find a source on that.

But you can probably describe what latin is in a few words. 


He's not asking about the ins and outs of how maidsafe works or the kind of effort involved with creating it. He's just asking what it is.
If someone asks what bitcoin is you don't need to go into details of who satoshi is and how he disappeared and the project is now worked on by another group of people, or how the blockchain works, or what asic miners are, or what a hard fork is. You just sum up the basics: "think of it like cash over IP". It doesn't give the whole story but it's a good start.
I've read other comments where you've replied to people comparing it to dropbox and you say a few times that it's not comparable but you never explain why.

$800 worth of bitcoins can buy $800 worth of goods/services. I don't see how that's expensive.


Early investors take on a higher risk for higher gains. Some people are always going to have more money than other people.


This ones a little confusing. They've also listed "secure" under pros. If someone (or some company) has poor security when dealing with bitcoin, is that a problem with bitcoin?


Anywhere you have a currency you're going to have criminals using it for illegal things. Unless you only allow people to only trade certain things with it (see paypal dictating what people can buy and sell).
Don't get me wrong. Bitcoins has quite a few issues i think it needs to sort out. But what's listed here are not problems.

Well yeah.
It's like saying "having a safe implies the cash in your wallet isn't safe". Which is completely true which is why you don't keep all of your cash in your wallet. You balance it between ease of use and amount risked. i.e. you don't want to go home and unlock your safe whenever you want a cheeseburger, and you don't really mind having $50 in your wallet even though there's a chance you'll drop it somewhere.

Correct. The thing is that when you buy bitcoins on gox (or most exchanges) you don't technically have any bitcoins yet. You have an entry in their database saying that you own x bitcoins. You dont really have these coins until you withdraw it from the exchange to your own wallet. At which point the send the bitcoins out from their wallet to you

Sort of. Miners are all trying to find the input to a function ([hash function]( and have the input be less than a certain number. There isn't anyway to "solve" this function other than to throw numbers in to it until you find an answer.
And everyone is trying to solve the same function.
So effectively, yes it's similar to a lottery in that it is random luck that your next hash will solve a block.

If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.
I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.

This quote from satoshi gets posted quite a bit but it's pretty relevant here:
As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
- boring grey in colour
- not a good conductor of electricity
- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
and one special, magical property:
- can be transported over a communications channel
If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.
I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.

Api = application programming interface
The developer of one program can allow users to write code that interacts with their program. They include code that can be used by external programs to run certain code. i.e. buy or sell bitcoin, get the current price, get amount at an address etc.
Access to an api for services like coinbase usually need a key (basically another password). If a malicious user manages to get the api key for your account they can execute any of the available api commands through your account (I.e. buy,sell, transfer your coins)
If you arent using the api there's no good reason for it to be enabled and most services have it disabled by default.
I'm not familiar with the API for coinbase since I don't use them. So can't really tell you how to disable the api or check if it's enabled.
As for apple banning the coinbase app. This doesn't really mean anything is wrong with the app. Apple removes stuff from their store for all sorts of arbitrary reasons (and sometimes for seemingly no particularly reason at all). So being removed from the app store did not in any way mean it can't be trusted.

"What is that"
"Looks like maybe a B"
People are either going to already be aware of bitcoin and recognise it. Or not recognize it and not know what it's meant to be. What are they going to do, go home and google "B".
The other suggestion OP had was writing "plan B". But again, try googling that and see how many pages you go through before you see a bitcoin result.
If you were going to stick to sky writing you'd have to write out the whole word.

Yeah if OPs program was modified to send two transactions at the same time I think that transactions will be flagged as a double spend and the one that gets added to the  block chain will be whichever reaches the most nodes first.
Properly implemented merchant software probably waits a couple of seconds to check for a double spend.
I'm not 100% on that but I'm pretty sure that's how it would work.
It would be up to the merchant what to do next. Either wait for confirmations or tell the customer to quit being a jerk And kick them out of the shop.

How would that work? The merchant would be waiting for the transaction but never see it because you never made it. Unless you're suggesting the Merchant processes the transaction by only connecting to the client instead of the  blockchain, which would be a really odd way to do it.
It would only work for merchants that don't check the  block chain at all

Your video is kind of confusing. In the video John buys a parking spot downtown from Sarah. Sarah sells the spot to John for $3. John is excited to get a parking spot for only $3 as he's previously had to pay up to $20.
Except John isn't getting parking for $3. He's paying $3 to Sarah on top of what the parking already costs.


How does this make parking cheaper?
Also what's stopping someone from looking for spots for sale on your app then just turning up and waiting for them to leave? People aren't going to wait at their spot wasting more time and money on the parking meter just so they can try make an extra $3-$4.
Interesting idea but i just can't see it working.

Because he saw you broadcast it. He Is connected to the same network as you and everyone else. Why wouldn't he see the broadcast?


No. It seems like you think the network uses a daisy chain kind of communication (i.e node A tells node B who tells node C who tells node D etc). But it doesn't work like that, everyone is told the message at the same time (i.e. node A tells node B,C,D,E etc).
Every node isn't connected to every single other node. But that's basically how it works.

A miner at 51% can indefinitely delay a transaction if they wanted to. They could effectively mine every single block in the chain and claim all block rewards for themselves.
The bitcoin network basically goes with whichever chain is the longest. Once a mine passes 50% of the hash rate they can just focus on their own chain where they mine every single block. Every now and then other miners well find a block but that block can be orphaned as soon as the large miner finds more blocks.

I read through the "about" section which didn't really explain what it is or what it's about, just why it's better. That section should really be titled as a "why use 1Block", and you should write a separate "About" or "How it works" section.

What's happening on the backend? What is the relation with the blockchain/bitcoin? What actually is it?
Just reading the protocol draft on Github. I'm pretty confused about what you mean when you keep saying it "uses blockchain technology"




Sorry if these questions are a bit stupid (not really familiar with much cryptography). Exactly what "blockchain technology" are you using? How is the ECC you're using different to that in SQRL? Is there something unique in the way that bitcoin implements ECC that separates it from other implementations (I couldn't find much by searching for "blockchain ECC")? What advantages does your implementation provide over SQRL?

Edit: the size of your virtual disk is going to depend on a bunch of things. What was the original size? How have you set it up to change size? (I.e does it add an extra X GB each time the limit is reached,  double the current size, add a percentage....), what other things have you installed that take up space etc

**Construction companies banned from offering opaque walls under new laws**
Home construction companies will be banned from putting in walls that aren't transparent under new laws to be unveiled on Wednesday.
Companies such as Bovis Homes, Keepmoat Homes and others will no longer be able to offer walls so advanced that even they cannot look through them when asked to under the Investigatory Powers Bill.
Measures in the Investigatory Powers Bill will place in law a requirement on building firms and service providers to be able to provide a video feed of customers homes to the police or spy agencies if requested through a warrant.
The move follows concerns that a growing number of homes are now completely inaccessible apart from to the occupants themselves.
It came as David Cameron, the Prime Minister, pleaded with the public and MPs to back his raft of new surveillance measures.
He said terrorists, paedophiles and criminals must not be allowed a “safe space” to interact with each other.
Ministers have no plans to ban opaque walls because they have an important role in the protection of legitimate home activity such as showering and getting dressed.
But there is concern over some aspects of so-called corner-to-corner walls where only the home owner and other occupants of the house can look within the walls of the home.
Terrorists and criminals are increasingly using such technology to communicate beyond the reach of MI5 or the police.
On its website, Brapple Home Construction promotes the fact that it has, for example, “Sturdy walls".
It adds: “So unlike other companies’ homes, Brapple doesn't allow people to wander through your home whenever they please.”
Last month, Metropolitan assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the country’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, warned that for some firms it was “a part of their strategy - they design their products in full recognition that they will be unable to help us because of the way they have designed them”.
However, proposals to be published on Wednesday will, for the first time, place a duty on companies to be able to access their customer data in law.
A Home Office spokesman said: “The Government is clear we need to find a way to work with industry as technology develops to ensure that, with clear oversight and a robust legal framework, the police and intelligence agencies can access the homes of terrorists and criminals in order to resolve police investigations and prevent criminal acts.
“That means ensuring that companies themselves can access the homes they've built when presented with a warrant, as many of them already do for their own business purposes, for example to target advertising. These companies’ reputations rest on their ability to protect their users’ privacy.”
The Investigatory Powers Bill is also expected to maintain the current responsibility for signing off requests to snoop with the Home Secretary but with extra judicial oversight – a move that is likely to anger civil liberty campaigners and some Tory backbenchers.
It will also require internet companies to retain video recordings of their customers for up to a year.

And why would you? Why not just spend your fiat? One if the big advantages people say bitcoin has is that there's no middle man.
But if you're just buying it to spend straight away your adding extra people in between. If the customer uses their credit card to buy with circle as your case seemed to outline:
 bank &gt; credit card processor &gt; circle &gt; bitcoin &gt; bitpay &gt; you
Or if you didn't use bitcoin. 
Bank &gt; credit card processor &gt; merchant
Yes, you can use bitcoin without these extra steps and seemingly half baked services. But for your use case it doesn't really seem like you want/need it.
What's the advantage for you and what's the advantage for your customer? And if you do have a decent advantage from it you should be giving customers some incentive to use it

@_date: 2015-10-10 00:55:29
You can ignore it. It's because of the transaction malleability issue that someone is abusing at the moment. But your transaction is still fine.
Double spending is basically when the same coins are used in a transaction twice. Obviously this can't happen so once one of the transactions is included in a block the other transaction is ignored.
The malleability issue is a little more complicated.

Active mining and asicminer are pretty risky but I believe that they're going to see some good return.

Litecoin, feathercoin, namecoin etc these are all altcoins that people have made by "copying algorithms or whatever" (and making changes for different benefits). I don't know why you would keep it on the low. If no one knows about your coin and why you think it's better no one is going to buy it. These altcoins have no negative effect on bitcoin.


Not sure what you mean by this. The protocol is completely open for any one to read in to. There's no "hidden parts" or "untapped resources" of the bitcoin implementation.

They do use machines to mine. But it's proving to be more profitable to sell them to people. Also safer to lock in the profit now by selling them to people rather than risk keeping them to mine with and having network hash rate spike up. 
Also machines take up space. So if you want to mine with all those machines you're going to need somewhere big to store them with a pretty decent cooling system and a way to power all of it.

In 2012 google averaged about 5,000,000,000 searches per day. That's 3,472,222 every second. So we'll say that every single one of those searches completes a hash for google. 
This would be almost 100 times slower than very low end asics (the kind that aren't worth running anymore).
The return would be absolutely minimal and probably wouldn't even cover the extra network usage involved with sending the code to compute the hash and receiving the result.

Hey guys I got a loan from the Russian Mafia On my sisters behalf to buy bitcoins and put her and her twelve year old daughter up as collateral.
I'd done my research and found that bitcoin had a history of going in a very moon like direction. I was very thorough looking at the charts as far back as October. I'd also read about how an unverified random person had said that Starbucks was going to accept bitcoin so it was all looking very bright.
Since bitcoin has only ever gone up and never really had any large falls like this I'm somewhat surprised. I told them that there was a little bit of risk like any investment but I still don't know how to tell them that they are now owned by the Russian Mafia. Any advice?

Even to match the amount of advertisement bitcoin is getting from word of mouth (that no one is paying for) would cost a shit load. And to match the amount of advertisement bitcoin is getting from existing merchants, news stories, conventions etc. would cost another shit load.


Then this would cost another even bigger shit load.


And another shit load.


another shit load. And even more to negate the negativity against his coin.
And on top of that seven shit loads he would have to have another shit load invested in the coin so he could actually try make a profit if it even does go up.
So all in all. Yes, someone could try do this. But it would be a very very unwise business decision.

@_date: 2013-11-21 03:29:26




Yes. Edit: Actually no, it would be fine for a bitcoin client to create a wallet with a mixture of addresses. You could have 5 addresses you use in one wallets and create another wallet that only contains two of those addresses. The address is the base entity and is the thing that holds your coins and it could exist in multiple wallets. 
So wallets contain addresses which contain coins. A coin can only exist in one address. But an address can be referenced from many wallets.
I think what you're referring to is a "double spend". It's the basis of the 51% attack. What will happen is your transaction will be flagged by the network as a double spend and nothing will happen. 
The 51% attack is when someone does a double spend, mines the next block themselves so they can accept the double spend instead of rejecting it. They will also have to mine the next few blocks as well or their new chain will be rejected. It's called the 51% attack because for it to be viable they need to be mining with at least 51% of the network hash rate.
Some one correct me if I'm wrong there. I haven't done much reading on the attack or how double spends work

Have you done this in person? It sounds like you've done it online.
Just to explain what I think I'd happening here. You've sent your address to the seller. They haven't started the actual bitcoin transaction yet, hence your address shows no transactions. Once the seller sees you've sent your address then they'll do the transaction. It might take minutes to days for the seller to do the actual transaction, depends how good they are. But once they do the transaction it will appear in the block chain instantly, and take about 10 minutes to confirm.

No. Especially for small transactions. Read the other line of comments I had with jenya_ here. Double spending really isn't viable. 
Someone would have to spend literally millions to gain a large amount of the network hashrate to have a chance at double spending. 
For example KNCs Neptue hashes at 3TH. To gain 51% of the network you would need 4,500TH. So you'd have to spend $19,000,000 to buy 1500 of those miners. And you would have to keep adding to it to keep up with the network which is increasing at a crazy rate.
You aren't going to use that power to go out and try steal a coffee or new TV. For purchases larger than a couple of thousand and you're probably waiting around for more than ten minutes anyway to wait for packaging or paperwork.

From what i understand, bitcoins multi sig transaction  implementation allows for a transaction to require two signatures from three parties
For example. Alice wants to send btc to Bob and they use Elliott as escrow. The transaction requires at least two of the parties to sign for it to go through. If there is no dispute then Alice and bob both sign, the transaction goes through and it didn't matter if Elliott signs or not. If there is a dispute and only one of Alice or bob has signed then Elliott gets the deciding "vote" as to what happens by signing or not signing.
This way Alice and bob don't have to worry about having funds unnessecarily frozen by Elliott, as is sometimes seen with PayPal. Basically they don't have to give Elliott full control of their money

I never understood this argument for litecoin. So what if ASICs can't mine it? What's the difference between someone buying a GPU farm to mine it or an ASIC to mine it. 
The argument seems to end at "so anyone can mine with their home computer". But either way the "little guy" with his single GPU is still going to get pushed out when the network hashrate goes up.
The only difference I see is less power is wasted with ASICs.

Lots of people have been investing in bitcoin for years. It's really considered an investment opportunity as soon as anyone can take the opportunity to invest in it.
But this doesn't really mean much anyway. Many things are an investment opportunity, this didn't mean that they are a good (or bad) investment.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:07:02
What value do you see bitcoins stabilising at. I know it's incredibly speculative and hard to put some value on. But I know a lot of people are investing (rather than just using it as currency) so you must have some kind of target price that you value bitcoin at.
So making some assumptions (that are probably ridiculous): what value  do you see bitcoins at in 20 years if 1% of America has adopted it's use as a normal currency.

No. You don't need to store your coins anywhere. What you do store is an address where the coins are on the blockchain (a database of all addresses and transactions). And a private key (password) that gives you access to coins on that address.

 &gt;why would people pay 900 for a btc when they could get a unit of wealth storage in the form of ltc that is widely accepted for only 9?
Supply and demand. Let's say Mr rich does come come and start dumping money in to advertisements for litecoin. And people do start buying litecoin. The people holding litecoin don't want to sell it because they've seen Mr Rich's ads  about how great it is. So people are now willing to pay more to get there hands on the further decreasing supply. Prices go up.
But this all isn't particularly relevant anyway. Why would Mr rich advertise litecoin in the first place? Because it's cheaper? So what. All that means is instead of exchanging 10usd for .01 btc and buying a pizza you exchange 10usd for 1ltc and buy a pizza.

Yeah. Renaming files don't change them in any way. So renaming it to something else and then changing it back when you want to use it will be fine. If your client let's you browse to select a wallet you probably don't even need to change it back

It's a decent video but there's a couple things I didn't like about it (though pretty minor things). I think it should start with explaining what bitcoin is instead of starting with what people think of it.
I find that section at 0:42 kind of odd. As the voice over explains that "bitcoins are cryptographically strong and highly secure" and it visualizes this buy showing a bitcoin inside a matryoshka doll. Which to me seems anything but strong and secure. Maybe if bitcoin had multiple layers of built in security or something it would make a bit more sense. But as it is this visualization is just confusing.
It then goes on to say "bitcoins are a fully anonymous form of currency". which is just untrue.

People seem to be confused by this. The moon is not in a geostationary orbit. When the moon can be seen directly overhead, the price is moving at a rapid rate towards the moon (up).
Likewise when the moon is on the other side of the planet the price is decreasing at the same rate.
Of course people buying and selling also affect the price. But the wild swings occuring lately are to do with the China picking up bitcoin trading. The communication barrier along with being on the opposite side of the world from most traders has caused some confusion with timing trades with moon alignment.
[BIP0082]( "Did you really have to check that?") is a propsal to decouple the bitcoin price from current moon position. It's currently awaiting approval.

I sold a couple of bitcoins on localbitcoins a few of days before it started going down. The guy I was selling to told me that he was scraping money together and just had a $25,000 personal loan approved by the bank that he was going to spend on bitcoins.
I told him that was a retarded idea and asked him what he was going to do when it went down. He had the same kind of attitude that it seemed like everyone on had before it started going down, "Have you seen how much it's been going up!"
The reason it seemed like everyone else was getting in was the same reason I was getting out. So many posts where people were just trying to jump on the "i'm going to get rich quick" bandwagon like it was a sure thing.
Don't get me wrong, I believe that it's going to get back up there but that doesn't mean you should be throwing all the money you possibly can at it.

You can't "overwrite" the first transaction. When the second transaction hits the network nodes can see that it is a double spend.

You're being cheap. Send that 50 cents. And then buy another 50 cents worth of bitcoin if you want. Don't use it based on what it might be worth in the future. Use it based on what it's worth now. Put some aside as an investment if you need to.

It takes about 2 seconds for the payment to be verified. It takes 10 minutes for the first confirmation, but a customer isn't going to spend $100,000+ on a mining farm to try get a free coffee. So you only need to wait for it to appear on the network, not for confirmations.

The scroll bar shows you're at the bottom of the page and there's nothing under the already displayed 12 merchants (until you scroll and it refreshes)
I only realised there was more because i accidentally scrolled.

Sounds simple to me. What part of it do you think is difficult. Creating and displaying an address is trivial.
A user is just paying to an address which they are going to do in any  implementation so nothing changes on their side. I seriously would not trust any app automatically taking funds from my wallet.
Then checking the address is trivial as well and you should see it as soon as the user transfers. Its not enough to worry about double spending so don't worry about confirmations. 
Consolidating to another address should be easy too

I'd be more worried about investing in something before being comfortable with what you know about it. Don't invest in something you haven't done the research on.


Before buying your first bitcoins you should find out how they can be stored and how your are going to store them.


I'm not in the US but as far as I know they are taxed as capital gains.
I'd recommend not buying anymore until you know a bit more about what bitcoins are, how they work and how to use them. It kind of sounds like you've just jumped on the bandwagon with minimal reading.

1) you would buy all the coins at (or below) your target until your order is filled. If there arent enough sellers at that price to fill your order the remainder is out in to the buy queue at your target price.
2) the order goes through and the amount you purchased is removed from the sell queue.
3) no
4) I can't look at it at the moment but I think it highlights larger orders

The block chain is publicly viewable. You can see what is in any address and every transaction that has been made with it. So you just need to show the address you. 
Not sure how any bitcoin payment systems currently work. But it would be very easy to have them read your address and have your wallet sign a message to prove the address is yours. Without actually releasing any bitcoins to them yet.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:34:57


Completely unrelated. No one is looking at your wallet in relation to other wallets.
In your motorbike example someone is looking at stealing a single motorbike. If he decided to start stealing multiple motorbikes he runs in to a logistical problem, he can't ride two motorbike at once or fit more than a few on the back if a truck.
This problem doesn't come up with bitcoin wallets. Its mostly done by programs automatically trying brute force your key. Or malware on your computer recording key presses or searching for your wallet. Of it stumbles across your wallet it's not going to try compare it to some other users wallet and evaluate which is going to be easier to steal. Its just going to try whatever it has in its arsenal.

Every transaction is publicly viewable. If someone were to look at the transaction where you bought livestock from this sheep dealer they could trace the transaction tree and possibly link it to you.

Miners switching to litecoin will cause hash rate to jump which will mean the average user mining on his CPU will be returning less. Exactly the same as with bitcoin. I'm not sure why you think it will be different.
People are mining litecoin with GPUs because a slightly different hashing algorithm means that ASIC mining isn't really viable at the moment. But that doesn't mean that people can't keep throwing more hardware at it. It just won't be asics (for a while). Same thing will happen it won't be viable for you to mine with your PC without investing a heap in hardware

That doesn't mean anything by itself. A company might be trading at $500 per share but only have 10,000 shares available. Another company might be trading at $50 per share but have 100,000,000. The second company would be worth more even though it's trading at a lower price per share.
Companies regularly do a stock split where effectively more shares are issued to holders and the price adjusted accordingly.
Not to mention that there are plenty of stocks trading at over 530 per share, not sure where you got that number.

People explain bitcoin will always go in to details of the blockchain and mining and whatnot.
But really you don't need to know any of that.


You need absolutely zero knowledge of programming or coding.


Good, that one is pretty important. Some people 


Download a wallet program (I use [electrum]( Play around with it to find out how to use it. Find out how to backup your wallet and back it up (you don't want to lose your money if your computer breaks). Buy some bitcoins, check the sidebar you'll have access to different services depending on where you are. That's it play around with what you have then ask more if you have specific questions.
Having said all that, if you're buying bitcoins as an investment rather than use to buy/sell things you might want to read up on more of the details of bitcoin to know what you're investing in. You still don't really need any programming or coding knowledge, some understanding of cryptography might be helpful. But you should be able to understand most of the concepts without much trouble.

* Some dude (Joey) asks for a small loan for a short period. Says he's going to use it for poker.
* Another dude (Austin) loans him the bitcoin.
* Joey asks for more.
* Austin gives him more
* Joey says he's not actually going to pay it back.     






* Austin has a very particular set of skills      


* joey asks for more money from austin. Also applies for another loan elsewhere    




* Austin doesn't give Joey more money. Logically (according to joey) this means that Joey can't pay back Austin.        


* Some of Joey's information is posted by other forum goers. He has a neckbeard.
* Joey changes to a different username (boatedaces) for no particular reason.
* Joey is dumb   






* Joeys full info posted. Confirmed by multiple users.
* Player3 is going to go visit joey. Taking flowers for joeys mother.

High latency? 50 minutes for non trusted parties?
 


There is a way to check if those coins have been used in a prior transaction. he could check the block chain if this transaction is a double spend. Which will take under 5 second to check.
It seems you don't understand how a double spend works. The network will mark a transaction as a double spend as soon as it appears on the network. The problem comes up when a rogue miner owning a massive amount of the network mines the next block (and several blocks after that).
So your premise is incorrect. If you make transaction to someone and then send the same coins to someone else, the network will mark it as a double spend within seconds. And the shop owner can easily check this and know you're trying to cheat him.
