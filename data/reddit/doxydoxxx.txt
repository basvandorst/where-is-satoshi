It's not your bitcoins that you are downloading, but the blockchain. The blockchain contains the whole history of the bitcoin network and is replicated on many full nodes (bitcoin core) around the world.
That's why you only have to export your private key (dumpprivkey) and import it in a light client connected to a full node in order to access (spend) your bitcoins. As busterroni linked: 
=&gt; You should just install electrum on your pc, and import your private key with the menu Wallet/Private keys/Sweep. Don't forget to write down the electrum recovery words, the coins will be transferred to a new address managed by electrum and recoverable with these words.

Whether total freedom of exchange is a good thing or not probably depends on cultures, but it doesn't matter as bitcoin will take over the monetary system anyway.

If you use tor and don't explicitly specify https before blockchain.info in the address bar, you're indeed subject to man in the middle attack.

The main attack vector on the trezor is a MitM attack replacing the payment address on the computer screen, thus making the user validate a false address on the trezor.
This can only lead to a single payment redirected to a hacker's address, not empty the trezor. This will be eventually fixed by the adoption of BIP-70 
To my knowledge there aren't other security flaws if the user double checks the address on the trezor screen before validating.

Actually bitsofproof is a full node implementation, the only one in java (bitcoinj uses SPV), and the blockchain is stored using JPA.

@_date: 2014-12-07 14:00:45
HD is not exactly that, BIP-32 standardizes HD wallets like this: 
It allows different "accounts" to be derived from the master key, and provides two wallet chains per account, one for receiving addresses and one for change addresses.
Addresses are only generated on the leaf keys, before that it's key derivation.

Bitcoin is just not ready for mainstream acceptance, as email wasn't when you had to type unix command lines to send one.
You totally fail to see the empowering nature of an open network/protocol for innovation. Give bitcoin a few years of developments and you won't recognize it.
It's totally irrelevant to say it fails by comparing it today to gold or credit cards, because gold and credit cards don't have more place for innovation, while the new secure payments methods and store of values will be build on the bitcoin network, with much more possibilities, including all that you mention for gold or credit cards.

The second has already been released in 2009, and it's obvious from the beginning that it will eventually be locally regulated.
I don't see any contradiction here, from the governments point of view it has always been either ban or regulate.

Change addresses are there for a reason, they improve privacy and security. An electrum wallet is deterministic, which means that all the listed addresses are covered by your word list backup (even if you generate new ones, but not if you import private keys from another wallet). It is a best practice that every address is only used once for spending, and you should avoid sending coins to an already used address.

You can only have one active HD wallet in mycelium, so you have to reset the app to import one.
I don't really see the problem though. You don't need multiple wallets since you already have multiple accounts derived from the master seed.
Keep in mind it's just a mobile app, it would complexify the UI and some people would loose their coins if they had multiple seeds.
If you want to manage multiple HD wallets, do it on armory, not on your phone.

To have an account for work and one for home, for example ? :)
A BIP32 HD Wallet is a **Hierarchical** Deterministic wallet, which has a structure like this: 
In a HD wallet, you manage the accounts like bank accounts and you can see the transactions, the address being managed internally using the wallet chains.
One Wallet Chain is used for change, in order to never reuse an address when you make a payment, while the other Wallet Chain is used to generate receiving addresses.
@_date: 2014-09-15 03:33:02
The image is indeed inaccurate, but because the address is a RIPEMD-160 hash (160 bits + SHA checksum), leading to 2^96 possible private keys per address.
The "public key cryptography" part  affected by quantum computing is ECDSA with 256 bits keys.
=&gt; There are 2^256 private keys, 2^256 public keys, and 2^160 addresses

If you always reuse the same address, anyone can be 100% sure that all the transfers initiated from and to this address belong to the same person. If you use change addresses, an observer can't know for sure which one of the two outputs is the transfer and which one is the change, meaning that any change address on the road could belong to another person =&gt; basic privacy, one can't be sure who owns/owned what by just looking at the blockchain.
As for security, unspent addresses are cryptographically more secure than used ones because when you spend from an address you have to reveal the public key, meaning the private key is now only protected by ECDSA instead of ECDSA+SHA+RIPEMD
Bottom line is, change addresses are a best practice built in the wallets and there is no reason to bypass them, especially with single seed backup deterministic wallets.

It would be great to add some management options on transactions. At least be able to cancel transactions not yet broadcasted and be able to rebroadcast such transactions at will.

Bitcoin Wallet is nice but Mycelium has more options. Mycelium "centralization" is not a security issue, it just means that it doesn't directly connect to the bitcoin network but through relay servers. The only malicious things these servers could do are: return wrong account balances, refuse to broadcast transactions, or log transactions, they can't steal your coins which are only on your device. Personally I use Mycelium in part because of theses relay servers, which are overall more private than Bitcoin Wallet's SPV.
Additionally, Mycelium always had better private keys management, I haven't tried Bitcoin Wallet since it switched to HD Wallets too, but I believe it's still behind.

Yes, core should never have released a segwit SF with 95% requirement when the community is split, they may be good technically but they are horrible at politics &amp; consensus.
They should have programmed an early HF to 2MB first and then a second HF to segwit to give time to the community to adapt the devs, and almost everyone would have agreed.
It's obvious that the current segwit SF will never be approved and we are stuck with a bloated 1MB network hindering adoption. A chain split seems inevitable now.

To clarify, I used HF to designate a consensual hardfork with the goal to upgrade the protocol, and where noone would have any incentive to continue to use the old chain. There have been a lot of successful hardfork like these in the past on altcoins, but some on bitcoin too in order to correct fatal bugs (mainly in the beginning).
By a chain split I designated a hard fork with the goal (or at least the result, by lack of consensus) of splitting the chain into two sustainable chains with value, leading to different coins with different visions, like ETH and ETC. This wouldn't be very good for the bitcoin ecosystem, but whatever, bitcoin doesn't care.

Nice explanation. To go a little further, there is a whole tree of keys before the addresses in BIP-32: 
child_private_key[index] = parent_private_key + (hash(parent_public_key) * (index + 1))
The important part is that the offset is derived from the public key, allowing to generate the public keys (and the addresses) from both the parent private and public keys, because with ECDSA pub(priv + x) == pub(priv) + pub(x)

A quantum computer can't reverse SHA256, so all unspent addresses would be fine (they are a hash of the public key).
Only addresses already used to send coins have their public key broadcasted and are vulnerable, and the encrytion algorithm can be upgraded to be quantum proof when it's time.

- The passphrase is the seed used by the trezor to generate his private keys, it gives you total control over all the keys that will be generated by your trezor, ever.
- The private keys stay only on the trezor and are never copied anywhere else.
- You will see in multibit the addresses corresponding to the trezor private keys. Using multibit, you can ask the trezor to generate new private key/address pairs.
- When you want to send coins from these addresses in multibit, the trezor automatically asks for confirmation, displaying the recipient address and amount.
- Once confirmed, the trezor signs the transaction with the corresponding private key(s) and transmit the signed transaction to multibit, which sends transaction on the network.
- You don't have to resync your wallet and you can use it safely on someone else's computer, they will even provide a safe web interface with browser plugin.
If you ask me, the trezor is the first ultimate hardware wallet, it is very well designed and will even support the upcoming payment protocol.

SHA-256 is not vulnerable to quantum computing, so the unspent addresses wouldn't be vulnerable anyway.
The only addresses that would be vulnerable are those whose public key has been published, i.e the addresses from which some money has already been spent.
Hence the recommandation to always use a new address for change.

But bitcoin is not a product, it's an evolutive protocol and platform already backed by tenths of millions of $ in investments, both in hardware and startup fundings &amp; income. Something better may replace bitcoin, but not a mere copy created out of thin air.
Global revenue on Bitcoin Mining alone is currently more than $3.6M/day, going to the backbone infrastructure of the bitcoin network. Mining being barely profitable (due to exponential hashrate increase) means that profits are currently reinvested in the bitcoin infrastructure, through the asic manufacturing &amp; hosting companies.

When the internet comes back online, the longest blockchain would win, i.e. the part of the world with the more hashing power.
The transactions recorded in the shortest blockchain only would be lost, except those still being broadcasted.
But it's really unlikely. Even if there is a fork, as long as there is a way to broadcast the transactions to most of the miners, they will be included in both chains. Only double-spend would be invalidated and it should be mostly fine if it doesn't last for too long. For more information, check what happened during the last fork.

It's not that they sold out, they just stopped the pre-orders as explained here: 
The initial price was needed to support R&amp;D and was around $100 when they decided it at a fixed BTC rate, so I think we can expect their units to be available for much less in 2014.

Mtgox has no fees on SEPA deposits either, it's very convenient for europeans. The money they make is on the btc/$/€ exchange fees, max 0.6%, less if you trade more volume.
The only problem of gox seems to be the waiting list, but that should be solved soon with their additional employees.

This has nothing to do with gox cold storage.
Mt Gox only needs to transfer funds from their cold storage for bitcoin withdrawals, the exchange itself is only based on internal db entries.
This has more to do with the time and difficulties to move funds outisde china, making the arbitrage opportunities riskier until the price has stabilized.
It should be back in order in a few days if the price stabilize.

Just to balance, I ordered several times through them and never had a problem. It's legit.
The problem discussed here comes from the fact that they get the money directly converted to euros by bitpay, so when there is a refund request they can only send the euros back to bitpay, and bitpay converts it back to btc at a later rate.
It sucks but it seems to be a more general problem of refunds via bitpay.

Invalid transactions are not broadcasted by legit clients and moreover not included in the blockchain by a legit miner.
If the transaction is included in a block by a malicious miner, this block will be invalidated with a fork by the legit miners, and the blockchain will always continue on the right path, as long as the legit miners have more hashing power.

Bitcoins always and only "reside" in the blockchain, which is distributed through the bitcoin p2p network and secured by the miners.
The only things you have in a bitcoin wallet are the same things that reside in this coin: two long strings called the private key and the bitcoin address (which is a public key hash).
The private key is the password used to spend the bitcoin on the network and is hidden behind the physical coin's hollogram. The corresponding bitcoin address is used to receive funds on this private key and check its balance. For this coin, its first characters are 14242Jyk.

I don't agree.
For the average user, the most secure is to use electrum and print the seed. And armory will be great for the public when it will work in standalone mode and without the full blockchain (it should come soon).
Atm, just advise to use electrum, and add a part on generating/printing a seed offline (+reboot before plugging internet) for big amounts.

Armory has the most advanced functionalities of all the clients, allows access to low level parts of the protocol and can be used to sign transactions offline for maximum security.
But it's a heavyweight client needing bitcoind and the full blockchain to work online. Best suited for handling large amounts of coins in cold storage or for developers, not for everyday use.
Electrum is lightweight and simple, good for online purchases.

It's really overkill, you may need such length only if you are using common words.
With lowercase, upercase, numbers and special chars, you really don't need more than 15 chars for the password to be completely bruteforce proof, even in dozens of years.

Simple method to have both an encrypted digital wallet that you can backup on multiple media *and* a paper wallet in case you forget the password of the digital one.
- Install Electrum 
- Unplug computer from internet
- Run Electrum
- Write provided seed on a paper - it gives you complete control over the wallet
- Use a 15+ char/nb password to encrypt the wallet when asked, *and remember it*
- Store the seed paper in a safe place and backup your digital encrypted wallet (usb drive + HDD + whatever)
- Reboot computer 
- Replug internet
- Never type again your password when online
- Transfer the amount you want to your new cold wallet
- Sleep well !
More secure, 2FA alternative : encrypt wallet with 30+ char/nb password written on a paper and store separately the paper password and the digital wallet, but you'll need both to unlock your coins. Or you may learn the password, and/or copy it on a separate usb key. Don't forget usb keys, hdd &amp; dvd-r don't last forever, that's why you should always keep the seed in a very safe place anyway.
Don't transfer everything on your cold wallet, keep separately the bitcoins you want to use and use a separate electrum wallet or blockchain.info wallet to spend them.

Bitstamp is in europe (slovenia) and supports fast and almost free transfers from/to european countries + international transfers for additional fees. Trades are in USD and USD/EUR conversion is automatic. It's the main market used by coinbase &amp; bitpay to buy &amp; sell coins, and currently the reference for USD/BTC price.
MtGox is in japan, it's the oldest exchange and support multiple currencies. But you can't currently withdraw any money from it unless you have a japanese bank account, due to regulatory issues in the U.S. - That's why the price is higher and arbitrage very difficult.
BTC-e is probably in russia or bulgaria and has anonymous owners so it is probably a scam, but lots of people continue to trust them for no reason until they run with the money. They allow trading in USD/EUR/BTC + Most of the existing alt-coins

I've got a bootable usb drive with tails armory &amp; bitcoind. The main advantage of tails is that you're sure to have a clean system everytime you reboot. The fact that every network packet is only routed through TOR doesn't hurt too.
This way I'm pretty confident not to have a keylogger loaded, even if you can never be 100% sure.
You shoud check this: 
It requires a bit more config to run it online and it's a bit less secure, but a lot more convenient.
Plus I recommend to put some scripts in tails persistent drive to automate the install of armory an relinking of the ~/.armory &amp; ~/.bitcoin folders

Don't worry, your bitcoins aren't floating anywhere, they are registered in the blockchain, you can just check it on blockchain.info.
Your wallet is just the key to transfer them, the bitcoin themselves are never transfered locally.
You should use electrum or multibit instead of bitcoin-qt, the official bitcoin client is not for eend users anymore.

You don't, and you shouldn't consider their product like a secure paper wallet.
It's just a nice item to offer as a gift, to introduce bitcoin to people.
But I prefer trusting a known german company with small amounts of money than for example an anonymous russian exchange like BTC-e where lots of people keep large sums of money. *That's* what I'm really concerned about for them, and more generally for the bitcoin community when they will run with the money.

µBTC would be better than satoshi for two main reasons:
- mBTC/BTC as multiples of 1000/1M µBTC, which is more convenient than 100M and compatible with a SI notation
- Presence of a natural "cent" unit as in most currencies: the satoshi
More details here: 
But we should find a better name than µBTC for the current language

By the time Bitcoin became self-aware it had spread into millions of computer servers across the planet. Ordinary computers in office buildings, dorm rooms; everywhere. It was software; in cyberspace.

Yes but only from spent addresses (which may still contain bitcoins), hopefully all bitcoin clients will soon force users to only use new addresses for the change.
