Wasn't that moron Amir Taki the one that caused this? Follow his addresses he could be involved.

They bought a website that has no value beyond clickbait revenue. The group is off to a great start!

So it's reddit with incentivized posting.
I can see that working out really well and it would in no way discourage rational discussion and promote people to pander to popular opinion.

Someone explain to me how this isn't just a pump&amp;dump scheme pitched to investors with buzzwords like "worlds first" and "bitcoin computer". Did the investors at no point ask how little bitcoin each one generates? How that decreases exponentially over a very short period of time?
I'm really surprised these guys tricked Horowitz and Thiel, I really expected those groups to have some smart guys vet their potential investments. I'm fully expecting them to burn through their venture capital and declare bankruptcy by Q2 next year.
I hope no one involved with this company ever gets a dollar of investment capital again.

Oh wow, another moron writes about something he has no grasp on. This guy didn't even realize the "representative" he was writing about is the CEO/founder of 21. 
Online journalist are a joke. You can tell this clown just churns out article after article with no research or fact checking involved.

How is a glorified raspberry pi supposed to handle any kind of commercial API load? Better yet, how is this supposed to scale?
21's only development was the mining chip that sits on the I/O header so it stands to reason that people would expect some kind of proprietary functionality from this device. Something that they could not do before, or even something that is made easier by 21's hardware. 
But at the end of the day they're just paying ~~$300~~ $400 for a raspberry pi because we all know the mining aspect is a gimmick. This device contributes absolutely nothing to the bitcoin ecosystem and at ~~$300~~ $400, it's hardly a "great developer's playground". Any self-respecting developer was not hindered by the lack of integrated mining chips on the market.
This is a blatant cash-grab. I'm not even close to surprised this is coming from the bitpay guy. What exactly makes you a "hacker"? Let's see something (*anything*) that you've hacked.
This board is crawling with shills. Anyone pointing out how stupid this whole idea is gets downvoted to hell.

$169 for a $35 raspberry pi and $40 thermal printer?
What is it about bitcoin that attracts such greedy people. I understand profit is imperative to running a business, but why such large margins?

No, you're all in the same category. The only well written articles I find online are not published by journalist; they're published by researchers and developers within their respective industries.
It's all blogspam and you survive off ad views/clicks. I'm really glad Apple is pushing for adblocking by default. You'll all be out of jobs pretty soon. Or worse, you might actually have to write good material.

I don't know, I find it hard to support the company knowing what the product is. They aren't exactly filling any specific niche either, they are expecting users to pay a premium for their hardware and do it for them. I won't consider the product infallible purely on who is behind it. It has to speak for itself.
What I think we really need are hardware wallets that allow person to person transactions, offline transactions (based on trust), ability to tether your smartphone internet via bluetooth or wifi, hardware terminals that allow users to pay, and all in a credit card form factor preferably.
If we wanna make a good impression with the average consumers, we need to give them the benefits without the downsides (learning curve, ability to lose your funds over a simple mistake). If they don't have to drastically change the way they hold/spend money then it's going to have a bigger impact.

The protocol is self-correcting, if blocks continue to take this long the difficulty will be lowered to compensate and bring it closer to 10-min per block.

Don't hold your breath. I've been in the game for a few years now and this isn't the first company to come along with big funding and little to show.

Even though he's probably full of shit. I wouldn't doubt 138m is possible if he's operating in multiple countries.

I guarantee you nobody will use *this* device to innovate.
It provides neither a basis nor benefit to anyone planning a bitcoin business. The people capable of creating something were already able to do so without this device.
And no, this does not make it easier for the people who don't. They will be just as perplexed trying to use this device as they would be trying to program from scratch.

There are 2 logical explanations. 1, they're mining with customer devices or 2, they're mining with excess chips.
Nobody here would believe that they have actually sold that many. That's like $160 million in sales.
