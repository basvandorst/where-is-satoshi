i said


not sure if that even makes a difference to verify transactions. you will verify them as much or as little as you always do.
i don't think you verify transactions when you just broadcast them to other peers. mining on p2pool might make a difference though, someone should test this.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:25:39
yeah i agree and i am running a full full node but people keep saying they don't want to run one because of blockchain size.
guess they want to do other things with their 12 bucks :/
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:57:11
why didn't you say that right away?
sorry but after all your bullshit i have a hard time believing this.
i can't prove you wrong this easily though, will have to check the code. you win today, anti-bitcoin hater.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:40:43
[you seem to have missed the image that proves you wrong.](
stop your crusade against more nodes.
i even screencapped the config file so anyone can easily check for himself before *actually* doing this.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:53:48
did you just create even more fake accounts to downvote this thread?
**what is your problem?**
if i was wrong, it would incredibly, *incredibly* easy to prove this. why do you have to resort to insults, lies and other shit instead?
[liar again.](
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:10:57
no it is not in good faith as i have already explained this to you before.
accept you were wrong and move on. stop hurting the network.
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:50:23
what's the problem with running a full node? miners can just delete old blk*.dat files to save disk space and limit max connections to save bandwidth...
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:01:58
look at merkle trees plz
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:05:35


stop. telling. lies. it will not crash if a node requests a block from you, did you even read my post asshole?
I'll check the key import case, never did that before. it still is something no mining node will ever have to do.
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:22:33
[why is there a guy spreading lies and going out of his way to prevent people from running more nodes?](
there might be reasons why this wouldn't work (i listed some in the OP), but nobody has posted any actual arguments so far.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:34:47
the merkle tree is not stored in the blk.dat files ffs.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:59:04
bullshit. your node will only crash if you open the console and call getblock on a deleted block, which is something no normal person does under normal circumstances ever.
just running a node will work perfectly fine, especially if you only need it for mining. when someone requests a deleted block from you your client simply won't send it and the peer will get it elsewhere.
if you don't believe me, prove it. run a node and come back when it crashes. see you next year.

huh? of course i am.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:09:08
[**here is proof that you are telling lies**]( no crashes even though one node is constantly asking the other for blocks. now stop your bullshit.
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:38:37
do you seriously care how we call it?.. i think you are missing the point here ;)
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:06:59
gmaxwell (it's you, right?) you are pissing me off. stop talking shit. fucking try it yourself or paste the lines of code responsible for crashing.
post some proof instead of bigmouthing.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:18:04
please learn how to edit .config files and try it yourself.
if your operating system leads bitcoin-qt to a crash this is a serious issue. please report this if it actually happens to you.
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:02:43


**stop. lying.**
the blk files contain the raw block data, other files contain the merkle tree or whatever you need to verify transactions after indexing.
[otherwise this stackoverflow answer would not be correct.]( and you wouldn't be able to parse the blk files to see e.g. satoshi's message in the genesis block. blk files = raw blocks and only needed before indexing or to look up raw transactions.
oh and please stop creating fake accounts and reconnecting your IP to upvote yourself. it's ridiculous. if you have no arguments, leave.
if you want to do something productive, see if a rescan makes it crash. rescans are only needed in special occasions but it would be nice to have some knowledge about those.
but considering how rescans don't require a reindex i don't think they require the raw blockchain.

please get in here and get some other developers here too.
i need some assistance from people who know how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:12:56
ah well nevermind. hard to tell to whom a new account belongs and doesn't matter anyway.
thought you might be him as he seems to have spread those rumors you are blindly parroting.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:38:01
call it partial node then?
it is "full" in that you help broadcasting transactions and new blocks and can use it to mine on p2pool.
hence the '"'
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:58:48
you do realize we are *not* talking about "verifying against 0-confirmation double spends" here, right?
i thought the whole point of merkle trees is that you don't have to always verify the entire chain?

@_date: 2014-04-28 04:36:36
what is your problem? why are you telling lies? how does this make me an idiot? and most importantly, what drugs are you on so i can avoid them in the future?

give me a new name and I'll accept it.

well if you have time to go to a post office that also does WU stuff, taking your ID card with you and filling out some form then western union isn't that bad for receiving money.
oh yeah, and the fee is higher too. especially if you consider that you most likely won't have to exchange bitcoin for fiat in the future as that's the whole point of *one world - one currency*

MAYBE SOME INCREDIBLY SMART PERSON HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA OF

YEARS AGO???
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:01:06
dude what the fuck?
what you linked to has nothing to do with what we are talking about here.
it does not even tangentially mention how the verification process works.
and i seriously doubt that for every transaction the client has to crawl through the entire blockchain.
the whole point of how bitcoin works is that you *don't* have to do that.
