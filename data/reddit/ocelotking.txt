because if you have the fiat currency, a bank can control and profit off of your drug=dealing habit.
With crypto-currency no bank is profiting, which means it's a tragedy

isnt trumps finance chair a pro-bitcoin anti-fed?
also, I was pretty sure he said he'd get the money either via confiscations from cartels or trade negotiations

I'd rather save the outrage until trump himself confirms and appoints someone. We are freaking out right now over *rumors* of *advisors* that are *considering* this. 
Still, hope for the best prepare for the worst.

really? i heard the opposite, that hillary/obama were the ones planning on cracking down on "fake news" on the internet.
any sources?

Neither situation is ideal, but then again trump is the guy who stopped the TPP (corporate govt control) so at least give him a chance. hes a moderate not a neocon.
id prefer the lesser evil (government moderately invading privacy of any citizens equally when possible threats to physical safety exist) vs the greater evil (private organizations selectively invadung privacy for some people but keeping privacy for others, constantly getting away with doxxing, censorship free speech, and harassing political opponents).

im a bit confused, is this good or bad?
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:55:22
If he was an anti-bitcoin operative, wouldn't he have a scrubbed story and make himself look casual?
Like if you undermine something you have to be discreet. Being a saboteur needs secrecy. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 09:28:39
Agreed. Skepticism is good but anything remotely relating to trump gets exaggerated to the point of fantasy. We still don't know that think wants to actually monitor Bitcoin, he seems like he would be more interested in attacking our common enemy the federal reserve

I mean, with all due respect, this is idiotic logic. You may as well discourage someone from exercising because "we're all doomed to die bruh". You're using confirmation bias on a negative conclusion for an incredibly complex creation.
If you want to give up that's great, but it's really annoying when you come along and bring that attitude to drag down people who aren't interested in hearing it.
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:56:35
This is very bad

Oh stopp, you're sounding like a banker shill.
Yes, there are always concrete things you can do. Laws, code changes, new mechanisms to distribute the coin, the only way it dies is if people give up on it.


The rise of bitcoin was unpredictable. No one accurately predicted it would succeed at all, therefore nobody has the authority to accurately predict it will fail. The future of bitcoin is still up in the air.

If you want sources then ask in a polite way for sources. There's no need getting nasty over something you disagree with

He used coinbase to buy cocaine. Seriously I have the emails
