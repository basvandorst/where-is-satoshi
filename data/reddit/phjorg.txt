Regulation means insurance so funds are not lost in event of hack.

Ya this.
I don't invest in the dollar. Or hold the dollar. Or whatever other terms everyone in here uses for bitcoin. There is an astounding lack of reality. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:48:46
Only with evidence. Which there is none.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:35:16
Exactly that's why I hold it and invent in it like everyone in here. Exactly like what people do with currency.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:45:50
Currency of the future.

No idea about that tech. But I would assume they use a rolling code just like their remote tech. Every time the door is used, all frequencies and codes are changed so that they cannot be reused. As for its security to keep someone from root access, no idea.

Garage door tech here. Liftmaster with their new myq line has WiFi and Bluetooth integration where you can use your phone to open and close from anywhere. As well as notification for current open/close state.

Now you see the problem with this "currency".
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:33:57
People actually did this?? O.o
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:37:43
hey cool.  Be sure to use this next time you give someone your wallet in a mugging.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:17:21


I thought it was a currency?
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:16:16
when you start using gold to buy a pop at the local store you may have a point.

You give the bare min and your raise a child who is bare min.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:22:54
I'm pretty sure they are only accepting cash through an intermediary and not actually taking bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:21:55
What would happen then is once every couple months, a citizen could purchase something. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:43:18
What about the msds?
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:09:11
I'm unsure what you're trying to say here. The spending on countries health care systems is public record. USA is by far the worst. It would stand to reason that the public systems are doing something better to get cheaper results.

o.O  thats over 10 years of movement, and it's only a 30% swing compared to bitcoins what, 100000% in the same timeframe??  And even then it's not saying anything as that's just relative to other currencies.  It very well could be the dollar is stable and it's the others that are moving...
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:17:00
Bitcoin isn't a cult at all...
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:40:08
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:38:59
Same thing with any other mlm type sceme. Some might bite, most people will distance themself from you.

you're welcome to try. but your GPU will burn hot because thats normal temps for it running at that capacity.  Also,  ASIC's have completely taken over mining.  GPU's are a tiny fraction computing power, and your chance of mining a single coin is legit 0%.  There is no chance.  And if you're part of a pool, your return will be fractions of a penny.  When you factor in power cost, you're losing money.
Hell, most older asics are losing money.  GPU is losing money hand over fist if you try and make a go with one.

Unless you have government agents constantly coming in and out of your home, there is zero evidence of cash either.  
Source: I buy stuff with cash.
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:04:39
I'm going to buy lunch with cash.  Track that....
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:12:27
What should be the legal way to get evidence from criminals? Only allowed to get it when the criminal gives them consent?
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:14:26
this is some mlm shit...  do not do this.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:14:20
And another 30% are thought to be lost when you look at untouched 50 coin wallets from 2009.
