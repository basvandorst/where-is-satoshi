I'm pretty ambivalent to this.  First off, I regularly spend from an LBC wallet and have *never* had an issue with doing so.  So that makes me think right away that this is being pushed as part of some kind of feud with Coinbase.
And it's obnoxious to try to force these changes when major wallet providers don't support them.  There are a lot of wallets and exchanges out there, these days, but only six on Bitpay's list of supported ones, and two of those are their own.  Two of the largest, Blockchain.info and Coinbase, don't support it.  Hardware wallets don't support it.  Apparently no exchanges support it.
Then there's the fact that the actual implementation is not very transparent.  I can't open a BIP70 URI in my browser and actually see what a "BitPay invoice" looks like.  It just looks like a secret contract that my wallet is signing on my behalf that I can't even read.
But, on top of all of that, the real reason I'm hesitant to support BIP70 is that I'm *pretty sure* it has nothing to do with preventing errors or man-in-the-middle attacks.  I think it was actually implemented in order to take advantage of exchange rate fluctuations on payment refunds.  And that's an annoying precedent that should not be allowed to take root in the Bitcoin payments industry.
The video that someone else posted is related to this.  If you go to Overstock and buy something and pay with Bitcoins, and there is a problem and you never receive the item and require a refund, Overstock will refund you in dollars.  Meaning, since your Bitcoin payment was converted to dollars, if those dollars go down in value (as they tend to) you get back fewer Bitcoins than you paid.
But if you go to Overstock and pay in pesos, instead, you get pesos in return -- the exact amount you paid.  Widespread use of the "payment protocol" would tend to cement this discrepancy, and subsidize businesses that use Bitcoin not as a currency, as designed, but as a vehicle for the transfer of fiat currencies.

This is the first I've heard of a 'Spilman Channel', but I notice you conveniently left out 'Bitcoin Bonds', which preceded them and upon which they are clearly based.
In fact, you left out 'BenCoin' as well, which although admittedly a very flawed micropayment system, demonstrated the necessary mechanics for everything that came afterwards.  It was the first system that utilized the unique property of Bitcoin that coins can be deposited with a third party yet still withdrawn at will, creating an asset which is "shared" in a way that was theretofore impossible.  That feature is fundamental to the operation of trustless second-layers.  Once demonstrated, it was then used to create Bitcoin Bonds, another such asset with a slightly different use case.
As such, Lightning is arguably a variant of bidirectional BenCoin, implemented using some better technologies that were created as a result of the development of Bitcoin Bonds.
But there were other early efforts, as well, including Mike Hearn's work and a Ukrainian project used for distributed storage which I don't recall the name of at the moment.  Most of this is documented on the BitcoinTalk forum.

It's generally a good idea to store your Bitcoins in a wallet where you control the private keys, rather than on an exchange where they control the private keys and could go out of business or be lost.
But different wallets offer different levels of protection.  And different exchanges offer different levels of protection.
Some wallets include peer-to-peer trading functionality today.  And, in the future, some exchanges will offer decentralized trading so that you can trade directly from your wallet and private keys that you control.

It would be a problem, but not as much as you might think.  In fact, mining empty blocks has been suggested as a method of limiting block size.  Transaction fees would rise enough to entice new miners to include the transactions, since any miner has a chance of finding the next block.  In the long run, the block reward will fall, and miners *must* rely on transaction fees regardless.  And if you're wondering about a scenario where some malicious entity buys off all the miners not to include transactions, then this has the same game theoretical outcome as some malicious entity buying up all the Bitcoins.  Mining has a low barrier to entry, by design.  And Bitcoins are divisible.  Bitcoin is a tar baby.

Because there is an obvious political motivation to re-classify Bitcoin as something other than a currency.  Some currencies are better than others.  And Bitcoin isn't a great one, lately -- I'll readily admit that.  But that doesn't change the fact that it *is* a currency, and nothing else.
There are no training wheels for *many* uses of Bitcoin.  And there never will be.  Every time Bitcoin is traded across borders, no government guarantees its value.  So, no, you don't get to just say "it's volatile" and try to ignore all the people who use Bitcoin as a currency, whether they use it as a unit of account or not.
Lots of currencies are volatile.  Lots of currencies are pegged to other currencies.  Every major world currency was backed by gold at one point.  In fact, that was *the* definition of currency for hundreds of years.  So, for you or Warren Buffet to pretend that somehow currencies that are pegged to other currencies aren't **real** currencies, now, is asinine.
Currencies tend to be volatile, in practice.  [Federal Reserve notes are volatile](  Before the 1mb limit was hit and the dipshit Core developers blocked raising it, Bitcoin was at least the only currency in the history of the world with falling volatility, over time.

First of all, no, no they aren't.  The coin limit is the key aspect.  Decentralization just exists in order to help enforce the coin limit.  The minute that decentralization becomes destructive to the coin limit, it will go away.  Perhaps the most horrifying aspect of this entire conversation is that Bitcoin developers who are central points-of-failure almost by definition, who put themselves in compromising locations like the EU and Switzerland and the US, don't seem to agree with this.  I understand that they would *prefer* decentralization to compensate for their precarious positions of being leaned on by governments and regulators who want to de-fang Bitcoin, but it's not a silver bullet.  Most users will just go along with whatever the core devs promote.  This is an issue that was entirely predictable.
And Bitcoin **is** controversial.  Life will probably be dangerous for Bitcoin developers, no matter what.  It isn't Paypal; but even Paypal is controversial in a lot of ways.  There are influential functionaries in most governments who consider alternative currencies "domestic terrorism".  The financial industry is basically run by gangsters.  Criminals of all stripes are targeting Bitcoiners, and have been for some time, because there is a sense that Bitcoin exists outside of the law.  And it does, and has to, to a certain extent.
I don't really know what some of you expected, but pretending that there's a way to do meaningful work on Bitcoin while remaining uncontroversial is just idiotic.  I'm trying not to sound harsh, but perhaps Bitcoin is better off without you, if you thought that was the case.
Regardless, that's kind of an off-topic rant.  I agree that developers shouldn't be making controversial decisions.  But I also think developers shouldn't be in a position that they are so easily threatened.  That's just bad for Bitcoin all around.

Humans are incentivized by physical reality to cooperate, yes.  That's what you are describing.  There are no subsidies involved, though, if that's what you are asking.
Even without explicit force applied, people naturally tend to gravitate towards using one bank, or one currency.  The difference with Bitcoin (and with Lightning Network as well) is that there is a substantially level playing field.  Anyone can be their own bank.  Anyone can be a payment provider.
So I wouldn't expect there to end up with a single payment provider, no.  Probably a handful of dominant ones.

First of all, that's not necessarily true.  There are a lot of ways to create low-trust closed systems using Bitcoin, already.  And I'm sure it is already happening.  All this does is add a couple of features to make such systems zero-trust.
Secondly, this is not an "either/or" proposition.  Lightning Network is something that can complement Bitcoin, without necessarily taking anything away from the existing system.
Then there is the fundamental issue of centralization versus scaling of Bitcoin, by itself.  It's questionable whether Bitcoin can succeed as an actual currency without radical scaling methods that are guaranteed to add at least some type of centralization.  If Bitcoin doesn't succeed as an actual currency, there is not much reason to believe that it will succeed otherwise, as a kind of underground medium of exchange that is not accepted anywhere, not backed by anything, and having little intrinsic value.
So, then the question becomes "what are you willing to sacrifice, in order to produce a forced flat node structure?"  (I won't call it a level playing field, since I don't think that's what you're describing.)  Because if you're willing to sacrifice decentralization, by increasing block size to the point that nodes can only be run in datacenters by dedicated organizations, then we're back to square one.  I mean, there are other things that can be sacrificed, if you prefer.  But the only one that Satoshi endorsed in the long run was sacrificing decentralization.  As far as I'm concerned, tree-chains would sacrifice the coin limit.  Sidechains would sacrifice fungibility.  Obviously there are ways to sacrifice trust, which is what we have in third-party services operating already.  Or we can just continue to sacrifice scalability by keeping a block size limit and adding no alternatives, as we have so far.


Then start your own network.  That's free-market competition at work.  You still have access to the open network of Bitcoin, when all is said and done.

I won't say that "Satoshi was wrong."  But it is likely that Satoshi did not have a vital piece of information required to understand the scaling of Bitcoin.  He laid out the best plan he knew of, at the time.  But I think it is clearly not the best plan possible today.


No, not everyone.  140 transactions per second is one transaction per day for 12 million people, or one transaction per month for 370 million.  In the grand scheme of things, that is still fairly limited.

Has anyone from Blockstream ever given a cogent, *technical explanation* for advocating such low limits?  If so, I haven't seen it.
Gavin's research placed the technical limits at 20mb blocks, for a high-end home internet connection, with 40% annual growth.  What is the technical argument for much lower blocksize, and much lower growth rates?
Anyone... anyone?  Bueller?
The only people I have seen so far who have given any rationale at all for a 1mb limit have been the gang from  who argue that the limit was some kind of economic feature.  No technical argument whatsoever.

Zero-confirmation transactions can be rather trivially double-spent.  In the long run, this will likely end up being a feature that doesn't change.  Requiring more than one confirmation just provides extra insurance against blockchain split, which has happened before.  And splits don't have to be caused by deliberate attack or fraud.  They can be accidental.  So, that's why for any large sum the recommendation is 6 confirmations.

Right, which is why this actual attack, in practice, would look more like "51% of miners (with good internet connections) create blocks too large for other miners to handle."

Normally I would agree with GP, but yeah if this involves AT&amp;T and number porting, then they are absolutely incompetent fraudsters.  I tried to have a number ported almost fifteen years ago and *to this day* it is the reason I will never use AT&amp;T for anything ever.
Long story short, a family member had a remodeling business with an idiot partner who couldn't pay the bills, so I agreed to pay them and to have the number ported to my account.  AT&amp;T went through five different verification procedures to make sure that I *really* wanted to port the number and pay the bill, and then in the end **never actually ported the number** and tried to stick me with the bill anyways.

Very few people (not even Satoshi himself) expected Bitcoin to remain decentralized in practice.  At least this way, the centralized parts can be moved off of the main blockchain, and the main chain can remain substantially decentralized.
The system also has a lot of other advantages as compared with both Bitcoin itself and existing payment providers:
* Intermediaries only have the option to either process transactions, or not.  No other trust is required.  Everything can be reverted back to Bitcoin at any time.
* It solves the confirmation time issue.  Payments are nearly instantaneous.
* It's all Bitcoin.  No intermediate currencies involved.
* Anyone can be a payment provider.  There are no barriers to entry.
* It incentivizes the creation of physical network infrastructure within the Bitcoin community, which is a weak point currently.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:49:07
Yes, it is possible to satisfy both.  We agree on that.  And there are likely multiple ways to do so.  The question is, what is the simplest way (or combination of ways) that most satisfies the interests of all parties?
And that really is the crux of the matter here, the issue that the more technical developers don't seem to get: **it absolutely must be a simple solution**.  It has to be understandable and easily explainable to the average person.  The average person will not put his money in some complicated instrument that he doesn't understand, and shouldn't have to.
Bitcoin is simple enough, once you accept the premise that elliptic curve cryptography is basically magic.  And, just as importantly, it is proven now for several years.
Scaling Bitcoin, however, regardless of method, is going to alter the current economic structure, and perhaps even incentives.  In fact, *not* scaling Bitcoin will also have economic consequences.  There are no good choices, here.  Bitcoin should scale.  But if we want to scale Bitcoin in some way that is not identical to the (flawed, really) method laid out by Satoshi before he left, we absolutely must be able to demonstrate that the economic consequences of doing so will be substantially similar or at least no worse than that, default, method.
So, we can come up with a lot of solutions for scaling Bitcoin.  And many of them will be preferable to the default method.  But what we *can't* do is rely on some radically complex solution like treechains or similar that has completely unforeseen economic properties, or which can't be easily explained to an average person.
I think we both understand that a system that is perpetually limited to processing fewer transactions on-chain than even the highly-centralized existing central banking system is not really a de-centralized system, regardless of the number of nodes, and not really Bitcoin.  Similarly, we agree that a system which can handle the on-chain transactions of tens of millions of people, yet which requires access to nodes operating out of centralized datacenters is not really Bitcoin, either.
So the solution will have to be somewhere in-between, or somewhere orthogonal to, each of those "default" outcomes.
I think lightning is a good solution.  I think it will likely be no worse, economically and in regards to decentralization, than the default scaling method.  And I think it solves a few other problems as well.
*But*, if lightning requires radical changes to the way Bitcoin works currently, enough so that a competent developer can claim that it also would be "not Bitcoin," then perhaps it has not yet satisfied that requirement of being simple enough to explain to an average person.

I don't have time to respond to all of this right now, but I'll just say that the reason I never implemented "Sidechains" proper is the same reason that **you** haven't implemented them, and have instead concentrated on monopolizing Bitcoin core developers -- making the necessary changes requires commit access to Bitcoin core.  Implementing them anywhere else is pointless.
As for the others, I did implement the Bitcoin Bonds, what I consider the direct precursor to one-way pegged Sidechains.  (The critical difference being that a pegged Sidechain takes the additional step of creating a mirror coin on the Sidechain once the Bond is created, the same way that Bencoins are issued whenever Bitcoins are deposited with the trusted third party.)  And you know this, because you were chatting with me in the  channel when I broadcast the first Bitcoin Bond, witnessed it and helped answer some of my questions.  It's still right there [on the blockchain]( for anyone to see.
Regardless, I'm not here to bicker over details.  I'm just pointing out that Sidechains, or similar, do have legitimate applications in Bitcoin scaling.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:55:37


A fee market requires basically only one thing, which I've mentioned a couple of times.  It requires the user to have a choice between one of two alternatives -- for instance, between [two chains of different sizes](
The choice has to be real, as in people must actually be able to make the choice.  (A 1mb chain which people could only access, on average, once every 73 years is not a real choice.)
The choice has to be meaningful, yet specifically tied to the feature in question.  It should be a choice between two chains of different sizes, *with few other differences*, for instance.  It can't be a choice between two chains with radically different features, or two completely different currencies -- that's too much.  Likewise, it can't be a choice between two chains of identical size.
And the choice has to carry some risk.  For instance, if I transfer my coins into a 1gb chain, I have to accept the risk that fees may go up if I want to transfer them back out.  I have to accept the risk of centralization in dealing with whatever entities are able to process the 1gb chain.
So, there it is.  Those are simple market mechanics.  Frankly, I haven't seen anything close even mentioned by the naive proponents of "hitting the 1mb limit in order to create a fee market."  And, frankly, I'm not sure any of them actually understand how it would even work, anyways.  But that's how.  That's the simplest arrangement.
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:11:39
The only way to raise fees is to cut short the inflation schedule.  This impacts the potential future profits of miners, but it's not as though those are guaranteed anyways.
If anything, raising the block size limit, making miners actually work for their inflation subsidy, and ignoring their cries of increasing costs would be a preferable solution.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:27:19

Yes, it would be built into your wallet.  But, in the beginning at least, your wallet would probably be tied to some specific payment provider with whom you would maintain a sum of locked coins.  The seller would probably have multiple such arrangements with all of the main payment providers.  Large sellers would likely be payment providers themselves.
So, for instance, you could have a wallet provided by Walmart, and a sum of locked coins that you use to make regular purchases at Walmart, but they could provide payment services to other sellers as well, using those same coins.
The thing is, it's all still just Bitcoin.  None of the parties require any trust, because they can't take your locked Bitcoins without you authorizing it.

Too bad.  You can't have it both ways.  Six months ago, everyone was crying about how MtGox crashed and took their money and no one had any warning.  Well, this is your warning.  Government agencies are attacking Bitcoin businesses.  It's not a conspiracy theory.  It's well-supported fact, openly admitted in many cases.  Regulatory capture and extra-judicial bureaucratic action are now documented features of doing business in the US.  You can either support the Bitcoin businesses that benefit from regulating their competitors out of business, and that openly support this kind of regulation, or you can support Bitcoin businesses that avoid voluntary interaction with extraneous and unnecessary government regulators.  But what you can't do is pretend that it's not happening, or that it's not a valid topic of discussion.

Not deflationary, but steady-state.  This talk has a massive gaping intellectual hole right at the point where he says that more money is needed in order to distribute more goods.  Wrong.  Goods can become cheaper, and they should.  If money is an information network, then altering the supply of money (typically done in secret) distorts the information it carries.  An inflationary currency is a massive game of "telephone" in which the information is different at different points in the network, and only truly useful to those with the privilege to print new money.

First of all, I'll say that there seems to be a fundamental disconnect between this author's economic views, right or wrong, and the basic premise on which Bitcoin was created.  Nothing in Bitcoin is too-big-to-fail, not even miners.
Regardless, the author's economic views also appear to be severely misguided.


The author seems to be making two mistakes, here.  Firstly, he thinks he's arguing against labor-value theory.  Secondly, he's parroting the equally ridiculous Austrian subjective-value theory.
The reality is that neither is completely correct.  The "production cost" of transporting a gold bar from New York to Shanghai will always be greater than zero.  It doesn't really matter what "individuals" *want* this cost to be.  No exercise of personal willpower can change it, because it is a consequence of basic laws of physics.  That cost will also, likely, always be greater than the fee for transmitting the same value of Bitcoin.  And, lastly, there will always be some demand for this service.  If any one of these premises ever change, then it means that Bitcoin has become completely obsolete, and deserves to fail because there is some new, better alternative (that likely violates known physics).


Actually, scratch that.  Three mistakes.  The other mistake is in assuming that profit is necessary in order for Bitcoin miners to process transactions.  In fact, in the long run, miner profit is *antithetical* to the continuing functioning of Bitcoin as a neutral currency.  Even in the short run, rigging Bitcoin to become a profit center threatens ruinous regulatory intervention at the very least.  But in the long run, guaranteed profit (however small) derived from pretend work is the exact flaw in the centralized fiat currency regime that Bitcoin was created to correct.


.  




Make that four mistakes.
Frankly, I would expect someone with two years of experience with Bitcoin to come up with better arguments than these.

Yes, Bitcoin the **unregulated currency** was released in 2009.  And it's clear that Satoshi knew from the beginning that governments would attempt to regulate it.  That's why he said "we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."
But, for some reason, you don't see a contradiction when the creator of Bitcoin equates regulation with "loss of freedom."  Somehow you want us to believe that regulation was part of the original plan?
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:07:29
Yes, that's right, historically speaking at least.  There are several different cycles in any mature economy.  The annual cycle is one of the most dominant.  This is one of the cycles that is actively managed by governments in order to skim the productive capacity of their citizens.
Bitcoin doesn't have regular long-term cycles, yet.  It has daily, weekly, and monthly cycles, based on geography and pay periods.  Yet these short term cycles are not as prevalent as they once were.
I had this thought a few weeks ago, that we could now be seeing the emergence of an annual cycle in Bitcoin.  This is likely deliberate.  Especially with the tax guidance, handed down at the last minute, causing a forced drop in prices.  If I'm right, the cycle could be about the same as we saw last year, low in the late spring and high in the late fall, which is fairly standard.
The tax cattle Bitcoin early investors will fall right into it, of course.

In one sense, mining does absolutely nothing.  It's not strictly necessary in order to process transactions.  The algorithm performs no useful work or specific task.  It's just a pointless game that determines the distribution of new Bitcoins.
In another sense, mining is essential.  It keeps the network decentralized.  It provides an alternative price signal by tying Bitcoin to the costs of energy and high-tech manufacturing.  It enables bootstrapping and growth without centralized control.  It protects the network from outside interference.  And it provides a necessary psychological placebo, perhaps even a transitional pathway to enlightenment, for seven billion barely-evolved hairless apes who have grown far too accustomed to performing subsidized make-work in exchange for treats from their incorporeal caretakers.

Because the FBI's own mission statement [now clearly says]( that their job is no longer law enforcement.  It's "national security."

Yeah, Coinbase are crony capitalists.  I'm surprised this isn't more widely known, actually.
Remember a little business called "BitFloor"?  Remember how they were doing pretty well with their business model of trading *their own* Bitcoins, which they bought from a major exchange once a day?  This practice neatly avoided regulators, and gave Bitcoin a base price from which to grow, hence the name, Bitcoin "Floor".
Well, mysteriously, they got hacked.  And it happened around the same time that the FBI was directing LulzSec to hack a bunch of other people, including some other Bitcoin businesses.  And then this new business, "Coinbase" popped up with a similar name and founders from Goldman Sachs and the same business model but with regulators attached.
But I'm sure it's all a big coincidence, because Wall St. and the US government are a bunch of angels who would never do anything like that.

It's cheaper than transporting gold, which is the only really comparable competitor.  Everything else requires counterparty risk.
Also, there's a difference between end-user cost and physical costs.  The physical cost of Bitcoin is relatively high, especially compared to theoretical alternatives.  The end-user cost, however, is lower (and could remain lower indefinitely) because of the lack of monopoly rents.

It will take years for Bitcoin to stabilize enough to compete with currencies in developed countries.  Of course there will be adoption before then, and speculation.  But from a neutral point of view, an average random person probably doesn't have much incentive to use Bitcoin until it is a much more stable store of value.  Most people have little or no savings, perhaps a months worth.  Holding Bitcoin as a currency over short periods still carries a lot of risk.

@_date: 2014-10-17 02:12:34
If you want automatic conversion, you will need to use a payment processor like BitPay or Coinbase.  There are several factors to consider, including:
* Fees
* Support for website/shopping cart software
* Support for physical point of sale systems
* Reputation
But, in lieu of a full-service processor, all you *really* need in order to accept and store Bitcoin is to have an offline wallet to generate addresses, and provide each customer a unique address (with an optional QR code) along with the amount to pay.  You then use an online client to monitor the blockchain for as many confirmations as you need in order to consider the payment complete.

Currencies were historically backed by something, usually gold.  They have interest from a legal/regulatory standpoint because of the potential for fraud when this backing turns out to be less than advertised.  This is the basis of regulation of the banking system, and especially the practice of fractional-reserve banking.
Bitcoin, however, is not backed.  It is not advertised as being backed.  It is an un-backed, full reserve currency.  Therefore, from a legal standpoint, it is not equivalent to other "currencies" in which the potential for fraudulent issuance exists.

Nonsense.  What we've seen over the past year is the opposite of clarity.  The last 12 months or so will go down as the most confused, nonsensical, least-clear period in Bitcoin's history.  And it was all started off by that ridiculously deceptive "guidance" from FinCEN, which will eventually be reversed along with half of the other Bitcoin "regulations" that have been handed down since then.
No, there is no clarity.  In the last six months, nearly every major government and central bank in the world has issued their own, usually contradictory visions of Bitcoin "regulation".  Many of their opinions have even been reversed or recanted.  Most still contradict each other, and sometimes even themselves.
In the last six months, Chinese media pumped Bitcoin with permissive signals, then the PBOC dumped it with warnings and restrictions, which were themselves later walked back.  And now, to cap it all off, we get the IRS (finally) revealing the bankers' hand by attempting to re-define the core nature of Bitcoin, through edict, manipulated opinion and, ultimately, raw violence.  The thickness of trolls on this subreddit over the past twenty-four hours speaks volumes about their desperation.
So I say nonsense.  Nothing is more clear.  It's all distraction.  It will all go away.
Until every government and every central bank in the world eventually recognizes the **fact** that Bitcoin is a full-reserve, inherently non-fraudulent and non-criminal unregulated and unregulatable sovereign currency outside of the grasp of their commercial tentacles, a simple technological extension of every human being's god-given right to trade, there will be no *clarity*.  Only these kinds of deliberate distractions.
They can continue for years, for all I care.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.  The only thing that is going away is what little credibility regulators still have.

That's all true.  But there is a chicken/egg issue.  Using Bitcoin as a currency requires a relatively stable price.  Stability requires a *high* price, which requires some speculation and investment.  Now, this is somewhat mitigated by services like BitPay.  But the fact remains -- a higher price is generally a more stable price, which enables easier trade and more use.

The US government (Democrats especially) has an ongoing policy of selling the services of the American police state in order to secure resources for China.  This is what happened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya (planned for all of Africa really).  It is part of what is currently happening in Ukraine and Thailand.  Russia as well.
Look at what is going on today.  Bitcoin is enabling capital flight out of China.  Chinese real estate investors are going under as wealthy Chinese escape the grasp of their own government.  And Bitcoin is helping.  I'm not claiming that Bitcoin is the focus of attention, far from it.  But China is the 500 lb gorilla, and the US is tied at the hip.  When it gets upset, everything in the way is targeted.
It was pretty clear what happened in December, just from the sequence of events.  The Chinese have been mining for a while.  Many miners likely reached the end of profitability.  Chinese buying of Bitcoin took off.  The price took off.  Chinese authorities became alarmed.  Regulators stepped in.  The price fell.  Regulators backed off.  Obviously the push for regulation is motivated by something other than legality.
Regardless, yes the US government is targeting Bitcoin.  It has been for years.  It's only now becoming obvious.  The central bank statements you refer to were clearly coordinated.  Not only are they targeting Bitcoin, but they're doing a bad job of it.  Retroactive IRS rules, really?  This is desperation.  This is currency warfare, not regulation.

Some people would rather hold and use a currency that isn't guaranteed to go down in value than deal with the front-running and fees and random confiscations of other currencies and payment methods, even if some of them do come with some consumer protections.
Look, people don't buy Bitcoins in order to spend them at a particular merchant.  I agree that that's an idiotic notion.  They buy Bitcoins to use as a currency *in general*.  The more merchants who accept Bitcoin, the more likely it is that people will feel comfortable buying and holding and using them.  It's not a direct correlation.  And it's not instant.

Sorry, but you're still not on the right track.  Bitcoin *does* contradict the regression theorem, because the regression theorem is backwards.
The regression theorem basically asserts that monetary value comes from the *past*;  eg. gold had value in the past, therefore it has value today.
But this is obviously bullshit.  Seashells had value in the past, but they don't have much value today.  Zimbabwe dollars had value in the past, but they don't have much value today.  Sticks and giant stones and dozens of other monetary systems and fiat currencies had value in the past, but no value today.
So, the regression theorem has it completely backwards.  Monetary value doesn't come from the past.  It comes from expected *future* value.  Seashells had expected future value, at one time, because there was no better alternative means of trade.  Gold has expected future value, because gold a thousand years from now is the same as gold today, except perhaps more scarce.  (Or perhaps not.)  Paper currency has expected future value, because people who like to pay taxes will accept it for goods and services, to pay taxes in the future.


Still not right.  It's only a "payment system" for Bitcoins, just like every other currency is technically a "payment system" for itself.  That's not a distinguishing feature.  The currency still has to have value for someone to want it, even if it is easy to transfer over large distances, as with Bitcoin.  In every instance, that value comes from the *future*, not the past.
In short, the regression theorem is backwards.  Monetary value is future value.

To really get Bitcoin, you don't have to know programming, per se.  But you do need to understand the cryptography behind it.  Perhaps that would be a useful tack.
From an economic perspective, though, saying "we could use our gold" is kind of a curious response.  Most people don't own gold.  Gold is a terrible medium of exchange.  A lot of people question whether the Federal Reserve or the Treasury really have the gold reserves they claim.  And, even if they do, the question is not whether Bitcoin is better than gold.  The question is whether Bitcoin is better than fiat currency that isn't even backed by gold, regardless.

You should know that the term "positive" money originates from the concept of "legal positivism," which itself comes from a group of authoritarians who attempted to hijack the very successful idea of "logical positivism," on which much of the enlightenment was based.
"Logical positivism" is the simple idea that nothing exists, even theoretically, which is not observed and supported.  This is the basis of empiricism and the scientific method.  It is basically the idea that there must be "positive" (as opposed to negative) evidence for a thing's existence before it can be accepted.
"Legal positivism," on the other hand, is some deliberate nonsense, piggybacking on the success of logical positivism, while twisting and distorting its meaning.  "Positive" in this sense doesn't mean "the opposite of negative."  It means "positional" or "hierarchical".  So the idiots who adhere to this philosophy argue that laws have validity not due to objective acceptance or consent of the governed, but by virtue of their being handed down from a "position" of authority.
"Positive money," as far as I can tell, is the same thing.  They think money should be top-down, based on "position."  Their objection to the current banking system is that it isn't authoritarian enough.  It has nothing to do with logic or even what is "good."  They are deliberately attempting to fool people by hijacking the word "positive" for their own perverse ends.

Nicki Minaj is what most people mean when they say "music".  It doesn't make it so.  Whatever you've been brainwashed into believing "inflation" means in government schools is completely irrelevant.  We don't have to use language that's been deliberately weaponized against the average persons ability to accurately understand how money works.  It's not that complicated.
And dishonest?  Nonsense.  I'd say trying to hide monetary inflation by pretending that price inflation is all that matters is the dishonest route.  The supply of Bitcoins inflates at around 10%, currently.  It will decrease in the future.  And of course it doesn't matter as long as Bitcoin is growing.  But why would we tell people anything about whether their "purchasing power" will go up or down?  That's completely impossible to know, and depends on dozens of factors completely outside the purview of Bitcoin, or any other currency for that matter.

Okay, I'm not going to answer your other questions without answering the first one, because the crux of the matter is the definition of deflation.
Deflation is simply, and only, a reduction in supply of a currency relative to everything else.  No other definition is even self-consistent.  And I'll explain why.
Keynesians like to argue that deflation/inflation is a change in the *overall prices* of things that a currency can be used to purchase.  That's actually true, it is.  But that *only* comes about because of a change in the supply of that currency relative to everything else.  And here's why.
A currency, if it can be used to buy even one thing at all, can be used to buy *anything*, just indirectly.  So there is always a price, denominated in that currency, for *anything*.  It may be rather high, depending.  But it exists.
Once you accept that assertion, then you accept that there is nothing really *outside* the economy of any particular currency.  There isn't really any such *thing* as "adoption".  There is only a change in price of a particular currency in relation to some particular good or service (or in this case competing currency) that it can be used to purchase.
So, when you say "if users adopt" Bitcoin over, say, US dollars, that doesn't really change anything about the overall equation.  There are still the same number of Bitcoins as before, and the same amount of everything else.  All that changes is the price, in Bitcoins, of that one particular thing that Bitcoins can be used to buy, *relative* to the price of everything else.  And when the price of dollars, denominated in Bitcoins, goes down (when users "adopt" Bitcoin), the price of everything else Bitcoins can be used to purchase (everything) **goes up by the same amount, by definition**, because those Bitcoins, at that moment, are not available to be used to buy anything else.
And that's all there is to it.  The Keynesian definition of deflation/inflation, when placed in a consistent framework, reduces to the classical definition of deflation/inflation -- a change in the supply of the currency relative to everything it can be used to purchase.
So, in practice, in order to maintain the (inconsistent) Keynesian definition of deflation/inflation, something must be excluded.  As a Keynesian, you can't say "this currency can be used to buy anything," even though that may be the case.  You have to say "this currency can be used to buy anything, **but** credit derivatives," or "**but** energy," or "**but** food," or "**but** real estate."
As it turns out, that's exactly what Keynesians do.  They say "well, the definition of inflation includes everything **but** food and energy," or "our inflationary monetary policy works in an economy with everything **but** real estate bubbles," or "banks should be able to spend newly-printed money on anything **but** credit derivatives."  Keynesianism only works, in real life, when paired with an ever-evolving set of "gotchas."
It's not realistic.  And it's not realistic for a specific reason:  the Keynesian definition of inflation/deflation is not self-consistent.

Yes, the "Ross Ulbricht" character filed a claim for coins, completely against his legal interests, ~~which was denied~~.  He only did this after the government announced plans to sell off the coins, and many people rightly pointed out how inconsistent this was, to dump coins before there was even a trial.  So the government was clearly in a hurry to attempt to crash the price of Bitcoin last fall, and tripped over their own dicks in the process.
Because now we can see what is really going on.  ~~Now, we see the reason the claim was denied.~~  Now we have evidence that "Ross Ulbricht" is not the real DPR.  ~~The coins were never his.~~  He had nothing to fear from making claims on them, because he's in on the sham.  The real DPR has likely already made a plea agreement, and is safely in witness protection.  There's no way he wouldn't sell out his biggest customers.  There's no way the government would parade his face in front of the cameras in a legitimate trial.  And there's no way the government would quietly shut down something as revolutionary as Silk Road without taking the opportunity to demonize Bitcoin a few dozen more times in the media.
So, everything from here on out is a Soviet show trial, completely authorized by the domestic propaganda provisions of the NDAA.  And it won't be the last.

Satoshi only has less than 10% of all Bitcoins.  And by all indications he hasn't spent any of them in five years.  He could spend all of them in a single year and still not come close to the debasement that the FED is responsible for.  And Satoshi can only do so once.

@_date: 2014-01-15 14:18:59
E-mail is transmitted over the internet, through dozens of routers and servers, in plain text.  It can be intercepted by any of them along the way.
But here's the way public key cryptography works.  Assume you want to send an item to someone else, through the mail, without anyone intercepting it along the way.  You could put it in a box, and put a lock on the box.  (We'll just assume for argument's sake that the box is strong enough to prevent anyone from opening it without the key.)
But the problem is that, once the receiver gets the box, she doesn't have the key to open it.  And you can't send the key, obviously, because then anyone would be able to open the box along the way.
So, here's what you do.  You put the item in the box, put your lock on it, and send it to the receiver.  When the receiver gets it, she can't open it.  But she puts *her own lock* on it as well, and sends it back to you.  Now you have a box with two locks, yours and hers.  You remove your lock, and send it back.  It's just a box with her lock, and the item inside, which she can unlock with her key.
Public key cryptography does the same thing, but using numbers instead of locks.  Just like a lock and key, encryption "keys" are split into two matched parts, one that locks and one that unlocks.  The public key can be given out freely -- it only locks.  The private key is used to unlock, and obviously should be kept private.  When someone wants to send you something, they just need your public key, equivalent to a box with your lock on it.

He seems to think that governments will be able to manipulate Bitcoin as easily as they can gold.  Yeah, sure, this is a threat.  Of course it is.  But it's a threat to gold.

The point is that when the value goes up, and we start using smaller units, there won't be any practical limits to the value increasing, unlike gold for instance.

Fractional reserve is still kind of possible within Bitcoin.  The difference is that banks and patrons who take the risk of supporting fractional reserve also take the risk of loss that entails.
With Bitcoin, instead of allowing banks the exclusive right to print money, which they have repeatedly abused, new "real economic production" within the Bitcoin economy simply increases the relative value of all Bitcoins.  And since Bitcoins are near-infinitely divisible, unlike fiat currencies, deflation is not a problem.
So, in Bitcoin, the reward for real economic production is pushed to the edges of the economy, where it is produced, rather than concentrated in the middle, where fiat money creation is controlled.

Number of transactions is just one piece of the puzzle.  Value is another piece.  If the value is constantly increasing, the number of transactions doesn't necessarily have to increase.

The major requirement for individuals to meaningfully participate in Bitcoin without being dependent upon third-party wallet services is to receive and maintain a copy of the blockchain.  The blockchain is large and growing, so this imposes physical requirements and costs in the form of internet bandwidth and storage.
Broadcasting the blockchain over a connection that is free or very low cost, such as terrestrial broadcast towers or satellites, removes the cost of receiving the blockchain for the individual and can enable secure, trustless usage of Bitcoin anywhere within wireless range of the signal.  This can enable mobile users or sites without constant internet access to verify the receipt of Bitcoins at zero cost.  Sending Bitcoins requires just a kilobyte or so, and can be done over a separate, intermittent (pay-per-use) connection.

Beyond that, why don't you tell us what you'd like to see?  Are you happy with just entering the total amount and getting a QR code, or would you like something more comprehensive?  What inventory/accounting/POS program do you use already?  Almost any Bitcoin wallet app can be used for point-of-sale, but if you're looking for some specific features you should tell us what you want.

Lots of poor assumptions in this analysis.  Do you have a source?
He's assuming that Satoshi is one person.  If Satoshi is three people, you're really going to tell us that they each deserve a tiny fraction of the "reward" given to kowtowing opportunists like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates?  Please...
He's assuming that Satoshi is still alive.  Maybe Satoshi didn't get shit for inventing Bitcoin.  Maybe he got a bullet to the head.  That's a very real possibility, and someone like Jim Bell should know.  Did Zuckerberg or Gates risk death in order to bring the masses their advertising/spying/labor wasting software?  Of course not.
So, even if we take Bill Gates as an example, (which we shouldn't since creating a viable global currency isn't even remotely in the realm of creating a defective graphical user interface) the price of Bitcoin could go up by a factor of 100 before Satoshi even comes close to Gates' $70 billion fortune.

Mining is designed to be a zero-sum game.  In the long run, on average, you shouldn't make a profit by mining over buying, (unless you are in an area with unusually high Bitcoin prices).  So it will affect the price exactly in proportion to the inflation rate (newly-mined coins).  3600 new coins per day is a fairly high inflation rate, but actually not a huge amount of the total market, especially considering growth in usage.
The larger effect is that miners tend to be new users who don't know any of this, and who therefore overvalue mining (and Bitcoin by extension) in the short term and eventually have to liquidate at a loss in the long run.  So, miners mainly cause price fluctuations at the moment, rather than any kind of sustained pressure one way or another.

It's not an either/or question.  Bitcoin is not perfect money.  It's still a somewhat risky investment.  But it is *becoming* money, over time, the more people hold it and the more businesses accept it.
Money is just a store of future value.  If you can reasonably expect that Bitcoin today will be worth at least as much five years from now, then Bitcoin is money.  Many people think so.  But even if it isn't, Bitcoin is still currency that has *current* value and that can be used as a medium of exchange.  And that's almost as useful.

Bitcoin isn't just a commodity;  it's a currency.  It has the potential to be far more liquid than any commodity.  And if you look at the charts carefully, the times volatility has increased have been when Bitcoin trade has been hindered by large-scale attacks or regulatory action.
It's true that Bitcoin has not grown organically over the past two years.  It has grown in fits and starts.  Certain groups and interests have periodically pushed the price up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with the real Bitcoin economy.  But these are simply growing pains.  They will go away once Bitcoin is too big to easily push around.

Blockchain size is a huge issue going forward.  Frankly, I'm surprised that OP_RETURN is even being supported at all, even though the [justifications for it]( are fairly simple.
It is great that they want to build on top of Bitcoin, but these services should not be using Bitcoin as a data store.  It is simply laziness not to take the obvious approach of pointing to some external source.  I worked out this (Mastercoin/etc) scheme a couple of years ago, and that's how I would have done it.  Anything less is irresponsible.
I really don't have time to read a 300 page thread about whatever their service is trying to accomplish.  Maybe I will have to do it regardless.  But Mike is probably the most competent Bitcoin developer, and Luke is no slouch.  If they say 40 bytes is sufficient, I'm inclined to believe it.

I generally agree with this.  It does put a burden on businesses to have to manage Bitcoin volatility when they get more orders when the price is high.  It's kind of a dick move to only buy when the price is high.  But with services like BitPay, they can manage the amount of Bitcoins that they are willing to hold.  So there is a potential for it to turn out better for everyone when done correctly.

Bitcoin isn't a payment system for anything but Bitcoins.  It can't legally be regulated.
A "payment system" is a (third-party) system that is used to transfer some currency, Yen, Euros or Dollars for instance.  The only reason payment systems are regulated, the only reason they even **can be regulated**, is because there is a chance that the Yen, Euros or Dollars might be *lost* in the process of payment.  This happens all the time.  Banks go bankrupt and lose customer funds.  The risk of loss is built-in to the fractional-reserve banking system.
Bitcoin doesn't have that risk.  There are no banks in Bitcoin.  The only third party is the Bitcoin network.  Asserting that the regulations regularly imposed on payment systems, credit cards for instance, should or even *can be* imposed on Bitcoin implies that there is some possibility for Bitcoins to be lost in the process of payment.  And that just doesn't happen.
So it would be the same as imposing regulations on cash.  Cash is a payment system.  It'd be like having to sign a five-page agreement (as are typical for credit cards) every time you hand someone a twenty dollar bill.  It's nonsense.

So, I looked into something similar to this a couple of weeks ago, because I was looking for a payment processor that accepts both Bitcoin and credit cards.
Here's where you need to look.  There are a few major credit card processors.  Right now, the biggest, First Data, is hostile to Bitcoin.  They won't work with businesses that use Bitcoin **at all**.  But they have some competitors.  Some of the smaller ones are seeing an opportunity.  Some are investing in Bitcoin payment companies already.
The closest thing I could find was that [Digital River]( has [partnered]( with Coinbase to provide both Bitcoin and credit card processing.  The next step is obviously to start paying out in Bitcoin as well.  But it will no doubt be limited to very safe merchants in the beginning.  This is still a hostile environment.  Payment processors will likely want to see an established business with a brick-and-mortar shop before even thinking of paying out in Bitcoins.

The reference client no longer keeps an index of transactions by default, for speed and space reasons.  So, in order to check the chain, you need to either 1) tell the client which addresses to track as it goes along processing blocks (what this patch does), or you need to 2) search through all of the blocks every time you want to check an address balance (*very* slow), or you need to 3) re-enable the full transaction index feature so that you can quickly calculate the balances of arbitrary addresses (requires more disk space).

"Money" as it applies to the concept of money laundering refers to force.  There is no "money laundering" without some original initiation of force, some crime.  The general application of "money laundering" to things which are obviously not force, and which are not derived from any original criminal initiation of force, like an individual voluntarily doing drugs, derives from the taint of hierarchical force introduced by fiat money printing.
So, in this case, the argument goes something like this: doing drugs is illegal because it causes others to have to do drugs, due to the transmission of hierarchical force provided by fiat money printing.  Using Bitcoins to "launder" this (fiat) money, or hierarchical force, in support of people doing drugs is therefore also illegal, because it furthers the crime of causing people to have to do drugs involuntarily.  That's what they have to prove.
I doubt they will prove it.  I doubt they will even try.  But that really doesn't matter anyways, since Ross Ulbricht is an actor and this is ultimately just a show trial.

You're missing a huge part of this process.  Here's more of what actually happens.
Some tech early adopter, let's call him 'Sergei', scours the internet to find interesting new products to buy.  He decides to spend $300 on a new computer that just was released.  Sergei has a knack for these types of things, and he thinks this one is a good deal.
Sergei likes to pay with his credit card that he got from the biggest bank in town, let's call it 'Push' bank.  ([Here]( is the logo of Push bank.)  The card is very convenient.  Sergei gets 1% cash back on purchases, and a good interest rate.  Since Sergei pays with his credit card, the information on this purchase goes directly into a big computer at Push bank.
Push bank uses sophisticated algorithms to determine that Sergei is, indeed, a prescient early tech adopter.  He can spot a good deal on computers.  Push bank decides that the computer Sergei bought is likely under-priced.  That's true in this case.  Sergei chose a computer from a small start-up that makes good quality products but has just begun to establish itself in the market.
Push bank then goes to its lender, Confederated Money-Printing, Inc., to arrange a loan for the small start-up computer manufacturer to expand its operations.  The CMP sees that Push bank is a large bank, and approves their loan.  The CMP then prints money out of thin air to loan to Push bank at 0.5%, which they then use to make a $100 million loan to the small computer-manufacturing start-up at the rate of 12%.
Now the small computer manufacturing start-up has hit the big time!  They expand their operations and hire 100 new employees.  The founders all cash out their stock and retire to a life of snorting coke off hookers' asses.  Consultants are brought in to advise on how to maximize profits by cutting corners on quality.  Now they're making computers at even lower cost than they were before.  They partner with TigerDirect (also a Push bank customer) to sell their computers at an even higher price.  Profits are soaring.  They start an advertising campaign to market to the general public.
Now we're ready for your mother to come along.
Since your mother is not at the forefront of technology, she's at the bottom of this pyramid.  She pays $1000 for a computer that is worse than the one Sergei paid $300 for.  When it breaks a few years later, she goes to get warranty repair service only to find that the small computer start-up is now bankrupt.  Even though sales were good, in the beginning, they've had a lot of returns of faulty products.  They couldn't successfully manage their growth and pay their loan to Push bank.  Push bank is also having some financial difficulties because of making bad loans lately.  But that's okay, they get a bail-out from the government, and Confederated Money Printing, Inc. prints them some money to help them get through the unforeseeable recession.
Your mother, though, is paying extra taxes collected by the government to help bail-out Push bank.  Prices on things go up a little faster than usual, because of the extra money printing done by the CMP.  She begins to notice, and is feeling squeezed and a little stressed out.  She loses her pension that was invested in the stock market, due to algorithmic trading by Push bank.  Eventually she can't keep up, and Push bank repossesses her house.  She dies broke and penniless and leaves her children with nothing.  You are now a wage slave to Push bank.  Their motto is 'Push Harder^TM '.

It's true that Bitcoin will become more centralized over time.  The capital costs of mining will grow.

Meh, that's mostly correct.  An address is actually a hash of a public key.  There are lite wallets like Mycelium that aren't remote, and that don't store the blockchain.  Transactions are added to blocks by miners, not by wallets.
To answer your question about signing, that's what the one-way function is for.  It is easy to derive the signed transaction, given the unsigned transaction and the private key, but it is very difficult to derive the private key given the unsigned transaction and the signed transaction.

The security differences aren't even that great.  The hash data is still secured by the Bitcoin network.  No other blockchains or miners are even necessary.

Volatility should be expected to decrease as Bitcoin grows.  It is still very early in that respect.
Think of it this way.  Assume that you are a Canadian travelling to Las Vegas for vacation.  You want to bring a lot of money with you, to gamble, but you don't want to risk having it seized.  Maybe you are willing to deal with 5% in fees, and perhaps a 20% volatility risk for a week or so, if the alternative is a chance of having 100% taken.
Maybe you have some money you want to save for a few years, and you live in a country with high inflation.  You're able to be flexible in when you buy and sell.  All you care about is that Bitcoin beats inflation over a long enough period of time, which it historically has.

I'll just point out that Bitcoin would likely not exist today if it weren't at least mostly anonymous.  Running the Bitcoin network, at a level that prevents it from being trivially co-opted, requires a rather large amount of resources.  That requires incentive.

Without at least some anonymity, some protection against inflation-subsidized front-running, banks would make Bitcoin obsolete overnight.

Actually, credit that is based on derivatives behaves very differently from credit that is not.  Many people, including economists, missed this fact in the 00's.  Bitcoin is not just gold.  It is near-infinitely divisible.  It has very low transport costs.  It is easy to validate.  It does not suffer from financialization or re-hypothecation, as gold currently does.  It doesn't have gold's stigma of monopolization, price-fixing, or regulatory barriers that prevent its use as a currency.  Now, perhaps one could argue that Bitcoin will eventually turn into gold 2.0, and stagnate and hinder a functioning economy.  But that hasn't happened.  And that's not for economists to decide, especially not economists who advocate the current economic system based on force and fraud.  It's for us to determine how Bitcoin behaves.

A colored coin is an actual Bitcoin (usually a small fraction) that you say represents some other unit of value, like a piece of property or a share of stock or similar, and is traded as such on the blockchain using a client that is aware of this distinction.
A sidechain is when you lock Bitcoins on the blockchain, and simultaneously create a new coin that is tracked and traded on a separate chain.  A sidechain has a few advantages -- that the ratio between sidechain coins and Bitcoins doesn't have to be static, that they can be traded without using the Bitcoin blockchain (with lower fees or more quickly or slowly for instance), and that sidechain coins can be more accurately accounted-for.

It kind of depends on the implementation of the miner.  Bitcoin is actually double SHA256.  So it's pretty safe to assume it will work on coins with the same algorithm.  It will probably work on single SHA256 coins as well.  But, unless it is a FPGA, no it won't work on Litecoin or similar.

What most of you still don't seem to understand is that central banking is not a grass-roots phenomenon.  It doesn't need your support.  They don't care whether you use their money or support their cronies, or not.  Central banks can out-live all of us.  They can print money for decades at a time, and spend all of the proceeds fighting anyone who threatens their monopoly.

Just keep in mind that most of these "regulatory" schemes are a coordinated effort backed by central banks (not governments).  And they are almost all hoaxes, designed to spread the meme that Bitcoin is regulated, when it's not.
In the US, for example, the "advice" (not regulation) refers to "convertible virtual currency" when Bitcoin is obviously neither convertible nor virtual.
I expect that more peripheral banks, in copying this effort, will tend to get it even more wrong, simply due to nuances of language.  "Moeda," for instance, is more correctly translated as "money," not "currency."  Even though legislators tend to use the terms interchangeably, they are not equivalent.
Now we have Brazil telling us that Bitcoin is not "convertible," and that users bear the risk of conversion, which is obvious.  But this is at odds with what US "regulators" have tried to claim.  And it seems Brazil is also going to stick with the claim that Bitcoin is "virtual," which they have to do because they have incorrectly confused Bitcoin with "money" instead of "currency," and they need to be able to distinguish it from their own fiat money.

The obvious objection is the same reason that Bitcoin exists in the first place: the calculation problem.  Ideal block size is dependent upon so many variables, many of which are completely outside the realm of computability and exist in the real world, that it is impossible to write an algorithm that "solves" for all of them.  The *only* solution that has ever come close, in all of human history, is a suitable market.  Arbitrary limits won't solve the problem.  Flawed algorithms won't solve the problem.  Humans forming a consensus every few years can probably kick the can down the road for a while.  But, ultimately, we have to either transcend the concept of "blocksize" entirely, or create a market that allows individuals to choose between at least a couple of options.

Not the exact same thing.  It is simpler, much more limited in many ways, yet potentially superior in others.  But it's the same general concept.
Sidechains only require a few improvements to the 'Bencoin' system described there.  One, the alt-chain itself, in place of the "central bank," is fairly obvious.  A couple of other pieces are necessary to make the whole thing work in a completely decentralized way.
Most of the concepts are there, though -- validating the parent chain, proof of possession, the confirmation period, pegging of external assets to Bitcoin.  It's a simple progression from Bencoin (with a single "central bank" functionary), to the "federated peg" described in [Appendix A of the sidechains paper]( (with multiple functionaries), to the "asymmetric two-way peg" in Section 3.3 (alt-chain as functionary), to the "symmetric two-way peg" in Section 3.2 (multiple chains functioning together).

[Here]( was my version of this concept.
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:38:04
Seems like a bunch of people still think they can turn Bitcoin into a Paypal clone, while each controlling a piece of the pie.  They say it will have "zero fees," (which is just a flat-out lie that none of them actually believe).  They say it will compete with existing payment systems which, as far as I can tell, they do actually seem to believe.  The only problem is, it's just not true.  It's some carefully-crafted Goldman Sachs propaganda.
Not a single one of them sees the big picture.  None of them will acknowledge, or even seem to understand, that once each of their start-ups takes its slice, and charges its fee, the entire system is less efficient and more costly than existing systems.  Even without the network fees and the third-party fees and the constant speculation and hackings and government attacks, **Bitcoin has 12% inflation**.  Forget Zimbabwe, there isn't a country on Earth that has 12% inflation *and* the infrastructure required to make economic use of a system like Bitcoin.  It's a *niche market*, but one that was growing just fine, albeit slowly, *without* this pack of investors at the helm.
But that's beside the point.  No one will want to use Bitcoin for the reasons they are touting.  They're selling a story of some kind of crappy Voltron that, once all the pieces are put together, falls over and explodes.  Each of them wants to tell us how great their piece is and how wonderful it will be when the entire system is put together, but none of them has actually done the work to understand how that system will function in its entirety.  They are letting venture capitalists and bankers tell us all fairy tales.
Here's reality:  The vision described in this video will function very poorly.  Once regulators get their noses under the tent, thanks to the constellation of incompetent sell-outs that VC investment attracts, they can use the eventual failures to attack the real heart of Bitcoin's value and the features that set it apart from fiat currencies -- Bitcoin's real economy, its decentralization, its anonymity, its fungibility, its irreversibility, its limited supply.  These people will happily sacrifice all of that in exchange for this carrot on a stick of "mainstream" adoption being held out in front of them by totally-controlled financial insiders.  It's just wrong.
I mean, Christ... parts of this video would be hilarious if they weren't so sad.  There's Peter Vessenes un-ironically talking about how consumers will love to use companies with the "Bitcoin Foundation Seal of Approval," while *two* Bitcoin Foundation board members are facing indictment.  Gavin Andressen says that banks have "a hundred years of experience in keeping people's money safe," as though he were completely oblivious to the reason Bitcoin was even created.  It's like watching a hostage tape.  If you look closely, you can almost see the gun pointed at their heads beyond the camera.  Is this Stockholm Syndrome?  What the hell is wrong with these people?

This is idiotic.  Currency doesn't have to be durable.  Gold isn't used as a medium of exchange or unit of account anywhere.  Gold isn't very divisible or interchangeable, either (a single cents worth would weigh 0.2 milligrams).
And this definition is completely oblivious to the etymology of the words themselves, as well as the historical development of each.  Money is not an improvement over currency.  And currency is not just degraded money.  Each has unique features that, it turns out, can be divorced from the other.  (Even after a hundred years of paper currency dominance, the gold bugs who made this video remain in denial of this fact.)
Here's a real definition:  Money is future value.  Currency is current value.  Not everything that has future value has current value.  And not everything that has current value has future value.  It's not difficult to understand that gold has future value because it will be the same 1000 years from now, while paper money has current value because you can use it to buy a hamburger.  If you find a place where you can use gold to buy a hamburger, then you can start calling it a currency and a medium of exchange.  If you find a paper currency that holds value for longer than 100 years, then you can start calling it money.  Until then, they're separate concepts.

Okay, so my understanding is a bit dated.  The issue of denying transactions has been solved with some consensus rules.  So what's the problem?  Not only does your concern already exist within Bitcoin, it's already been solved.  Merge-mined sidechains with the ability to "create Bitcoin" through transaction fees would require a fork anyways, and the same consensus rules can apply to them.  I don't see an issue.

Despite some propaganda efforts, Bitcoin isn't a democracy.  Network voting doesn't have anything to do with number of people/users.  Instead, you should be just as concerned about a minority voting to invalidate the wealth of the majority.  In fact, we have already seen several campaigns by miners to press for higher fees which are totally unjustified.

"More secure" in the sense that the mining network is more resistant to attack.  But less "secure" in terms of decentralization and resistance to other vectors of attack.  Security is a trade-off.  Mining is only one of several factors.

Unfortunately, it isn't.  The limit exists because each full node must be able to receive, process, and potentially store the entire blockchain.  The network also should reach a de-centralized consensus.  Without a block size limit, these two requirements become mutually-exclusive.  A miner with the ability to create a HUGE block (or many) can effectively reduce the network to only those nodes capable of receiving, and processing it.  This creates centralization and susceptibility to attack, at least, and at worst, outright failure.

[This]( appears to be the study in question.  Apparently, to get to the "45 percent" number, the authors found a bunch of tiny exchanges with little or no volume that operated for just a few months in 2011/2012, most of which quietly closed their doors without incident because, let's face it, they were just individual early adopters running hobby "exchanges" to begin with.
This completely skews the numbers against the significant exchanges, such as Tradehill, that were scuttled by regulators.  And, yes, it's likely that a significant number of those small exchanges closed due to the mere threat of regulation, as well.
edit:  To put it in perspective, using the studys own numbers, the exchanges that have closed (for any reason) represented only 17% of the total Bitcoin exchange trade volume.  The exchanges that closed *without repaying their customers* represented **only 3%**, by volume.

Reading what you wrote, I'm not sure you understand that, in your preferred scenario with a transaction limit, you wouldn't actually be able to verify your own transactions, because you likely wouldn't even be able to directly *make* transactions.  What do you think you would be looking for, in a 1MB block?  Your transaction certainly won't be in there.  All you would be able to "verify" is that one oligopoly provider transferred a large amount of Bitcoins to some other oligopoly provider.  Yawn.
Look, there are two general options.  Either we make transactions cheap, and verification expensive, or we make transactions expensive and verification cheap.  You want the latter.  But, like I said, I don't believe that's even economically possible.
In the long run, it won't really matter because the market will evolve ways for both to be cheap.  But the important point is that *the market can't do so* (there won't **be** a long run) if we artificially limit the ability to even make transactions in the first place.  The market for verification is **dependent upon** transactions.  It is therefore the secondary market.  Verification should be the premium service.
And it's easy to envision this happening.  Someone will always keep the entire blockchain.  You can pay them for verification, if you want.  There's no way to game that setup.  There's no way to monopolize such a market.  There's no artificial scarcity.  And Bitcoin can continue to grow unhindered.  That's the win-win scenario.

Lots of people print them out and keep them offline.  It isn't that hard.
Look, from your responses in this thread, you seem to have an irrational fear of "speculators".  If you don't want to trade, don't.
But in Bitcoin, trading is a useful function that helps protect the value of the coin from outside manipulation.  The real "speculators" are in central banks that are able to print money at will.  Since Bitcoin can't do that, it relies on traders to maintain a stable value.  This is an important job, but it can be very risky.  So you shouldn't trade unless you know what you're doing.  And you probably shouldn't hold a lot of Bitcoins online unless you know what you're doing.

CloudFlare is a man-in-the-middle attack, by definition.  I'm not sure whether blockchain.info uses them, but since you want to use BCi as an example, let's assume they do for a minute.

I'm curious, what kind of tickets do you generate currently and how do you check them at the door?  It should be fairly easy to generate unique tokens as QR codes or similar and scan them with just a smartphone even, but I'm not familiar with the kind of systems available.
As for Bitcoin, you need at least two things, one, a way to generate addresses and two, a way to monitor the Bitcoin network for payment.  You may also want to monitor the exchange rate as well.  I'm not aware of any packaged setup for this that doesn't use a centralized service, so you'd likely have to put it together yourself.
The most secure setup is to generate addresses offline, on a spare PC or a dedicated hardware wallet, and upload several at a time to your webserver.  It is slightly less secure to generate addresses on the fly, on the server with one of several Bitcoin libraries, Bitcoin clients, or even custom code.
The most secure way to monitor the network for payment is by running a full Bitcoin node, though this is fairly involved.  Alternately, you can run an SPV (lite) node which is still somewhat secure yet less resource intensive.  Or you can query a centralized service like blockchain.info.  Depending on how much information you leak to it, a centralized service may still be extremely private, but is subject to manipulation.
The exchange rate can be gotten from any of the major exchanges, from third-party charting sites, or even from payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay.  Or, you can manually set an exchange rate or even just set a fixed price in Bitcoin.

Encryption and hashing are similar, but not the same thing.  Encryption is reversible.  An encrypted message can be decrypted to produce the original message.  A hash of a message can be used to *verify* the original message, but not to reproduce it.
Bitcoin uses both encryption and hashing.  The blockchain contains transactions and their hashes, in order to verify the transactions.  The transactions themselves are encrypted, in order to ensure that only the holder of a Bitcoin private key can spend them.
As for e-mail, it's a bit more complicated than I said.  The protocol itself is plain text.  So it is stored in plain text on servers, and can be sent in plain text over networks.  But encryption is usually added between servers.  Sometimes it's mandatory.  Sometimes it's optional, depending on the server.  Either way, it doesn't change much.  It only means that routers cannot intercept e-mail easily.  Servers still can.
And e-mail is regularly intercepted.  You just don't hear about it, because those capable of doing so are governments and large corporations.  Last year, for instance, a Bitcoin developer who worked for Google blogged about the NSA intercepting e-mails on the Google network that were sent unencrypted between servers.

Yeah, if you look carefully at this debate, you will see a lot of people say that 20 megabytes was the *compromise* position.  Where this compromise was worked out, I couldn't tell you.  But it would not create a centralized network.
What it *would* do, is put quite a bit of pressure on casual node-maintainers and solo miners.  It could eliminate the ability to run full nodes on wireless links, on smartphones, or on single-board-computer node appliances.  It would likely make running a node the purview of relatively wealthy individuals, dedicated hobbyists, or professionals only.
Even then, if the choice is between 1MB blocks forever, and 20MB blocks forever, 20MB would still be preferable in the long run.

First of all, it's kind of funny that you're still getting downvoted in your own thread two days later.
Regardless, nobody said this definitely wasn't money laundering.  I, for one, am not likely to defend Walmart or their (overpaid, apparently) H-1B employees.  What we're telling you is that this navel-gazing isn't any kind of evidence one way or another.
But just look at that article.  It's literally an advertisement for "algorithmic data services" written by the CEO of the company that sells that service.  Did you even notice?
And the guy is recommending that exchanges adopt an *extremely* stupid practice in the cryptocurrency space -- namely to sell coins at a low price based on the *assumption* that they can be bought-back later on another exchange.  That is, not only to accept (unverifiable) information from a random Bitcoin exchange, but to trust that information with your coins.
Literally no one does that.  The people who try that, tend to lose their coins.
In fact, if this practice were widely adopted in the cryptocurrency exchange industry, it would pretty much be disastrous.  And this guy wants to force that counter-party risk onto exchanges under threat of being accused of "money laundering" with no real evidence, just so he can sell his dubious "data services".  Eh... no thanks.
His fundamental assumption is wrong, anyways.  In my experience, exchanges that "incorporate data from their competitors" would tend to have a *higher* price, not a lower one, since as mentioned already that data would need to be discounted for the fact that Bitcoins held on an exchange are not secure.  Incorporating reliable external price data just skews the price higher.

No, but I can help you to simplify this equation, because there are only a couple of variables that really matter.  First of all, you no longer have to store the blockchain with a pruning node, so disk space is becoming somewhat irrelevant.  It was already fairly irrelevant, since the blockchain is only around 50 GB and a 5 TB disk is around $150.  So the cost of storage is not high, regardless.  But for a pruning node, at least, you can pretty much ignore that variable.
The blocksize is easy.  It will be whatever we decide it should be.  8 MB blocks every ten minutes would add approximately 420 GB per year.  In order to keep up, you might need to buy a new disk every couple of years, at most.  You can calculate any other figures for blocksize you want to consider.
The real limiting factor is bandwidth.  But it's not even bandwidth, really.  It's more a matter of what kind of bandwidth you can manage to buy.  Most home internet connections in the US, for instance, are capped to less than 400 GB per month.  So, even though your connection might be capable of handling many times that amount, the data cap is the limiting factor.  You can get uncapped fiber to the home in a few places, or in a datacenter.  And in that case, the bandwidth costs are [very low](  But it's a matter of location.

BLOCKING DECENTRALIZED RETAIL USAGE IN FAVOR OF CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES -- IS THAT AN ATTEMPT TO DESTROY BITCOIN?
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:06:25


If it doesn't have a limited supply, then it's not money.  Decentralization helps it to have a limited supply.  If people can't use it, then it's not any better than gold, which has already failed to become any kind of "global standard" and failed to drag national currencies kicking and screaming towards "ideality" -- a state which they have no incentive to adopt voluntarily.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:54:38


That's not completely accurate.  It would be nice if total transaction fees per block increased, because that would mean that there are more economical uses for Bitcoin and those uses are willing to pay more fees.  But the profitability of mining is neither here nor there.  Trying to force higher transaction fees, one way or another, is anathema to the health of Bitcoin.

The most compelling argument of all is simple economics.  Bitcoin isn't actually a "payment network" *or* a "settlement network".  It's a **currency**.  The minute that it stops being a currency, an independent, accepted currency, it will fail.  Bitcoin has **zero value** outside of its actual use.
If you try to turn it into a "settlement network," and governments (predictably) phase out cash, then eventually you will have nothing at all to trade your Bitcoins for, and it will simply fade into oblivion.
If you try to turn it into a "payment network," dependent upon government-issued fiat currencies and paying taxes to central banks, it will likewise fail to become a hedge against inflation, have no protective benefit to offset its huge physical costs, and similarly fade into oblivion.
This is a false dichotomy.  There is no choice, here, regarding what Bitcoin is, and what it *has to be* if it is to continue being anything at all.

Okay, let's say first of all that I agree with most of this and wouldn't go near Tether with a ten-foot pole with anything but money I'm willing to gamble away.
But my question is this.  We've been saying for years that Wall Street will buy into Bitcoin, and that the game theory is such that even banks will eventually "defect" from the fiat system to join us.  And then we watched as the bankers circled the wagons and started calling in mortgages of Bitcoin users and closing their bank accounts.  And we spent many years having to fight and work around these actions and things like the "Bitlicense" and FinCen nonsense, while watching corrupt law enforcement officers literally robbing the Bitcoiners they were investigating for victimless crimes.
So why, exactly, would you want to go out of your way to expose the few banks that are willing to quietly buck the trend and lend to crypto traders, at this point?
I mean, maybe Tether is printing USDT out of thin air.  Or maybe some bank is printing USD out of thin air and lending it to Tether.  As far as Bitcoin is concerned, what difference does it make?

There was bitcoincard.org, which had [lofty ambitions]( but somewhat questionable technical specs.  With any device like this, you're going to have a trade-off between range, battery life and required network density in order for the thing to work reliably.  And so far it seems there are only, at most, a couple of places that *might* have high enough demand to support it.  So, that's the extent of your market basically.
I've worked in a similar field, so I admit I've dabbled in attempting to design such a system.  It's really a fairly difficult task.  Ultimately, you're competing with cell phones that have *massive* economies of scale, existing infrastructure and design resources behind them.

That's a good question, especially in light of the claims being thrown around lately about XT.  If the block size is restricted, then yes, Lightning has some properties of a separate currency.  It's not a yes or no question, though.  It's more of a spectrum of "currencyness".  The ultimate factor is, if you lock your Bitcoins into a Lightning payment provider, can you get them back without issue or cost?  And that is something of an open question.  Certainly if Bitcoin remains limited at a block size that prevents everyone on Earth from performing more than one transaction per lifetime then, yes, Lightning is a separate currency for all intents and purposes.

There are a lot of options, none of which is particularly fool-proof or easy to implement.  If you say "US dollar value," then congratulations your plan is near-impossible to implement and even if it weren't, would destroy Bitcoin as a viable independent currency.

A backlog of 20,000 stuck transactions, with users waiting 30 blocks for confirmation, is a "transaction fee market" now?  What an idiot.
These supposed "stress-tests" are doing tremendous damage to Bitcoin, at a time when it should instead be providing a reliable alternative to collapsing fiat institutions.  And it's not the first time, either.  It's obvious that this is becoming a permanent attack on Bitcoin usability.  And here it seems as though the culprits have emerged, to claim responsibility for what is, in effect, a denial of service attack on the Bitcoin network.
Keep in mind, we're talking about people who are arguing for increasing transaction fees in an environment in which miners are **already subsidized by what amounts to a $7 per transaction block reward**.  And they want that to be higher.
So, let's use this occasion to learn from history.  The new users who tried to get into Bitcoin when it melted down and became unusable on Bitcoin Black Friday didn't stick around.  They created Dogecoin instead.  What a wasted opportunity that was.
The same arguments were made then that are made today, by the same pig-headed group -- that transaction fees should rise, that actual usage as currency doesn't matter, and even that new users are a bane instead of a boon to Bitcoin.
Has that worked out?  No, of course not.  Prices have plummeted since then.  Node count has plummeted (even without any increase in block size limit, mind you).
Were their arguments even based on any kind of viable economic theory?  [No, of course not](  What they promote is simply eating the seed corn, extracting value from a fledgling Bitcoin economy and stunting Bitcoin growth through artificial scarcity the same way that any fiat banking institution would do so.
And we are supposed to believe that this is a group of hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts, [as claimed by some](  I'm not buying it.
In actuality, I've seen little evidence that these arguments, and attacks, are being proffered by a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts.  On the contrary, these people seem to be mostly proponents of multiple currencies -- Monero, other cryptos, and even fiat.  They have almost no interest in Bitcoin as a currency, only as a means of capital-control avoidance and exchange.  And they will readily tell you, if asked, that Monero is a superior means to their ends, to boot.
In short, they are speculators and money-changers, not Bitcoin users.  And odds are good they will leave for greener pastures the minute that interest wanes, and Bitcoin is left a charred husk of its former self.  They are here to "monetize" Bitcoin (in fiat terms, of course), and nothing else.
But, don't take my word for it.  Read their own arguments (they do a lot of talking).  Decide for yourself.  The only consistent theme you will find is that this group holds a lot of Bitcoins and wants the price to go up, by any means necessary.  They aren't spenders.  They aren't retailers.  They aren't miners.  They aren't entrepreneurs.  They aren't developers.  What's left?  Nothing good.  Certainly not a real Bitcoin economy.

I think you've heard me say this before, Greg.  You all continue to claim that you're arguing about "technical limits," when in reality you're arguing about political risks, about economic decisions, etc.
Gavin did an admirable job of laying out the **technical limits** months ago, complete with testing and a reasonable theory and an assertion of just what level of node decentralization Bitcoin should aim to achieve.  But, in the end, and according to Satoshi's original design, Bitcoin isn't really "technically" limited by anything other than the rate at which participants can light up dark fiber.  And the economic decisions of miners who think they can skip verifying transactions doesn't really come into play, at all.
Beyond that, I'm fine with arguing about political risks and economic decisions.  But, as I've said before, none of the "active Bitcoin developers" are experts on either of those.  So you all have a choice to make, here, as far as I'm concerned.  If you want to continue making this claim that there is some kind of "technical" limit pertinent to the blocksize debate, please lay out exactly what "technical" limitations you're referring to.  The burden of proof isn't on me.  You're the one who has made that claim.  It seems to have no theory behind it whatsoever, just some empirical observations that node count has dropped a little bit, that a few irrational miners have attempted to fork off their own completely unworkable chain by not verifying transactions, and some claims about memory usage and UTXO caching that we've discussed before and that I've still never seen sufficiently explained.  Is that it?
If, on the other hand, you'd like to move on to arguing about (what I think is the real issue) political risks and economic consequences, then remove those idiotic little stacks of books from your flair, stop pretending that the opinion of developers carries any more weight on the issue of ideal block size than anyone elses, and please try to do at least as good a job of laying out the case for limiting block sizes as Gavin has done for increasing it.

8 MB is nowhere near pushing anything as hard as possible.  [My original opinion in February]( even, was that Gavin's 20 MB proposal was too much.  I [suggested it be reduced]( *specifically* in order to leave room for improvements in fungibility and privacy.  And I have seen nothing, since then, to indicate that 8 MB would not leave plenty of room for those improvements, both in terms of network usage and CPU / other resources.  Do you have any data points or technical reasons to share that would indicate otherwise?


That would be Lightning network, and what else?
I'm sure many would dispute the claim that Lightning is "much better".  It still has a couple of downsides.


No, it doesn't.  It just presumes the ability to bypass ISPs with restrictive data caps (the major obstacle to scaling) and centralized datacenters -- potentially even a *less* centralized solution.  **That's the ultimate technical limit.**  It has nothing to do with centralization or decentralization, *which are political rather than technical concerns*.
Beyond that even, you keep repeating this claim that node decentralization is the sine qua non of Bitcoin decentralization, but it's not true either.  In fact, it isn't even the most important *component* of decentralization.  Bitcoin's **primary** mechanism of decentralization is *economic*, and has almost nothing to do with miners or nodes or any of that.


Well, I'm not sure I would say it's a "considerable" trade-off, seeing as how tens of thousands of users still have the opportunity to run nodes right now and instead choose to use things like SPV wallets instead.  But it should have been understood by everyone who uses Bitcoin, not just Satoshi, that some amount of node centralization would occur at some point, just as some amount of mining centralization has already occurred.  Even mining centralization wasn't nearly this controversial.


Don't do it for me.  There are hundreds of Bitcoin users here who ask the same questions, every day.  Most of what they get in response is hand-waving arguments about "technical" limits that wildly contradict not only Satoshi's original design, but also the scaling framework that has been on the wiki for four years.
If there are really technical limits, please lay them out in more specific terms.  If you want more time to develop Lightning, or believe that it can't work with 8 MB blocks for some reason, just say that.  If you are concerned about economic or political risks, please just concede that this isn't really a "technical" argument.

Okay, and then (as I've [alluded to before]( you say this is a market, but what is it really a market *for*?
It's not a market for block size, that's for sure.  The block size doesn't change based on any of these fees.
If it's a market for transaction inclusion, then it certainly isn't a very efficient one.  Miners are already subsidized to the tune of $7 per transaction.  There should be little or no fees required on top of that hefty sum, especially considering that mining is a relatively arbitrary, zero-sum game to begin with.  I think we all know that Satoshi's inflation schedule would end up being sub-optimal no matter what he chose, but considering that the Bitcoin mining network is several times more capable than the most powerful supercomputers in the world, incentivizing its growth further is not the direction to go.
And if it's a market for block space, then the fees are being paid to the wrong entities.  Miners don't store the blockchain.  Nodes do.  And they don't get paid any fees at all.  Is this like a carbon tax?  There's a negative externality involved somewhere, and you think you're Jacob Rothschild and that we should all pay taxes to you in order to offset it?  Should we call it a "transaction tax" instead?  Should we be paying fees to make sure the sun rises tomorrow, as well?  Who gets to collect those?
So, what is the point exactly?  Let's say you've managed to increase the transaction fee to a quarter per transaction.  What does that accomplish?  It seems that, rather than a market for an actual service, what you've created is more of a "convenience fee" that people are willing to throw at you just to get out of their way.  It's like the homeless guy down at the traffic light who jumps on your car and starts washing the windows, and you pay him a quarter just to go away;  only I think the homeless guy at least knows deep down inside that he's not actually creating a "market" for window washing by doing so.

Okay, then in that case -- Keynesianism, what Keynes actually advocated, doesn't have much of a problem.  Keynes simply said that when national economies are threatened by outside forces (such as world wars, for instance), governments should manipulate currencies in order to promote economic stability.  Basically, when your factories are getting blown up, you should probably promote some capital accumulation so that they can be re-built.  And when your population suffers a massive decline, you should promote consumption and create some artificial prosperity in order to offset that.  And this artificial consumption should be offset by future savings in order to help the economy return to a steady state once the threat has passed.
The problem only appears now that his ideas have been co-opted by privately owned central banks and their bought-and-paid-for academic spokespersons -- people who (ironically) *profit from* international conflict and who *create* wars in order to manipulate and parasitically feed off of national economies.  Keynesianism has now morphed into perma-Keynesianism, or permanent money-printing that promotes unsustainable resource consumption and unsustainable population growth, that sows the seeds of future conflicts, and whose benefits accrue only to the parasitical globalist financial classes who are protected from the effects of the monetary inflation they promote.

I'm not convinced.
The whitepaper, and the reference client, were obviously written by a real leader.  A leader doesn't say "increasing the blocksize is risky, therefore we shouldn't try."  Anyone who thinks that way would never have created Bitcoin to begin with.
Instead, a leader says "this is where we're going, this is what we're doing, it might not work and we might not make it but we're going to try."  That's what Satoshi did when he said Bitcoin would work "for several years."  That's what Gavin did when he proposed that ridiculously-high block size.  It's the reason Gavin was the leader of Bitcoin.  It's probably the reason Satoshi chose him.
Since then, Bitcoin has had a lack of leadership.  No one is willing to stick his neck out to say "this is the path forward, this is how Bitcoin defeats the banks."  It's just miners who want to be told what software to run, on the one hand, developers who want a steady pay-check, on the other, and fiat investors manipulating both sides to the long-term detriment of Bitcoin.

Every iteration of Bitcoin (so far) has included some element of centralization.  Beginning with an island, which is centralized.  Then "Satoshi's vision," which would have ended up with Bitcoin nodes all running in centralized datacenters.  And now with Blockstreamcoin, which would open Bitcoin to an element of regulatory risk and centralize access to the main chain.

So, I've thought about this a bit and there is one non-obvious issue I see.  If most transactions move to something like Lightning, it will become advantageous (necessary even, perhaps) for miners to prioritize the spending of older UTXOs over newer ones.  And the reason for this is that, in order to maximize the value of both networks, coins on the main chain should really not move more often than every few months or so, on average.  And since it is somewhat risky to put coins into Lightning, those who do so will want some assurance that they will be able to settle on the main chain even after a long period of time.  If miners also have an incentive to limit block size, which they probably will, and if the only way to limit block size is by manipulating the BDD downwards by prioritizing *newer* transactions over older ones, then these two aims are at odds.

Miners decide which transactions go into a block.  They are the ones most affected by UTXO growth.  If it is hurting their competitiveness, they can prefer transactions that limit it or require higher fees for transactions that don't.
But they haven't done that.  So obviously it's not yet an issue.  Instead, we get central planners pushing contrived economic magic numbers to solve a problem that doesn't exist, and in the process trying to take away from miners the right to order transactions, and solve the issue themselves in a *decentralized* manner.

Let's see, there's probably a simple way to explain this, but it might require some knowledge of cryptography.  I'll try, though.
The result of using a product key, like Microsoft Office, is ultimately a software program that runs on your computer, and which can be copied and used in multiple places simultaneously, since it doesn't have any link to a centralized authority.  Furthermore, it can't have any link to a centralized authority, since that would require the centralized authority to have control over your PC and for your PC to have constant internet access in order to maintain this control.
Bitcoin is the opposite.  Instead of the central authority holding the key, **you** hold the key.  The central authority (the blockchain) just contains a list of transactions that have been specifically authorized by key holders.  The network requires a vote on whether to include a transaction in the blockchain, but the transactions themselves cannot be modified by anyone but the key holders.  So, the result of signing a Bitcoin transaction is a single entry, which can either be accepted or rejected by the network.  If it is accepted, it gets placed in the "stack" of transactions and, once a few more transactions get stacked on top of it, it is basically impossible to remove without removing those transactions as well.
So, in short, a Bitcoin transaction is "crackable," technically, since it is ultimately dependent upon a central authority (the network/blockchain).  But the way this dependency is strictly designed makes it *very* difficult for the network to do anything but what the key holder wants.

You have an example of an early adopter right there telling you he's going to leave if there is no vendor adoption.  I'll say the same thing.
I understand there are those who think that international money transfer is enough to support Bitcoin.  I disagree.  I think if, eight years from now, transaction fees have risen to $5 in order to compensate for dropping block reward and low transaction volume, it will be a complete disaster for Bitcoin.
Please explain, in detail, how you think Bitcoin constitutes a "store of value" if there is no significant Bitcoin-denominated trade?  Unlike gold, there is nothing fundamentally unique about Bitcoin that puts any real limit on their supply.  I can start Bitcoin2 at any time.  That doesn't constitute a store of value.  The value is determined entirely by trade velocity and expectation of future trade.

I realize Alex Jones is difficult to follow, since he tends to rant.

Each of these statements is well-justified based on research going back decades showing that the US government (among others) has used this exact same playbook time and time again.

As far as I recall from his posts on the forum last year, KnightMB never really took any steps to hide his identity.  He was also very open about the fact that he happened to get his Bitcoins in a very lucky way.  Basically, the people he bought them from didn't really recognize their value.
His original plan seemed to be to help Bitcoin grow by spending his stash on building a mining datacenter.  It wasn't a particularly good business idea.  But he seemed like just an average IT guy who was more interested in helping the community than making money.  And I got the impression that the guilt he felt in the way he stumbled upon his Bitcoins probably played into this as well.
Unfortunately, in the Bitcoin world, having a lot of Bitcoins and being open about your identity tends to attract unwanted attention.  And an average, naive IT guy is a perfect target.  It seems like he got some.
So, at the moment, I'm filing this away as another likely example of high-profile Bitcoiners being targeted.  Perhaps even set up.

Once again, the issue with Bitcoin adoption is that we are putting the cart before the horse, almost literally.
High-level consumer service businesses should be the *last* ones to adopt Bitcoin.
The issue with Bitcoin adoption for businesses like these is not that it is "too hard," but that consumers do not already own and use them.  And consumers do not own and use them because everyone in the Bitcoin economy wants to sell high-level information services instead of simple, everyday things like groceries.

An important point, even beside the point about *physical* law, is that of **natural** law.  Governments can only regulate that which they can prohibit entirely.  Despite what the crony capitalists would like us to believe, **regulation is not the norm**.  It is a *compromise* designed to allow acts which are *inherently criminal*, and yet which have ancillary benefits.  In exchange for protection against liability, the state provides a regulatory framework within which these acts may continue, as long as the rules are followed.
Pollution and fraud and fractional reserve banking fall into this category.  Trade doesn't.  Bitcoin isn't fraudulent.  It isn't criminal.  **Bitcoin has absolutely no need for regulation**.

Probably the biggest problem affecting reliability and preventing Bitcoin scaling is that there are a lot of shitheads who like to DDoS attack public Bitcoin nodes.  And many of them are actually in the Bitcoin "community".  So here is one way to mitigate that:
Get two VPS accounts at different providers.  Put one node on each.  Setup tunnels from each of these servers to a third server with its own node at your location.  Your local node only connects to your two VPS nodes.  Disable any kind of node discovery on the local node, and try to keep the IP address from being used for any other Bitcoin activity.  You will need to disable the advertising of your (local) IP address on all of these nodes as well (which I don't recall how to do off the top of my head).
That's the basic theory.  When one of your public nodes goes down, you can easily bring up another one.  You can add more nodes on different networks or in different geographic regions, if necessary.  If your local node is on a dynamic IP address, you can cycle a new one if it has trouble.  But the idea is to prevent that.  Good luck.

You mine blocks.  Blocks contain a reward of new coins.  But they also contain all the transaction fees.

Okay, first of all, there are no "funds" involved.  You aren't sending US dollars to anyone.  You're just locking Bitcoins into an address on the blockchain that will (in theory) be returned to you when it expires, unless you sign any transactions in the mean time.  So if the other side doesn't do likewise to open the channel, that's what will happen.
Any outside communication would just be to coordinate this process. 
 But most large nodes will have an automated process to open channels.  And it will probably involve a fee, and some limits based on your expected usage patterns.
But it is literally *alpha* software, at this point.  So you aren't going to be sending 1 BTC to anyone to open a channel any time soon.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:48:51

I think I've already demonstrated that I have direct knowledge of the origins of the term 'Bitcoin' and the true ownership of any kind of Bitcoin trademark, perhaps better than Satoshi himself even.
So, if any of you really want to go to court, I've offered my assistance to any exchange that wants to list SegWit2x as Bitcoin.  This is an open source project.  Core doesn't have a monopoly on development.
Reasonable, moderate scaling of Bitcoin, just as Satoshi laid out, is not fraud.  But attempting to block its scaling, and profiting thereby, may actually qualify as conversion.  I find it incredibly unfortunate that, over the last several years, Core developers and employees of Blockstream have repeatedly refused to work with anyone else in the Bitcoin community (including miners even) to implement reasonable Bitcoin scaling -- instead resorting to histrionics, censorship and, now, legal threats in order to further their apparent agenda of limiting Bitcoin to 1mb blocks forever.

This was dumber than even I expected.
Here's a simple example of something really dumb that he said in the first ten minutes, or so.  He said that banks will start their own blockchain, because they don't want to lose 'control' of five billion dollars for an hour or however long it takes to confirm a transaction.  That's fine.  It's probably true.  But, the thing is, who cares?
Bitcoin wasn't made for banks.  Bitcoin was designed to make banks irrelevant.  Normal people can stand to be without access to their money for an hour, even if bankers cannot.  And if normal people have a trustless currency that serves their needs, why do they need banks?  But I guess that probably makes me a "twelve year old" for thinking this, in his mind.
The other really obviously stupid thing he said was that 'commerce' is somehow more efficient, and that a commercial solution will be centralized.  Again, he sounds like someone who just learned about Bitcoin and doesn't really understand it, rather than a serious journalist who wrote a book about Bitcoin.  In fact, he sounds like someone who, rather than being an expert in money laundering, doesn't even understand the existing financial system.  Commerce isn't "more efficient."  It's more fraud-ridden.  When you add in the fraud, and actually account for the externalities, it's *less* efficient, especially in comparison to the miniscule costs of trade with a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.  Yet he spends the entire interview suggesting that Bitcoin would somehow be improved by removing the trustless currency and that someone (Mark Andreessen in his mind, apparently) should sell the 'idea' of trust, the 'blockchain' minus the miners, to banks.
What the hell does that accomplish?  We all know that the banks trust each other.  They don't even need a blockchain for that.  They collude constantly, and even volunteer to bail each other out sometimes.  The issue isn't that banks don't trust each other, it's that **the public doesn't trust the banks**.  Banks running their own private blockchain doesn't change that.
But I have a sneaking suspicion that Jeff actually understands all of this perfectly well.  He did actually made a couple of valid points that seem to indicate that he understands the consequences of cryptocurrencies just fine.

No, **officially**, more US dollars are *not* being printed.  That's what it means to say that the Bitcoin inflation rate is higher than the rate of USD inflation.  You can view the official (CPI) inflation rate [here]( and compare it to the Bitcoin inflation rate [here](  Official USD inflation is less than 2.5%.  Bitcoin inflation is over twice that.

No it isn't.  If that were true, the exchange price wouldn't change.
Compared to accepting Bitcoin in person or in trade, exchanges are centralized, monitored, attacked and regulated.  If someone thinks having Bitcoin in hand is worth more than dealing with exchanges, the 'price' should absolutely reflect that.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:21:47
Most wallets have a feature to import a private key.  Since it is possible for this key to be shared among multiple wallets or users, some wallets will "sweep" all of the Bitcoins from the imported key into a newly created key.  This can be considered a security feature for inexperienced users.
But, depending on the circumstances and the particular user, it may be undesirable.  For instance, you may actually want to share that private key among multiple people for some reason.  You may want to maintain a backup of that particular private key.  If all of the Bitcoins are moved out of it, both of these uses become moot.
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:01:18


Users don't have any contract with Bitcoin miners, explicit or implied.  Nothing prevents miners from including broadcast transactions in any compatible chain.  And nothing prevents miners from ignoring a users transactions completely.

Bitcoin has gone fairly far in this direction over the past two years, or so.  Sadly, I have to admit it hasn't really worked out.  And I'm someone who would have liked more than almost anyone for it to have worked.
Robinson even mentions in this interview (one of the valid points I mentioned) that Overstock was only doing a tiny fraction of the sales they expected.  Bitpay is reportedly having troubles.  Coinbase seems to be scavenging their reputation in search of a sustainable business model.
And it's not as though actually paying with Bitcoin is slow, expensive or cludgy, as you claim.  Those payment providers are damn near free.  They let you keep as many (or as few) Bitcoins as you want.  Using them is close to instantaneous, and not really *that* much more complicated than using a credit card.
Yet there hasn't been a huge upswell of adoption, or even spending by existing Bitcoin holders.
So, no, I don't really accept your premise that people want "digital cash".  People want their privacy back, online.  They want to disintermediate banks.  And they don't want to get swatted in the process.  Beyond that, it's hard to say.  Just look at Apple Pay, which seems to have gained a large following overnight.  It's not digital cash.  It's just a wrapper around credit card transactions.  And it's backed by a company that has a credible chance of attracting merchants and standing up to the NSA.  That seems to be the criteria for success.

I'll try to dumb it down.  (This may be too dumb for some peoples liking, but oh well.)  The way Bitcoin basically works is that you have coins on the chain, and in order to move them you must sign a message saying "move these coins" and then get that message added to the chain.  Simple enough?
Now, the way Lightning basically works is you have coins on the chain that are flagged with a special variable that says "Lightning coins do not touch!".  Now you have TWO options to move them, you can *either* sign a message like before and get it added to the chain (eventually), OR you can sign a (bunch of) different message(s) saying "move these Lightning coins".  THOSE messages are handled by the Lightning network, and only have to be submitted to the main chain if things go badly.
So, to answer your original question, I think in practice the added cost to buy coins on the main chain will end up being a trade-off between how much you are willing to pay in fees and how long you are willing to wait for Lightning locks to expire.  A sort-of market for the time-value of Bitcoins will emerge and smooth everything out (eventually).

'Scaling' means the number of transactions that Bitcoin can handle in a given period of time.
A few people are against scaling because they view it as a form of inflation, but (as far as I know) they are a small minority.

Yet another brilliant analysis from a one-day-old account in @_date: 2017-05-10 19:19:43
Here's what is probably happening.  Your transactions are not being confirmed (in the blockchain) quickly.  The reason for this is twofold.
The underlying cause is that you have moved your coins recently.  And there are pricing algorithms designed to detect this, and to charge much higher fees for spending these coins, because it is indistinguishable from a "spam" attack.
But the reason it is becoming more and more obvious lately is that blocks are full.  When blocks weren't full, miners didn't care about "spam" transactions that paid low fees.
Depending on which wallet you use, it may or may not suggest appropriate fees.  And depending on which payment service is used, it may or may not require a confirmation.  These transactions are usually sorted within 24 hours.

edit:  In fact, this made me go and actually find a quote of yours (of which there are many) in which you yourself don't seem to be clear on the wording of the actual agreement you signed, versus your own re-interpretation:


I dare you to claim I took *that* out of context.  You signed an agreement that says "broad support" and then apparently decided not to actually honor that agreement unless it reached "consensus," a much higher standard.

Yet another corrupt government institution attempting to introduce volatility into Bitcoin.
OP, why would you ask *us* these questions?  You know what our answers are.  Ask the DOJ.  Good luck.  You will never get a straight answer from *them*.
They will never tell you what the words "money" or "currency" or "sell" mean.  Did you know that when the FBI offered the seized Silk Road Bitcoins, they put a specific disclaimer on their ad that it was "not an offer to sell"?  What does that mean?  Hell, I just opened my Blacks Law Dictionary and looked up the word "business."  Here's what it said:  "no definite or legal meaning."
And yet, look at this thread.  There are already idiots spreading the idea that you need a "license" for your "business".  The Supreme Court has repeatedly found that only acts that would otherwise be crimes can be licensed or taxed by government.  Everything else is just freedom.
Trading Bitcoin isn't a crime.  Money-printing is the crime that Bitcoin was built to end, since none of the sausage-pizza-loving faggots at the DOJ are likely to ever do so.
And speaking of "taxes," you might notice that the wealthy little island of Puerto Rico, where the IRS is incorporated and where everyone gets universal health care, just declared bankruptcy under a brand new law passed specifically for its benefit.
As for the US government, they only have jurisdiction over interstate commerce, at best.  Everything else is a hoax, designed to convince you to volunteer to "let them in" like the vampires they are.
The best policy is to simply ignore them.  And for gods sake don't ever recognize one of their Jew judges.  There should be a sticky on this sub by now, explaining the history of the hoax Federal Reserve, and how those people have infiltrated and paid off all levels of US government over the past hundred years.

Everyone will argue that "the size will be wrong" or "what if it's too big" or "what if it's too small" or "we should wait for the perfect magical solution" or "what if the fuzzy-headed Jewish black nobility hire assassins on the dark web and kill us all for even suggesting it."

I really don't understand why this is so difficult.  Gold was a good currency, at one time.  But it is not easily divisible.  So it can no longer be used for small purchases.  And it cannot be transmitted long distances easily.  So it cannot be used on the internet.  Digital gold solves the problems of physical gold.  It isn't just a settlement layer.  Gold is a settlement layer.  Bitcoin is a real usable currency.
The problem it solves are the problems of gold, namely transportability and divisibility.  And that is useful.  And it has nothing to do with Nash.

There is a group of people who believe that using Bitcoin for things they don't like is an "attack" on Bitcoin.  In the past, these disapproved uses have included gambling and timestamping and sending messages via transactions.  Some of these people have a long history of using underhanded means to block Bitcoin transactions of which they disapprove.
But, today, their disapproval also extends to "buying coffee" and most other retail purchases that are not either high-value international remittances or long-term investments.  These individuals have stated their preference that in the future Bitcoin only be used by individuals and businesses who are licensed and regulated by governments.  They have even expressed an intention to alter the fundamental economic properties of Bitcoin by making transactions reversible, again, likely at the behest of governments and banks.
Because Bitcoin scales very poorly (as acknowledged by Satoshi), and because Bitcoin has a temporary 1mb spam limit (put in place by Satoshi), this group has seized upon the opportunity provided by the "scaling debate" to build second layer systems on top of Bitcoin, to try to patent those systems, and even to attempt to completely replace Bitcoin with these second layer systems by keeping Bitcoin forever limited to some low block size.
In case it's not obvious, the Bitpay CEO and miners and "Chinese dudes" are not included in this category of users.  This category is primarily made up of supporters of Core, and employees of Blockstream.  And by running their software and trusting them blindly, you are in fact helping them.
Bitpay and miners and "Chinese dudes" have their own interests, of course.  And they are not always free of influence from governments and banks, either.
But since this subreddit is heavily cen$ored and filled with shills, I suggest you not take my word for it and instead research the situation yourself and determine the interests of all of the groups and individuals involved.  Be warned, though, that it is a complex situation, and easy answers are hard to come by.  Good luck.

And, on the other side, there's a developer cartel.  Which is obvious since in no other non-cartelized industry could you ever have 100 technical specialists come to the identical conclusion that SegWit is the perfect scaling solution but 2x SegWit is some kind of horrible abomination that must be resisted at all costs.  How could that possibly be, if SegWit was designed to scale?
To claim that miners are "adversarial" is completely asinine.  They haven't even attempted to sponsor their own client until just weeks ago (despite the insistence of ~~both~~ Gavin ~~and Satoshi~~ that multiple implementations are good for Bitcoin), repeatedly preferring to be told exactly which software to use by the Core developers, and not even taking the step of increasing the block size (a one-line change) themselves without Core doing it.  They haven't instituted any blacklists.  They haven't filled blocks with spam.  BitMain sells hardware to all comers.  There's not even any evidence that they are using ASICboost.  So, if it's a cartel, it's a benign cartel.  And in Bitcoin that's all that really matters.
The developer cartel, on the other hand, *is* attempting to alter fundamental properties of Bitcoin.  They openly say they want to turn Bitcoin into a limited settlement network.  They are working with banks and insurance companies.  They have forced transaction fees into the stratosphere, and forced users into alt-coins, harming Bitcoin growth and market cap.  They are trying to force all Bitcoin transactions into a second layer that is likely patented.  They have discussed making Bitcoin transactions reversible.  One of them has been caught implementing secret blacklists.  They are constantly involved in censorship and manipulation and lies.  They have been caught orchestrating psy-op campaigns in secret channels.  They sign agreements, break them, and then lie about it and complain that others make agreements without inviting them.  They have even proposed changing the proof-of-work and forking naive users off onto a chain with no hash power and thus no security behind it.  All of that, apparently, in order to avoid having to work with miners who have so far been completely reasonable and cooperative.
So, you tell us, now, which cartel should Bitcoin users really be concerned about?

I saw your comment.  You don't have to re-post it.
Your reasoning is based on a couple of assumptions that I think are clearly not valid, including a couple of glaringly contradictory assertions.  And, frankly, given the fact that you are using an obvious troll account, I am loathe to even acknowledge them.  But I will regardless.
The first is this idea that performing what is in effect an economic experiment on Bitcoin is equivalent to acting with prudence and caution.  I reject that outright.
The very idea that a group of self-appointed "experts" would propose such a path forward is extremely troubling, to say the least.
The second is that, if you truly believe in scaling beyond 1mb, as many of you repeatedly claim to, then 2mb will be required eventually anyways and is therefore not "arbitrary" -- it is a bare minimum figure for the time being on the path to eventual blockchain growth sufficient to support 2nd-layer solutions.
The entire point of asking for *you* to posit a real objection to 2 megabytes in this post is to show that many of you are not truly serious about scaling beyond 1mb, at all.  And I think that's clear from this weak response.
Regardless, given the events of the past two years, including 1) the breaking of the Hong Kong agreement, 2) the failure of the block size cap and "fee market" to bring about second-layer scaling, 3) the explosive growth of alt-coins, and 4) the failure of Bitcoin to maintain its dominant market position, I don't think simple blockchain growth even needs to be justified at this point.  Core needs to justify continuing to block it.

The question of Bitcoin as money is one of the most hilarious things to watch governments wrestle with.  Technically, it isn't money, yet.  And it may not ever become money.
*But*, if you just make a couple of simple assumptions, you see how difficult it is not to come to the opposite conclusion.

I think some of the people in this thread have already touched upon much of it.  Given the fact that


a proper hard fork would have been planned long ahead of time, and might have included one or two other useful features that have been long-expected.  It might have included small, automatic block size increases so as to avoid future hard forks, even.
Instead, core devs seem to have taken the complete opposite approach, and planned for a long string of endless soft forks with the justification of avoiding chain splits yet somehow end up causing chain splits regardless.  It's just sloppy.  It's not careful, or tested, or meticulous, or inarbitrary.  It's sloppy.
So, that's the point of this post.  Now that core is being routed around, and a *necessary* hard fork being pushed through *at the last minute*, I want to know exactly what your objection is to it.

Bitcoin use on TOR is a perfect example of a problem in search of a solution that the incompetent Core devs have completely ignored for years.  The entire concept of using a P2P network on top of TOR is idiotic, and a better option should have been coded years ago. 
 There are a half-dozen of these types of issues with trivial solutions that don't involve artificially hamstringing the entire Bitcoin network so that they can be ignored.

Economic ignorance on full display, here.  You idiots had two years to come up with a reasonable scaling solution.  You failed.  The adults are in charge, now.
Look at all of the businesses that have had to abandon Bitcoin in those two years, because of the failed leadership of Core.
I've said this over and over, again.  I'm saying it again.  You could have had 2mb blocks.  You could have had 4mb blocks, or 5mb blocks.  All you had to do was present a *reasonable* proposal acceptable to all sides.
Taking *your code* and simply scaling it as designed shouldn't suddenly make it "technically appalling."  Yet that's what Core developers want us to believe.  It's very telling.

No it isn't.  It's the ability to make transactions without intermediaries blocking them.

I'm not sure what Mike Maloney says, exactly.  But he's a gold bug.  He is used to using the term "money" in its accurate, technical sense -- to describe something with guaranteed future value.  The value of gold, the minimum value at least, is guaranteed by the laws of physics.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no guaranteed future value.  It is accepted voluntarily.  It is open source.  Unlike gold which has certain irreplaceable properties, there's nothing preventing someone from creating a copy, or multiple copies, of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.  The price of Bitcoin floats based on supply and demand and could, under the right circumstances, feasibly go all the way to zero.
So Bitcoin is not "money" in the classical sense.  And there's no reason it should be.  Regulators like to use terms like "virtual" and "money" to describe Bitcoin, solely because they want to regulate it.  But words have meanings.  And Bitcoin isn't either of those things.  It can't legally even *be* regulated.
Now, one could argue that, metaphorically, a widely-used currency is a new kind of money.  It has future value based on widespread acceptance.  And that is the theory behind Bitcoin, of course.  But that value is not guaranteed.  Widespread acceptance could end at any time.  There's no benefit in calling Bitcoin "money," when "money" in both the colloquial and legal sense has implications that don't apply, and will never apply.

Sounds like a solid argument to me.  Segwit proponents argue that *it is* a blocksize increase.  Luke-jr has argued that running a node without the witness data is useless to the network.  So, as far as potential downsides are concerned, Segwit is 4mb blocks.  We'll see what the outcome is.

Your faction had the opportunity to compromise and end up with a block size of 2 megabytes or 4 megabytes or, at most, 5 megabytes.  But because many of you insisted upon waging war with fellow Bitcoiners &amp; miners, now you have the choice of either 8 megabytes or a nonsensical and risky fork away to something with almost no hashpower at all.  In short, your option at this point is either larger blocks than you could have had, or ditching Nakamoto consensus altogether.

We've already been through this.  This was the business model of payments processors like BitPay.  And it was a very reasonable idea, say, five years ago.
Unfortunately the Core developers decided to oppose it for no apparent reason, refused to raise the block size to accommodate it, suckered major miners into agreeing to run their software exclusively, and then publicly supported (of all things) **credit cards** over Bitcoin adoption.
Now zero-conf is absolutely dead, on-chain fees are sky-high, and clueless Bitcoiners have to try to convince skeptical brick-and-mortar retailers to use either an experimental Lightning network built on a reversible Segwit-soft-fork hack or even more idiotic centralized trusted third-party services like Bakkt or Spedn.

@_date: 2017-06-27 07:54:07
Perhaps.  But there are other explanations.  Money is whatever you think someone will accept, and will hold its value, when you want to use it.
Gold mostly holds its value.  But it's been flat since Kaiser et al started pumping silver.  And silver's been flat since Bitcoin became a widely-known, and viable alternative.  So its possible that all the people who have lost faith in the dollar are going straight into Bitcoin instead of silver or gold.  Because they think it is more likely that someone will accept it when they want to use it.
Or, they're just fools.  Only time will tell.

Well, I'm not sure what this "community" is you speak of, since I've seen no evidence of it.  Can you tell us who it is?  Does it include all the sockpuppets in this censored and heavily propagandized subreddit?
Regardless, the fact is that a supermajority of miners, who ultimately control the block size, did pass that decision on to Core developers for whatever reason, probably related to the HK agreement (ie. the "suckering" I mentioned).  The developers then chose to promote a permanent 1MB limit, reversible soft-fork-Segwit and "credit cards" over more reasonable accommodation of actual Bitcoin users.
This is all a matter of historical record.  The only thing that is yet to be elucidated is the motivation for those developers' actions.

I'm not going to comment on segwit2x, quite yet.  But it has become clear, over the past year, that the "giant bitcoin redesigning campaign" is, in fact, just SegWit by itself.  You all had plenty of opportunity, for two years now, to design and propose whatever support for 2nd-layer scaling **as an option** that you desired.
And, instead, what this sub, "Core," Blockstream and the people behind them came up with was a mandatory "upgrade" to SegWit-only, complete with security degradation, unnecessary and inexplicable forks (while claiming backwards-compatibility!), weird new economic incentives, new complex code, an obviously orchestrated marketing campaign, a threatened Sybil-attack and even the likelihood of built-in government regulation and *reversing* Bitcoin transactions once implemented -- going so far as to argue that it "*is* a block size increase!!1!" when criticized.
In short, Blockstream/Core had the opportunity to carve out a very profitable business for themselves from second-layer scaling, and instead acted like incompetent, economically-illiterate fascists, then handed the Bitcoin community a shit sandwich and claimed it was a "compromise" and the "only path forward".
It's too late.  Nobody buys it any more.

Absolutely correct.  Value is proportional to velocity.  Holding Bitcoins in order to use them over and over again increases their value.  Holding Bitcoins as an investment, well, that will probably introduce some volatility.  But stable, long term hoarding is beneficial as well.
The current trend of using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, and cashing out frequently, is not a sustainable economy.  But it is an interesting way to bootstrap a real economy.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:00:03
They don't need to do this.  They've already compromised most of the "core" development team, and convinced Bitcoin businesses like blockchain.info that Bitcoins are not currency but "funds" that are transferred between "persons" through the Bitcoin "payment network," and therefore need to be tracked and taxed and regulated as a "financial" service.

This actually sounds reasonable to me.  I've pointed it out before on the forums.  Even with first-mover advantage, and with Bitcoin being the largest crypto-coin (which it likely will be), the barrier to entry is low enough and the tendency for forks high enough that it won't ever take over the world.
Not that that's such a huge problem, of course.  But at some point it will become necessary to face the geographic consequences of this.

I think, in general, you are assuming that a rising Bitcoin value induces trade.  That may be correct from a user's perspective.  But from a business' perspective, rising Bitcoin value means lower profits.  Trade requires stable prices.


The "cliff" is inducing volatility which kills trade.  It's not a very good analogy, admittedly.
As for hashing, no, hashing power is irrelevant to the number of transactions.  It is basically make-work.  The network is already quite strong.  The 51% attack is not the most effective at the moment.  Other avenues are much better.  These are not discouraged by more hashing power.  And due to the introduction of ASICs, a rising price would not really change this dynamic.
Here's a better car analogy.  We're in the middle of shifting between FPGAs and ASICs.  Now is not the time to step on the gas.

Peter, this is really what it comes down to.  Go to the forums and search for "Bencoin".  I'm not opposed to centralization, when it makes sense.  (And, be honest, what you're proposing is a form of centralization.)  I'm not really even all that opposed to limiting blocksize to some reasonable number, based on the number of nodes or network/storage costs or whatever.
But what you're proposing, at the least, is extremely premature, and, at worst, could easily end up having very detrimental effects.  Hobbling Bitcoin's use as a currency via $5 transaction fees wouldn't make it more censorship-resistant.  It would limit Bitcoin's growth and make it, politically, *much* easier to shut down.  If Bitcoin is only used by drug dealers, gamblers, speculators and money transmitters, because it doesn't make economic sense for anyone else to use it, then there's absolutely no excuse for a state not to regulate it into oblivion.  Many of them will be completely successful, if they apply themselves.
In order for Bitcoin to survive, it has to be a currency.  There has to be at least some chance that I can use it to buy a cheeseburger, at some point in the future.  Because, otherwise, it's just a ponzi scheme, or worse.  And, as a ponzi scheme, it doesn't even have a first-mover's advantage.  All the value is based on expectation of future use, *as a currency*.  If that goes away, Bitcoin will simply die and be replaced by something else.

In currency trading, whole numbers tend to be "sticky".  If the price of Bitcoin gets close to a round number (1000 CNY) it will tend to gravitate towards that value if there is active trading in that currency.
The interesting thing about Bitcoin is that, since it is a truly global currency, the price could bounce between several different round numbers.  The current value is around $165 which, under the right circumstances, could be enough to push it to the next round number in USD ($200).  Then if that happens, $200 in USD is 750 Saudi Riyal, which could potentially gravitate to 1000 Riyal.  1000 Riyal is 16326 Indian Rupees, which could get pushed to 20000 Rupees, and so on.

Here's an example to show how it's trivial to track transactions without this feature.  Let's say you have three people - a butcher, a baker, and a prostitute.  The butcher pays the prostitute.  The prostitute pays the baker.  So now the baker knows the prostitute's address.  Then, when the butcher pays the baker, he also knows the butcher's address.  The baker can look at the blockchain and see that the butcher has paid the prostitute.

Puerto Rico is in bankruptcy, because they are all a bunch of criminals, and because Bitcoin exposes their scam.  And they have received special bankruptcy protection from the US government.  This is a part of that.  Special Agent Rickards is being trotted out as a part of that effort.
And the basis of the IRS scam (which is fundamentally Catholic socialism, in nature) is that "profit" can only be the result of legitimate "work" and that "gain" from "capital," including intellectual "work," is illegitimate and must be redistributed.  That is the fundamental mechanism by which every other Catholic socialist shithole in the world has been created and maintained.  And, in America, the Internal Revenue Service is the vehicle of it.
Bitcoin turns all of that on its head.  Because it is complete nonsense.  And Bitcoiners have so far been smart enough not to go along with it (thank god).
So what old Jimbo here is doing is trying to make the case that any time the price of Bitcoin goes up, that constitutes "capital gain" and is therefore illegitimate and subject to confiscation.
As I pointed out in my other post, even if you subscribe to that (which I don't), the dollar is actually going down and gold and silver are flat ever since Bitcoin came into existence, despite amazing gains in the years before that.  The only illegitimate confiscation of wealth anywhere to be found in any of this is occurring at the Federal Reserve, via their printing press, and the IRS itself, obviously.

Bitcoins will stabilize at a high price.  The mechanism is proprietary, for now.  Steady deflation in the medium term (fossil fuels era), constant prices in the long term (post-fossil fuel era).
Volatility is not irrelevant, but less relevant because of BitPay.  Merchants and speculators hold Bitcoins.  1% fee is a king's ransom.  Legality of exchange is a problem.  Paucity of loans will only become a problem when legal restrictions/sanctions make it a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:00:14
Exactly.  The banks *are* blocking human progress, but not in the way those technocratic socialists think.  In fact, the mechanism is very easy to explain:
Every time someone invents some new technology, banks print money to buy it.  The creators of new technology benefit by selling out, but the benefit to society is redirected into the hands of banks.  If the technology cannot be used to their benefit, in increasing their control over the economy, the technology is locked away.
Bitcoin solves this.  Because there is a limited supply of Bitcoins, those who create actual, beneficial technology and sell it into the Bitcoin market are rewarded, but not subsidized.  The market determines what is and what is not beneficial new technology.  Because of this, society collectively benefits based on its own needs and preferences, not the whims of bankers.

Clearly I'm not getting through to you.
Your bank account represents a debt.  Your bank is "accountable" to you for settling this debt, in paper dollars, backed by the Federal Reserve.  Dollars in your bank account are "virtual" in the sense that they represent physical dollar bills.
TEMS is also a credit based system, in my understanding.
Bitcoins, on the other hand, represent absolutely nothing.  They don't represent debt.  They don't represent wealth that anyone is accountable for.
Like other currencies, Bitcoins can be traded for wealth.  But that's not the same as representing wealth.

Firstly, yes, it was in part because Bitcoin was the first.  There was no guarantee that it would succeed.  Similar efforts at alternative hard currency in the United States had met harsh fates and repression at the hands of the government.  Liberty Dollars, for instance, was an utter failure that ended in counterfeiting conviction.  (Eric Voorhees' father was the judge in that case.)  E-Gold ended in money laundering conviction.  The FED is a harsh competitor that thinks they have a Constitutional "monopoly" on currency in the United States.
But, secondly, it is likely that Satoshi was actually the CIA, and they wanted to pin the creation of Bitcoin on someone else, for various reasons.

There are two types of software in Bitcoin, clients and miners.  Each has several versions from which to choose.  And they all work together using the same protocol.  Miner software is mostly controlled by large mining pools.  Clients are basically controlled by their developers.  The most influential are the developers of the QT or original "Satoshi" client.  But ultimately the users and miners decide which software to use.

Pretty good, actually.  I'd maybe change it a bit, to say Bitcoin is using your CPU to mine bitcoins out of the luminiferous aether, converting electricity into bits of matter stored on your hard drive.  And that E=mc^2 is the "Bitcoin algorithm" that enables this.  This is all, of course, based on occult knowledge that has been hidden from the public for decades.  Tesla also independently discovered it, and wanted to distribute free electricity to everyone in order to run their own Bitcoin miners.  But the bankers found out, and his plan was thwarted.
The creation of Bitcoins out of thin air is based on the same magic that is used to make dollars, through a secret ritual performed by high priests at the Federal Reserve temple (depicted [here](  That's the reason US dollars have the little Illuminati pyramid with the eyeball on them, because they also come from the Illuminiferous aether.  Putting 9/11 on the USD was a message from the trans-dimensional demons to warn us to stop printing so much money.  But, now, the secret to Bitcoin creation has been discovered by programmers, and "open sourced" to the general public.  In order to prevent any more terror attacks, Bitcoin creation is limited by Gregory Maxwell's daemon.

I agree there is far too much of this.  I do it myself.  And 99% of the time, I couldn't care less about which terms I use to describe Bitcoin.
But these tips do all have a context.  If you find yourself in court, defending against a sting for selling Bitcoins to an undercover officer, you probably don't want to describe Bitcoin as "money" or as an "investment".  You might not even want to use the word "selling".
Similarly, if you're on national television, describing Bitcoin to a bunch of potential adopters, I think it's reasonable advice not to describe Bitcoin as "virtual" but "digital" instead.
Bitcoin users tend to know that the difference between "virtual" and "digital" is almost completely irrelevant, and that Bitcoins are not "virtual" tokens used in a pretend world under the control of a centralized corporation.
They also tend to know that Bitcoins are a risky investment and, unlike "money", do not represent guaranteed future value.
So if one Bitcoin user describes Bitcoin as "virtual money" to another, the meaning is clear.
But there is a context for everything.  Words do have meanings.  And, while Bitcoin users (who know the purpose of Bitcoin) might not care about the distinction between "virtual" or "digital" or between "money" and "currency", others tend to view these terms with more specific connotation.  So it's better to avoid confusion whenever possible.

@_date: 2013-02-20 05:55:29
Businesses selling BTC is driven by volatility.  A rising price **adds** to volatility, because it increases the risk that the price will fall.  Businesses don't want to play the currency markets.  They want stability.
Here's a thought experiment.  Assume that you are a pure Bitcoin business (which is what we want to encourage in order to grow the Bitcoin economy).  You hold Bitcoins as well as capital to make widgets.  In order to invest in growing your business, you have to sell Bitcoins and purchase capital.  If the Bitcoin price is rising, you lose out on the opportunity of holding those Bitcoins by investing in the real economy.  You sell Bitcoins in exchange for a small amount of capital, use that capital to produce goods and services, and then receive fewer Bitcoins in exchange.  That cost comes out of your profits.  So a rising Bitcoin price encourages user adoption, but *disincentivizes* business adoption.
Instead of joining and growing the Bitcoin economy, what we get instead is existing businesses **removing capital** from the Bitcoin economy by using Bitcoin as a Paypal alternative and selling Bitcoins as soon as they are received.  As soon as this capital source dries up, as soon as the hoarding stops and the dumping begins, these businesses will stop accepting Bitcoin.  They will be better off; the Bitcoin economy will be worse off.
Bitcoin isn't a national currency.  We can't just go around forcing businesses to join and to accept it.  You can't apply the same assumptions to Bitcoin that you apply to them.

Maybe create an internal virtual credit facility in order to manage the amount of Bitcoin liabilities that can be accumulated in any one area, or by any one customer.

Eventually, cold hard reality will set in, the value of Bitcoin will stop rising, Bitcoin will stop acting as a money, and perhaps the value will even fall.  Those who said "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme" will claim to have been vindicated.  And when that happens, it will be a roll of the dice as to how many people begin to believe that Bitcoin is actually a currency, and decide to use it as such, and how many decide to believe that it was actually a ponzi scheme all along.
At the very least, there will be at least one more humongous "Bitcoin is money" bubble.  It's just that Bitcoins could be worth $100,000 each by the time it pops.

There are a couple of reasons why it doesn't make good sense to me.
The article makes the argument that the entire cycle is driven by hoarding.  That's wrong.  The cycle is driven by the interaction between users and businesses, by trade.  Hoarding that is not supported by trade, and which cannot be sustained otherwise, will turn into dumping.
What the article is advocating is the equivalent of trying to push-start the cycle, via hoarding, in the hopes that this will spur business and user adoption.  But there are risks in this.  While sustained hoarding can encourage user and business adoption, and indeed push-start the cycle, hoarding and dumping (volatility) will completely kill it.
It's like trying to push-start a car, without pushing it off a cliff.
Also, security of the network is not directly proportional to hashing power or mining profitability at the moment, both of which are already quite high and unlikely to be substantially affected by much higher prices.

That might be true when analyzing debt-based currency.  "Demand" for debt fluctuates based on interest.  And the interest rate is manipulated by central banks.  So there is an artificial forcing of the currency's value against goods and services.  With Bitcoin, the value is determined by the market, voluntarily.  There is no "demand" fluctuation that isn't based on rational market participation, and which will not be damped out by the market.

True "value" is a shared construct, derived from universal physical laws.  Just because one person values a thing, doesn't mean that everyone does.  But when many people collectively value something, odds are that it has true value.  This is even more true when many people collectively value that thing over a long period of time, over many generations.
The difference between fiat, and Bitcoin, is that one small group, a government, declares that fiat has value, and attempts to force this view on others.  While, with Bitcoin, value is collectively determined by the market.  Historically, fiat currencies always collapse.  The value always goes to zero, usually after only a few generations.
So, with Bitcoin, we will have to wait and see whether it has true, lasting value.  But it is already on a more firm footing than government-backed fiat currencies, which are pretty much guaranteed to fail.

[Mappers vs Packers. Why Most People Don't Get Bitcoin](
For complex subjects like Bitcoin, most people tend to fall back on a cognitive process known as "packing."  Most people are "packers" anyways.  But even "mappers" will use it also.  It's basically fuzzy-logic, or pattern matching.  They are trying to put Bitcoin into the right mental 'box', ie. "good or bad," and to do so they consider contextual clues such as what it looks like and who uses it.  From a cursory glance, Bitcoin looks like a ponzi scheme and is used by a lot of scammers, therefore it's a scam to be avoided.  For a surprisingly large percentage of the population who are basically incapable of logical thought, and who tend to get by by following the herd, that's as much consideration as they will likely give it.

Several things.  Holders making a conscious effort to support Bitcoin businesses.  A few communities with lots of Bitcoin businesses in the same area.  Large online retailers accepting Bitcoin.  More friction at the exchanges limiting the inflow of fiat.
Basically, once a single large holder can decide to live in a community in which most businesses accept Bitcoin, spending Bitcoins exclusively, and ordering things online only from businesses that accept Bitcoin, and he/she chooses to do so and makes a very public announcement to this effect, the growth in intrinsic value would come very quickly.  Because it's a model that can be replicated almost anywhere.
It's coming.  Don't worry.

The lessening influence of fiat currencies, which is a side-effect of Bitcoin's growth.  It may take a while, though.
There are two forces at play here.  One is the growth of the real Bitcoin economy.  In a vacuum, this tends to stabilize Bitcoin's value over time.  Hopefully the reason for this is obvious, so I won't go into it.
But the other force is the external influence of fiat currencies.  Since the Bitcoin economy doesn't exist in a vacuum, we need to account for this also.  Fiat currencies are generally only manipulated in one direction:  down.  This causes the value of everything those currencies can be used to buy, to rise.  So fiat currencies have a destabilizing effect on the value of Bitcoin, which would reach a stable equilibrium based on the real Bitcoin economy otherwise.  As Bitcoin becomes more closely connected to fiat economies, however, its value rises due to the force of money printing.
Sometimes though, as we have seen a couple of times, Bitcoin can become disconnected from the fiat economy.  When a choke point like an exchange goes down, for whatever reason, the value of Bitcoin is no longer influenced by fiat currency.  The value falls as a result.  Because the Bitcoin economy is small in comparison to the demand introduced by fiat inflation, disruptions to exchange introduce a lot of volatility into Bitcoin.
Unfortunately, until the Bitcoin economy has grown to a much larger size than it is now, and until Bitcoin can be directly used to purchase all kinds of goods and services without exchanging, it will not be able to absorb fluctuations introduced by fiat currencies.
It's difficult to determine at exactly what point that will change.  Some argue that the fluctuations we have seen already have been the result of relatively random market forces.  If that is the case, then the prospects of Bitcoin stabilizing any time soon are bleak.  There will need to be a much larger real economy to absorb external fluctuations.
But there is evidence to indicate this is not the case, that Bitcoin crashes are far from random.  Every single one has been preceded by a media-induced frenzy.  Many run-ups were halted by explicit regulatory intervention.  The latest was bordering on a deliberate pump-and-dump, topped off with coordinated warnings by central banks.  Evidence of manipulation grows with each Bitcoin crash.
When the kid gloves finally come off, and central banks really start viewing Bitcoin as an existential threat, volatility will be induced in Bitcoin openly, deliberately.  It will be even worse than the subtle fixing that has occurred in precious metals markets.  And it will be more obvious.  Coordinated attacks, massive buys, unexpected sell-offs, and a barrage of media coverage (both favorable and unfavorable) will occur simultaneously.  It will be impossible not to get the message of what is going on.
But it is in the interests of fiat bankers to avoid openly attacking Bitcoin as long as possible.  They will try to subvert Bitcoin subtly, to make it seem as though instability is somehow inherent to Bitcoin, rather than induced by outside forces.

One of Schiff's arguments is that a gold-backed electronic currency is better than Bitcoin, because at least there is a chance that it would be backed by something.  And something is *obviously* better than nothing.
So, since Peter is good at communicating in terms of folksy analogies, maybe he can be convinced by this one.  Here's an argument that could be made in response:
No, Peter, something is not always better than nothing.
Consider the same example, except using rifles instead of gold.  Let's hypothesize a currency backed by rifles.  Everyone gives their rifles to a bank, which issues electronic currency in exchange: Riflecoins.
Obviously, according to Peter, Riflecoin (backed by rifles) is better than Bitcoin (backed by nothing).  At any time, anyone can exchange their Riflecoins for rifles.  Bitcoins can't be exchanged for anything, except what the market decides they are worth.  So Riflecoins are more valuable, right?
Wrong.  Peter is ignoring counter-party risk.
Because what inevitably happens with Riflecoins, even more obviously than with similar gold-backed currencies, is that the Riflecoin bank loans all of its rifles to a warlord, who uses them to kill your family.
This is pretty much the history of bank-issued currencies.  We gave our gold to banks.  They used our gold against us.  If we had given them rifles, they would have done the exact same thing.  It just would have been more obvious.
Since history has proven over and over again that we can't trust banks, now we don't have to.  We can use Bitcoin.  If we want gold, we can keep it ourselves.  Unlike gold, we can use Bitcoin as a real currency, with no counter-party risk, and without anyone using our assets to bet against us by means of criminal, economy-destroying derivative weapons of mass financial destruction.

Money is guaranteed future value.  This has historically been provided via noble metals, like gold and silver, which don't corrode over time.  An ounce of gold today is the same as an ounce of gold 100 years from now.  Use of a single, stable money enables the determination of the time value of a community's money, and thus the real interest rate of the community's entire economy.  Fluctuations in this rate provide a valuable "warning" as to the state of an economy at any given time.
One real life example of this is the debasement of the silver content of the denarius, which provided advance warning of the collapse of the Roman empire.
The US economy is in the state it is, one of uncertainty, in which conditions can change at any time without warning, precisely because there is no stable money.  The money is artificially manipulated.  It has no guaranteed future value.  Because of this, the determination of future value has been mostly outsourced to the derivatives market, which is riddled with fraud.  Due to chaotic effects in this inherently flawed market, the perceived state of the economy can change at any time.  There is no warning.  Therefore there is no real money.

Nothing really enforces it.  And it's implemented at a level that makes it fairly simple to overrride, if you want.  But there is one reason not to.  In the future the blockchain will need to be "trimmed" in order to prevent having to store so much information on every client.  Addresses that create multiple "forks" in the path of dependencies will have to be kept around longer than those that don't.

Actually he has a point.  The IRS is not a government agency.  It's a foreign corporation, a subsidiary of the private Federal Reserve.  All of their enforcement is via a "voluntary" extortion network of businesses that are completely dependent on Federal Reserve money-printing for their continued existence.
They aren't restricted by the burden of proof, or any other legal formalities.  They are a crime syndicate.
That's why he's right when he says that the IRS will cause problems for Bitcoin users.  But it's also why he's wrong when he believes that large companies will ever voluntarily embrace Bitcoin.  Large companies aren't victims of the extortion syndicate;  they are beneficiaries.
