Ahh, so you are talking about the verification process. I understand. It took me about 1 month to get verified to the point that my weekly deposits could go over 2500, but I can see how it could be shorter or longer depending on your luck.
I still don't understand why OP would do 40,000 all in one lump sum. I would do 10,000 dollar deposits and just report the income to the IRS when I sold, again in 10,000 dollar deposits.

I am verified on coinbase and my my maximum weekly deposit is 10,000. What do you mean it is not true?

I have more than 40k invested in crypto... I am not talking about the amount. I am talking about the 10,000-20,000 weekly limit on your ability to deposit fiat into coinbase.

I don’t even understand how the op made a 40k wire. It takes months just to get verified for 10k wire...

How’s you do 40,000 all in 1 lump sum? It took me months to get verified for even 10,000 dollar wires....

I am still trying to figure out how the fuck OP made a 40,000 deposit. You have to be verified, which takes weeks/months, and even then you can only do 10,000! I think it was 20,000 a few months, which they shortened to 10,000, but that still doesn't answer the question of how OP made that large of a wire!
Someone clue in here. I am either wrong, which I must be, or I in the presence of morons to my left and right.

Some people can articulate their thoughts eloquently. I can reasonably assure you that that reply took at least an hour and a half. It would have taken me 3-4 hours to write something like.

Whoa what? I have double authentication with my Coinbase account. What could possibly be more secure or different from that? Beyond not being generally stupid with your downloads and email attachments?

Normally, I don’t “day trade” crypto currency, but something sticks out so hard from this. I go by my feelings and this feels like 3 months where it 5000 and then went back down to 3500. Honestly, I don’t know why you would hope I am wrong. You will gain money regardless if you hold on to it. I am the one who cashed out on 10s of thousands based on a gamble.

I agree that you cannot kill the Bitcoin protocol, but if the next day you could no longer exchange bitcoin for the U.S. dollar, well... working around that is an absolute pain and certainly a growth killer for future investors. We can pride ourselves for taking part in something that is decentralized and unique, but I can't buy food with bitcoin. I can't pay my bills with bitcoin. If I cannot exchange my crypto then I have a bunch of useless bits on a network.
If you cannot beat an adversaries army, cut off their supply chains and watch them dry up and shrivel.

That is good then. I feel a lot better :)

Uh... well it is just an after thought, but in a world where Goods, Services, and Energy are plentiful, the incentive for a Capitalism based society may become almost entirely non existent.  To create such a demand and incentive, mining Crypto Currency may become a never ending activity that takes place in every American house hold. The economy would shift and demand would be created based upon computing power.
It's a complicated idea that I just had last second while making this post. Not to sure how to elaborate upon it. It is a little bit over my head honestly.
