You can try the Bitcoin Argentina facebook group, in case you have facebook. It's a pretty active community, I'm sure you'll have more luck there.

That's a great idea, yet it's the same concept as dollars.
But if you can bring BTC to this country, for god's sake DO.

Damn, guess I'm late for gold.

How is the government getting fucked over if in order to get BTC USDs are needed anyway?

Hey, what business are you running?
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:31:58
You're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:02:57
Facts! I want to believe you.

It's only for national credit cards, don't worry!

I'm quite new on all this Bitcoin business, have bought some and I'm ready to start and keep it rolling. Let's hope it's main currency in the future! 
Grats on your success, several business are starting to accept btc here, we can only wait :)

I love you Monstercat!!

Totally agree, my first encounter left me quite surprised as to why it required to download like 5 gigs of data!

A thousand time yes! I've also been spending my bits on few items here and there :) The only thing that prevents from getting EVERYTHING is the price of international shipping. Else? Oh man I'd be bankrupt.
