I applied for registration to hold the trademark to prevent any jackass from registering and suing, just as you've stated above.  Today I reached out to the foundation folks to get dialog on this, I'd be happy to transfer ownership there (assuming this ever went through) if this is where the trademark is best protected.
There is no intent of ever bringing suit on anyone for any reason, just want the trademark protected from those who might use it against the open community. - Mike

My intention is to take this trademark off the table to keep it free and open, I didn't like the fact that it was sitting out there trademarkable and I read the stories of the last guy (lawyer) who had the trademark.
  
I don't claim first use or anything like that.  If the trademark goes through (which it likey won't), it should be very clear to everyone that this cannot and will not be used to bring claim against anyone for any reason.
I completely agree this Trademark should be held by someone or some foundation that can defend it for the community.

This trademark should be kept free and open to use.  I was/am doing some bitcoin work, wondered if anyone would keep me from using the term "bitcoin" in my product and saw the trademark was not protected, so I filed for registration.  It would be great if we could get this registered under a/the foundation to keep it off the table and free and open for the community to use in the future.  - Mike
