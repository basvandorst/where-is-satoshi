most of the investment banks are investing in crypto lol pretty much all decent hedge funds are into crypto aswell.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:32:38
yes, thats right

Instead of tapping your debit card on the screen of the payment device, you’ll scan a QR that shows up
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:38:45
It is. Because it goes against everything that makes him rich
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:51:21
I Can't really talk shit about anyone who has the ability to sell $17m worth of bitcoin. CLEARLY doing something right!
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:41:29
HAHAHHAHA good one
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:50:43
But then if they could mine it. The value of gold would go down and it would be worth not much
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:17:06
but you're forgetting that he was in a position to pay $30m for bitcoin at some point. Bette state in life than me to be fair
@_date: 2019-11-20 09:29:22
Who knows hey?
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:46:26
Well, not really. If you’re measuring it in fiat terms, and fiat is useless then relatively speaking you will not be wealthy. You will only be wealthy if you hold substantially more bitcoins than most other people. Which statistically speaking most people don’t.
Also wealth is largely having your assets generate a passive cash flow allowing you to maintain your current standard of living.
Let me know when your bitcoin wallet starts paying you a rental income without deduction the principal
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:43:52
Let me know which hookers and crack dealers take $17,000,000 of bitcoin in one go
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:41:01
Hahaha isn’t what they said in 2017
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:41:20
Don’t talk about fiat as an antiquated system unless you are able to 100% do everything with crypto
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:40:06
perhaps thats why they had to withdraw the $17m. Bills dont wait for your convenience
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:49:00
what if that 17m was just a portion of their holding
@_date: 2019-11-29 09:37:30
You don’t know shit about where bitcoin is going to go.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:39:36
Not really. Cash is still pretty much king.
Buy a car with btc or a house. or get finance based on your crypto equity.
@_date: 2019-11-09 09:53:30
People shit on these billionaires when they don’t get into crypto. Even if they never touched crypto in they life, they have still accumulated wealth at a amazingly rapid pace that mere mortals can not. And that’s fucking impressive
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:44:36
I mentioned that In another comment. That's what seems likely, and also, if that's the case - is a really clear indication of doing something right
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:29:15
I mean at the very least, he's got $17m in cash - that's not a bad outcome at all. being $17m liquid is a very great place to be in. a proportion of that has the potential to be LIFE changing for so many people. We also need to keep in mind, there are OTHER investments outside of bitcoin.  
I may disagree with this statement in years to come: I'd certainly be very happy to hold $17m worth of blue chip property. Good capital growth, 2-3% rental yield - that's a great fucking life.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:38:53
Not really.
Debt is everything. That’s ok
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:46:13
The subreddit is becoming a bit of a meme
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:58:47
As much as I love bitcoin, My financial mind would certainly not sleep easy at night if I gambled HALF on bitcoin. Fuck me man, maybe 10% would have been good - if you put half of it into property in high growth areas and maybe good cashflow areas, not only will you likely end up being worth 10x as much in 10+ years, but you can also live off the rent.
bitcoins are great, but they don't generate any cash flow :S
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:45:33
Bitcoin is not an asset. It’s a tool.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:26:42
If you've got a very very very veyr very large holding, and you need to sell off $17m to pay the bills and keep the money making machine operating, then that's just a cost of business - so in essence it makes a very large difference, the magnitude of difference is proportional to the size of this sell of in relation to the size of the overall holding.  
If the $17m is the majority of the holding, then perhaps things are not going so well. If the $17m is only, say 10% of the holdings, then things are going quite well.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:40:59
Haha good one
@_date: 2019-08-25 10:36:44
they said that about computers once.

I think land has intrinsic value
Turns out humans live on land
@_date: 2019-10-03 11:23:58
That’s it my boy!
Cash is just a means to cash out the equity and pay some bills. You need physical wealth.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:39:35
I honestly hope so. I’d load up

Get a loan to a trust, that you are a beneficiary of.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:31:28
Probably not mate.
Considering we are all sitting here basing bitcoins value in fiat terms
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:12:39
You’re god damn right. Just like any appreciating asset that is intrinsically valued and very scarce. Just buy and hold.
Same like blue chip property - buy it and never sell it.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:48:25
this is true.
but also not true.
cash and fiat is fucking worthless and the majority of wealth is not based on cash riches. I think true wealth is in the tangible assets and controlling things of intrinsic value. Think of property, or even just the land, businesses and industries. the Fiat is the least important part of this deal, of course it's printed willy-nilly - it's useless! it's merely the bits of paper that can facillitate the unimportant day to day things
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:44:21
Everyone here is an expert saying cash out its gonna drop to the floor asap, that is until, it picks up again and they all change their tune 'yep i sure saw that coming'
yer right pal, it's going all over the place and no one predicts it

Libra is the exact opposite to everything crypto currency stands for.

The trick is to not need a pay check
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:26:28
Not really bro. It was the banks idea to phase out cold hard cash, they want your fiat locked in with their accounts. This quote by Elon musk speaks more about the digitalisation of fiat, rather than being a siren song for the decentralised nature of crypto
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:27:07
ah fkn relax dork. It's a really useful store of value, and a really useful means of transferring value.  
It isn't the return of christ almighty, and i'm pretty sure when the economy collapses we're all fucked anyway
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:28:26
How is bitcoin going to make you financially free?  
with fiat, the whales hold the majority of the cash, and you have the crumbs.  
with bitcoin, you might have invested well now, but the truth is, the whales still hold most of the coins.  
You'll  need a job still
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:46:05
Yeah same.
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:22:26
Not true bro. I eat nestle all the time and I’m straight as a runway. Never had bitch tits either.

Diamonds?  None
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:26:00
this has just become a massive HODL circlejerk akin to beanie babies.  
wait, before you get triggered:  
What inherent value will bitcoin have if it is not utilized, and instead held like a speculative investment? Bitcoins inherent value has always been it's utility!  
Just use the bitcoins
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:20:39
Right, one of the largest banking industries in the world should adopt crypto. That’s totally what HK is all about
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:24:38
True. 
Perhaps then the demand for that will lead to price rise
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:19:04
It’s dumping when it drops at little , and then it’s moon time a day later when it’s up a few
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:02:49
I don’t know. I feel like bitcoin is at that peak fomo madness again. Everyone’s talking about it.
Be fearful when everyone’s greedy
@_date: 2019-12-12 11:34:28
What is bitcoins inherent value?
Sure, there’s only 21 million of them, so there is a scarcity.
But what’s bitcoin got that any other crypto doesn’t have?
It’s got a recognisable brand - That’s it.
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:23:15
don't fucking HODL. this isn't some sort of index fund scheme were we all get rich holding a thing and never utilising it.  
That's not what bitcoin is for. just fucking USE it
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:29:10
HAHAH i know right. people act like they just inherited an asset that's going to be worth 1b
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:14:50
you can apply tax losses in other years, no?
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:45:46
I’ve got an economics degree too! But being into economics doesn’t mean you’re good with money.
@_date: 2019-12-14 09:13:03
Economists aren’t good with money

Maybe so,
But this guy is an absolute kook
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:03:38
of course cards and credit cards aren't part of this.
people arent going to be forced to take a mortgage for a 85 inch 4k tv.
the loss of cash use is a loss to persoanl freedom
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:07:04
I've stopped caring about its price.
it could drop it could rise.
as long as it just IS
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:41:38
Investing is great and all.
But I like nice things
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:57:01
You should diversify. Have multiple investments, multiple sources of capital growth, multiple sources of income.
Betting all on one is a very unlikely path to true financial freedom
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:54:39
the more it drops. the harder my cock

Couldn’t you have just brought btc with it ?
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:38:08
Yeah good call man!
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:42:43
This is bitcoins intrinsic value that people in western countries who doubt btc will not understand.
You are free with bitcoins to use it and posses it as you wish regardless of the status of your government. You’re no different to anyone. Your btc is as a good as anyone’s. 
Money is not like that anymore
