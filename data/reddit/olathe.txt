You mentioned precompiled stuff being unsafe in this instance in distinction to open source. What is the main difference between the two? Also, where is the precompiled stuff that you were sure was the genesis of the problem here again, clown?
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:13:47


You're a clown.
That stuff in the post above is **source code**. Source code that's open source. Source code that hasn't been precompiled.
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:24:50
So in a thread about a specific instance, you were making a general statement that didn't apply (there was no precompiled software, and open source didn't save anyone), and I'm the one who's at fault for misinterpreting?
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:18:32
I don't, but open source tends to allow for these things called 'forks'. You were wrong about open source necessarily being safe and about it being precompiled and unwilling to admit it, you clown.
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:41:20
Your argument here is also inapplicable.
You're saying that official sources rather than open source are what provide the protection. So your argument doesn't even pertain to open source.
You're also saying something that would apply to closed source products. People can maliciously edit those as well. So your argument again doesn't pertain to open source. It pertains solely to official sources.
@_date: 2016-04-09 23:21:24
I'm not saying that that's your position. I'm saying that your argument only supports official sources being the way to security. This is because the argument can also apply to a Toyota with a messed up engine or to closed-source software.

Your defensive obfuscation isn't going to work.
You said "the open source version works fine". It turns out that the open source version in question doesn't work fine, thus your statement doesn't apply to this situation.
You said "Anybody with a brain doesn't download precompiled software from unreputable sources for something like this." That's also inapplicable, since it doesn't describe the situation. There was no precompiled software involved.
You also said "You're a clown..." This is also inapplicable, since neither warning people of a valid threat nor pointing out that open source, *which allows for forks just like this*, can allow for insecure forks are something clownish.

Just like you're free to waive your right against self incrimination by confessing or to waive your right to plead innocent by pleading guilty, you're also free to waive your right to effective counsel, particularly since the judge will make sure that you know the potential downsides before allowing it.

It's the majority of the first paragraph:


The idea is that banking economies work far better, so the bitcoin currency is worth very little to the vast majority of everyone if banking is precluded in bitcoin.
You didn't respond to that. Instead you said that it wasn't the point in bitcoin to enable what the person had said was needed for the currency to be used in any widespread manner.
A response would be something like "Yes, currencies need that to be used widely, but..." or "No, currencies don't need that to be used widely because..." or something else that's responsive.

That's an illogical response. This is like someone saying that people need to breathe in order to live and someone responding that history is littered with people who died who also breathed. That's a very unconvincing argument. You need to show that currencies can succeed widely without banking, not that currencies with banking sometimes fail.


I didn't say that. I said that you hadn't responded to the person who said that.


That's an illogical response. If currencies require banking to do well, they require it regardless of what you're proposing. You need to show that currencies have succeeded widely without banking.


That's an illogical response, since the idea was that very few people will accept a currency that doesn't have banking. That it has other features is irrelevant, since the feature that nearly all people want isn't there.
It's a bit like saying your computer may not be able to add numbers, but it sure can use energy efficiently. People want computers that can add numbers. You need to show that people will widely use currencies without banking.


That's an illogical response. It's like saying your roadkill sandwich has the extra value of cheese on top. If people don't want roadkill sandwiches, the extra value is irrelevant. You need to show that currencies have been widely desirable without banking.

There's quite a difference between being forced to physically do certain things and being forced to think certain things. I'm talking, as you were before this latest comment, about what Roger thinks about the actual guilt of Ross Ulbricht regarding hiring out some murders, not about what Roger physically does.
I hope you're not suggesting that the government somehow warps Roger's mind into only accepting someone's guilty of something if they've been convicted of it.


I mean that when you said "All can go in is the crime for which he was convicted", you were claiming that Roger limits his accusations or speculations to what people have been convicted of.
He obviously doesn't limit himself to what people have been convicted of, since he accuses people of being slave owners before they've been convicted of it.

Huh? While I can understand that the fees might be competitive for specifically buying bitcoins, this isn't a good argument.
I haven't paid ATM fees in several years. The reason why is because banks tend to not charge customers when they use that bank's ATMs. It's a no-brainer to choose a bank that has lots of convenient ATMs where you're likely to use them.

The 1970s aren't that relevant. You were talking about the Internet as in the major TCP/IP network. Otherwise, why mention 1982? You might as well emphasize your point by using the 1970s as the start of the Internet.
In fact, ARPANET led into the Internet but wasn't the Internet. The fact that TCP/IP is called the Internet protocol suite while ARPANET is called ARPANET and not the Internet is a major indicator, but here's Wikipedia:


And also:


Even ignoring that, my point was that the limiting factor wasn't the availability of killer apps but the availability of the Internet itself. That point still obviously stands regarding the 1970s, which didn't provide general public access to ARPANET.
Instant messaging was definitely available early on, since sending simple messages to other people is stupid simple to implement. It's even easier than e-mail. From Wikipedia:


As you might gather, 1983 is quite soon after 1982! Also according to Wikipedia:


The 1960s is *very early* in multiuser interactive systems. The obviousness of instant messaging leads to it appearing very quickly.
I see that you're correct about CompuServe beating AOL in 1989 by connecting their preexisting e-mail service to the Internet. It should be noted, though, that use of e-mail among CompuServe users was already popular with them. When the Internet was accessible, the desire to use e-mail was *already there*.

You can tell the Liberty Dollar's creator was enthusiastic about letting people know about the Fed and the IRS in the following interactions.

* **Cashier:** We don't take this. What is this?
* **Bernard:** It's the new ten dollar silver piece.
* **Cashier:** [something] see what this is.
* **Bernard:** Just like that.
You can tell the minimum wage cashier was totally enthusiastic about the potential of private currencies, what with that explanation. You can totally see the lack of concern in her voice about possibly losing her job later that day when her drawer is counted. A new, unafraid advocate against statist tyranny is born! Go Bernard!
* **Bernard:** Now, I have the paper money, but I have a new silver ten dollar piece.
* **Vendor:** Oh, really?
* **Bernard:** Yeah.
* **Vendor:** Ooh, it's good.
* **Bernard:** Cool! What do you think? Looking pretty good!
* **Vendor:** OK. I...

* **Bernard:** OK, thank you very much.
* **Vendor:** Thank you so much.
* **Bernard:** You're welcome.
* **Vendor:** You have a nice day.

It's rather hard to confuse bitcoins on a computer with US dollars. On the other hand, advocates of the Liberty Dollar, including von Nothaus himself, relied on common assumptions in order to fraudulently pass their money off to people who didn't actually want it.
There's a piece [detailing how to commit fraud with Liberty Dollars]( I was around back then. It's not a parody; it was meant seriously. "Please don't attempt to educate people about money **when using** Liberty Dollars. ... [Y]ou should simply offer The Liberty Dollar with the confidence that it will be accepted". Yeah, I wonder how confidence men got that name.
"A Liberty Dollar is currently set at 1/50 ounce of .999 fine silver in order that the face value coincides with an already publicly accepted and recognizable currency denomination." Uh huh. 'Coincides' is quite a way to put it when it was by design.

Here's what kwame_kilpatrick actually said:


A proportion doesn't say anything at all about the total amount.


You don't appear to know the history of computing. Computing technology has never, *ever* stopped and had nice calm breaks like that. Since bitcoin now has specialized mining hardware, guess what!
People have already bought out the first batches of the new, much more improved ASICs, like Butterfly Labs' Monarchs. Those and others will make investments in the first generation practically worthless fairly soon, since the hash rates are about 15 times higher for equal power, which won't inspire people to spend the bitcoins they earned on the next generation.


This doesn't examine the history of huge computing hardware installations (*particularly* specialized hardware installations), which are owned almost solely by huge companies and governments.
In the CPU era, anyone could join in and do well. The GPU era didn't change that much, since most people had or could afford a decent GPU. Even the first generation of ASICs were fairly affordable.
With the endless complaints, bad press, and legal threats from people who spent a few hundred dollars on Jalapenos like they had a sure way to win the lottery, you'll notice that the next generation of Butterfly Labs products start out at a few thousand dollars. The people who paid for the heavy machines didn't complain, because they understand investment risk and aren't likely to be trying to strike it rich when they already have or likely to be relying on income for living expenses. Butterfly Labs not working out a way that was affordable to just anyone wasn't likely a mistake. Even the price of the Jalapeno jumped from $167 in January to about $250.
With the way entry-level prices and hash rate are increasing, there are going to be a lot of people who don't make enough with the current generation to afford even more of the current generation, let alone the next generation. The starting prices for next generation equipment are thousands of dollars. Most people can afford a few hundred dollars. Most people can't afford a few thousand dollars. And Butterfly Labs has already sold out its first batch when they're not even done designing it.
When those begin to be produced at a decent rate, the affordable mining equipment will die out due to the expense of running it. Things are changing to where only people with a lot of money can do well, which is about what you'd expect.
This is not particularly good if you want a decentralized currency, since the miners decide what to include in blocks.

You've apparently never been new to one of the dozens of old designs of US coins that people don't usually ever see these days. You've also apparently not one day seen a new, colorful $20 bill that you hadn't seen before. But don't worry, her actions aren't consistent with changing her mind based on assuming that what she was seeing was a new US coin. Presidential quarters and the US mint coining silver and gold again with new designs in 1986 and so on don't exist for you. You have bona fide proof!

Silver (and gold) certificates have the problem of postal theft, excessive transmission time, relatively high transmission fees, the necessity of dealing with the particular silver bank that issued the certificates (which can be quite a problem if the recipient is in another country), closure of silver banks making the certificates worthless (see Liberty Dollar), and on and on.

You're assuming that people can't come to the conclusion independently of a prosecutor's reasoning. I bought Liberty Dollars and liked them, but then I found out the ways that they advocated spreading them, and I didn't feel comfortable about that.
People are obviously used to US money to the extent that they'll think the Liberty Dollar is just a new US coin (like all the other new designs of US money that come out fairly often). To think that those people aren't going to be harmed when they find that the coin that was presented using terms that people commonly use for US money, with all the symbols of the state on them, is ludicrous. And the methods they recommended for spending them included *avoiding* informing the person of anything about money, and confirming that the coins were various things that sounded to uninformed people like US money.
Forget what the prosecutor is saying. Those people who received the coins ignorantly are likely to find out that they have to go to a coin dealer to sell the coins and that the coin dealer is only going to give them the melt value, which is far less than what they were led to believe the coins were worth.
That inconvenience and loss is the product of fraud.
The spreaders of Liberty Dollars actually thought at the time (I read them saying it many times) that, by avoiding calling it a "coin" (because that's what the law supposedly restricted people from calling it) and other magic words, they would avoid civil suits and prosecution. How legalistic and stupid do you have to be to think that there's no way to prosecute you for victimizing others because you made all the right arcane incantations that none of your victims were aware of the magical significance of?
You could supposedly get away with defrauding, and it wouldn't actually be fraud, because the recipients of the coins should have been aware of the magical words that signify real US coins legally. Supposedly that makes everything great morally, because it's not your job to inform people of the value of what they're buying. That's quite true *if you properly inform them of what it is in the first place*! They can then choose to accept or reject the inconvenience and so on associated with it not being a real US coin, and that's not your business.
Even looking at the US laws, did von Nothaus not know about investment prospectuses and the moral reasoning behind people giving them out to potential investors?
Buyer beware is a great phrase because it lets you know there are charlatans out there. If you're the one they should have been wary of, that's not good for you.

I'm an anarchocapitalist, so try something else. You may want to gather some evidence beforehand, rather than living in 'everyone's against me' and 'everyone's an indoctrinated statist' paranoia land.


Apparently, the nanny state is bad, but the nanny independent money makers are good! That can be the only explanation for this particular defense of von Nothaus and others who, with planning ahead of time, acted in opposition to ensuring the person had reasonable knowledge of what trade they were making.
I wonder how someone could miss that a lot of businesses want the money they receive to be *easily spendable*. But you know better than them what's good for them! Surely they wanted to receive something where, to spend it, they'd have to undertake all the necessary work of finding out that coin dealers will sometimes buy non-US coins, finding one that will, spending the gas money going to one, and then finding out...that its melt value is only half of its face value and the coin dealer is taking a cut! In other words, they got ripped off for time and money.
That's if they didn't just toss it in the trash because it was useless to what they needed to accomplish and they lacked any knowledge about silver because the wonderful libertarian advocates like von Nothaus *didn't bother to advocate anything to them*.
Surely neither one of those happened to anyone and they all just decided to save it like a good silver investor that you know everyone really strives to be. You can read minds, after all. They were all universally happy with their unchosen savings plan and everyone went off into the sunset singing praises to Bernard von Nothaus because, over half a decade, they made a grossly inflated $20. They must be thrilled (to have to go through the effort and expense of selling it, as detailed above)!
You know, instead of growing their business with the money and perhaps making quite a bit more than $20 or buying something for themselves later that day or whatever they would have freely preferred.
Let's do that instead of informing them about the Fed and advocating that they start investing in silver. Surely a few coins they didn't want is far better investment than their informed decision to purchase loads of them! Thanks von Nothaus! It's people like you that make the world better!




Yeah, you sure do have quick, supposedly-unassailable proofs for the ideas you're convinced of and slow, impossible proofs for the ideas you dislike. I think the worst 'everyone' will think of me, if they care at all, is that I'm an idiot for arguing with you.

This is bro*ken*.

Speaking of evidence, where's your evidence that I believe the prosecutor? It may be that I think von Nothaus is guilty of something other than what he was prosecuted for.
Having trouble differentiating separate people with minds of their own?
