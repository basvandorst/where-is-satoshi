if you have your private key, there is nothing the government or anyone can do to keep you from using your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:10:11
wait what
You can buy planets and people with BTC in the future? And then people kill their neighbors because of luck like in  Monopoly? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:33
Tell me more about the future

"I don't talk about money." Then change the subject. If they persist, then you know they are just nosy as fuck and have breached polite social conduct. Feel free at that point to tell them to fuck off.

My crazy theory: Nothing is going to happen. Just pure indifference. Price stays at 15k for a year, everyone gets bored and goes home.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:20
Good. Bitcoin needs a crisis to grow. Solve scaling or die.
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:40:47
bitcoin rising in value was luck, and no one would fault you for not buying in and missing out
but selling your bitcoin was in your control and would totally be on you
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:54:57
send me cad file plz

you're right, 200x this time

that was my first thought when I went to download it. 
Is it easier for cryptominers to get on my computer by me being stupid and actively downloading something or for someone to program a virus that finds my computer
Vote goes to me being stupid
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:50:53
what, how often do you strand yourself somewhere where you can't access fiat money and have to depend on your memory bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:10:05
I love screenshot threads. I can't wait to post in a few years the ones I took, which right now are just kind of depressing me.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:56:28
Thanks for explaining
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:27:44
This is as good as any TA. You can't try to criticize this when it's all based on bullshit anyway. The entertainment value comes from the fact that OP (like McAfee) actually gives a specific date and is not afraid to be wrong.
@_date: 2019-03-08 05:38:10
it'll be fun to see what happens if those coins ever move. Pandemonium
@_date: 2019-03-30 05:40:03
I agree. It's convenient to use log to diminish how scary a -80% drop looks like. If the next bull run hits $40,000, you can bet your ass people aren't going to use log scale on their graphs on the front page.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:28:33
I'm out of the loop, why are people making logos for satoshi?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:58:26
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:50:22
That's why you treat it as a long-term investment. If it drops, you don't "gotta get out fast," just hold and ignore the daily noise.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:13:35
I decided before I invested what my cash out price is. No way I'm selling early. That regret would be much worse than losing my initial investment.

Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years already. Things haven't changed that much.

This is amazing, I can't look away

Yeah my dog ate my bitcoins from way back I feel you

I liked bits a lot a couple years ago, but yeah, I think the trend is sats now.
Edit: bits still &gt;&gt;&gt; mbtc ;p
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:37:28
Yup, this is why people buy alts
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:00:17
Sorry dude, that's like my worst case scenario. I would rather buy at the top and hold through a bear market than to sell and watch the price rise.
You can fix that by buying in now and taking the short term loss. It might drop again, but at least youre back in it
@_date: 2019-06-10 05:05:11
It would only be life changing if you don't sell until 1 BTC can actually change your life. But people aren't going to do that, not a chance. Just look what happened when BTC hit 9000.
If you have 1 BTC and can hold past 50%, then 100%, then 1000%, and whatever the ungodly % is needed to change your life, then you fucking deserve it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:35:23
Watching this is worth the price of admission.

I think as long as you have your private key, you can access all your forked coins later on when you import the key into whatever wallets/exchanges end up supporting the coin.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:26:04
I also heard, it's Bitcoin 2 now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:22:31
OP, cash out. You have a sure thing right in front of you. Choose that over a hypothetical higher return. How much higher do you want?
Let's say you cash out and BTC doubles. You'll feel FOMO and get $1.8 million instead of $3.6.
Now let's consider if you hold and BTC halves. You now have $900K instead of $1.8 million.
I don't know about you, but I would much rather go with the first scenario. $1.8M is large enough for me to not care if it goes higher, and missing out on being a millionaire is a MUCH bigger regret.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:43:21


What kind of research tells you whether bitcoin goes up or down? Crystal balls?
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:18:49
Cool graph
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:04:18
People seem to believe it will drop, but it went up after the BCH fork.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:49:03
It's amazing that I managed to buy at literally the absolute worst time in bitcoin history. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:07:10
I didn't even finish replying, now 12,700

Land and housing values could go down over time if jobs move away from an area. Places like Detroit or Flint were hit hard when manufacturing jobs left and likely not coming back.

same :( that was a dark time
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:21:51
I disagree with your views about wealth and human nature. It's one thing to expect personal responsibility and another to generalize away someone's problems by using terms like "reality principle," as if you have some direct link on what reality is.
Another thing, your use of random capitalizations of nouns makes this seem like a street-corner pamphlet.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:37:12


The 4% SWR defines success as having anything more than $0 in your balance after 30 years; so you probably shouldn't count on having your original principle intact at the end.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:03:43
This is fucking heartbreaking.
Your dad is YOLO incarnate.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:26
Wait, where do you live? If you paid for your house and land, why is it your city's and not your own private property?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:58:12
sucks that you had to deal with people like that so much that you've internalized all that
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:34:51
That was hella violent
@_date: 2019-12-30 08:16:11


this is the easiest way to ignore whatever you're saying
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:30:05
that's a good point
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:45:32
To me, selling early and seeing the price moon is so much worse than holding through a drop. In fact, it's the worst case scenario for me in terms of regret. 
If 3x can change your life in a significant way, then yes by all means sell. But if you're taking profits just to take profits, and the market rises, it's so much harder to get back in, and you end up wishing for crashes that may never come.
On the other hand, if you mentally consider your initial investment as already gone, and you don't need that money for rent or whatever (because you're a responsible person who didn't invest more than you can afford), then just HODL. If the market drops, wait and cheer for crypto's success instead of failure. We've been doing this for literal years. You're still in the game and not standing on the sidelines while the magic ship sails away.
It's why HODL is more important during a bull run than a bear.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:54:26
I feel exactly the same way. Let's see people stand up for what they believe in. No more posturing and arguing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:34:47
I realized recently that I've lived in a bubble for most of my life and it's good to realize just how large the percentage of people here think this way. The silent majority indeed.

Yes comrade

If you knew, why didn't you max out your credit cards and borrow as much as the bank would give you to buy up those sure-fire assets?
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:39:11
Haha this is great
I may be down 80% but at least memes are back.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:50:54
That's too bad; I was looking forward to the split to see where people fall in line. There's just been posturing and words and    I wanted to see people put their money where their mouths are and settle this. 
@_date: 2019-12-22 03:30:31
That was a dumb article. I feel dumb having read it.

wishful thinking
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:30:35
omg you're actually saying "this is good for bitcoin" with a straight face.
China cracking down on the entire bitcoin ecosystem there is bona fide bad news. You want people to use bitcoin, not have it driven out of the mainstream back underground. 
I see your points about bitcoin going back to its roots as an anti-authority system. But I think bitcoin has always had a bigger PR problem than a technical one. If adoption doesn't happen, even the purest, best written protocol is worthless.
@_date: 2019-02-23 03:06:46
