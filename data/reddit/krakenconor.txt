Hi ya\_mu, 
Conor from Kraken Support here. I'm sorry to hear about that! Generally, if an account is not verified it's because the documents do not meet our requirements. You are always welcome to review our requirements for verification documents and resubmit them. 
Please see this link: [**Document requirements for verification**](

Hello AlexanderRow, 
We certainly appreciate your kind words about our CEO and the platform! I would also like to add that we have made some very significant changes since end of 2017-beginning of 2018. 
We have a brand new website, an improved trading engine, more funding options, more liquidity and volume, the addition of Kraken Futures (with up to x50 leverage) and much more on the way!  We've also massively increased our support team with many more enthusiastic and experienced crypto specialists from all over the world!
We're going to scale just fine :) Just wanted to let you know that we may be worth checking out again!

Thanks for asking!  
If you are a resident of NY and you would like to have an account with Kraken, you are still able to open an account with us as long as you can provide a proof of residence when registering from another state that is not restricted from using our services. Alternatively, you can register a company outside of NYC and use this to open a corporate account (please note you can not register the Kraken corporate account with a NY address, only a non-NY address).  
If you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out here or via DM!
