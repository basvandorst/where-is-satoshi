I think the idea is that they take away the risk of losing your data somewhere/somehow, or any other security failures on your side (although you still have a problem if someone gets a hold on your password). But the price doesn't seem worth it indeed.

I had hoped for taxes on net rather than gross income though. For companies this will never be a problem, but if you are using your home GPU to mine some coins this is going to be an interesting item. I didn't see anything on this in the current set up.

I hoped to get some thoughts going on this. Nothing is certain, but this could turn out to be a key element - I will amend the text to better reflect this
I'm curious on how they plan to check this, this could save your home GPU miner for a while. But I imagine that there will be a point where the government knows all wallet address owners

Well, the U.S. is a big player and generally and example to the rest of the world.

It concerns the mining only. The U.S. (and Japan?) will apply taxes. Russia banned Bitcoins, China might follow. Europe hasn't decided yet but is divided, and will be inspired by this ruling. Overall, it isn't exactly looking too great if you happen to own a mining rig.

With a home made mining rig you'll easily make it to that amount, but you have a good point on their ability to check it. That's another thing that isn't clear yet. As a honest person you should include it I guess, but if they're not able to check it people have an incentive to simply ignore it - and then nothing changes. Let's see what else they come up with.

Interesting, how would you motivate this?

Regardless of the question whether VC is a valid measure the article is simply wrong. The author ignored or missed the footnote that the numbers for 1996 are unadjusted. If you want to compare you need to adjust for inflation, bringing $639m in 1996 to $952m today. The only headline you can come up with then is; "Bitcoin VC interest falls short of the internet, despite barriers removed by the internet". Sloppy journalism.

The majority of the network wants bigger blocks one way or another, and even the devs agree that there is a need to increase (with the Lightning Network you still need to scale up). 2MB is the minimum proposal I've seen except for some "do-nothing" suggestion  that keeps getting bashed to pieces each time. In the meanwhile tx fees are rising, and delays have already occured due to blocks spilling over. What exactly shows that there isn't a need for an increase?

Altcoins like Dogecoin are easily ignored, while they do manage to get their **** together and solve more fundamental problems than Bitcoin has. BTC has not been capable to even raise its block size limit by just 1MB for the past two years - longer than most alts have existed in total. Instead, the discussions has resulted in personal attacks, a forced hard fork and even censorship. It seems like a relevant question to ask why there is a difference and what BTC might learn from that.
