I bought when it was on its upward train, I sold out right before it dropped below that amount, ended up making a good amount since i had bought at multiple times on its upward swing. I don't know how much further its going to drop, but I wanted to preserve my cash value temporarily so I can buy some christmas presents.

Oh man.... aggressive much? I mean its pretty obvious the feds don't like bitcoin, they seized currency (which in bitcoin is a finite amount), so now there will always be less bitcoins. This drives the price of other bitcoins up creating market volatility. That is depending on your view, potentially a failing of the currency system. I'm not saying its mine, I'm just asking what other people think. Since I think its an interesting question, at least to me. I don't have a proposal or a solution because I'm not sure if its even a real problem.

In fact there is an argument to be made the deflation encourages competition because members want more money now to capitalize on its increasing growth over time. First person to market would be a powerful economic advantage, and high quality high value goods would be much more monetarily advantageous because your goods need to keep pace with the currency.

A thought. Are there any cryptocurrencies out there that meaningfully handle seizure of coins. Obviously bitcoin is capable of handling the problem since a seizure of assets just drives up the value of individual coins, forcing purchases down the decimal point. But I think having the power to seize large portions of the market potentially creates a rather unfortunate level of volatility. Thoughts?
EDIT: My whole chain of comments downvoted for asking questions cause I'm just trying to understand? Jeez guys.

And all that time I can be mining zerocoins under the radar.

One thing I will say about the average investor is they could really care less about what the money is generated from as long as its generating money. People don't go into banking because they love banks, they go into banking because they want money. If there is more and easier money to get elsewhere many investors will just follow the gravy train. CHOO CHOO TO DOLLAR BILL VILLE.

The wikipedia page gives a good run down as usual. Semantically they can be used as a singular, its just not "practice" to do so. I would argue that using it as a singular is totally okay and would probably benefit the language rather than harm it.

100% interest over the last couple weeks..... That's not a savings account that's striking gold.

Which if you think like people who think that the millenium started in 2000 you are safe in your mathematical insecurity to believe it happened in the 90's!

People are silly, so sometimes the truth is as well.

Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy time and freedom, which might produce happiness! Best new slogan!

Are the feds legally obligated to liquidate the bitcoins they've seized?

So basically your philosophy for bitcoin is effectively, "Let the market sort it out?" In the case of bitcoin I think its design lends itself well to that approach and I'm inclined to agree with you, thanks for your thoughts.
