That's what my plan is. Thank you!

I honestly thought the same thing you did, but I've seen both phones available at the same time for $100, and I've even seen the 64GB for $0. Even right now, I can go to the site and both phones are showing as $100. I seriously think something is up with their website. I don't know how it's possible to have a bug that only affects the iPhone X but it seems like that might be the case. u/imige said his / her order got cancelled, but mine is still there and I even got a message that it was being processed, so we'll wait and see.

If you take that link and copy it into Purse's search bar, you'll find the Purse listing for the same product. So it's definitely the one you posted a link to, but we'll see what happens.

I can't disagree for sure. It does seem a little too good to be true, but I felt optimistic since it's sold by Purse. I'll update this post if I get it though.

This is what made me feel like there's a hope that it's not a scam. I guess we'll see what happens.

Mine is still good. I sent a message yesterday to ask when I would get tracking info and I was told today around 3 hours ago that "the order is being processed. We will update the order details ASAP"

Sure! Thanks for your input.

From my understanding, that's how wishlist purchases work. You create a wishlist on Amazon, someone on Purse buys and ships it, and they get your BTC. This, however, was **not** a wishlist purchase. It was a "buy now" purchase. For those, Purse (the company, not a seller) buys the item from Amazon and ships it to you directly. I have a really good reason to believe that this is legit because the order says that the transaction is being conducted with "PurseBuyNow" (that's Purse's bot that acts as an earner during buy now transactions). If they cancel the order, I won't be surprised, but I'm beginning to think that this isn't a scam, and that they just screwed up.

Mine is cancelled now too. The email I got said it was due to "item unavailability". I tried again, but I'm not counting on it.

I absolutely will. I went to Amazon's real website and looked up the phone. After copying the link over to Purse, I found that the listing on Purse matches up with the listing on Amazon, so I think it's more likely that I'll get nothing as opposed to a fake phone. Regardless, I'll post an update.

I agree. I just figured it might be worthwhile because it seems like it's from Purse and not some other seller. Anyway, thanks for your input.
