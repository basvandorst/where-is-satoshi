Bisq rocks and is probably a great option. You're not required to take the offers that are there. Put up your offer at a 0% deviation from the price that is showing and then wait.

No online or mobile version at this time. Bisq needs to be used on a PC/Mac. There is a Windows, Mac &amp; Linux version.

Incorrect. Bisq is a completely decentralized exchange with KYC-free fiat on/off ramps for multiple currencies.

Alex Jones was offered a butt load of free bitcoin from Max Kaiser wayyy back in the day but didn't understand it and found the tech too complicated (there weren't wallets all over the place back then for one thing) so just never went through the "hassle" of receiving it. He made it clear in Dec. '17 that was one of his biggest regrets of his life. So he's bitter about that. Ever since post Dec. '17 "crash", Alex Jones has decided he doesn't like "crypto" anymore.
Alex also doesn't understand the difference between bitcoin and every other shitcoin and just calls them all bitcoin most of the time. Much of what he says (ICOs being scams, him being offered money to pump some crypto, etc.) is correct but sounds ridiculous when he just calls it all bitcoin. When you understand that Alex means "crypto" and not bitcoin when he goes on these rants, then it makes more sense.

Agreed. I found myself actually rooting for the dip and having a blast watching it go down. So many people freaking out...chill.

I second this. Bisq works really well.
