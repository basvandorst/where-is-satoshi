Looks like shit
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:15:20
haha, yes it has. Especially since I just got into Bitcoin mining :\ Eh, its still $50 a week for selling hashing power at the current BTC/USD exchange rate. I'm fine with it ;)

Y tho, you can just use a bitcoin -&gt; USD transfer site and not lose a ton of money through:
1) The transaction
2) The discount you applied to the value of your coins

Wait what?! Get out of Copay?! I only opened a wallet with them less than 2 weeks ago and am currently in the process of selling hashing power in return for BTC that will be transferred to the Copay address. Does this change need to be made immediately or... ???

I have no idea what that is. I'm literally clueless at this point, the only thing I THINK I've figured out is that all this hodl bs was started because some drunk fucker went on reddit.

screw buying, mine.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:45:59
2000 USD now...
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:38:23
if you're giving away some free cash, i'll take it ;D
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:25:13
yeah... I gotta pay more than that for an estimation of "over 8 hours" ...

According to copay, the lowest fee I can give is 0.002679... there's only 5 options as well, the highest being 0.005783...
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:02:53
ah, right

I think unichange.me is good, I haven't tried it yet though. From a few quick searches, I'd conclude its legitimate.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:12:52
Sell it, I recommend Nicehash.

You're very welcome, it's a much more consistent method of generating income. Fluctuations are rare, in the USD department that is (although, you're paid entirely in bitcoins, for the moment anyway), profits are good, payouts are frequent. Me and some buddies are investing in some GTX 1080's and building a mining rig, which is protected to be far more than just self-sustaining.

haha, I've got a 1070 Founder's Edition, but I got SUPER SUPER fucking lucky with it. I can take my memory clock all the way to +900Mhz before any tiny little artefacts appear, all the way to +1000 without crashing but then artefacts are way more regular and prominent. Core I can only go to 2056Mhz, but I could go higher under liquid. Max temps are 64c with the AC on and 64c with it off, so, as you can imagine, I'm a happy man :D

Thanks, should be a peace of cake ;D. ATM, I'm solo mining with my own personal system. Although, its not really a dedicated mining system, I just don't really play video games anymore, and what better way to make use of a GTX 1070 than to mine for the rest of its lifetime...
