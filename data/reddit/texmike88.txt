I am newbie to Bitcoin but here's my take on BitInstant. This service was a disappointment! I used it on April 12, 2013. I needed to buy $60 worth of Bitcoin so I could purchase something online. Knowing that the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate, I ordered $67 worth of Bitcoin on BitInstant. After placing my order, I went immediately to CVS to pay ZipZap. It took 3.5 hours to receive my Bitcoins, although they claim to have your transaction completed in 30 min - 1 hour after payment. Also, I only received $55 worth when it hit my wallet.
I emailed them yesterday about this and they have yet to respond. I would expect them to have quick customer service considering they charge you a 3.99% fee. Their phone support is just some recording telling you to use the non-existent live chat feature on their site.
Take home message: I spent $73.95 (base cost + BitInstant's cut + ZipZap's take) to get $55 worth of Bitcoin after a 3.5 hour wait. If this seems like a fair deal then go with them. I know I will be avoiding BitInstant in the future.

Why are the BitInstant folks on Reddit and not answering emails?

When Bitcoin hit my wallet (3.5 hours after I paid) I only got $55 worth. I paid for $67 at the time of the transaction.

It took 3.5 hours to receive my Bitcoins and I only received $55 worth when it hit my wallet. I understand if there are technical issues, but when you charge a 3.99% transaction fee and an additional $3.95 fee through ZipZap, I would expect to get what I paid for...$67 worth of Bitcoin when it hits my wallet, not $55. What pisses me off the most is that I can not buy what I originally set out to get, cause I'm $5 shy now. Looks like I'm going to have to waste more money trying to unscrew their problems. 
Take home message: I spent $74.95 (base cost + BitInstant's cut + ZipZap's take) to get $55 worth of Bitcoin. Avoid BitInstant!
