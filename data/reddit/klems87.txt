Get a hardware wallet and your coins off Coinbase. It's only a matter of time until it gets hacked. I got a Ledger Nano S last week and just pushed everything in there. As i buy, I'll continue to push.

Bought in at 9.5K, zoom out to 1 month and I haven't lost anything :) Question for the newbies...why would you buy at an ATH? The pattern has always said it will correct.

Many thanks, that makes sense now.

Ledger Nano S for me for all three.

And I'm all secure now. A bit of a headache with some GDAX transfer errors, but everything got through. I had to reload Chrome each time i wanted to send something.

What is the preferred method of moving BTC from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano S? I've see some suggestions to move it from Coinbase to GDAX and then to the Ledger to minimize the fees. Is this correct?

So wait, you're using a credit card on GDAX? How? I don't want to link anything to my checking account with security being as questionable as it is these days.

I just started last Sunday after the "$9000" hype. I had heard and looked at Bitcoin a few months ago, but it looked difficult to get into because I didn't want to have it connected to my checking account. I looked around again on Sunday and found that Coinbase was finally taking credit cards. I bought a few hundred $ between BTC, ETH, and LTC. Hate the fees, but I like the convenience and security of using a credit card. 
I saw the rise yesterday evening and the dip today, fun stuff! I'm looking into how to use GDAX to mitigate the fees and I bought a Ledger Nano S to put my coins in cold storage. I plan to buy on the dips and "HODL" until I reach my "moon"...which I'm not sure what that is yet. Retiring by 35 would be nice.
I know I'm a bit late, but I wanted some better security. Hopefully I've managed to get in before this goes really mainstream. I'm looking forward to following this sub and laughing at the memes. Keep them coming!
