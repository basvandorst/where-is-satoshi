Want to know the great thing about Dogecoin? *When it comes to giving, we don't give a crap about how it will affect the value of the coin.*
Now shut up and take my dogecoin.
+25.98 doge

I have a feeling you haven't looked at what has done at all. The more I look at what he does, the more I feel he has spent a minimum of $1,000 on buying Dogecoin solely to give away. We aren't doing any of this to market a coin, we're doing it because we are having fun, and want to give. I'm sorry if you can't believe that people might actually be generous, but just because we're tipping doesn't mean we have some ulterior motif.


About 90% of the people who posted on that thread were not new to Dogecoin, I guarantee it. His rep was also already beyond awesome.


Glad to hear there is another large tipper around.

..not an option. People who offer services to New York State citizens *also* have the follow regulations, stupid as it is.


This is such an **insane understatement**.

I want you to go take a look at and his tipping behavior, take a look at [this thread]( and then I want you to tell me if you *really* believe we're tipping just to market a coin.
The man spent **eight hours** giving **1000 dogecoin at a time** to roughly over **600 people**. And this is just his more recent stuff, too. That giveaway thread distributed what amounts to **$272.16 total** at the time of writing, for no reason at all.

Except that it does put them in the poor house if they can't actually pay for anything with it since there are no real legal ways of using it that aren't a headache. 
This is what happens to all cryptos if nothing is done. Ignore it all you want, all that'll do is hurt you.

If that were true, I'd just give a smaller amount of Dogecoin.

And so have to deal with regulations regardless because they deal with New York citizens.


And get arrested. Yeah, okay, that'll work.


Name one.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:44:42
You certainly appear to be doing that.

If it gets them arrested, that doesn't really work out well for them at all.
I'm not sure what makes you think that you can simply ignore laws you don't like, but in the real world that puts you in jail.
