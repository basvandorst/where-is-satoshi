By all means, specify *exactly* where the flaw or inaccuracy in what I just said is. 
It's really fucking obvious, so you should have no trouble at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:35:34
Oh wow.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:46:16
Yes, when you try and dispute a point based on incorrect or irrelevant claims, the discussion tends to return to said point after the inaccuracy or irrelevance of your claim has been established.
That's very observant of you to notice. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:04:07
Oooh, so now it's the network which brings the irreplicable practical value, and not the trustless ledger as previously stated?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:39:22
So you can't, no surprises there. 
Please don't waste my time any further until you have something of substance to add, thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:46:20
What if I told you all that value the internet has is derived from practical applications it possesses which cryptocurrencies do not? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:32
Some electrons, I guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:54:23
No, trustless decentralized ledgers have no practical value which cant be easily replicated or replaced by a virtually identical competitor, and the same can't be said about the internet.
Honestly, *you're* the one who made this comparison to begin with, Do you really think anyone is going to buy that you suddenly forgot about the entire replicability aspect of *your* analogy within the span of forty minutes? 
You're not making yourself look smarter by disarming a laughably transparent strawman that nobody would ever fall for, man.

Lol, the EU's military spending is currently at $226 billion USD.  
Russia's? It's at $69.2 billion USD. 
The notion that Europe needs military protection from Russia has been little more than a joke for a few decades, now. 
And hell, this isn't even taking into consideration how much more Russia proportionally spends than the EU. Were the EU to collectively increase their military spending as a percentage of GDP to match Russia's current level, as they'd obviously be expected to in the event that actual conflict broke out, then they'd be outspending Russia by approximately *14* times over.

I couldn't agree more. 
Which is why it's nothing short of baffling that you don't actually seem to understand what [logarithmic growth]( looks like, Here's a hint, though: It's literally the inverse of the pattern seen above.

That stuff doesn't meet the criteria for currency, because it's not convertible or transferable to actual money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:01:23
Because the people who make the decision as to exactly how much money is spent are also the people that [companies like Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, etc]( are allowed to pay big bucks to help ensure they stay in office, where they can continue to allocate more and more money for those company's products.

Russia has [one of the highest GDP to defense spending ratios of every nation on the entire planet]( my friend.
The only nations exceeding them are the tiny oil driven nations of Kuwait, Oman, and the UAE, the larger oil driven nations of Algeria and Saudi Arabia, and finally Israel.  
Given that higher percentages are obviously expected in smaller economies, both Russia and the US are pretty major outliers. Russia simply for breaking 5% GDP while being a [major economy]( and the US for managing to stay as high as 3.3% while also having the single largest economy on the planet, at 14.5 times the GDP of Russia.

Lol, all you'd manage to do is prompt them to set up an automated reply informing you that video game money doesn't constitute a digital currency, on the basis that it is not legally convertible or transferable.

@_date: 2017-12-13 17:32:22

Standard speculative investing behavior, mate. 
When a volatile asset makes a sudden and enormous leap in value without any major real-world developments to justify that change, you can bet your ass it's going to quickly correct itself afterward as people rush to sell during what they suspect to be a jump in prices driven by market irrationality.

So essentially what you're saying is that you don't actually know whether or not something constitutes Marxism, unless it fails, in which case it must have failed because it was Marxism.
You know, if you go around making up your own definitions to established terms like that, then language essentially loses any meaning.

A sure sign that something isn't an ill thought out conspiracy theory is when its proponents don't understand it well enough to explain it themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:13
That's complete nonsense when you actually look at the numbers, though.
Let's get specific so that we can do just that.  Who couldn't the EU's $226 billion in military spending manage to protect them from? Russia and their comparatively piddling $69.2 billion? Who couldn't the NATO nations, barring America, defend themselves against? 
Who *exactly* are you protecting from who?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:17:00
That *still* wouldn't be logarithmic growth. You realize that trial and error is a terrible way to learn basic math, right?

@_date: 2018-09-28 01:02:28


You're the one who argued against redefining words. Make up your mind. Or do you not actually have any real convictions beyond "whatever best suits the conclusion I want to arrive at"?  




At what point do you think you'll begin to realize that the claims you make and beliefs you espouse simply do not align with reality?
Or is that something you've already realized, and deliberately choose to ignore? 


Kim Il-sung certainly believe he was pursuing a democratic republic: 
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:40:57
You *really* wanna be pedantic about the definition? Because I can be absolutely be pedantic about the definition:




That there is pretty much the purest definition you can get short of using the original German, and I'll tell you right now that the [law of value]( was most *certainly* not superseded by [use-value]( in the Venezuelan economy. 
Had that been so, then they wouldn't have been hit nearly as hard by [Dutch disease]( which literally anyone who's understanding of economics wasn't built on internet memes can tell you was *easily* the single largest driving force behind the state of their economy today.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:59:26
Pretty sure the *mods* are stopping me, mate. After all, it'd be against the subreddit's rules to make a submission which consisted of nothing more than me pointing out that is full of shit, as evidenced by their inability to articulate their own beliefs. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:32:22
That tells us exceptionally little without also knowing your income. 
**Edit:** Wait a minute, you're including the sales tax on the purchase of a *house* and attributing it to a single year, rather than the length of time you're going to be paying your mortgage for? 
That seems a little bit disingenuous, to be honest. Particularly in comparison to a nation which primarily relies on income tax, like the US, where most people pay approximately the same amount every year. 
Kinda like an American saying that they paid $70,000 in taxes this year, only for it to turn out that they took an advance on next year's paycheck, you know what I mean?  
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:11:44




Alright, I suppose that's technically correct based on how I worded that question, so I'll give you that. But I was kinda hoping for answers along the lines of a nation with which potential conflict might be remotely plausible, you know?
And the notion of a war between the EU and China, well, that's simply not happening. Not only is the EU China's largest trading partner, and China the EU's second largest partner after only the United States, but there's also the fact that EU spending would still eclipse that of China by a fair -if not overwhelming- amount when you equalize spending as a percentage of GDP, and that the EU is still technologically ahead of China when it comes to the production and development of military equipment.


No disrespect, but that's a joke, right?

A question of whether or not anyone else noticed something you insisted to be fact. dietrolldietroll is disputing the factuality of your claim. 
The fact that you asked if anyone else had noticed the disputed claim in question is irrelevant.

There's just one problem with this, and it's that Bitcoin is not a good. It's a currency. 
It's not consumed by anything, and there's no sustainable profit driven demand for it -outside of speculation- which will not be filled in the short term. Treating it like a good is like trying to sell money in a currency exchange where speculators outnumber actual users one hundred to one.

That's a terrible idea, simply because those examples are all serving several dozens times as many people as crypto currently is. 
Scale crypto up to serve the same percentage of the population as the cited examples, and crypto loses by an overwhelming degree every single time.

@_date: 2017-11-27 11:11:17
Bitcoin is literally nothing like that, though. 
Oil deposits that you can't currently use still have intrinsic value, because there's oil in it and oil is a commodity. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It becomes worthless the moment you can't use it, because it literally derives its value from the ability to transfer it to others like any other currency. 
If any shmuck could simply take a barrel of fluid, call it dogeoil, or potoil, or titoil, and then have it be just as good as actual oil, then you might have a comparable situation on your hands.

His claim that humans and lobsters "divulged" (diverged) [about 350 million years ago]( In reality, Vertebrate originated during the Cambrian explosion about it's around half a billion. 
And for that matter, really his entire spiel about lobsters in general. His claims regarding an analogous relationship between human social hierarchies and lobster social hierarchies simply don't stand up to the fact that there are literally thousands of different species who are incomparably closer to humans on the phylogenetic tree who exhibit entirely different social hierarchies than lobsters. 
So the notion that the latter reflects how humans should be, or how humans naturally are, is simply a load of bullshit.
