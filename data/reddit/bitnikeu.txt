tnx, will check out!

Yes. Their case seems somewhat similar. Perhaps they did solve what we need to do, but I'd imagine they can achieve it using different approach.
For a service like Reload users expect that transaction is noticed within seconds. Which we achieve for single address wallets, BitGo wallet and LocalBitcoins. And we want to offer same level of quality  for HD wallets.
@_date: 2016-04-28 12:41:34
Not yet. Has been 'coming soon' for a while now. Main challenge we're facing is to get a reliable blockhain explorer that offers notifications for transactions based on xpub.
@_date: 2016-04-28 12:38:43
Bitnik Reload requires no bank account and exchange API access information includes no personal information. With some exchanges you'd expose username, but that's it. Bitnik.
Currently same address (non-HD wallet) or BitGo wallet. HD (through xpub) wallets support is under development.

A buy order is triggered on your exchange account. 
|You send 0.1 bitcoins from your wallet and Bitnik Reload will rebuy same amount on exchange. Your exchange account is connected using API key so our service gets no personal information from exchange.

let´s say que sera, sera, but i am also buying another :) 
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:32:35
There's a service that will rebuy spent coins automatically on 20+ exchanges. Great for exactly such use case. Spend and hold at the same time:
Anonymous and it does not hold your coins.
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:38:28
My rule is also buy, buy, buy. But I do spend them whenever I can in order to support usability and accepting merchants/services. Not only for Sport Cars, Luxury Homes, etc. but in day-to-day purchases, paying utility bills, etc. My rule: when spending, always rebuy those spent bitcoins instantly, for example with Reload -    so my stack does not diminish :) And then buy some more. If merchants using processors like BitPay don`t dump the coins immediately, but actually keep some (as a merchant, you can keep for example 5%, 50% or even 100% of the revenue in Bitcoins...  there was an article, stating that more than 4400 merchants keep all their settlement in bitcoins -  (it is an old article, so the number certainly changed, but anyways)), and i am also rebuying all the spent coins, then this scenario sounds better, than just sitting on loads of coins without supporting their usability.

Gold can't be spent on a cup of coffee, cos it not practical. It is with Bitcoin. If you have incentive to pay with bitcoins, why wouldn't you? You can rebuy them as you spend, so the value is irrelevant. Here's an automated solution that can help you:

possibly Emma can help -  - it is not completely accurate, but a good approx. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:16:32
Thank u !...and tnx for the advice .. SLO is beautiful and Bitcoin +++ ;)
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:50:57
Thanks. You should at least visit. Also other parts of the country are wort visiting. We will hook-up even more merchants, but even now your bitcoins would get you far in Ljubljana.
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:43:57
Well. The price is not for the ticket. It's if you want them performing on your event.
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:46:21
Thanks. We will keep that in mind. The challenge was that the shoots are short and text background would change causing bad contrast on text background. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:57:44
Thank you. Yes we noticed there was a spot to be filled here and we gladly did it.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:00:07
 got ur tip!..very kind and honest of u..tnx!! there is a wallet error on change tip, but i nothing to worry...
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:27:24
Bitpay is best option atm and physical locations are simplest to add. Merchant creates account, usually sets it to convert bitcoins to fiat. Gets 100% of  charged amount on bank account next business day. Pairs device or browser with account. Can be setup in couple of days.
When customer pays, merchant enters price and shows QR code. Instant confirmation. Merchant prints receipt from his standard POS and chooses payment method 'bitcoin'. No accounting problems or dilemmas as merchant newer touches bitcoins.

When you do travel to Slovenia, be sure to contact us. We will give you a fresh update of all the places accepting bitcoin. Growing by the day.
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:57:03
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:44:32
Ljubljana is the capital of Slovenia, EU. In the local slavic language the name actually originates from the word 'love'.
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:54:18
Do check out those locations, they all accept bitcoins. Or why not convince your local bar/heardresser/trafiko/restaurant to accept bitcoins. Get in contact, we can do it together.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:06:40
We also posted the video. Yes unfortunately we were a bit late on reddit. And we are quite new here, so I don't even know how to link it :)
Tips are welcome as is sharing. But main mission is to spread bitcoin usage by showing how useful and versatile it is. In Ljubljana and elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:22:29
Tnx a lot !!
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:40:24
Thanks. That is what we were going for. The way it should be, and somewhere alteady is. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:20:31
 tnx for sharing our link/video,   ljubljana is magical yes, tnx and come visit us  ;)
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:56:48
True. That would be a good solution. Would impact the final length of the video though, which is not a simple question in itself given the today's 5s focus culture.
Frankly we are very glad it came out as good as it did and that it's finished. Bumped a lot of challenges as we produced it. Remarkably bad weather this summer and a crash of a drone to name just 2.
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:43:18
A bit hard to estimate. Slovenia is quite high in bitcoin usage, Bitstamp's success helps there. Still it is a small town. Would estimate maybe a hundred. ? But that will grow! 
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:02:53
Thank you for the compliment. We are proud of our production and happy the community is accepting it very well.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:06:09
..we will in the next one..we r oldschool .. ;)
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:06:02
Hehe. Glad you like it. Come visit all that in person!
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:50:50
then we could go for a drink ;)...tnx for the tip
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:49:53

Reload is a service that binds your bitcoin wallet to your bitcoin exchange account: whenever you spend bitcoins from your wallet, Reload will use your exchange account to immediately repurchase the same amount of bitcoins.
In general, Bitnik Reload currently supports any wallet that uses a single address. Reload currently supports over 20 exchanges. 
You need to provide two things: your bitcoin wallet public address, and API credentials that you obtain at your exchange. You’ll also need an e-mail address to register. This is all the info we will ever require for Reload to work. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:39:27
That is perfect! We are celebrating our 1st anniversary and  May 22, at 18:00 UTC and will post regular updates on twitter :) -

Bitnik Reload team could add the other side to Reload. It has been on our minds for a whole now. We're open to proposals. We'll count your post as a +1 vote for this 'feature'.

[Reload]( Rebuy on the fly! 
Reload is a service that binds your bitcoin wallet to your bitcoin exchange account: whenever you spend bitcoins from your wallet, Reload will use your exchange account to immediately repurchase the same amount of bitcoins. Try it!
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:29:14
Bitnik Reload currently works with any wallet that uses a single address and a growing number of exchanges. Therefore it is more universal.
It works on a set-and-forget principle with almost no need for manual action. It will try to match lowest ask for the required volume (amount). It will re-adjust order on regular basis if market moves away. If there is an error (fiat balance low, API down,...) Reload will re-try later. No matter how the actual orders were executed Reload will report precise spent amount (including fee) and report true price for the reload (combining multiple trades and considering fee).

Hey we are launching Bitnik Reload, an universal solution for automated bitcoin repurchasing, advanced reporting and bookkeeping. Please feel free to ask us anything!

Reload FAQ: 
Btnik Reload is a service that binds your Bitcoin wallet to your account at a Bitcoin exchange so that whenever you spend from the wallet, the same amount of coins will immediately be bought back for you at the exchange. Bitnik Reload effectively enables you to pay for products and services from your fiat balance while using bitcoin as a payment network.
SUPPORTED EXCHANGES &amp; WALLETS
Currently we support the following exchanges: Bitstamp, ANX, BitcoinToYou, Bitfinex, BitVc, Bleutrade, BTCChina, BTC-e, BTCTrade, CexIO, Hitbtc, Kraken, Loyalbit, OkCoin, TaurusExchange. We are adding new supported exchanges according to popular demand.
In general, Reload currently supports any wallet that uses a single address. Wallets that automatically cycle addresses (even change addresses), either randomly or deterministically (eg. using BIP 32 / HD-wallets), are not yet supported; support for BIP 32 is planned.

I couldn't agree more, since i believe bitcoin needs to be used in everyday life. So i recently started to pay my bills with bitcoins (electricity, phone bill, etc.), as well as persuade many local places to start accepting bitcoins (and i am doing my best to show them support and love by visiting regularly, all real places shown in our video Bitcoin in Ljubljana:  At the same time i want to hodl the same (or accumulating bigger :) amount of my bitcoin stash, so i am repurchasing them immediately after i spent them. For this use we have developed an online service, called Reload (basically we developed it for our BTM operations), but now the whole team started to use it regularly. You basically connect your spending wallet (has to be single address, since multiple address wallets are not supported yet, but we will add those too eventually or upon demand) with your exchange (16 exchanges supported by now). So as soon as you spent your bitcoins from your spending wallet, Reload immediately rebuys them for you on your chosen exchange. Works super nicely for me! Also enables reporting (which turned out supper practical for our BTM operation tax reports). Welcome to check it out (we are still working on the UI a bit, but the backend has been tested extensively and works perfectly): 
Here also a Reload Tutorial video we created yesterday: 
Would be great to get some feedback, just hit us up at: reload
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:58:46
yes, it is available globally, it is free of charge and you can sign in with your email only.

Hi there. Agreed. We have developed an online service, called Reload. Primely for our BTM business, in order to rebuy back as soon as we sell. But now we have started to use it for our day-to-day spending as well. Works really nice actually. The service is in beta, so we are searching for people or other BTM business, who would give it a try, test it out and give us any kind of feedback regarding bugs, feature requests, general feedback, etc. If you are interested hit us up at: reload Cheers.

Does anyone know precise currency exchange fee NETELLER is charging for this? Usually e-wallets like NETELLER and Skrill earn a lot on currency conversion. And BTC -&gt; fiat needs to happen in case of such deposit.
