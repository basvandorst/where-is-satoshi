Well then, fuck them.

That's my question... why no transfer?  Isn't that the nature of BTC?

Honest question... if you don't want to contribute, downvote and fuck off.

My understanding is that if you hold BTC, then you have a BTC wallet.  One can move BTC from one wallet to another regardless of any 'exchange holder' or anything else.  Why can't one move their BTC holdings in a gox acct to a different wallet?  Does Gox have control over how one moves their BTC?  Isn't that removing one of the essential values of BTC to a centralized 'bank?'

Thank you.

That was the implication:  Sell holdings in AAPL, give your iPhone, Mac, whatever away, and be done with them.  Don't just smash them.

I read through every posting in I have been following this sub since early 2013. I still don't understand.

Thanks man

Stating to make sense, now I see why so many people are livid.  Thanks for explaining it better for me.

So technicalities aside... they found a way to bypass the 'verify' system with mining and keep it confined to the MtGox system?  This is bad news if true... and is probably why the value of BTC has dropped significantly recently?

I would rather see this trend, than seeing iPhones get smashed (though I agree with the message.)  
Sell your stock in AAPL and buy Bitcoin.
Money talks ;)

Question: When does that attitude change?  For some it was 30 or 60, others 266, then 1000 and 1242.  
We need to spend to keep it valuable.  I understand holding, but the idea that you can cash out all at once (No matter the amount) is selfish.  If you have faith, spend and buy more to replace what you are holding.

Research that statement please

Did they specify you were getting shut down because you are a business, or did they say bitcoin for personal use would be acceptable?  I'm about to start my own business (with boa) but I'm curious whether they made their decision based on the fact that you're a business vs just being another guy. Thanks man.

Thanks, I'll be sure to get something in writing before opening my business accounts.
