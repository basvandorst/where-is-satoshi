Just the amount of coins that are short on margin or long on margin.

**Future hard forks:** if a future HF does *not* have segwit, then I will not receive the new coin if my BTC are on a segwit address
**Airdrops:** cannot receive airdrops if using segwit address
**Message signing:** cannot sign messages using segwit address
**Adoption:** many exchanges/wallets still not segwit-compatible - makes me wonder why...if they don't have confidence in it then there might be a good reason
**Adoption (2):** if segwit adoption falls precipitously for some reason, then are my coins safe on a segwit-address?
**Security:** are segwit transactions as secure as non-segwit transactions?

I used to like Roger until recently.
The Error Log interview was a great signal to dump BCH and keep hodling BTC...and question Roger's motives.
I don't even know why he's attacking Andreas - what has he done?

This is why I love reddit

BTC has become a store of value.
A store of value needs to be HODLed.

Even though the wallet works perfectly, it's been labelled a scam.
Just because it supports BCH as default.
Brilliant work guys, keep it up.

BS...just like most things in crypto right now.
Except the price of BTC of course, which just keeps giving ;)

Fully agree. Let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:20:56
True. Both sides were pricks IMO.

$1 million per coin would give a market cap of ~ $20T, which is around the total global money supply.
Nah bro

This is the beauty of BTC - since there's no central authority, anyone can do what they want.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:35:34
Yes agreed.

Just posting since I thought that last sentence from Satoshi is hilarious.
Forget the rest of it. Not on any side here :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:45:37
oh no
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:53:46
Bro, BTC supply is not a constant!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:27:25
You're trying to prove that it's better to buy 0.3 BTC at 7000, rather than 5500.
Then you're going to make &gt;1000% by trading it.
Seems legit.

Sorry, got my M2 money supply wrong. You're right, thanks for correcting.
It would be more than 16 trillion market cap as more BTC will be mined by then.

Thing is though, there is *some* truth to that.
If a business doesn't make enough money to cover its expenses, it fails. And many startups these days have a shitload of expenses.

This might be the first time a market crash has been termed 'bullish'.
