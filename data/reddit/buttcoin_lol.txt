$5 million means SWR of $200,000 per year. That's plenty to retire on.

The usability thing sounds subjective. Besides the fewer confirmations, which is nice but not crucial for me, any other pluses that stood out for you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:35:21
(sub has gone link only?)
When do you get out? $100K per? $1 million? $10 million? We can't all just hodl forever right??? Or will you morpheus-meme and just never sell and wait for the day when you can use BTC directly? 
I've always just hodled because I don't have that much BTC and it's not anything life-changing. I figured I would think of something if/once my stash does reach a significant amount.
That day might be here sooner than I expect.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:18:40
I would. I'm only interested in cashing out if I can retire off of the money. If I'm just going to settle and go home for $100k, I might as well just stick to mutual funds.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:57

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:30
Yeah you fucked up by selling BTC, but not necessarily by buying bcash--it's not automatically a bad investment just because of all the politics you hear. 
Just look at it objectively; you don't have to like it or the people around it to profit off of it. Like all crypto during this ridiculous ramp up early days of awareness and adoption when you don't know what's going to moon, hodling imho is the best strategy.

Bitcoin is doomed in the sense that governments, as made clear in the article, will want as much control as possible through huge central digital storehouses of your fingerprint, retina scan, medical information, on and on, all of it. Once they see the threat that bitcoin could potentially have in their sparkly new "cashless" society, they will ban it left and right.
While I don't believe bitcoin would survive this opposition, in the end, the blockchain will though. You can't ban math.

Srsly, we're never going to stay above $1000 at this rate. People keep jizzing when the price goes past $1000 and go limp. Hold it together goddamn it
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:56:00
Ha, yeah, I do enjoy the insane volatility. Wild double digit swings up and down within a few weeks are really entertaining. I think once bitcoin stabilizes somewhat and goes flat for a while, people like me will lose interest and that's probably what will kill bitcoin off in the end: indifference. 
Then again, the world's governments could outright go hostile and start banning exchanges when they realize how subversive and powerful a networked, trustless money system based on cryptography can be.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:44:21
Great article. I was just thinking about bitcoin and gold, which occupy the same store-of-value space in my mind. 
I despise gold as an investment but super gungho about blockchain currencies and I couldn't figure out how to reconcile the two. Seeing how uncorrelated they are though made me feel much better.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:40:09
Doesn't correlation goes both ways? I mean, doesn't this mean you can hedge BTC with any other asset class?
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:40:19
I'm optimistic but I think it will take a long time before we see a 100x increase. 
We are still in the very early stages. Most people don't know about Bitcoin, fewer trust it to use, and fewer still believe in it to invest or use to store value.
The price of Bitcoin depends on people's perception ultimately.

 Can you imagine you come back 5 years from now and it's still bobbing around $8K? Fuck that, I'd rather bitcoin go to zero than to be boring.

Right, totally this.
There is a lot of illusions of grandeur going around. No one gives a shit or will ever give a shit about 0.1 BTC. Owning BTC doesn't magically make you important enough to be considered a target over celebrities or NBA stars or whatever.

@_date: 2017-01-25 03:27:19
Having BTC as the main unit is the problem, and it's what re-basing to bits solves. 
Calling BTC bits doesn't fix the expensive coin perception problem, the having to use prefixes problem, the unwieldy decimal representation problem, and so on. 
Regarding prefixed units getting eventually shortened, like with cents as you mentioned, why go through all that when you already have a nice short base unit to begin with? Instead of using different prefixes that forever reference a big, arbitrary BTC unit, you can keep the bits unit the same and just increment the number.
I would argue it's not an education or logical issue but rather a user experience and design issue. Bits is simpler and easier to use. If you want to use a more global perspective, most people don't use prefixes for money, even in metric using countries. There is a simple base unit that stands by itself, yen and not milliyen, and that's it.
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:32:34
Why do you like to see this? 
It's not a zero-sum game. The world doesn't have to burn for bitcoin to succeed.

@_date: 2017-01-22 19:40:56
Totally agree, people have been dealing with ambiguity in language for eons. Bits having synonyms is not an issue.
Bits being easier to say and use than prefixed units is the reason it should be, and will be, the standard for mass adoption.

You're right, it shouldn't. We have a handful of data points and we're filling in all sorts of upward sloping curves and shit around them. 
But the halving is as much about hyping people up as it is about anything fundamental about the supply. 
Price of bitcoin won't go up because of the halving; it'll go up because people expect other people to believe in the higher price to sell their BTC to later.
Nobody believed in Litecoin.

The risk with profit-taking is that you may miss your re-entry point if the price keeps mooning and the correction happens from $20k to $15k. 
Unless the 35% profit in fiat is pretty significant to you, cashing out at 10K is not necessarily regret-free.

All halvenings are priced in because that's public knowledge. When people go to the market to buy or sell, the halvenings are part of the common pool of facts known about BTC that people draw from to make their market decisions.
If halvenings aren't priced in, you're saying that people are willfully ignoring the fact that block rewards will go down and not thinking about that when they decide if they want to buy or sell their BTC.
The current price reflects the latest reality.

Gold's current physical uses as jewelry/industrial don't support its current price either. Like bitcoin, most of gold's value comes from people's speculative belief that it's worth something.

From having this bits/mBTC argument over and over again for years, it always comes down to what we think language is going to do. And language, especially English, defies neat logic as a rule.
Bits is going to win over people and general usage because it's more convenient, shorter, and friendlier sounding than mBTC.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:13:13
Bits is simpler to use and say than prefixes. We shouldn't care what a BTC is originally that we need constant references to it as a base unit.
You can take a look at how Twitch uses bits already and it's really natural. I only wish actual Bitcoin or whatever crypto replaces it could be used like that in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:50:39
Same for me. I prefer regret from losing money than regret from missing out on money
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:57:32
Why not just keep that 1 BTC? It doesn't sound like the extra $5000 will affect your life that much. 
You can still just ignore bitcoin news for a few years to lower your stress and come back later to a nice surprise, or $0, or whatever, but it's just 1 BTC, so no big deal either way. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:39:06

Take out loans to get more money to gamble with. When the bank stops loaning you money because you lose it all again, beg your family and friends for money because they would feel sorry for you and you can exploit their love. Gamble more.

that's a good point about bits not being ready yet. I think it'll be much easier when 1 bit = 1 cent than now.

Why is it obsolete? It still let's you generate your own private keys offline.

It's a trap! Future You will just instantly withdraw the 10X coins back in the future and you're left stuck here in the present with crappy $6k coins.

Agreed. Bitcoin is overpromised as the financial and technical savior for whatever corrupt system you can fill the blank with. The blockchain tech is great but the current implementation and user experience of Bitcoin aren't there yet. Right now, people care more about its price than its utility.

Cite please. Who are these people who are warning against paper wallets? I will read their arguments because your arguments so far are not convincing at all.

OP's announcement post sounds exactly like how a politician would try to tell people what to do.

That's weak, clumsy appeal to authority and instantly makes me doubt whatever you're saying. I can say I'm super smart and awesome and know a whole bunch of experts that say paper wallets are the best.
The article you linked to also has the same kind of language that sounds like it's talking to children and it has some sort of agenda rather than laying out well-balanced information to the user and letting them weigh the pros and cons.
