Well perhaps my finance knowledge is poor, but I thought that for a given asset exchange, such as Litecoin, only actual Litecoin trading can affect the price of Litecoin.   So someone is dumping Litecoin, ETH and all the rest at the same time.  No amount of Bitcoin trading is going to affect the Litecoin price or anything else, except perhaps as a market reaction which would have some kind of a delay.  In these moves there was no delay, it was as if an algorithmic trader such as a hedge fund dumped everything at the same time.
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:32:28
So India can go fuck itself I guess.

Well that explains why they go down at the same time in fiat terms; I still doesn't explain why the alts went down even worse than BTC, i.e. they also went down on the BTC trading charts not just the fiat charts.

The thing is, if even one sovereign nation adopts a cryptocurrency, then international banking regulations would require all banks and payment systems to recognize it.  I'm sure you can see that will lead to somewhere banks don't want to go.

I asked him a question from this forum about how this is possible with the many exchanges and worldwide open market and he answered:
 The largest exchange right now is BitMex. When they went down for server maintenance, crypto prices across exchange rallied during that period (5%+ in a few minutes) and then returned to normal once they were back online. This is because trading bots are all monitoring what’s happening on other exchanges to determine their trade strategies. Since all bots are doing this, the larger the exchange, the more it effects prices across all exchanges. So, it’s not so much that exchanges are working in concert, as it is, bots maintain this order. Furthermore, they will have similar strategies because retail investors reacting to news are mostly doing the same things on different exchanges and all exchanges have the same “conflict-of-interest” to move prices the opposite way to where the majority goes to generate more returns.

I believe it is mostly caused by algorithmic trading and the use of stops.  Stops get triggered and it cascades.  I study complex dynamic systems in my research and I agree that the behavior would be truly baffling if it depended upon hordes of folks staring at the price charts on their computer and doing manual trades.  My theory is that if there were no computers or bots making trades, and no stops were used, these "market-wide pumps" would never occur.

@_date: 2018-09-06 09:23:55
You forgot January already I guess.   Plus which plenty of altcoins now have "great news" but it has no impact on the prices.  In any case no matter whether the alts would *follow* a large Bitcoin move, it is impossible for them to do so *at the exact same instant* by this supposed influence pressure, or whatever.
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:25:41
I'm not excited and I'm not really trading, however I notice that Bitcoin has gone up and down between $5700 and $9900 since early February.  It is possible to make money with a swinging market like this, it isn't a downward spiral at all.
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:04:18
The reason is that international banking regs require all national sovereign currencies to be recognized by Visa and MasterCard, SWIFT etc.  So if a sovereign nation adopts a crypto as the official currency it will open the proverbial floodgates that currently prevent smooth connections between cryptos and other payment systems and banking.  
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:03:37

Well in my case it was worse than that.  I set a stop-loss at $8500 when BTC passed $9500 (those were the days) and it flash-crashed.  By the time the sell order was executed I had no BTC and the price was $10,300.  I bought back in and still made a few bucks but I had bought originally at $6300 so I missed tons of profit potential.  I should sue Coinbase.

Considering that 80% of cryptocurrency is owned by hedge funds and not actual people, I'd say "good luck."
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:50:19
I set a stop-loss when I was first trading in November and got seriously burned when the exchange had a flash-crash.  All my BTC sold for no reason because it was back up and climbing within a few minutes.  Furthermore, the sell order took hours to execute and could not be cancelled.  It was honestly a nightmare, \*never\* set a stop-loss.
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:30:46
Well, what I meant was the credit card company uses their own bid-ask spread like the one at Thomas Cook Travel for purchasing foreign cash.  They hide this in the fine print and then, because they don't add a specific fee for a foreign transaction, they can say their card has "no foreign transaction fees!"  The bad news is that they sell Euros for $1.25 and buy them for $1.10, just like when you get hard foreign cash at a currency exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:21:57
I'm sorry to irritate you, but it seemed like people are trying to highlight a feature of cryptocurrency, namely that there are no concerns at all about foreign exchange because they are international currencies.  Your posts seem to be really brushing this off, as if all means of spending in a foreign country (Visa cards or whatnot) have extremely minimal foreign exchange fees, but this is really not the case.  People have to be quite careful about precise what kind of card they use abroad, as some cards have 6% bid-ask spreads or even more, plus the prospect of 2-3% fees tacked on (American Express standard).   
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:20:04
I have two theories on that.  Keep in mind that 80% of cryptocurrency is already owned by hedge funds and not actual people.  Moreover, these theories are not incompatible, and so both could actually be happening at the same time.
1) The current price action is like the calm before the storm.  The major players have done all they can to depress the price temporarily so they can maximize profits during the upcoming bull run.
2) A significant proportion of crypto owners are actually using for illegal purposes, money laundering etc., and that group is now dumping because they see the writing on the wall.  Once the black money is replaced by good in a short while, all should be well in crypto-land.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:43:37
Yes I know it was my own fault, hence my original advice to \*never ever use a stop-loss\*.
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:18:06
"trend lines" don't cause resistance.  Why would millions of people change their collective behavior because of a trend line drawn on a chart?  It's absurd.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:14:08
It might work, you never know.  I wouldn't try it with taxi medallions, for example.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:52:29
I thought of taxi medallions the other day as being the perfect example of an asset on the downslope.  A wise person said that the price chart of basically every asset in history is shaped like a mountain.  The trick for investors is to figure out the timescale and when the absolute top is, and whether we are really on the upslope or the downslope.  With crypto, my \*guess\* is we are still on the upslope, although maybe not for a lot of altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:43:43
The thing is, this theory only works if you assume that there is an untapped horde who would buy FOMO the next time.  Some analysts/experts/self-appointed gurus believe that this won't happen again.  So, their theory is that at this point, cryptocurrency has already been tried by everyone in the entire world who would ever take any interest in it, so if we ditch to low values this time, the only idiots left will be us, and then no one.. repeat NO ONE... will come back to invest in cryptocurrency ever again.   Now, I am not really sure who is right.  Having spelled out the death scenario here in so many words makes it sound a bit silly, TBH.
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:43:53
Yeah so, since we got ATH almost 20 times the previous ATH, after the bear market that means the next ATH will be $400,000 -- do the math

I have several credit cards. The only one that waives foreign transaction fees has a $90 annual fee for the card.  There are no fee-free credit cards that waive foreign transaction fees.  If they say they do, they are covering the real fee with a bid-ask spread in the fine print.

Well I never bought any stocks, but in any case it is impossible to predict which company will actually last.  Anyone who had a diversified tech stock portfolio in 1999 is probably still in the hole, because only a few like FANG actually went up.  Most went to zero.  Maybe crypto will go the same way, so only the lucky few who picked the winners will make money.

Yes indeed, Bitcoin is just exactly like Beanie Babies, which pioneered no new technology, had no use at all, and accomplished exactly nothing.

I only invest in stuff that I believe (perhaps mistakenly) is going to go up and up and up, starting today.  Crypto investing has been a break-even for me overall, thanks to the bubble bursting and me being unable to recognize it until it hit bottom.

I believe that the earliest valuation of Bitcoin was a small fraction of a dollar.  Like, far less than one cent.  The few geeks who mined it and supported the network at that time would trade it among themselves in great numbers.   
 When it was first publicly traded it was something like 2 cents. I guess there has been more buying than selling since then because look at what happened. 
This is useful:

Another problem is that the free withdrawals from Quadriga to a Canadian bank can take up to 14 days to complete.. yikes that is really sluggish.  This treadmill is starting to seem awfully slow, requiring huge amounts of capital which I don't really have.  Well it was a nice idea but...

Yeah I looked into it and as I had feared, it is basically impossible for one person to do this.  The exchanges on both sides of the border do heavy KYC requiring verification of actual residency, and one person cannot reside in two countries at once generally.  I know I do not.  So, the only way to set up the money treadmill would be to rope in a close friend who lives in Canada and get him to do all the Canadian bank stuff.  I would buy the bitcoins on this side and send to him on Quadriga.  
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:08:01
Yes the bank card will work, but if the store is not set up specifically for "debit" purchases then the card will have to use the Visa network for the payment, which will then incur the same fees as if using a Visa credit card.

There is clearly some wild price action, on Coinbase it is below $6500 again after touching $6800 an hour ago.  I don't think this pump will hold water.  Everyone's sending their Bitcoin to Coinbase and selling it there.
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:36:27
Uh, I think you need to check your glasses because I'm seeing a spread of 108 CAD not 8 CAD.  And on the other hand the prices on Quadriga for both buying and selling are way out of whack.  Canadian BitCoins is offering to sell you BTC (this the BUY price) for $8730 meanwhile it will cost you $9040 on Quadriga.  That's quite an awesome difference.  Now mind you it looks like Quadriga is a real exchange while Canadian Bitcoins is some kind of OTC marketplace, they don't hold your coins for you at all.
Pricing this out, the Quadriga buy price is equal to a USD price of almost $6900, meanwhile on Coinbase it is below $6400.  Hmm, think I'm gonna do some reverse-arbitrage to northern climes holy shit!  Even the sell price on Quadriga is pretty awesome by comparison.  I think a money treadmill between my bank accounts and the Bitcoin exchanges is going to get set up tomorrow.

No, retail adoption will happen if merchants pass along the savings from no credit card fees to the customer.  When people find out that they can get 3% off everything for paying with Litecoin, soon that's what they will do.

Yeah when I went to verify my Quadriga account so I could use it with my CIBC account, they want me to go to a Post Office in person and bring documents which prove that I actually reside in Canada.  I do not, but that didn't stop me from setting up a CIBC bank account.  For that all I needed to do was establish a Canadian connection with my Canadian passport and a mailing address there.  I didn't need to \*prove I actually reside there.\*  This is incredibly strict.

There are apps/software that automatically process exchange data to do this so you don't have to do it manually.  They're getting to be pretty good at it, although I see your point.  Remember you only pay tax on the gains, so if you buy just enough Bitcoin and then immediately sell it to use it there is essentially no gain so nothing to report.  This is what I do.  I buy it on Coinbase and then send it to Purse where it is sold right away, to protect myself from the volatility.

It could and should be adopted because it would save everybody the transaction fees from the credit/debit payment network.  Where I live, I have to pull out wads of $20s to save a few bucks on a tank full of gas.  This is because the cash prices at local gas stations are usually 20 cents less per gallon.  A local music store offers an 8% discount on everything... including $5,000 cellos.... for paying with cash or check.  Check!  We should all be using Litecoin or something for these daily savings.

Lots of people are predicting $200K, and that's lowballing it.  Every time Bitcoin has gone through this big up and down market in the past, the next ATH has been about 11,000% of the previous low.  Most recently, I think the ATH was more than 12,000% of the previous low.  Given that the low was $3100, 11,000% of that is more than $340,000.  Every time this happened in the past, it has seemed just as unbelievable a prediction as it is right now.

Investing is when you \*buy\* something to get a share of its value, in the hopes that its future value is greater.  By definition shorting is never investing, it's always gambling, or whatever you want to call "trading for profit."  Investors fulfill the noble purpose of \*giving value\* to assets.  Bitcoin would never have attain a value greater than zero, were it not for \*investors\* who gave it value.  Trading for profit is not investing, nor does it fulfill any kind of noble purpose.  Without real investors (i.e. hodlers), cryptocurrency would never provide any profit to traders because it would be worthless.

A lot less, meaning, maybe half of credit card fees.  I once bought a $20,000 van with my AmEx card.  If I had used a debit card there would have "only" been a 1.5% fee which is still $300.  You can be double certain that the BTC fee for a $20,000 wallet transfer is nowhere near $300.  Probably less than $1.

Just because I'm feeling nice here is a link:
And a quote from that:
 
 Base layer enhancements
While layer two solutions and sidechains are taking off, the base layer is not being neglected. [Solutions like Segwit]( are now more common, and hot on its heels are [Schnorr Signatures]( and [Bulletproofs]( The combination of these technologies will increase the base layer throughput of Bitcoin by orders of magnitude over the next few years. I believe that by 2020 the implications of these changes will be hard to understate. By the time that the next block reward halving occurs, the Bitcoin network will be able to process more transactions more securely than ever before. With added layers of security and privacy being baked in, Bitcoin will be poised to disrupt global economics like never before.

Most Bitcoin arbitrage exists when the exchanges have problems with fiat interfacing.  I found that Bitcoin was worth 5% more in Canada a while ago and explored doing some arbitrage trading.  When I looked into it I discovered the reason: Canadian Bitcoin exchanges have major problems with Canadian banks.  It generally takes anywhere from 2 weeks to forever to get $CDN out of a Canadian bitcoin exchange.  Kind of kills the arbitrage treadmill when you can't get fiat out from one of the exchanges.

I don't think it is inaccurate at all.  Litecoin began as a hardfork of Bitcoin right?  And it uses the same protocols.  It's just that there is more of it and it transacts faster for daily commerce.  The analogy is excellent, not just good marketing.  It is actually true.

Yes, this is what I've been saying for a while now.  This is the road to adoption in the USA, in particular.  This is the answer to people who say "crypto has no real use in the USA because we have cards to pay with."   Businesses in the USA successfully sued the credit card companies in 2013 and won the right to pass these fees on to the customer.  In other countries like Canada they still cannot do so, so the fees remain "baked in" and it is harder to convince the consumer of the benefits of crypto payments.

Only this assumption, which is totally unwarranted, allows this proclamation that we are going to surpass the previous time taken to go from top to bottom.

He said he had $115 in his checking account and now $100 of it is missing.  I don't see how the OP losing $100 from his bank account is in any way caused by some BTC transaction error.  If he had simply said he found 1 BTC in his Coinbase account, then yeah, I would believe it is from a mistaken transaction.  But the real problem is he also said that $100 was withdrawn from his bank and shipped over to Coinbase.

That's crap.  If every turn someone calls, for years, is correct, that isn't luck, it's a successful method.  Avi Gilburt and his group successfully called the market top, and the huge bear market following.  They were a little off on the bottom, initially looking for $4500 when it was trading around $6500 in October.  Then they correctly called the bottom and suggested buying in January, looking for a huge wave up to $65,000 at least in the future.  They've also correctly called every turn in the SPX for the past 18 months, enabling all their followers to time the market successfully.  They urged selling off all stocks last August, predicting the 20% retracement that occurred.  Then they correctly called the turn there and suggested going all-in at the exact right time.  This stuff is not luck.

People keep searching for the perfect investment that always goes up, and which gives positive returns no matter the time of entry and exit.  For some years that was supposed to be real estate.... a lot of "normies" got ruined by that one, because unlike Bitcoin you can't invest $5,000 in real estate, you have to buy a whole house.   In 2017 some risk-takers began to think hey maybe crypto is "that perfect investment".  Turns out, it doesn't exist but that doesn't mean crypto is a bad investment long-term.  Real estate, on the other hand, definitely was if you bought in 2005.

You mean to say "you \*borrow\* 100 BTC at 4k..."  You don't buy Bitcoin to take a short position, you borrow it and sell it for fiat immediately.  This then obligates you to buy it back in the future in order to give back what you borrowed.  The short position makes you money if you can buy it for less in the future.  If it's more in the future you are \*rekt\*.  So with all the short positions on Bitcoin that have piled up since $19,000, more and more are going to have to get closed or get rekt which tends to accelerate this type of rally like gasoline on a bonfire.

It's a good interview but I think he is still too pessimistic.  He says:  The average American who uses Visa is not going to see an immediate use case for \[crypto\] other than speculation. 
I dispute this.  I know a number of small businesses that offer sizable discounts for spending in cash or check (yes, paper checks) instead of credit card, just to avoid the costs of the payment processors.  It would be child's play for all these businesses to set up on PayWithLitecoin and just take Litecoin directly and offer the same discount.  So, there is the possibility of an immediate use case in America that could save consumers 5% or greater on purchase price (one local store offers 8% discount for cash/check).  Amazon, for example, could easily do this.  I think that they will before the year is out.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:57:29
Fair enough, but since the average American thinks Bitcoin is a pile of dung, why would the average American suddenly believe that FaceCoin or whatever would be anything worthwhile?  At least Bitcoin has the advantages that it already existed for 10 years and is worth thousands of dollars per coin.  I think the only chance of convincing the average person of the utility of crypto is to teach them about the ones that are already here.  Making one up and then trying to convince people to use it is like doubling the burden -- it would go the way of the Confederate Dollar during the US civil war.

OK let me waste my time with a longer reply.  One store in town that offers 8% discount for cash/check is a musical instrument store.  The cheapest item they would sell would still be like well over $100, and sales of $5000 items are made on a weekly basis at least.  Taking a check for $5000 from someone for a nice cello is risky due to bouncing issues, and for a little store in a strip mall $5000 of cash is a huge robbery risk.  If I ran that store I would set up my Litecoin account somewhere (coinbase pro?  whatever) and just use a direct payment transfer process like snap the QR-code from a customer's mobile LTC wallet (Ten-X for example).  Then I could take Litecoin and give the discount for zero risk, and even if I cleared my account back to USD at the end of each business day those fees would be worth eliminating the risk and still a lot less than the payment processor fees.
To pick another example, every gas station in town charges 10 or 15 cents per gallon more to pay with anything but cash.  Credit, debit, doesn't matter.  Only cash gets the cheap gas.  Now, personally I don't want to drive around with enough spare Grants in my pocket to buy gas, so I eat the charges every damn time and pay $2.00 more for my fill.  If the gas station said, pay with Litecoin and get the cheap gas, you can be sure I would charge up my TenX wallet with enough LTC to do that when needed.

Well it's been flat at $3650 for hours now so $3000 is still a long way down.

Elliot Wave guys are looking for a huge pullback from $7,000 approximately.  Like, enough to scare the bulls away for a bit before the \*real\* bull market starts.

I call it at zero, because it definitely cannot go below that.  It's the ultra-safe bottom call.

Stuff like this would never happen without bots doing most of actual trading.  I wonder what the crypto market would look like if no bots were allowed on the exchanges and everyone just had to make trades the old-fashioned way.

I completely agree.  I am very computer literate but I am still scared to keep thousands of dollars worth of coins in a soft wallet on my thumb drive etc.  It's scary to me, maybe I'm just paranoid.  But also I don't want to shell out $100 for a hard wallet when I am already down in value from the crash, it's like throwing good money to store bad.

I don't know what opsec is, and I don't see what difference any of this makes, if someone could see this information about me.  The IRS... I tell them everything anyway.  There are a lot of tinfoil hat people on here, I see.

So many people... you mean like a fraction of a percent of the world's population?  What do you think happened the last 3 or 4 times it peaked and fell off a cliff?

Ethereum Classic was successfully attacked, not ETH.  Get the facts straight.

How could they do that?  I'm pretty easy to find in any event, my name is extremely unique and I don't try to hide it.  How could "they" put a keylogger onto my computer, do you think?

If you're truly using crypto then you're buying and selling it often, which is also fine.  As long as you buy more after you sell it.  It's \*selling out\* that's the problem.

Wow thanks for letting me know the future, I just wasted money having my palm read.

The problem with Amazon I think is that they need a solid relationship with the credit card companies to survive.  There's a Mexican saying that says "when you start moving furniture around, people stub their toes and get upset."  Amazon accepting crypto would definitely qualify as "moving furniture around."

I guess I must be retarded because I've never heard of a penny stock that did anything other than pump-and-dump.
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:56:08
I sense I'm being made fun of.  You don't think the market would make more sense if an actual human decided to execute every trade?
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:03:35
Yeah I'm waiting for it to be $1000, so forever then.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:46:17
Why don't you just give it all to me?  Better yet, pay me to take it off your hands, since it's so much worthless junk.
@_date: 2019-05-08 06:14:23
Well I sure hope you are right because that's pretty much what I did.  I've also got some recycled profits from the last ATH that I turned into shitcoin investments on a lark... but I didn't really get much profit because I bought in too late.  I only made 110% of my investment before the bubble burst...

I have confidence in the security of my account there.

There was a viral story in 2017 about a British man who had mined Bitcoin in early days as a hobby and then forgot about it.  When he finally woke up to what he had, he realized he had recently discarded the hard drive containing the wallet file during an ill-fated housecleaning effort.  Poor chap even scoured the local dump looking in vain for the hard drive.

This is one reason I would never deal with an exchange outside my home country.

What do you think is going to happen to my $150 of BTC?  Like I'm a millionaire?  They're going to come and kidnap me?  I'm not so paranoid.

Unfortunately there are a few types of accounts and services that they offer, which no other banks here do.  As a result I am one of their customers, if reluctantly.  My main bank won't do these services, so... Wells Fargo has gained competitive advantage through services offered.  Can you blame them for that?

You're right, it's the only true validation...
