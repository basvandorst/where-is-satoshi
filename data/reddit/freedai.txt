well, i dont want gold, i want bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:42:00
yep, but gold it hasn't got any real utility, i mean it's just banks stocking up a rare metal. 
Bitcoin will be by far imo more useful as store value, because it's getting more and more adopted againts the FUD, so yeah btc will stand for loooong time imo.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:20
you are late, the point it's now. if you try to mine bitcoin with an asic already bought, your energy cost will take your benefits, so yeah, late post. xd

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:47
you dont? well the coin was just 250$ each on summer, do you think they will not get researched by law by market manipulation? do you think that little amount of people know this before it happens? come on dude xD
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:23
manipulating market, taking out all my coins from any exchange and market from now, not worth having money on them, with hack attacks, manipulating and etc.

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:11:36
yes, it is. I will make a lawsuit soon when i get my holidays. I hope owners get arrested soon withdraws are getting blocked without any explanation and they are ignoring support emails.

??? bitcoin cash its centralized buddy, if people already know this was going to happen before the new adoption of gdax and coinbase its obviously market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:59
HAHAHAH wtf dude, was at that price like less than 45 minutes. It's not natural for the price to increase, in which kind of world do you live buddy?.
You are just defending a coin manipulated, centralized, and without ethical purposes. Because you probably invested there. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:36
??? ok you are blind probably. bcash has touch ath just right now, havent been 3k over a month, just in your dreams, but anyway i dont keep argue with a monkey with a keyboard.

he is a cocaine man, best bet it's your own ideas, not others, thats why most of people trading loose because copy other ideas :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:28
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:52
wtf?, you are defending bcash using as reason that btc its centralised, when bcash its 100% centralised? xD i think you dont know where you have invested or at least have low info about 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:33:47
just trade all your coins, and remove the account, and dont forget mention them on twitter and reddit shitting on their moms
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:05
Ver it's going to a miami future of cryptos and icos on january i think. I hate him anyway. I think on there new icos will release and he will talk about his trash coin..
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:04
roger ver will get a research because of many lawsuit incomings, market manipulation it's obvious
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:33
it will happen probably. but it's not related about regulation of cryptos, it's about market manipulation on the crypto market, they can't do that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:35:26
you are dumb, never invest again... we are gambling not about money only, most likely about future
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:38
prob not, expect it at 2k level
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:49
scam 100% market manipulation and fake market publicity from owners faking the name of bcash as real bitcoin when it's just an alt more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:49:15
