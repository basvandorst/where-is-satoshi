(1) Kraken specifies up front how long it will take.
(2) Customer complains before that time limit is up.
(3) Kraken delivers cash in the timeline specified.
The problem here does not lie in Kraken. If the customer wanted quicker delivery he should use a service that promises quicker delivery. Kraken apparently was honest and accurate.

Well, I cannot speak for anyone else, but I can tell you why *I* voted this story up.
I thought that it clearly made a point -- one which is important and is at least peripherally relevant to the topic of this subreddit. It made the point using sarcasm and ridicule, but sometimes that is the most appropriate medium for the message, much as you used profanity to convey the strength of your reaction.

Don't change the subject!
"Bitcoin will retain it's value against inflation better than most fiat currencies." is a perfectly good claim to make.
But you were responding to a conversation about "Keep your Bitcoins in an offline wallet instead of trusting an institution to store them for you." In THAT conversation, BenCoinake gave a fairly convincing example to illustrate that institutions actually have a fairly decent track record. I'm not sure what the long-term track record is for people of normal competence keeping cold storage (there's not enough data for ANYONE to answer this question), but I'd bet it's actually LESS reliable than institutions.

Very interesting. By the way, that wasn't there when I first posted the article. But, in a way, it makes it an even more interesting discussion.
The rationale behind the decision is that bitcoin falls into a grey area between being something you can invest in like a stock or commodity (can't invest if you're a reporter who covers it) and something that is just an ordinary part of life like owning a home (acceptable to invest in). Since it falls into the gray area, they err on the side of maximal journalistic integrity and ban the investment.
If they were claiming that it was an investment I might quibble, but I have to agree, that it DOES currently occupy that gray area. So I suppose I endorse this decision.

I'll tell you something about the security-by-obscurity protocol used for US military drones:
Iraqi insurgents figured out the protocol, intercepted video, and took military advantage of that fact.[1]
Look: I design security systems for a major US bank. I know this stuff. Not telling people your protocol is fine, but people are better at guessing this stuff than most people think. Using an approach that remains secure *even if* the attacker knows what you are doing is a lot safer. But if you don't believe me, then that's fine... keep your bitcoins safe however you like. When *others* are looking for advice on safely storing them I will suggest that they talk to someone like me, who will say EXACTLY what they are doing because they know it is secure even when known.

Not at all. [the second article]( explains that Vox has two categories of things: "stuff you invest in" (like stocks) and "stuff you use for daily life (like owning a home or fiat currency). The former is not allowed for journalists who cover that subject area, the latter is. They decided that Bitcoin falls into a gray area between the two, and thus they chose to maximize journalistic ethics by banning it for their reporters.

@_date: 2014-03-31 14:22:00
This is not a retroactive tax. These tax laws were already written long before Bitcoin was invented. The IRS is simply providing tax advice: they are explaining what they believe the existing tax laws mean with regard to Bitcoin. If you think they are wrong, then by all means, file differently and take it to court if the IRS objects. (The court will give significant deference to the IRS interpretations, but ultimately the laws as written have the final say.) If you don't think that the existing laws should be written the way they are, then complain to your representatives or run for office yourself.

Yes, the guidelines are clearly explained and adjudication is up to the editors. In this case, Timothy Lee went to his editor and GOT permission before buying bitcoins... that's why he isn't in trouble here. But the strongly "endorsing" tone of the article, combined with his investing significantly, caused the editor to reconsider his position.

I build security systems for banks and I assure you, that is NOT correct. Having enhanced levels of security for high risk transactions is a good practice and it enhances security. Large amounts transferred are one indicator of a high risk transaction.
That doesn't mean that MtGox is doing it right -- their lack of transparency suggests that perhaps they are not -- but it IS often wise to treat high value transactions differently.

They're usually smart enough to spell "stupid".
More seriously, the law says things about how citizens must pay taxes. The IRS is tasked with enforcing that. The only way to find out FOR CERTAIN what to do with something new and unusual (like bitcoin) is to get prosecuted for misfiling your taxes, go to court, and win or lose. The IRS is providing _some_ level of guidance, but they can't be 100% certain either.
If you don't like how the law works, go found your own country.

Probably not. The IRS tends to look at the information they have. If you're hoping that they won't notice your lies, then you're probably better off not telling them anything -- reporting it as long-term gains would be pretty odd (not so many people have been holding large amounts of bitcoin for &gt; 1 year.

I'm trying to understand the methodology here. It seems to me that you find the highest price during the year and the lowest price during the year, compare them, and call that the amount of the loss for the year. Logically you should use the exact same procedure to find the amount of the gains for the year. With this methodology, "annual loss" is a phrase meaning "amount of volatility".

That depends on how "smooth" the demand is. If there is a sudden rush to purchase it on the release day then it would certainly contribute to a boom and bust in the bitcoin price. If, however, the number of customers using bitcoin for purchases slowly increased and Sony were selling the bitcoins as they came in, then it would instead contribute to *stabilizing* the price.

One benefit of a cryptocurrency is that an unlimited amount can be carried around on a USB memory stick. That is not true, for example, of physical dollars.

I disagree, quite strongly. Banks offer several important services. They are probably better at keeping your money safe than you are -- a bank storing bitcoins would have them stored in ways that were well-protected against theft and also against loss. Sure, you could print out keys on paper and use Shamir secret sharing to scatter those keys across your house, that of a friend, and three different safe-deposit boxes throughout the country, but it's easier to use a bank. And the bank (if it's any good) will absorb the loss out of their own funds if a theft does occur.
Banks also usually offer to PAY you for holding your money. Of course, they can do this because they lend money out, but that doesn't prevent you from getting YOUR money out. (Except in rare circumstances when a bank goes bust or there is a run on the bank.)
Banks also help keep track of your expenditures and will send you a monthly statement and also allow online access to your funds and services like automated bill pay.
Now, not everyone will want these services. But they ARE useful to some. And I don't see why these useful services should be reserved only for those who carry balances in more traditional currencies: a bank account denominated in bitcoins would be an excellent banking product to offer.

"Taxation is theft" is complete BS.

Because they are worried about fraud. Lots of people buy expensive electronics so there's a well-known market there, but bitcoin is something new and untested. Also, if they ship expensive electronics they can try to prove it was delivered and contest the credit card chargeback, but there's no reasonable way to do this with bitcoin.

Very clever, to recognize that pattern can be used to identify an individual miner. Like the author of the post, I am perfectly happy knowing that Satoshi has earned a fortune from this. Unlike the author, I am hopeful that he is NOT quickly identified through a spend from this recognizable set of bitcoins. I prefer to imagine that Satoshi Nakamoto is living and working a normal job, still haunting cryptography boards in the evenings and on weekends, and occasionally checking the news to see how that bitcoin thing is progressing. I imagine that someday, many years from now, when she dies her husband will open that envelope she left in the safe-deposit-box and it will contain a hard drive and stack of papers labeled "Now that I am gone, please publish this for the world to read."

The issue is not whether it is the same pool (they could easily split it into 10 pools)). The issue is whether it is all controlled by one individual or group. The bitcoin protocol is specifically designed to be "fair" (preventing double spend, for instance) even if some of those processing the payments ("miners") are TRYING to break the system. But that only works as long as no one has too big a chunk of it (50% is a commonly mentioned threshold, although I'd use 33% as my own threshold of comfort). If someone DOES have this big a chunk, then we are relying on their honesty -- not that I doubt their honesty (and this move to limit their influence is a good sign), but that bitcoin is designed to avoid the NEED to rely on honesty.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:43:03
I completely disagree with you on this. As it happens, I trust most governments (including the US government) far more than I would trust most groups with an equal amount of power. But I am even more confident of a scheme where NO ONE has that level of power.
For you, something like bitcoin is FAR too elaborate and has too many privacy issues. You should instead use a simple e-money scheme which does not keep a blockchain (and therefore is much cheaper to run and scales much better to large numbers of transactions), but instead just keeps a balance for each user and performs transactions on receiving signed transfer requests. As long as such a system is run by BTC Guild, it appears that you would trust it, and such a system is technically superior, assuming that trust thing doesn't bother you. It bothers me, which is why I prefer bitcoin.

We learned whether or not anyone in the world is analyzing the blockchain for weaknesses like this. That's useful information, and we can "buy" it for the low, low cost of a few fractions of a bitcoin.
For instance, I might be considering building a tool to try to crack wallets holding large amounts of apparently-abandoned bitcoin by making certain assumptions about the tool using a weak RNG. I could leave $10 worth of bitcoin sitting in a clearly-easy-to-crack wallet -- if it does NOT disappear then I know I don't have any competition and my tool might be the only one working on the problem. If it disappears within 2 days then I know that someone else is already running such a tool and perhaps it's not worth my time to try it.

If the government decides, for whatever reason, to charge a 10% tax on any bitcoins you own, then you have to pay them or go to jail.

After all, hiding pieces of paper is something certain people are VERY, VERY good at: with thousands of years of experience, yet that gets caught.

No, "ING Direct, USA" was purchased by Capital One and is now named "Capital One 360". The various insurance businesses and the rest of ING's worldwide banking system were not part of that transaction.

A provably fair version of poker may not be impossible, but it's certainly well beyond MY ability. Proving that the cards were shuffled fairly is trivial but not significant. Proving that all of the other players are human and that none of them had access to information like the contents of your hand... I suspect these things are nearly impossible.

Which is more likely? That Coinbase gets "owned" or that gooftheman does? I think moving them to Coinbase is a wide idea.
I also recommend if this is a lot of money for you that you should diversify. Change some to a different currency and invest in stocks or something. This is not because of anything wrong with Bitcoin (I have investments in Bitcoin and I use it for some purchases and donations), but diversifying your investments is a good idea for anyone, always.

No, I wasn't clear enough. The law itself defines ROUGHLY what a money transfer service is, and it says that FinCEN will provide the more detailed definition. Legislators do this on purpose: their job is to reach agreement on what the law should be; figuring out whether it applies to some strange cryptocurrency not even contemplated when the law was written is best left to the career professionals who work in FinCEN. So they are tasked (by the legislation) with refining the definitions, not just with issuing licenses.

Most banks use a different account number for a checking account you may have with them and a checking account you may have. But a few (mostly very small credit unions) use the same account number for both. Whenever you sign up for ACH transfers (which Coinbase has) you specify whether the account is a checking or savings account. When I go to add an account on coinbase it asks whether it is a "Checking", "Savings", or "Business Checking" account. You must have selected "Savings" -- you can probably add your checking account as a SECOND account.

There is existing law that says something like this: "Money transferal services must adhere to the following regulations: &lt;...&gt;. A money transferal service is defined to be a service for sending money. FinCEN will issue regulations defining it more precisely."
In other words, the law was made long ago by the legislature (both houses) and the president. But the law specified that a certain administrative department would provide extra specification and details to the legislation. This is the normal way that laws operate.

You can run this thing called a bitcoin wallet on your local computer and keep the money there. If you mess up or your disk crashes you'll probably lose all your bitcoins with no way to ever recover that. Or you could let Mt. Gox keep the bitcoins for you: they're not likely to lose the data. If you leave it with Mt. Gox then in theory they might decide to steal the money: they've never done anything like that before, and they probably wouldn't get away with it, but some people are just REALLY suspicious and would rather hold it themselves.

No, you don't the burden of proof. If the state wants to prosecute him for theft, then they have the burden of proof and his word vs your word is probably not enough. But if you were to sue him as a civil matter (not a criminal one) to get your money back then the case would be decided on the "predominance of the evidence" -- basically, whoever was more credible to the judge or jury. Of course, that only helps if you know who he is so you can take him to court.

It's slightly off topic, but market cap is the wrong criterion to use for this question. Ask what problems will arise when the rate of transactions in the bitcoin network is 1000x what it is today. Remember, the value of bitcoin is (supposed to be) as a medium of exchange, not a vehicle for speculators.

Can you give me any references to the trustless poker protocols?
Obviously there are things like [BitZino]( who prove that the shuffle was fair -- that's fairly easy. But that's not the form of cheating that most players are worried about. With poker, you need to worry about (1) [bots masquerading as humans]( (since the best poker-playing bots are [better than humans]( or the site itself cheating by allowing favored players to see other players' hands.
I'd be very interested to see any technique for protecting against either of these in a provably secure fashion. The first, I think, is impossible while the second might be achievable but. . . .  [mcherm begins thinking]
Okay, depends on the Poker game. For 5-card stud (just deal the cards, bet, then lay 'em down) I think I can do it. For simplicity, say there are 3 players. The "dealer", and each of players "A", "B", and "C" generate random numbers, and some sort of elaborate zero-knowledge proof allows A to see positions 1-5, B to see positions 6-10, C to see 11-15, and D (dealer) to see none of them. Then we need another zero-knowledge proof system to verify that no two players have the same card. If any do, then we start the whole thing over again. Once we get a deal where no two players had the same card, then we can play. Collusion could be prevented by never letting the players know who they're competing against (but that's a loss, because it removes all strategy based on learning an opponent's style over time and exploiting it). Games with face-up cards are easy to handle (make them chosen and known to all players), but poker variants with multiple rounds of face-down cards are still beyond me.

No, actually I have title to your house. I asked my brother, the judge. I mean, he's not one of those evil GOVERNMENT judges, but I think he's a pretty good judge.
&lt;end sarcastic arguments&gt;
Look... you say that "taxation is theft", but this statement is dependent on certain notions of ownership, and those are tied up with the government. For instance, the government says that you own your house unless you fail to pay the property tax on it and it gets seized through a legal process, then you don't own it any more. They say that you own your paycheck until they garnish it for failure to pay income taxes, then you don't own it any more. If you accept the government's rules on ownership, then you have rightfully forfeited those tax payments.
But perhaps you don't accept the government's rules for ownership. Perhaps you have your own set of rules. You read some Ayn Rand and decided that you'll start by assigning anything owned by a white man 4 generations ago as belonging to that person. Then ownership gets transferred via any contracts agreed to by both parties. If the parties disagree about the meaning of the contract then I'm not sure how you resolve that. Are there limits to these contracts? Do your rules enforce indentured servitude or slavery contracts? How about implied contracts: like anyone taking advantage of a road by driving on it is implied to have agreed to pay the toll when they get off. Or anyone living in the country under the protection of its army and police is implied to have agreed to pay its taxes?
At any rate, accepting the government's rules sort of makes sense: most of the people accept it (you can tell, because there hasn't been a revolution or even major uprisings and protests). But accepting YOUR rules of ownership... what's so special about THOSE? How about MY rules of ownership, which might be as absurd as my previous postings ("in my rules, I get your house and your computer")? I can see a reason why the government's definitions of "ownership" might hold a privileged position, but the only reason to accept yours over mine is that yours is somehow "right" (and neither mine nor the government's is). And if we're going there then this has become essentially a religious argument, and I'm bowing out.

The same procedure is recommended for making really large payments in USD also... like buying a house.
In fact, this has nothing to do with bitcoins and everything to do with making an exchange with an anonymous stranger.

I work for (but cannot speak for) a major US payments company. I am in no way authorized (or qualified) to make decisions about directions and products, but I CAN make suggestions. If anyone is seriously interested in setting up a real-world system to do this, please contact me.

The goal wasn't to avoid losses while maximizing gains, the goal was to maximize his (expected) cash in the end.
Suppose I bet you 1BTC that the dollar would rise to $5/BTC (from its current price of ~$1000/BTC) in a year. Since you are certain the dollar won't rise so much, what do you do?
Well, you COULD sell 1BTC (for dollars). Then if I'm right, you can buy 200BTC making a profit of 198 BTC after paying me off, while if you're right you won't lose anything since I'll pay off the debt and you'll end up with 0.02BTC more than you started with.
But since you're SURE BTC won't fall that much, you do even BETTER by keeping your BTC. Then when you win you'll get 1BTC instead.

You ask, "What can I do?". One option is that you can continue to wait and pester MtGox until they do something about it. As you note, this may take a long time. Another option is that you can write it off and walk away. Might as well bother MtGox. Finally, you can sue MtGox. That will take far more money than you can hope to recover and would, if successful, take even longer. So you're best off just pestering MtGox unless they tell you they're not going to do anything for you.

No, no: never trusting the clients is a whole different problem. That's fairly easy to do.
The HARD thing is to satisfy users who don't trust the server. They need to be able to verify after the fact (at least in some probabilistic fashion) that the server didn't cheat. Typically that means even the SERVER can't know who has what cards.

I guess we'll just have to disagree here. I think that the risk that an individual (especially an individual who is not an expert on security issues) will make an error and allow a vulnerability to be exploited is much greater than the risk that a large and well-respected institution like Coinbase will be exploited, despite the fact that the institution is a more tempting target. I would still recommend that any novice use such a service.

I am pleased that "Satoshi" (whoever she is) has, at least potentially, earned a fortune for the same reason I am pleased when any startup founder makes millions. In this case, the ONLY reason that Satoshi's bit patterns would be worth millions would be because people around the world valued the thing she invented. That sounds like well-earned value to me.

That's not what "living will" means, but it is VERY IMPORTANT advice.
Hey, EVERYONE who owns some bitcoins. If you had a stroke and died tomorrow, would your friends and family be able to use your bitcoins, or would they be lost forever? Write a letter with instructions, seal it, and give to someone trustworthy to deliver only in case of your death. Because it would be a shame if the keys were lost and those bitcoins became unspendable instead of going to your loved ones.
