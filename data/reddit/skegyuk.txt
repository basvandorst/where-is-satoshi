As a buyer you are OK - it is if you are a broker they will close the account. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:22:24
Does the above mean you are unable to take a bank transfer?
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:11:25
Ha! Good to see you on here mate!

It is true they (the banks) are clamping down, and was recently told by someone in back office that there has been a real push over the last 2 months. 
It is not uncommon for Barclays etc to deliberately delay payments to BTC trading bank accounts.

Yes can't remember the last time I had one come in instant!

It's not easy I have been doing it for about a year and finding a banking partner is impossible

Good lad.

Have you checked the address on Blockchain.info to check the up to date balance?

Yes very true - I have a feeling with how easy BTC can be manipulated and its volatility a lot of the funds wont be going "big" anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:21:16
If you are willing to HODL for the long term then you could just buy now. There may never be that dip and it moons!

They do make a valid point, but I would not be too worried. A motivated trader can quite easily short BTC on margin with not having to actually sell the coin - this just makes it a bit easier.

The $ is just to check the card is valid, its a pre-auth and they never actually take the money out.
