then another bird says, "I bought bitcoins in 2019"
and immediately gets crapped on by yet another bird.
Pyramid schemes always work out great for early adopters.

Here's what I don't get: how will people verifying transactions get paid if the system doesn't reward them with new bitcoins anymore?
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:07:38
yeah but as long as there's even one tiny fraction of one bitcoin in circulation, it can be divided up as many times as necessary. The value of bitcoin isn't tied to the supply.

Yeah well, nobody's perfect.

I am not convinced that wealth inequality is a bad thing.
If everyone made the exact same then there would be no incentive to go to college or achieve more professionally.
If what you mean is not really "wealth inequality" but something which you can demonstrate is actually bad then you need a new term for it, because this one sucks.

Yes. They do. Systems such as colleges entrench wealth inequality between high school dropouts and college grads. Why is that inequality bad?
What I think has been happening with this whole "weath inequality" thing is that Marxists in academia have gotten their heads stuck so far up their own butts they can't think critically about anything due to a complete lack of outside stimuli. Total monopoly will do that. They've replaced critical thinking with "critical theory." Of course everybody's a Marxist so of course everybody thinks wealth inequality is bad. But trying to explain why they think wealth inequality is bad to a non-Marxist or even an anti-Marxist may be beyond their capacity.

So, all bitcoin transactions cost network fees? OK, won't those make bitcoin impractical for small purchases?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:49:52
Assumption 2 is false. Bitcoin won't simply increase in value over time, because technology marches on, and the new hotness improved cryptocurrency (whatever it is) will replace Bitcoin soon, and will eventually get replaced in turn. There is no such thing as a profitable, low-risk investment you don't need to watch.

They gave a nobel prize to Yasser Arafat for crying out loud. They have been just giving those things out like free candy. Surely this guy isn't the worst offender.

Please recognize that I am not an advocate for any particular crypto over another except that I think Bitcoin itself has major problems which I think future cryptos can probably solve. Side-chaining seems like putting a band-aid on a broken arm. We end up having to trust the service providers of the side-chain (and possibly multiple ones) in addition to everybody involved in our access to our wallets and at some point we're just trusting too many people, groups and bodies of code to gain a real advantage in exchange for all the added complexity.

Fiat replaced 1. within a decade and 2. by Buttcoin?
LOL, no.
Maybe in 50 years, by a more advanced crypto. Maybe.

Are there any models to predict how many of the total Bitcoins that have been mined are lost, and at what rate we are likely to lose them?
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:11:36
Gold usually returns to the economy when it's rediscovered.
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:44:13
The question wasn't whether Bitcoins are scarce or not, but how scarce, and about the rate at which they disappear.

The above is a testament to how much reddit's search sucks, because I did search for this.
