Well considering only about 1/3rd of riders tip and if I get no tips I make less than minimum wage I'm fine with being spammy.
If you actually thought that when you got in I would wager that you are one of those riders that dont tip! Nothing wrong with displaying this as an alternative to tipping through the app.

No tips yet but I have had some passengers ask me about crypto so its a win in my book

I figured people with shitcoin might tip more just to dump their bags lmao

Cash app, for example for bitcoin. Or use trust wallet. Or free wallet. Most apps have qr scanner now.

I just used trust wallet, it does them all at once
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:45:08
I used trust wallet to make the actual wallets because it is all like one app and easy to make a bunch at once.
Then I took the wallet addresses and plugged them into a QR code wallet generator online

Please be careful spreading things like this. This type of comment you made goes against adoption.
It is completely normal to tip service workers. This is not asking for tips anymore than a waitress accepting tips from a credit card company. This is simply providing another form of payment option. 
Is it asking for tips or somehow begging to offer more forms of payment that may be preferable to the customer? 
Many people have crypto that they would prefer not to have to convert to USD before being able to use that for a tip.
Read the other comments here also. I said that more often this is used as a conversation starter. Pamphlets would be extremely weird dude think about that.
Also you are suggesting that I PAY THE CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD NORMALLY TIP ME. If I gave them all a dollar I would make nothing literally after gas and maintenance. 
Honestly just delete your comment you sound ridiculous.

The masking tape is still holding strong. This masking tape is not ordinary masking tape. It is as strong as five (5) normal pieces of masking tape.

I coded it man.

Lmao I came to the right place then

It is trading view alert. Sends emails to the bot. Bot executes orders through API. This indicator only does orders at the end of each one minute candle.

Hey man, sorry you feel this way. Sounds like you've got it pretty well figured out.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:15:26
You are correct about compound interest growth at 2%. The bot does what it does man I'm just broke af rn so I cant feed it much. 2% compounding .01 NYC still takes awhile. 
Have a good day man.

I haven't fully decided.  I use my pinescript I coded and the python bot takes alert emails. Really I could sell them separately if needed. I think it is worth .1 BTC or so.

This is true. This isnt for someone that doesnt know what they are doing.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:01:20
Ok man. It is possible. Maybe you arent doing it right. Sorry
