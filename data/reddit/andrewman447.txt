@_date: 2017-12-24 22:53:24
Just buy a little bit of everything. Use a website like changelly to exchange it if you want :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:55:10
Meanwhile my ethereum mine is powered by green energy :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:32:17
we need supersegwit tbh

You are a bold one.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:59:08
He’s kidding.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:20:40
I don’t think the idea of is to shit on every other crypto possible.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:15:25
The price is so volatile which makes people not want to buy anything with BTC. Why buy a cup of coffee at starbucks for a few bucks to find the next day it’s worth 5 dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:39:23
The app is fine, it’s just they’re a shit company.

So much for being 17 running an ether mine
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:45:17
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:34:29
i think it's a security concern, I know coinbase is already pretty generous by not requiring you to fill out anything personal, and that's just kinda drawing the line, I wouldn't ever see them accepting prepaid cards.
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:16:14
ah I see, thank you! :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:47:21
if you use a credit/debit card it's nearly instant

I can't take this seriously with all of the emojis and "Incest a lot of money"
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:32:52
118 excuse meeee
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:15:35
why is this?
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:45:07
I get what you're saying it's just i'm new to all of this and it spooked me haha

STAY FUCKING CALM
wait now it's at 16
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:51:12
This is really nice to know, could they legally take it if they wanted to? Is there some kind of loophole?
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:03:53
Bamboozled again!
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:45:33
;-; i want to buy more bitcoin now but i don't have the money to do so
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:04:25
ouuchhhh you must think about that every day
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:19:00
5 months from now the price could be a lot higher then it is now, is it worth spending the same amount for less Bitcoin by then?
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:07:47
i use coinbase for buying and if needed I can store on a more secure wallet. Some people might have mixed opinions on this though.
@_date: 2017-02-24 08:39:06
oh my god how long have you had all of that?
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:45:21
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:54:29
sounds kinky
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:49:51
oh my god is it going to drop i want to buy now because i'm freaking out but i feel it's too late
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:52:21
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:40:20
just spent 2.50 there last night to round to the nearest decimal lol
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:25:12
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:09:15
that was a rollercoaster of emotions lmao. at first I thought it said 969 and i'm like HOLY SHIT and then I saw .969 and i'm like "that's an impressive start" and then i saw this, you're killing me man haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:22:24
jesus christ how much could you get with $200 7 years ago?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:26:10
Wow, congrats man. That's amazing :) I hope you have that offline in a Trezor wallet or something haha. Spreading it out is safest though.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:36:36
uhhh so if i’m right (sorry i just hosted a party last night and i’m pretty fucked) you have 8.8 million dollars in bitcoin....
holy fuck man

This post is bringing me back to the good old days
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:32:22
uhm what
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:00:03
Sorry I meant like a physical thing I can place in my house, so I can just walk by and see the price. Thought it would be a cool thing to have!
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:36:54
Yeah I was just about to say why not both and get orange!!
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:14:09
Whoa a tesla in texas that’s also surprising
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:13:57
Just considering the fact that the state of texas hates tesla and their factory stores
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:24:38
but futures could go against the success of bitcoin, this doesn’t
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:39:02
okay cool. got all of my bitcoin off of coinbase onto my trezor but haven’t gotten around to my ethereum on it yet.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:56:44
game changer
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:50:33
what about ETH?
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:12:35
No I didn’t say I ever trust Coinbase, why the hell do you think I took all of my Bitcoin out of it? I just haven’t got to putting my ETH on my Trezor because it works a bit differently.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:26:07
Where can I buy criminals?????
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:34:39
Ummmm. like i said I use both my card and my bank account and it works fine, no verification needed, im 17 so i probably can’t technically own an account so trust me, i didn’t need to verify anything haha. Maybe linking your bank account is verification. I get all of my BTC from Coinbase, no issues.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:47:34
What? I haven’t even given them any ID of mine before, and i’ve been using it for months...
