I don't see it as overly optimistic at all. A couple of weeks ago, I'd have written off all of the fiat and BTC money stored there as lost. But it seems like several steady steps are being taken to get things back on track, with the BTC withdrawals becoming available a couple of days ago. 
And anyway, what would be wrong with being optimistic in this situation? A lot of people have been waiting for updates on the status of their money for a long time; little progressions such as these are very positive.

Having not even mentioned anything about how I would be using the acquired bitcoins, I'm not entirely sure how you extrapolated that. All I said is that I didn't want to lose the entire value of the money I sent, and now suddenly I'm some sort of day trader. 
I see posts like these all the time when I check reddit, and I fully don't understand why you're here. So far, despite having no knowledge of my financial situation or my intended usage of BTC, you've more or less told me that I've invested too much money and that I'm not using BTC properly. If you just want to tell people they're "not doing bitcoin right", go and set up a blog, or just stand screaming it at people and/or pigeons in the street.

Having lurked around for so long before investing, I'd seen some stories from those who had invested more than they could afford to lose. 800GBP then was something that I *could* afford to lose, but I certainly didn't *want* to lose it.

Couldn't agree more, it was just hard to think all that objectively when considering my own situation and reading about past exchanges that had closed and lost people a lot of money; these things just made me a little more wary of BTC at the time. I am by no means tying Bitcoin-24 to Bitcoin in general though :] 
And thank you; good to see the ratio of helpful/non-helpful posts on here is still healthy!

I was disappointed with this update, especially since it's been a while since the last one. Seems like things are at a complete standstill with the Polish bank account :/

Hmm, that hasn't worked for me, but thanks for the advice anyway! 
I'm just (non-sadistically) glad others like yourself are having a bit of a shaky time with it. I'll just put it down to a general website issue for now and try again tomorrow.

Sorry to hear it, lets hope we get an update soon!

Cheers, it's all good advice. If I ever see my money back, I'll definitely diversify it a little. :]
