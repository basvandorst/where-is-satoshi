Bought BTC to buy Lsd for the first time in May this year, it's mad seeing how much more money I would have had if I just held lmao

Although it was solved relatively quickly, it's always cool seeing someone create a puzzle based on Bitcoin :)

My guess is this is one of the "consolation prizes" OP mentioned...

Personally, I think if OP wanted to include clues giving them all at the beginning would have been much better, maybe in the form of a riddle or something. Having to constantly check for clues which could give someone else an advantage get's a little tiring and kind of defeats the fact that you should be able to solve this without any clues (as OP sells it as a poster)

N00b here, how do I know if I'm sending too or from a segwit address? Thanks

The only alt I don't regret buying is neo, the others including eth and monero haven't really done much for me. May start holding a larger percentages in btc from now on lol

It's funny knowing I spent $400 on 10 tabs lol

Took the opportunity to send my coins over to a segwit wallet before the fees hit 30+ dollars again
