I have a hard time seeing how bitcoin will actually be that empowering for the people. Think about it - the richer you are now, the more bitcoin you can buy/the more computer power you can invest in to mine BTC. And supposedly the price of bitcoin will continue to increase superlinearly.
With that said, if any big player or financial institution invests now (and they definitely are investing) they will become massively rich if BTC ever moons. Take Grayscale bank, for example, which is buying upwards of 20% of every newly mined bitcoin. 
On an average salary, buying a full bitcoin today is tough for most people and if the price increases as it's supposed to, it will be harder and harder for the little guy to get a piece of the pie. Not only that but "banks" in a sense will still exist: think Coinbase, Binance, etc. 
Long story short, I don't think bitcoin is going to destroy the government and liberate the masses. Governments will probably just adopt the tech/integrate it with existing structures and go on ruling the world.
I'm also a little conspiracy minded about these intermittent drops in price. What if it's a ploy to shake out all the people who need the cash (the average Joe that needs to pay their bills). Price drop. Joe tries to scavenge profits. Joe is scared of reinvesting. Big guys have more tolerance for market swings and can hoard more BTC. Price launches up and only the most devout hodlers benefit.
Idk, to me the bitcoin world seems to becoming more and more of a big-guy environment.
