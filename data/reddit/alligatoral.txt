@_date: 2014-04-08 01:51:57
How does this in any way sound like the paperwallet problem?  He has not imported a paperwallet, he says so himself in the description.  He has all the addresses he has ever created without deleting anything.  He has a public key present in multibit that has no private key associated to it.  When he exports his ~500 address private keys it exports ~500 - 1.

Excellent article.  It's just such a complex topic, the inputs and outputs terminology might still trip people up but this is without a doubt a good resource for someone who really wants to learn.   The key here is "wants" to learn.  Well done.

First off I think everyone needs to take a deep breath.  I am not willing to write off multibit and would like to help in any way I can.  I am not a coder but would be happy to write up any documentation that clearly identifies the issue and how to reproduce it if possible.  I could also write up any mitigation procedure that clearly shows how this can best be avoided.  Writing software ain't easy, and open source is about helping each other out.  Let me know.

Long time multibit user here.  I even donated to you because I appreciate the work you do.  I have never experienced this problem but I would like to know how many others have experienced this that you are aware of.  There are a few posts talking about others experiencing this but nothing to back it up.  What conditions can reproduce this problem so as to document any mitigation procedures.  I understand you guys are busy but this type of blowup can do irreparable damage to your brand.  Nobody expects flawless software but serious issues need to be fully addressed before they take on a life of their own.  Good luck.

What I am saying is close that wallet.  Create a new one in another folder somewhere.  Copy your whole existing folder to a usb stick if it makes you feel safer, you can bring it back later.  Create a new wallet and create another 500 addresses to see if you can recreate the 500 -1 problem with your copy of multibit.

This is a very good analysis from what I can see.  I am also positive about the mint chip which to me is something totally different than bitcoin and fills a national need.   I fear that the banks will be heavily involved and take an unreasonable cut anyway.  If that is the case there will be no advantage to paying a cut to Royal Bank or TD for every purchase as opposed to VISA or Mastercard.  If it truly is a frictionless payment method within Canadian borders it will find a use and will compliment Bitcoin and maybe even remove some of the ingrained fears people have about digital currency overall.
Edit: I would add that it could make purchasing bitcoin a heck of a lot easier.

I read that thread before.  With that problem you import a paperwallet with 100 BTC (for example) into multibit, spend two coins and then delete the multibit wallet thinking you still have 98 on your paperwallet.   When in fact what you have done is send 98 coins of change to the address generated by multibit.  As soon as you imported your paperwallet you now have two public/private key pairs in the multibit wallet (the paperwallet address and the first pub/priv key generated by multibit in the first place).   Then when you delete your multibit wallet you are in effect deleting the only address and private key that holds the 98 coins.  Your paperwallet key is empty.  So that seems quite different to me than what he is explaining here.

Ideally bitcoin would be only part of your entire investment portfolio.  Say you allocated 10% of your portfolio in bitcoin, when your target allocation dips below 10% you buy more, when it soars above you sell to come back to 10%.  It takes the emotion out of investing as your buy and sell triggers are based on math, not your gut.  This forces you to buy low and sell high.

Gave Libertybit a test drive today.  I have to say I am very impressed by the speed of my deposit.  I work downtown so I just filled the form on the website and then skipped over to CIBC and did a cash deposit.   Within less then two hours my cash was in my account.  Volume is pretty light on the site but I think this is a serious challenger to Virtex and overall is a better experience.  The fee is cheaper but you have to watch the prices as it can easily trade 3 or 4 dollars more per bitcoin. Since it was only to try it out I put in a $100 and bought right away.  I transferred it out and into my own wallet not long after that.   I think we are lucky in Canada to have two solid options between virtex and libertybit.  I will definitely be  using lb for future purchases.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:16:24
I don't understand what he is saying with one-time use.  If I import a brain wallet into Multibit with 1BTC and send .5 BTC from it, my fee will still be .0001 not .5
I think I am missing something here.  Brainwallets simply use a memorable phrase as a seed for your private key.  Maybe I am just too tired and should go to bed.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:30:42
I think I implied much more then just handing cash over.  Banks scrutinize transactions, now you are the only one that scrutinizes.  Also the receiver could be on the other side of the planet and you are sending funds electronically, try doing that without a bank or money transmitter without stuffing cash into an envelope and praying it gets there.  I didn't explicitly state the global nature but holding bitcoin is like being your own bank in that instance.  My definition may be narrow but you could probably write a book on this.  Feel free to add what you feel is important as you didn't really state what I missed, just that I did.

There is huge difference between stocks and Bitcoin.  The main difference is that with stocks you have a way to measure its true valuation.  Stock splits don't adjust the P/E ratio, that and many other ratios are some of the determining factors in making sound investment decisions.  Anybody looking at a price of a stock and making an investment decision on that alone is an idiot and will get taken to the cleaners. 
Bitcoin on the other hand has no straightforward way to valuate it.  It's an awesome protocol with so much promise and if it were a stock it would have a very high P/E because those gains are not yet realized.  I am not saying it is overvalued at all, we all believe in it and its potential.  However if anyone is dumb enough to make an investment decision based on mbtc looking cheaper then btc then I will be more then happy to retire on their ignorance.  As a unit of currency mbtc is much easier to use though.  However if this plan to herd the lemmings into buying magical mbtc because they look cheap even they will become worth more then "dollar" units.  Anyway its all good, if mbtc makes eveyone happy then by all means, fill your boots.

Question for QT users.  I have only used the Lightcoin version a few times but I assume it works the same way.  Seems to me that QT is most useful if you use your wallet everyday and the chain stays synched.  I downloaded the whole litecoin chain which is much smaller and then didn't open it for a few weeks.  it took quite a while to synch up.  I don't see how QT would be a good choice for someone who doesn't fire up the app often.  Serious question, not bashing at all, I realize there are benefits to the network to have more people using it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:07:25
You can do the BIP6 method posted at bitaddress.org on the Wallet Details tab. (instead of 1 roll 99 times use 9 dice 11 times, always record your numbers from left to right for example) 
Copy/Paste from their page;
"An important part of creating a Bitcoin wallet is ensuring the random numbers used to create the wallet are truly random. Physical randomness is better than computer generated pseudo-randomness. The easiest way to generate physical randomness is with dice. To create a Bitcoin private key you only need one six sided die which you roll 99 times. Stopping each time to record the value of the die. When recording the values follow these rules: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=0. By doing this you are recording the big random number, your private key, in B6 or base 6 format. You can then enter the 99 character base 6 private key into the text field above and click View Details. You will then see the Bitcoin address associated with your private key. You should also make note of your private key in WIF format since it is more widely used."
or 
You can use the diceware method

What a fantastic article! I know there are many people that hope to profit from bitcoin but to me the exciting part about bitcoin and crypto currencies in general is how it will play out in the months and years ahead.  When I first starting using the internet the masses had no idea what it was.  Their eyes would gloss over when explaining it but today they have panic attacks when they lose access for a half hour.  Bitcoin has that feel for me right now of the early internet days.  Value and speculation aside the excitement around this currency is "the spice of life" for me.  I am thankful for the genius Satoshi for conceptualizing the idea and for the geniuses that implemented it.   You've done a great thing.

Libertybits problems seem to have to do with using payment methods that are susceptible to fraud, not with their .5% fee.

Even if bitcoin takes off (whatever that means, $1k? 10k? 1MM?) it will not be the only thing in the world that has value.  I think today if someone were to put a couple of thousand bucks into bitcoin that represents very low downside ($0) and very high upside ($?).  It's called diversification.  But I don't believe even a best case scenario means you will be rummaging dumpsters if you didn't buy bitcoin.  People will adjust to new realities because  humanities strength is its ability to adapt.

I use CAVirtex too because there really isn't much other choice.  Please people do not leave BTC or Cash in an account with any website.  Just seems like good sense.  These people have not earned anyone's trust, so I am not sure why so many people trust any of these sites.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:02:51
I use bitaddress.org too.  But to tell you the truth, how can I really trust them.  There is a bit of a leap of faith.  Now some will say I can read the code because it is open source but I am not a coder and I would need to trust someone to do that for me.  Also, I downloaded the zip file with the code but they don't sign that file.  Can I really trust it?  (I couldn't 100% trust their signature even if they did). The only thing you can trust is that many people have used it and it works well, for me included.
I like the idea of using dice to create my paper wallet, that to me is the ultimate thing I can trust.  Bitaddress have instructions for doing this on their site using BIP6 (99 rolls of a dice) which you can use to create a truly random private key.  Lookup diceware as well to generate a list of words to use as the seed for your private key.
Every time you think you've nailed the process another question pops up.  In the end you have to weigh the risks and using dice and bitaddress.org offline to generate the key from your dice rolls is the best I can come up with.

Ok, not clear at all.  If that's what he meant then as soon as he imports from this key he should not use that address for cold storage anymore and he should create a new paperwallet.  Should also destroy the old piece of paper with his private key written on it.

I will get downvoted to hell for this but here goes.  In a way it makes sense....let me explain.  When you deposit money you are loaning money to the bank.  They take your money and pay you interest (a pittance but that is beside the point).  For the most part what they are providing you with is security from having to stuff dollars under your mattress.  When a bank loans you money they require some kind of collatoral.  If you default they take away your house or your car or whatever.  They don't run to the government to bail you out.  Well in Canada we have mortgage insurance for highly leveraged mortgages, but set that juicy tidbit aside for a while.  Since the general public need banks more then they need you (that's what they want you to believe anyway) they will not allow you to request collateral from them if they default (bail in).  It's basically a case of "too bad so sad" I am defaulting and the government will not cover your loss.  
So what can you do about it?  Understand your bank. Do the best due diligence you can on their financial health and give your business to banks that are more transparent.  Not an easy task I know, but you need to start thinking like a bank.  Just like they will boot your arse to the curb if they feel you are a credit risk you must do the same with them.  You have some power over a bank in that they need your deposits to survive.  So make them earn it.  I will admit that we are a little spoiled in Canada with a relatively stable banking system.  But the hawks are trying to reduce government regulation here as well so they can take on more risk.  Who is trying to initiate that?  Which banks?  Maybe you need to reassess who you do business with if their goals do not align with yours.  
All most people want from their bank is to hold their stash for them safely and not steal it, which is why we only get a pittance in interest. Maybe credit unions are more in line with your goals.  I don't know, not all countries have the same issues.  But from a government standpoint, they are saying we will not come to the rescue of a defaulting bank, so I guess you will need to find another way, like default on your loans.  I don't think its politicians and bankers sitting around a table going "Muhahahahaha".  So stop being a victim and demand better if you have concerns.  If they don't address those concerns then maybe shop around for better (credit union?) or look for more diversification instead of holding large amounts of cash assets at one bank.  Bitcoin is an interesting option for this reason, in my opinion.  It really is a power shift for the average Joe.  
Well...back on my bike.

yes, just fill in the form at libertybit and follow their instructions.  For example, say you are depositing $1000, libertybit may tell you to deposit exactly $999.81 or something so they can confirm it is you that deposited the money.  I don't bank at CIBC either but I walked right up the counter and said I wanted to make a cash deposit to the account on the printout.  She asked me where i was depositing and I said Libertybit Exchange.  She said OK and I didn't need ID or anything, I just initialed the deposit receipt.  $3 fee at libertybit to deposit and .5% to purchase which is reasonable I think.

That's what is so puzzling about this.  Virtex have all the necessary licenses and are very compliant. Even the regulatory framework in Canada has been unobtrusive of bitcoin so far. It's the Canadian banks that have been expanding into the US big time and now are bending over to FinCen interpretations of what constitutes money transmitters.  I can't say I am surprised.  Canadian banks may be seen as stable on the international scene, but to any Canadian who has to deal with them on a regular basis they are all about the disappointment.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:22:02
It appears CAVirtex also charge a .0005 fee  to withdraw bitcoin.  Blockchain only shows a .0005 fee but they actually charge you .001.  Yet they advertize BTC withdrawals as free on their site.  Maybe I am missing something.  Ya it's chump change but that is not the point.

Can't you just sell some btc on virtex or Libertybit and withdraw to your acct?
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:56:05
thanks for the reply.  Are you saying that Foxit pdf reader may cache the pdf somewhere on my system and be retrievable?  I can see recent documents show the pdf that I printed but it maps to my mounted truecrypt container drive letter and is not accessible.   
So, boot to live linux cd and download bitaddress.org.  Reboot live cd without internet connection and run bitaddress.  
Find a way to print from my linux live cd to my crappy printer connected to a usb cable.

I can't argue with that.  I will be watching closely as well.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:06:18
yes absolutely add a password to your wallet.  You can even go a step further and download truecrypt to create an encrypted container to store your wallet. When  you want to access your coins in the container you can decrypt it and it mounts the container as a drive on your pc (say F: drive).  
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:22:36
You are absolutely right.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:13:45
you will have to enter the password to send coins or to create new receiving addresses.  Make backup copies of your truecrypt container and store it someplace safe (usb key, or on a remote server somewhere (dropbox or some equivilent)).  You should make a new backup everytime you create a new receiving address as well.

I don't know, Libertybit is pretty easy.  I think you can deposit up to $2000 daily without verifying your account and it only costs .5% fee to purchase bitcoin.   You can email them money (interact) or walk right into CIBC and pay cash to their account and your money is there like in two hours.  If you are doing large purchases it may be different.  cavirtex is just as easy but they have a brutal 3% fee.   I just purchased at Libertybit and the only thing I had to do was initial my deposit slip at the bank when I paid cash.  Will use again.
EDIT:  As others have posted looks like EFT transfers at Libertybit are gone.  Cash deposits only for now.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:04:07
When I first heard of bitcoin in 2010 I dismissed it as well.  As someone who has always been ahead of the curve in technology I am ashamed, not so much of having not been an early adopter, but rather having closed my mind to what it is and what it can be.  I got too comfortable with my technological knowledge and bitcoin has renewed my sense of humility.  How did I let me attitude change so much over the years.  The good thing is that I am now more open to the possibilities and while I am invested now the technological aspect of bitcoin and its disruptive nature are what really interest me.  I find the goldrush mentality of late is foolish and many people are going to get burned.  There is so much to do to get Bitcoin to the level it can be and I think the speculators will grow impatient and lose faith.  If this causes a dive it will make no difference to the underlyine potential of the protocol.
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:31:59
There is no shortage of people willing to sell for bitcoin.  What's lacking is people willing to buy because too many people are speculating.  Lots of hoarders.  Getting paid in bitcoin is like trying to pull bark off a tree with your bare hands.
@_date: 2013-06-10 00:35:57
Holy crap, I just checked and that too changed.  You can only deposit at BMO now.  WTF.  I'm starting to see what you mean, a PITA.  FWIW I have deposited at BMO before (cavirtex) and it was the same deal.
Don't forget to fill out the form on libertybits website before you deposit.  
@_date: 2013-06-10 10:16:33
Libertybit has suspended operations.  Your only option is cavirtex now.  Same deal for cash deposits at BMO.  But n
ow you have a ridiculous 3 percent fee.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:41:13
That's my approach.  It's ok to talk about investments in general terms but getting into advice is touchy.  If a friend were to ask me straight up for my opinion on something I would be more then happy to discuss it with them privately, and even then it would depend on the friend.  May sound paranoid but its not a black and white situation.  Money just seems to bring out the worst in some people, whether they have plenty of it or none of it.

I would download Bitaddress.org to a USB key and then boot into a system that has never been connected to the internet with a Linux Live CD (Ubuntu or Linux Mint).
I prefer to use dice to generate my private key but then I am not sure how to encrypt it with BIP38.  Your way you have to trust bitaddress.org.  It always seems to be a tradeoff to me.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:30:47

If Target accepted Bitcoin then 40 million people would have still been swiped.  A handful of bitcoiners would have been ok.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:01:24
I wouldn't.  Only leave there what you plan to trade with.  You should use a wallet app on your pc to store your coins or if you have larger amounts learn about offline storage with a paperwallet.  
Really, why would you trust some company in Japan with your money?  They have done nothing to earn your trust.  If you really want to use a website to store your coins then I would recommend blockchain.info with 2 factor authentication.  But still better to download Multibit or equivilent app and take care of it yourself.  
Edit: i mention blockchain.info because they can't access your wallet (it's encrypted there) and they will send you encrypted backups to your email that you can use to import somewhere else later.  Gox gets hacked or goes belly up you can kiss your coins goodbye.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:18:46
There is absolutely no reason not to spend BTC if you buy small amounts from QuickBT (for example) to purchase something right away.  You can still hold most of your BTC and keep a petty cash (um petty coin) wallet for small amounts to support businesses that take BTC.  You were going to spend the money anyway.

not really rocket science, just step by step and being meticulous.  There are easier ways to do it but I have never found a way that I truly trust 100%.  I don't care how many steps I have to take as I just want a method I can trust completely.  I am not advocating this way of doing it.  Just looking for holes.  I think there are tutorials on youtube for creating them with Electrum that is easier.
Even now  bitaddress is still not 100% for me.  I went to the sourceforge page and there are multiple files there and the instructions were not clear.  I would like to see a zip file with what I need signed with their pgp key.  Maybe it is there, I just need to look at it again.

Not trying to be insensitive but you said you had a bit of room on your credit card.  Use that for your immediate sustenance needs and wait the 3 days for your cashout from virtex.  I mean nobody even knows what city you live in.  how are they supposed to help you.  You can also try the food bank or social services.  There is no shame in doing that when you are down on your luck and trying to get back on your feet.  Also try localbitcoins.

There is definitely an anti establishment bias here but "be your own bank" to me simply means transfer funds electronically without the need for middlemen.  No reporting every move as possibly suspicious and worthy of scrutiny.  You hold the account, the money, the time of sending and it is only you and the receiver.   All money is held in your own wallet and transferred directly to theirs instantly.  So ya,  be your own bank.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:26:39
Just import your paperwallet private key into your regular wallet, your coins will pop up there...I think that is what your asking.  You shouldn't reuse your paperwallet, make another one if you want to store some coins.  If you are having doubts test this with smaller amounts until you get used to it.

I don't think the article is without merit but I don't think it is dead on either.  The tone of the author comes off as "all knowing".  I tend to take all absolute opinions with a grain of salt.

Had some fun with Bitcoin at our garage sale this weekend.  The sign said "20% Discount on Negotiated Price if Paying With Bitcoin".  Offering 20% on top of a negotiated price is a little bit like catnip for the garage sale crowd.  Sadly there were no bitcoin sales but was able to explain what it was to whoever was interested in knowing more.  Gauging from my admittedly limited sample, the public is still pretty clueless when it comes to crypto currencies.  
Favorite exchange of the day.  This guy looks at the sign and then looks at me and asks, "What is that like debit or somethin?".   When I briefly explained what digital cash was (trying to keep it simple) he just looked at me with nerdly disgust and walked away.  Heh.

Then you recreate all the problems of the current system that bitcoin tries to solve.  The government would appoint intermediaries to handle the details and regulate the whole allocation of the supply.   The whole point is decentralization so that I can transact directly with anyone else anywhere for any amount without paying a toll to some middleman who will scrutinize every last detail of our transaction.  That scrutiny adds costs and time.

If this post isn't a troll then sorry to hear this, you seem to have taken more precautions then most people.  From everything you described it sounds to me like a keylogger, but then again this is very limited information. 
Who, how, what, where, when....who knows?  We have no idea where you have been and who has really accessed your machine.   First order of business is to wipe your system and reinstall.  
Losing ~1k sucks, no argument there but I have to think that you have other private information on your laptop that you need to safeguard now.  No internet banking on this thing I hope.  Once you have been owned you cannot trust that system ever again.  If you can't live without windows consider running linux in Virtual Box.  Use that install only for bitcoin.

Money is a touchy subject OP.  I would suggest you just drop the subject with them, it's a lose lose situation.  If this goes higher from here they will feel even worse that they didn't buy in at 1k.  If it tanks they will blame you.  I would say if a friend brings it up then talk to them privately, but not if you are all sitting around the same table having a beer.  Good on you for being in earlier then $10 from the sounds of it.

I think what I will do is just donate  .015 btc to on jan 1st if this address is not swiped byt then and keep this .015 btc here  indefinitely. I will post the transaction to prove the donation at that time just to make good on my word.
In the real world nobody would know this is a brain wallet so they could not focus on it.  I have also given clues which are not a real world situation.  I am not really looking to test the strength of a wallet in which I give away half the seed or say it rhymes with.....  That would be pointless.  I guess its up to the bots to figure it out.  Eventually it should disappear and that will give me a good idea how far they have come.
