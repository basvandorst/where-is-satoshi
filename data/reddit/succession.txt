Ah gotcha. The whole 10 commandments thing confused me but i understand your argument now. I wonder how many miners agree with the moral argument though, and how many would respond if such an attack was done.

This entire OP is about the morality of attacking a minority hash and how it does not fit into the ideals of bitcoin. Obviously morality is a main argument here.

Every single post here is spam. What gives?

I believe it is their DDOS protection service, which is what people can pay bitcoins for.

It would be great for the CIA to run a drug market. They totally wouldn't get any backlash at all for running an illegal drug market, even if they caught a few criminals from it. Anyone saying that this is some type of CIA honeypot or backdoor is ridiculous, with the amount of red tape in these agencies if they had access to a website like this, it would be taken down before anyone was able to exchange drugs or bitcoins.

Somehow I doubt they would be able to get any of the former admins to go along with a plot like that without them leaking to the public. Along with the fact that the Gov't would have also had to facilitate a drug market for 1-2 years, which probably isn't legal. Maybe check to see if your tinfoil hat has a hole in it.

I've never heard of this happening before. Could you send me a link to a report on this? Not saying that it hasn't happened, I'm genuinely interested if that's legal/has been done before.
