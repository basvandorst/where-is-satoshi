That doesn't solve the problem of being actually able to receive the deposit amount in the first place without the possibility of a flag / TTL report, or bank account closing/frozen + the possibility of prosecution/investigation (even though you are doing everything legit).
Even if you did it in &lt;$10,000 amount transfers at a time, i don't see it working.

Are you working for the globalists?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:42:10
because they are seed orgs of the NSA/globalists, they produce them, mine with them and don't sell a single bitcoin that they've mined. When they ship out the retail versions the limited supply becomes reality on exchanges the the retail miners can dictate the price, that's the globalists plans though, price spikes --&gt; adoption. This way every big country and their debt will be defaulted on when everyone adopts Bitcoin. Unless a war is started, which will probably happen between China+Russia and the US and its allies.

Now you have me paranoid, most of my mined coins i received payment from a service like betarigs.com, I mine scrypt coins that are converted to BTC, so i have no way of knowing where they actually came from.

OP is car owner, obvious advertisement is obvious
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:01:05
they earned that in bitcoins, no?
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:00:13
Who needs a backdoor when you are sitting on nearly all the currency in circulation, u can just dump it on exchange and it'll drop to cents again
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:46:58
so now we're going to see 27,000 BTC sell walls driving the price down into the dirt because of this jerk
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:27
I don't have that amount, unless BTC hits $20,000.

winkleb0sses, after being pwned in 2005 by zuckerberg,  they then hired satoshi fuckamoto, and sat in their basements trying to become "bigger and better" than facebook with a financial product, alas bitc0n.

He probably mad that he got fired, so Bitcoin was the only way to possibly overtake or make citi irrelevant, the sweet sweet revenge...lol

staring at the seconds timer, makes me realise how fast seconds are going, i used to have an old clock that would tick to the seconds, and it used to go a lot slower than that. Has time sped up since then?

So many retards on that twitter asking about litecoin and other random but yet equally shitty and useless sh1tcoins, makes me sick. Got their life savings aka $3000 of pocket money invested in their shitcoin that they gotta go and post about it everywhere, get real shitters.
