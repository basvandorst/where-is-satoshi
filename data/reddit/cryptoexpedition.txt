You know what you're right, my apologies...as I read again.....your title was kinda misleading to me. You actually said bloated alt coin market. Not entire alt coin market..I missed that. Wheeeew..I was a little nervous...because I'm up big time from some alts. I guess if you named some bloats...it would have helped. Thx.

My thing is this...if you are so sure that this space is a bubble and is gonna pop...then why worry. Sit back eat popcorn and chill out. Or could it be you're so consumed with confirmation bias that you won't even allow for the possibility of another successful market emerging. Another thing to consider...not every alt will become a billion dollar business.....but they are a legit business...in the words of one of the great crypto minds..."take a chill pill"...lol

I think that their are 2 camps that are crossing paths. People that believe in this space from the tech side and investors. Sometimes you can be both. The bigger problem in this space is the amateur investor. Amateur investing is not new and exist in the stock market world. Crypto just moves way faster. There will always be winners and losers ...it's not the space..it's life.  And one more thing...not everyone believed in Satoshi's idea. There was someone just like you in the forums saying the same thing...but they were talking about Bitcoin. The cycle continues.
