Yeah, I did check and ID was accepted, but it seems they've changed policy after all the verification issues/backlog they had. Before doing anything at all they even asked me about some legal stuff, such as whether I was buying BTC for myself or for another party and other things. Boy, where did the anonymous part went again?
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:01:59
Hoh? This seems quite interesting! Rather, a true decentralized P2P? Isn't that quite sweet? Why is it not mainstream yet? Does it have the same issues as localbitcoin perhaps? Slow, trust problem and higher prices?

Not sure about that, to get fiat/Crypto in Europe is quite hard because of verification times, or perhaps I've been freaking unlucky for the last month, not sure. 
- Kraken moved to permanent 502 error page, and even when it's on, verification is disabled;
- therocktrading doesn't accept new members;
- bitflinex doesn't accept new members too;
- coinhouse has same issue;
- poloniex is a mistery for me, as I've submitted verification info several times but each time I log in it resets things;
- bitpanda's verification has me in their waiting list since early december, and the other two methods (nice for them to have three partners, sadly not really helpful) require passport which in Europe isn't needed as long as you don't go abroad (for EU member States the Gov ID is enough);
- Bitstamp would be the best opinion, but it won't allow any operation until I submit all documents, among which I'm currently lacking a proof of residence since I still live with my parents (actually, I'm waiting for my bank account, so it might be my next exchange... I hope);
- coinmama's verification fails everytime because of loading issue, so I gave up.
There are many others I tried, but wasn't able because of other issues or because I didn't trust them enough.
Not to mention, even GDAX would be a better alternative to Coinbase, but it freaking requires two ID, and since Passpport isn't an opinion for me, I'm stuck at verification page (in the process of getting Driving license too, but that will take months, still before the Passport tho).
Sorry for being boring or annoying, but I'm quite frustrated as I quite dislike depending only on Coinbase to buy crypto.

Well, to be honest mine is the opposite problem: I tend to overspend during dips to get more. I now try to not think about it because I'm aware I shouldn't invest more than what I've already invested.
By the way, another, seriously bothering and annoying issue is that since my friends got to know I'm in crypto, they laugh at me while showing how the market crashed or how the prices dropped. 
That aside, yes, I've reached a zen state too. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:58:25
Huh? May I ask you when did you verify yourself? Because I tried two days ago, and all three partners of Bitpanda asked me a Passport since they said they didn't accept normal IDs anymore. Perhaps I was unlucky, or for my country only Passport is allowed now. Not sure, still salty though, as Bitpanda was the only other working alternative for me (still... 50€ per month... Bitpanda is trying to tell me to not invest too much in crypto perhaps? My, how kind of them..)
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:03:28
*Touché*, you're right. Well, at least I can do crypto/crypto thanks to Binance and others. I guess more safety is required when actual fiat is involved huh..
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:18:59
Nothing against you, but my salty pain of being unable to buy ETH or BTC aside from ~~BTC~~ Coinbase urges me to write my situation:
- Bitstamp: verification since december;
- Gemini: not in UE sadly;
- Kraken: you meant "error 5-" oh wait, now it's "maintenance";
- TheRockTrading: not accepting new users (so is Coinhouse and many other ones, Bitflinex perhaps, not sure, I tried many, many I assure you);
- Bitpanda: verification strictly require Passport, not accepting other IDs, which for European is quite the issue as for us there is no need for a Passport unless you go outside EU (inside of it, the government issued ID will suffice).
Thanks for Bitcoin.de though, I'll try there. How does it compares to the others if I may ask?
Also, is there a site or any source to see a current status of all exchanges based on communities? I'm currently sufring daily throught all related subreddits, but Kraken's one for example, doesn't allow all posts to show, while Coinbase's one is on the other hand quite enlightening.
Edit: Typo (BTC-&gt;Coinbase)

Woah, many thanks! Definitely going to dig it!^the ^font ^tho ^hurts ^my ^eyes..
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:35:22
Ohh, many thanks for your input! Definitely grateful for your concern over my sleeping habits, you actually hit the jackpoint as I've been severally lacking some good sleeping as of lately, so thanks.


Nice suggestion, as a matter of fact I've taken up that habit, I use Pocket though, far more convenient I think.

As someone who lives in Italy and 
- doesn't have two IDs which are required to get verified on GDAX (while Coinbase only require one, wtf);
- can't get verified on Bitstamp doesn't own any proof of residence because still lives with parents who believe investing=casino;
- has Poloniex and Coinmama's account pending for verification since a week ago;
- is in the waiting endless list of identification process of Bitpanda;
- tried Kraken but couldn't either access the site or get verified for a reason I forgot.
..well, **I freaking feel you**. Seeing people getting worried about losing money when I can't even buy them and secure them in my wallet is frustrating to say the least (and no, buying from Coinbase would mean leaving them there with such fees).
Sorry for ranting, but you are not alone. Might we able to fudging get our BTC soon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:54:36
Okay, so the public tab system is the blockchain. And up there I understand. But then does the Lighting Network do this


? If I understood correctly, you meant that as long as our tab is opened we have a credit/debit relationship, while when we close it, money *automatically* get transferred to the creditor from the one who is in debt?
Is this automated process thanks to the LN? And it isn't limited to just one-on-one relationship, but also with many-to-many?
Sorry if I've understood nothing or little, but let me thank you for trying to explaining, but I'm getting quite interested in it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:42:18
Did you pay those unreasonable fee to get the BTC from Bitpanda to your personal Wallet or simply to buy from Bitpanda (it put the bought BTC in its wallet as default and doesn't let us decide towards which address put them right?)? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:46:55
Any good European alternative to Gemini? Because I'm freaking done with Coinbase, its buy/sell prices are unreasonable (seriously salty over the fact that my 600€ ETH became something like 540€ in an istant... let's not talk about transfers/withdrawals delays or how GDAX requires 2, TWO, IDs which I do not have...)^sorry ^for ^complaining ^I'm ^just ^really ^tired
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:43:31
Oh, great. This actually answer my question, if you don't get any additional fee to keep the LTC you bought on Bitpanda, then it's fine. My only doubt was whether the amount bought counted as "deposited" and thus subject to the fee, but from what you said, it doesn't seem so. Then again, Bitpanda isn't clear about its fees, so it might actually have been already charged for what we know.
Anyways, many thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:30:05
I agree on the bank account's fees, but are there lower fees for credit card purchases? If that is so, then you, alongside the redditor who made an Excel tracking chart and the one who enlightened me on how avoid BTC's huge fees to withdraw from Coinbase, will have made my Christmas.
Please, tell me there are even lower fee for credit cards purchase (because IMO they are the fastest way).
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:46:40
Hm? Wait, then when you buy BTC where is it stored if not in the deposit address? Are BTC Wallet and BTC Deposit Address different? Or did they send them to your own Wallet Address directly?
Well, I said BTC, but for any Crypto there is a fee for Deposit Address. LTC for example has:


Do you mayhaps pay this fee when buying and keeping the bought amount on Bitpanda? (though I plan to withdraw them to my wallet, BTC is definitely a no-no for now with these miner fees...)
Sorry for the many questions, and many thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:16:03
Is there a way to use it with only one ID? Because I'm pretty much stuck on Coinbase because of that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:04:04
OH, so before even entering into a debt/credit relationship the necessary money are already there because they were needed to first open the Lighting Channel! Yep, I totally didn't catch that.
Thus, if continuing your example, you opened the channel with 100$ and setup tabs between us, and then bought something from me for 20$, we would be at -80$ for me right? (you started with 100$, so I was in debt for the same amount, then you used your credit for 20$ to buy). With this, if our relationship were to end there, the remaining 80$, which were still locked in the Lighting Channel, would return to you, is that correct?
Well, that is neat. You basically have to pay in advance, I see. I guess the one who wish to "buy" or to start the relationship will always open the Channel then.
Oh, but you said there is a limit (the 100$ is actually symbolic, and not the real one right?), so, if instead of you buying from me for 20$, I were to buy from you for 30$, I wouldn't be able to "go -130$ in favor to you" unless I opened (=funded) another Channel for at least the same amount (=30$)? In this last case, if everything then went like before (=you bought a 20$ worth thing from me), we would be something like:
- total channel 100$=me in debt for 100$
- I wish to buy for 30$-&gt;I fund Channel=me in debt for 130$;
- You buy from me for 20$-&gt;subtract from your credit of 130$=me in debt for 110$;
- we end relationship-&gt;110$ money go to you.
Yes, I think I've understood. Many thanks for your explanation! (I hope I didn't misunderstand anything, I would look silly otherwise...)
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:51:07
No worries, I'm the one being sorry for complaining. Oh well. Hope Gemini will be also available here sooner or later then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:46:13
And here I am. Trying to get identified through multiple platforms without success thus getting depressed because I can't buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:13:55
Got it, thanks for your time and explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:48:18
Yeah, that's true. My problem is rather that I do not have two different IDs, so I'm forced to painfully withdraw from Coinbase alone. Darn it.
Sorry if it was somehow unasked, but I needed to vent and yours was the first somehow relevant comment.
Have a good day.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:38:46
That sounds nice, sorry if I'm late, but would you mind clarifying a doubt of mine? On Bitpanda it's written that any deposit of less than 0.05 BTC will be charged a fee, does this also apply when I actually buy BTC from them and it gets deposited on my Bitpanda Wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:36:13
Yes, that I know. But to actually use GDAX, it asks me *another* ID other than the one I already used for Coinbase (the ID used is unselectable in GDAX verification menu), which is plainly frustrating as I only have one (currently in the process of getting driving license, but that's not the issue here).
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:39:44
I'm sorry, but I can't really understand. So, through LN someone who was lent money is somehow forced to give it back? That would be seriously great, but I would really like to understand how and why it works. I'm quite uneducated on LN (though even with BTC I just know the basic), so would anyone be kind enough to direct me to somewhere I can learn and comprehend better this?
