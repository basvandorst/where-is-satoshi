technically they can pay players in gift cards. So like a bitcoin gift card would work. it happens a lot if you look up the swag list for the bowl games there are a lot of gift cards for around 400-450 dollars.

add more to this its just the original name they came up with. 
One reason why they are keeping it there is due to what i explained a bit to be in RUNNING for the playoff that NCAA D-1 will have the bowl game can NOT be just a title sponsor aka Chik-fil-a bowl returning peach to their name allows them entry to the playoff hosting. St Petersberg bowl is the Original non changing name like peach Bowl.

dude i watch all the bowls i know what it is like lol.....it if isnt one of the old established bowls they take the time to talk about the national championship. Since this is the first year of the playoff its gonna be WAY worse. Instead of 1 game they have two games to hype up on top of big non playoff games like for example if texas/Texas am got into a bowl game.

have you ever seen a st pete bowl? the stadium is almost empty. 
this was 3 years ago and had a team FROM FLORIDA in it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:21:00
wanna bet? if there is another game with big power houses. this game wont get a the time of day. it will be like oh here is the bitcoin st pete bowl enjoy
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:48:26
i just explained why..... if you dont understand im sorry
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:26:30
i wonder what type of swag the company will give players :o
This was the list last year
■ Beef ‘O’ Brady’s St. Petersburg Bowl
Mon., Dec. 23, 2 p.m. (ESPN); St. Petersburg, Fla.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3;  Oakley Breadbox sunglasses; Oakley Status backpack; Schutt mini helmet

the people running the bowl might want to fight down the road for a spot in the rotation of the playoff. For example Chic Fil-A had to agree to return the Peach to its name to be selected in the processes. 
Sponsor is okay but they dont want the Visa Mastercard Bowl in Pasadena to be one of the bowls that represents them in the playoff they want it to be the Rose bowl Presented by Visa Mastercard (if that makes sense to you)

you realize who plays in the st pete bowl?
last year had power houses ECU vs Ohio....not Ohio State Buckeyes 
THE OHIO Bobcats
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:41:24
k find a college fan who knows th head coach and star player of both ECU and Ohio
That isnt a fan of either team
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:10:20
I hope those people realize that on top of sponsoring the bowl they also gotta get players gifts. This is what beef O Brady got the players
■ Beef ‘O’ Brady’s St. Petersburg Bowl

San Francisco Bowl  if it is in AT&amp;T park it isnt new. Pacific Life Holiday Bowl is there
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:34:34
again no way. there is no way TV Viewership for ECU vs Ohio beats a Talladega race 
@_date: 2014-12-21 05:55:21
bama didnt play that motivated after losing to Auburn last year. So honestly a bowl game like this just means ability to practice more.
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:39:31
you realize dogecoin/josh wise was talked about on FS1 like all week before the race? o.O
ESPN isnt gonna hype the bitcoin st pete bowl against MAC/C-USA  vs sun belt 
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:42:54
sure they are gonna run 30 second ads for the games on the 26th but analayis?? no. They will focus more for the big games
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:37:12
okay okay calm your tits
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:36:06
ECU and ohio are known teams? o.O
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:09:53
who knows but nascar raceday is where fans go to get daily news and they talked about it a lot on that show. and during practice/qualifying. No offense but ESPN isnt gonna hype this game up like the dogecoin car was talked about going into raceday. 
Hell they wont even be talking about the game. these minor bowl games get like first half them talking about it then the second half they are talking about the national championship or news about the national championship. Since ESPN has rights on the playoff its gonna get MAJOR time in the minor bowls. Which I think is a raw deal for those teams/fans but it is what it is.
