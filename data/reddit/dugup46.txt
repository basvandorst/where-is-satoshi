I guess I just don't understand what the big deal is here?  Sorry if I am being cynical.  His salary will surely still be based off of USD/year.  The city would have to take USD, purchase BTC, pay him in BTC, just so he can exchange back to USD to pay his bills.
The real stories are the companies accepting bitcoin as payment.  Not when exchanges are made, as in this case - we exchange BTC/USD all the time here.  The more companies that accept bitcoin the bigger deal it is and the more likely this continues to grow and become more widely adapted.

Here's the REAL question here. Is he being taxed?  He obviously can't report a zero income on his 1040 could he?  If his actual pay is in btc, I don't see how the government could tax him. Of course when he converts his btc to usd to pay his bills each time he would (should) be reporting an income. Fair question though. How do you get taxed in something that the us does not currently see as a currency.

Does anyone know if the transaction from the BTC out of the wallet showed up in the "Recent Transactions" list on the right?  
I'm sure a very high amount of people use this app; however, only a small percent are infected.  It may have something even to do with this subreddit.  There is a good bit of spam under the new section that people may be very prone to click and link directly up into a virus.  Not sure how possible this all is, just sounds logical.  
It's not going to be a random virus spread out to hundreds of millions of machines all the while staying undetected by virus scanners for a number of weeks, all in hopes to gain BTC from a VERY, VERY low number of machines.  The more logical step would be post a link to the virus/spyware here, hit a # of people you know will have BTC and remain low key.
