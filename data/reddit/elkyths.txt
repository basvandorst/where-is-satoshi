Satoshi, is that you?

I'm interested in moving my coins from Coinbase through Wasabi and into a hardware wallet. Is there a way to do this so that the hardware wallet is not linked to those coins and Coinbase (my identity) any longer?
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:36:52
I prefer to hear it first hand from redditors tho. I don't trust YouTube gurus ...or at least I don't know which ones should I trust.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:18:47
If *all* is everything you got in fiat then no.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:39:07
Yeah but you could use public access points for your transactions. Or a smartphone with an unregistered number.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:59:23
No way it's a scam. Must be legit. Jeez.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:24:16
Zooming out does make things look promising, true.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:48:41
Mucho gusto!
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:17:18
Let's wait and see. Seems to have started climbing back as of now.
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:14:36
There's a lot of mean people on this sub, getting all nasty with their comments. I'd gelp help you but I'm no expert. Been hodling some coins (well, satoshis to be exact) on Coinbase and plan to transfer them to a hardware wallet, still researching.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:55:24
Lol...exactly true...you can buy drugs with any money. Probably people think that buying drugs with bitcoin is anonymous or something?
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:56:39
It's probably AI od gvrnmnt anyways. Or aliens?

They say I might be a dreamer but I'm not the only one ;)
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:01:13
A very sound advice, thanks bro. Maybe now I buy me some ��
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:22:30
How do the paper wallets work?
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:49:40
Sound advice.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:07:07
Why am I getting donwvoted on my own thread, I wasn't the first to be immature in this conversation.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:26:42
I understand that...my point was, if he moves the coins to Trezor, no one can confirm it is *his* Trezor, he could have given/sold it to anybody.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:49:53
But is the dip over?
@_date: 2019-08-28 07:58:48
Seems like a lot of hassle, I'd like to do this without converting to other currencies....
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:21:47
Thanks, wil do.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:00:33
I appreciate this detailed explanation very much.
So basically with the 24-words-key (that's the seed phrase, right?) I can access my coins from any device, even if my particular device was stolen or lost? Didn't realise this before. But where are my actuall assets stored then? I thought they are stored in the wallet. Apparently not.
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:13:30
Well..I'm sure they're doing it for the big fish.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:00:33
I'm new to Reddit, it's been a positive experience so far, for the most part. ��
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:40:07
Sooo....sell now? :D
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:22:24
Wow thanks, a Trezor wallet wiki. Neat.  I'll be back in a few days ��
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:12:04
Yes it is.
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:59:13
Interesting, but what is it I should be practicing exactly? How could I fck something up?
@_date: 2019-08-16 05:54:38
Relax. It's not like I'm spending thousands here. Just here and there a couple hundred at most. I'm daring but not stupid �� Besides, if I wanted to sell all my BTC now, I would easily cover my credit card. Thanks for the concern tho.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:22:46
That button you're talking about, never saw it. Where is it? Also, if I'm breaking the rules someone should tell me politely, all I got was "buy a dictionary", and my response to that was in the same manner.
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:57:36
I realise that. Just wanted some opinions...it's kinda steady ...like 1-2% fluctuation in the last few days.
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:42:41
Thanks for the tip. What are some of the features u should look for in a wallet? Are they all pretty much the same?
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:24:19
I'll sell (but still leave and hold some) only when and if I need the money.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:22:19
Sound advice. I wish I was really holding fiat, but at this point I'm buying with a credit card��
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:40:12
Thanks for the detailed instructions.  My question is why pro? I gotta pay to have Coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:12:45
I'd say 85%
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:23:23
Kinda right.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:11:21
feez bro
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:51:36
I buy bitcoin with credit card. Insane?
@_date: 2019-08-17 08:06:18
Really? I'm new to crypto so I was excited to read this  ...now I'm not.
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:47:57
True. I'll cover those credit cards like it's a joke.
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:12:09


@_date: 2019-08-18 16:19:06
When was the last time someone gave you something for free, that wasn't a bubblegum?
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:58:48
I'm aware I need to make some effort to achieve this, but I'm not looking for ultra-super privacy at all costs, I'm not a criminal or doing illegal activities...I just want to somehow unlink my identity from those coins, but keep the coins...or make it seem I just transferred them to someone else.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:42:55
We're pretty much at the same page here.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:20:05
Well I got nothing to lose if I already got nothing, right? On the other hand, the potential gains have a promising outlook.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:23:10
Agreed. But it helps hearing other ppls opinions.
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:51:22
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:27:01
You seem sure we've already seen this year's high. That would mean even further lows should be expected.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:48:07
Yes we won't.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:20:55
Ok I just did buy me a wee bit.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:27:04
Couldnt he just buy a Trezor and send his bitcoin to it, now who ever has the tresor (him) is anonymous.
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:52:03
Thanks for all the tips. It's a good starting point. Once I have the wallet I can receive btc directly to it, right? How about purchasing from exchanges, I do that like I would normally and then transfer to my wallet after purchase?
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:52:51
This was already declared fake before it even got out.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:02:09
Yeh I read something about that...let's hodl and see.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:57:22
Haha, ikr....we're just looking for some friendly support and reassurance ;)
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:05:54
Does this classify as a dip?
@_date: 2019-08-28 08:48:46
Wasabi and Coinjoin seem like a viable option but I'd definitely like to understand all this deeper. Going to read that FAQ now.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:43:18
It could go down to 8.5 k € ...You guys all talk in $ ...maybe someone who actually cares about this comment calculates.
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:56:17
Suck my ghetto ballz.
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:53:39
As I said..I'm no expert, still researching. Plan to get a hardware wallet soon.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:32:32
Never all in...just spending what I can...not sure if now's the time tho....I have a feeling it might drop still by 50% this year.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:30:41
That's logical. I learned so much today, thanks all ��
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:32:59
Damm that was 10 minutes ago. How about now? ;)
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:08:00
Yes. We all should.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:52:16
Was thinking the same thing.....
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:38:26
Thanks for the tip,  yeah I've seen there are 2 versions,  one is much more expensive but I didn't get what was the main difference between the two. I'll probably go for the cheaper version.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:55:49
So I should always buy same $/€ amount, right? Not sure what are the benefits. I don't have any money anyways, I buy BTC with credit card and hope in the fture I'll cover all my credit cards, and have enough to retire when BTC skyrockets.
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:41:32
Let's wait a few hours, shall we?
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:31:37
"livedl" ��
@_date: 2019-09-14 05:57:00
They will still support € but their business will be conducted through a German based company instead of UK based. That is, if Brexit ever becomes a thing, which it probably won't.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:44:47
But someone hads soldl alldl.
