If I move my coinbase coins to bread wallet does it continue to gain money as the price of bitcoin goes up? 
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:41:59
So if I buy $50 USD in Bitcoins and the price drops from $719 to $650 then I will be losing some of my money? Last I looked the price was at$708.76 So is this like playing the stock market? Sorry for all the questions.

Prob a dumb question but I can transfer my funds from coinbase to electrum?

Sorry I'm new and trying to figure this all out. What exactly would happen if India catches on to Bitcoin. What significance does that have for my bitcoin in the US.

I'm new to this bitcoin thing. I use Coinbase. Should I not be using this? 
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:34:24
I only have about 108 in my BTC balance. I plan to just keep that money in there and see what happens. I don't plan on sending bitcoins any where except my bank account to cash out one day. Is coinbase ok for this? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:46:12
I'm out!

Coinbase always goes down when the price of bitcoin goes up. ALLLLLL THE TIME!! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:04:41
