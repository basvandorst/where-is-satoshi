Thats not the only way.  You can also use Bcash so it makes it look like people actually use the network!  I've bought several miners from Bitmain and I kind of hate myself for it but what else is there?  Hoping the new Halong proves legit.

They provided tracking number so thats one thing, show me the tracking history.  When you place an order you get an 'Order Confirmed' email from Bitmain. So there is some proof he could provide if he actually wanted people to believe this.

Yeah, I've ordered from Bitmain several times and haven't had any issues.  I know they are the evil empire but to be competitive you really have no other options.  Without any documentation its hard to chalk this up to anything but user error.  The trakcing number is listed on the invoice, not seprately in my experience.  How are you going to accept a shipment of 200 antminers? Do you have a forklift?

If you expected anything different from the big banks and CC companies you haven't been paying attention, sorry.

There are plenty of other avenues.  Buying with credit card should be towards the bottom of the list.  Would you expect any different from the traditional financial elite?? If so, you haven't been paying attention.

Its a matter of not having a choice or alternatives. Legally institutions need someone else to have custody of the assets. They can't just hold them themselves. Several other custody solutions in the works but I'm not sure any others are operational yet.
