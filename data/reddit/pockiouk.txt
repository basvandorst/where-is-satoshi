Oh yes! Perfect Instagram fodder. Thanks for the # tip. We're getting started with Instagram soon. 
I made a stencil with my hands (if that counts) and weighted it down against the pancake with spoons. Skillz m8. I wanted to do some for other currencies but can't eat that many pancakes.

Never thought of it like that! :D Sadly not Welsh, but from over the border. Was thinking more along the lines of this Fearne Cotton impression from The Morgana Show:

Cycling, no time for breakfast, walking to buy ingredients, faffing about with ingredients, faffing with icing sugar, faffing with taking a photo, cleaning up a lot of icing sugar, then trying to spread Nutella on it that had gone hard... I was pretty desperate after all that :D

She's brilliant. The whole show was really awesome. Well worth a look :D

No, we're in the UK, but this was an oatbran pancake, which is typically Dutch! We know this from going to a Dutch pancake house recently. We got schooled. :D

Do pancakes last well in the mail? haha

ah... too late. Nutella and raspberries = gone in 10 seconds.

So glad you noticed! I was going to do it straight on, but someone clever on our team pointed out that it needed to be on an angle! :D
