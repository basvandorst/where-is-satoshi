I agree.  I bought a Trezor for my coins a few weeks ago and it has been a breeze.  Theres too many ways to make a mistake using anything else.
Now I just keep my trezor locked in a safe next to my guns.  Never lose sleep over coins again.

Talk about sensationalized nonsense.  
Ulbright is the Nelson Mandela of our generation.  Jailed by a corrupt regime only to be freed when society learned the error of its ways (hopefully).

This is total BS.  We need to boycott the entire state until they fix this.

It depends on how fast he tried to buy it.  If he put the order out all at once I bet it would drive the price up 30-40%.

Your situation really sucks but you can't blame bitcoin because your computer security failed.  The same thing could have happened to your bank account or credit card.  You wouldn't blame fiat currency for that would you?

Spend $1,200 on an ounce of gold to get $1 in free bitcoin?  That isnt really a great deal.
They should focus on discounts for gold purchases in bitcoin.

Probably just a site glitch.  It is the weekend so the problem probably will take longer to resolve.

I think someday Satoshi will be awarded a Nobel prize, but I dont know if he'll reveal his identity to accept it.

The whole point of bitcoin is not to use the fiat payment system, so no debit cards.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:23:53
Yes if adoption increases more people will want to buy bitcoins and the price will go up.  As long as more people want to buy bitcoin than people that dont want to buy bitcoin the price will rise.
Right now miners are dumping all of their coins but when the price recovers they will want to hold them instead.  Price will continue to rise and we will see the next bubble.

Just do a local trade it's pretty easy and there are no requirements at all

Yes.  Using the blockchain for proof of ownership will increase confidence/awareness of its capabilities, including bitcoin.  
If you're tracking ownership of your stock portfolio and real estate on the blockchain it's not a big leap to use the blockchain for currency (bitcoin).

The technology and community are great.  The only problem is that bitcoin is slightly more difficult to use than fiat.  It took the banking system decades to come up with the seamless process for using credit/debit cards that people are familiar with today.
It will take bitcoin some time to catch up with the fiat payment system from a usability perspective, but when it does we're going to eat everyone's lunch.

Here's a good place to start

Just drama caused by trolls.  Not even worth talking about.

I think Bitcoin will do for mankind what the sun did for life on earth.

Other countries have less strict money laws that the US and Canada so it should be less hassle to open accounts there.
Just give BTC time.  The banks have a 100+ year head start and BTC has only been mainstream for a year or so.

Bitcoin doesn't need an endorsement from MIT.
Honey badger of money.

That is still much faster than a credit card transaction is settled.

You'd be better off purchasing bitcoin and using it in the various countries you visit.  
As a backup you can easily convert it to local currency.  Many airports have bitcoin ATMs and bitcoin ATMs are scattered all over the world.  You can use these to convert bitcoin to local currency with no risk and minimal fees.

What does this have to do with bitcoin

Is there a Chrome plugin to block sites that use wordpress?

It depends on how comfortable you are with the risk of missing the next bubble.  Investing $2500 per month over a four month period is a good starting point.

What we need is a high net worth individual with celebrity status to buy a lot of coin.  Someone like Mark Cuban.

You need to factor in a scam rate which adjusts the return based on the probability that the facilitator runs off with your entire investment.

There is no way for the government to know what you mined, don't report anything.

This would be a game changer.  Uber could also pay their drivers in bitcoin and save a ton on bank fees.
