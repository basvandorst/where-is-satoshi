With a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, I'd say it is impressive.

The market will work this out, and this is why it's good to get in early. 1 BTC could be worth 100,000, 1000,000 in $$ value. Currently not every Aussie is a million, right?

I don't fully understand your question.
The 2nd layer will not affect Bitcoin, It's a contract where you lock your Bitcoin into a channel.


You own the Bitcoin
Another issue is being online to ensure your channels stays alive, Im no expert here I could be wrong but if your not online for a long period of time the channel will force close and can take something like 144 blocks before you get your Bitcoins back onchain. Watch Towers fix this.

tippr is worst then [tippin.me]( at least with [tippin.me]( when tipping someone you do it from YOUR own wallet and not have to deposit into a twitter bot account that you have no control over. And with [tippin.me]( it's a lot easier to withdraw.

@_date: 2019-02-23 01:36:01
As long as there is demand to use lightning there will be improvements, if not we will use / build some other layer 2 tech. Lightning is open sourced and anyone can improve the protocol. Bitcoin will still work as it is with or without lightning.

It's worth the wait :) But these are early days and LN is improving everyday.  I would like to see a service where say your weekly pay (maybe 10% of it) would automatically exchange the $$ into Satoshis, send to a LN wallet open a channel for you (wait to confirm) and then you can instantly start sending payments over LN.  All this without you doing anything but waiting for TX confirmations. 
Good to hear your using [tippin.me]( and enjoying your experience.

* There is a lack of wallets that can't receive payments.  (**PRO**: they are some in the works)
* Not enough liquidity  to support of global usage . (I really cant defend this, who knows )
* Routing payments will cause centralization.  (**PRO**: AMP is solve this issue)
*Edit: 3rd point I meant centralization not decentralization*

@_date: 2019-04-18 21:41:43
Yeah I agree showing someones balance like [1ml.com]( does wouldn't be ideal, not sure for a way around this, maybe a LN node and restrict what is shared with a thirdparty like 1ml.com. As for linking phone number, I just don't like using my sim card to link to anything private like my password, banking etc. Sim cards can be easily hacked, but this is me be a little paranoid :/

@_date: 2019-04-18 12:43:36
I guess people could make their LN wallet public and use something like [1ml.com]( to lookup this person, as for linking your phone number I would have to say this would be a bad idea IMO.

2013, got bitcoin armory wallet and downloaded the blockchain played around and came back in 2014 and bought some bitcoin from coinbase, forgot about it came back in 2015 seen I made some money and then I decided to slowly accumulate some more bitcoin, than 2017 hit and now I'm stuck in the bitcoin universe and can't escape :/  I'm now convinced bitcoin has its place in the world.

Yes, you control the keys, you can even set up your own node endpoints so you don't have to use the hardcoded ones.
