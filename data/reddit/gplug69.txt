Sorry that’s my bad I didn’t mean it like that. I meant it like fellows like comrades or associates  which is gender neutral.

Yea sure I still buy when its down. But I also have a set point where below that certain level ill most likely liquidate some and no longer buy.

New to equities? HA. Been trading whatever I can my entire life. And to say I no idea what I’m talking about is laughable. I agree it will be a slower rise and you don’t need to rush in but once confidence flood the market and everyone wants to buy bitcoin again it will pick up pace. Also you’re an idiot there are institutional investors in crypto. Fidelity Yale black water and many others. Others will soon follow. And just remember the total market cap is around 200b dollars which is very small for a market. Apple a single stock is 700b dollars more than that. Once institutional investors get in 200b to them is pocket change they could blow this market sky high for shits and giggles. Saying you know how bitcoins price will play out for a fact is moronic. Nobody knows what it will do.

You're right it doesn't have to. But if you have half a brain and realize what potential innovations and creations can come from this new technology then you would know the long term potential of it going higher heavily outweighs the idea of blockchain fading into oblivion. Sure bitcoin might not be the winner but there will be huge winners coming out of this market. Just like the [dot.com]( bubble the leaders at the start of the craze are no longer in business. It was the late comers that brought new ideas better ideas and better business models that are the new biggest baddest blue chip stocks out there. Blockchain technology is here to stay weather you like it or not. Get with the times or be left behind.

Never said 6k was the bottom at all. I absolutely think it could go lower. I called it a support level. When it breaks that support level I have stop losses set to minimize loss then I’d figure out where I would want to get back in.

my portfolio is only 10% crypto and ive stopped trading it a couple months ago. accumulating a little here and there but have focused more of my energy to stocks because of the lack of volatility. You have no idea when it gets to 10k no one does. you're delusional if you think you know the time frame of when btc will be a certain price. You're just blowing smoke out your ass you have no idea what will happen NOBODY does.

you have weak hands lmao. Who said you had to trade it? if you believe in the tech behind it and where it could play a part in the future then just hold it. You dont know when it will hit 9k hell it could do it tomorrow for god knows what reason. Let me remind you btcs priced tripled from 5k to 17k in a month from November to December. But hey if your bad at trading don't. its not for everyone. Some people enjoy trading but just because **you** cant make money doesn't mean other people cant. And you know what they say "Buy when theres blood in the streets"

Yea. crypto is only a fraction of my portfolio. It could go to 0 and I’d be fine.

I use it at every market place that takes it. Some even give you a discount for using it. I see more and more store accepting it by the day.
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:28:06
I agree theres no rush but I'm accumulating now when theres hardly any movement and have stop losses set at below that 6k resistance. Also i wouldn't say a year or two. Sure it might be pretty long but one catalyst and the news will pick up btc rising again everyone and their mother who dont know shit about crypto will buy bitcoin again. After that we'll probably have another flash crash because of the influx of new weak hands. Smart traders will at the top and the and beginner emotional traders will see the drop and panic sell causing a flash crash. I think this cycle will continue until more people understand btc and the technology behind it and not some get rich quick scheme.

Completely agree

I havent been swing trading lately and my stop loss is not tight at all. I agree theres usually what I call fake a move to make a move where it looks like its going to dip but then takes off. My stop loss is low enough to not be taken out by the fake move.

Holding a support level for over a year? Very good sign.... and please take a look at the previous bull runs btc has had. It blasts off sells off quick then consolidates and stays pretty sideways for a while then blasts off again so and so forth. It’s happened like 4 times exactly like that so I’m not sure where you’re getting your stats from hot head.
