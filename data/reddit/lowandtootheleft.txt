What motivation would one have to run a full node if not mining?

How can you send such a small amount of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:10:10
so your saying that the OP_RETURN data isn't compiled in the transaction ID? 
 and [ display the OP_RETURN and it seems as if  also uses the OP_RETURN. 
Could it be that the transaction ID or the wallet ID is encrypted and compiled in the generated transaction ID?
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:48:36
Except unless your a miner your going to have to go to some lengths to become truly anon

No comments on him being possibly forced out by fear or blackmail? Seems like fear and/or precaution was why Satoshi may have pulled the cord.

He totally should call his service Nibble

So its not saved on the blockchain ?   I thought this was OP_RETURN data.  The information gets shared between wallets when requesting or sending.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:01:54
I still can't figure out how to add OP_RETURN data to a transaction.  
Using a Bitcoin Core wallet, there are some fields that you can add data but not sure which field is designated for the OP_RETURN data

A nonprofit has bills like any other company. If you want people to dedicate their lives to helping others, you must realize, they still need to make a living.

Mike Hearn doesn't represent the Bitcoin community as a whole.   Unless your a day trader, focusing on the volatility is moot

Actually odds on roulette for red is 2:1.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:39:31
you dont' have a bank account?
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:57:10
In response to roulette, 36:1 is if you hit an actual number not the red or black. 
Secondly the percentages are totally pulled out of the sky. 50% chance of failure!? Where is that number from? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:39:52
Disagree. I can black out drunk write the shit out of an article.

This really isn't a donation to the homeless. If this is how you want to help homeless, just donate to nonprofits that help in a specific segment.

Funny, I was going to say it was someone who sold early. Woulda had a 911 had they held out.
