So many wrong things in one single post. The "51% attack" refers to the *miners* colluding to change the transactions ledger to say something different than what is supposed to happen. The likelyhood of this attack also becomes harder every 10 minutes. Exchanges are merely participants of the network and have no more effect on it than two randos sending bitcoin to each other. Coinbase is a regulated business, and would face serious legal trouble if they kept user funds hostage. You can avoid this entirely if you do not keep bitcoin on the exchange.

This is actually hugely important. Coinbase doesn't want us to think employees holding certain coins is one of their biggest problems, but it is.
[They hired litecoin creator, who got it added to coinbase, and then left / sold his holdings once he was up 9,000%.](
[CEO Armstrong who is cozy with Ver, sat on their user's bitcoin cash for months, only to have insiders dump everything before their botched release. Allegedly.](
Until we have full autonomous exchanges, coinbase is a huge centralized point of failure and they must be held to all time high standards. It should not be easy to run the largest exchange in the USA, and employees should not have private holdings when they are responsible for the price it trades for.

You don't know where OP lives, what the electricity costs are, how long their hardware refresh cycle is. This is why I said "how much things cost vs how much they will make". The mentality of "be a chinese mining farm with free electricity or nothing at all" is dumb. It comes down to the numbers, what crypto is optimized for the situation, power costs, hardware turnover. This is not a one size fits all operation, but it's still possible to make it profitable depending on your views of where crypto will be in the future.
But most importantly, do not do it in secret.

1. high fees: this is temporary for bitcoin while segwit and lightning network are being slowly rolled into adoption (rushing it would be a disaster). You can currently use tools to calculate the lowest optimal fee to ensure a timely transaction but those such tools will eventually be obsolete. Some coins, like IOTA, trade away mining and transaction fees to allow low-power tech access.
2. It has to be a public ledger or else we all couldn't reach consensus on what it's supposed to look like. Private ledgers are probably a larger threat to your privacy. Think of all the data collected by social networks and financial institutions that either gets legally sold to third-parties (because you agreed to it) or gets leaked / hacked (because their closed systems have shit security).
I don't see bitcoin as an investment vehicle, it's simply programable money. Machines could collect payment and then pay for their own electricity / data without any human intervention. 
The lack of privacy falls on the user experience we have right now. If you generated a new address for each transaction (in, out, burn) then no one is the wiser. Again, other coins like introduce different levels of anonymity.
So while there are problems with the technology and the price is extremely speculative, I'm more interested in the applications we have yet to invent that are made possible when anyone, or any code, can communicate using decentralized networks. The real value is in the next stage of innovation we have yet to see.

There is no mechanism in bitcoin to prevent those coins from being spent. 
1. Bitcoin is a push payment network, not pull. You wouldn't know you had stolen bitcoins until after receiving them.
2. Someone or some entity would need to tag that address as a source of stolen funds. Now you are falling into the trap of trusting a third-party to tell you what bitcoins are clean or dirty.
3. Anyone can shift those coins to another coin, use an exchange, coin tumbler service, and bob's your uncle.

Guys, it's important to have a certain amount of skepticism considering how little weight is given to facts these days. Before investing (or dumping) any investment, do your research into what it is you are actually investing. There are so many people who are eager to give you advice because they usually stand to gain financially from your decisions. The basis of science is peer review. You cannot confirm on your own what will happen to the "price" of bitcoin at any point in the future, but you can verify with simple maths that it does work today. Be careful out there, happy hodling.

The most simplest way of explaining it is you basically announce to the blockchain funds which you add to the network, and then you can do near instant transactions "off the chain" for almost no fees. Then when you are done the final balance is updated to the underlying bitcoin ledger.
There's a lot of complicated routing between you and your destination, which finds the optimal, cheapest route, and manages the connections for you so it's practically no different than normal bitcoin transactions.
Instead of having to put every coffee transaction directly on the blockchain forever, we just have opening and closing settlements, like a periodic statement of transactions. It's still pretty raw but and under supported, but it is the scaling solution we've been waiting for!

This is only going to get harder if your plan is to seek out new crypto friendly credit cards. All of these traditional banking institutions have already started blocking these transactions *for your protection*.
Consider earning bitcoin. Offer products and services for bitcoin only or bitcoin discounted rates. If you buy it on credit and it tanks, then you are trapped. If you earn it then you are debt free and can still resort to credit to come to your assistance. Try weening off the teet of the central banking system and see how far you can get.

Do not secretly mine on hardware that is not yours without permission. This is what malware does. You will get caught and you will land in trouble.
Instead, approach them and say "we can make money while no one is using these computers that we already bought for some electricity". Schools are broke and businesses are profit driven. Show them how mining works, why it's good for the network, how much things will cost vs how much they will make. You might be able to convince them to start a much larger operation than what you can accomplish on your own.

People often say "hacked" to mean "unauthorized access". This is usually from poor password management and not enabling two factor authentication. Yes, poloniex handled things poorly, but that's only after you handled things poorly by not securing your account. Imagine that's all they deal with day in and day out.
This is why people always say DO NOT LEAVE YOU MONEY ON AN EXCHANGE. Exchanges are not wallets. Assume the worst, they suffer a real hack, go down for long periods of time, rogue employee, literally none of that would bother you.

Bitcoin does not recognize jurisdiction. 


That's been tried, and they stop because it becomes expensive for little results.


That was a long time ago. People are learning exchanges are not to be trusted and to not keep their funds in third-party hands.


Most likely. But bitcoin is incredibly conservative compared to other cryptos, and new things are tested for months before being considered ready for production.


It's not a company with expectations of grow, it's a medium.


That's evolution at work. The strongest survives.


They do so at great expense. Don't play by the rules, don't get paid.

Not your keys, not your bitcoin. These third-parties could be hacked and disappear with your money overnight. Never leave money on the exchange longer than it needs to be.
The absolute best way of storing coins is a cold wallet with a hardware device, which stores your private keys in a way so they are never exposed to the internet. The two tested options are trezor or ledger, but those are on backorder.
The second best way, which is best for real life purchases, is a hot or warm wallet on your phone or computer. Still there's risk since the keys could be monitored with some yet-to-be-discovered security hole, but for small amounts it's more convenient. I hear good things about electrum, mycleium, samurai.

Governments, businesses of all sizes, google, amazon, facebook. It's all just using software and hardware made by people, and that has bugs. All of the exchanges will get hacked eventually. It's up to you to never keep anything you aren't willing to lose on the exchange. Hackers target these because they are centralized. It's more incentive to find a weakpoint in a single system that contains lots of people's money, than say, trying to brute force wallet seeds or breaking into your house to find your ledger.

The problem is people are used to the old financial system of authority. Where everything will get taken care of after you die so you only need to plan if you have a lot of money. Otherwise the government will likely end up taking everything.
The people who grow up using bitcoin, who know that their seed security is paramount, will come up with entirely new ways of handling their money after they have died that is just not possible with fiat. I can think of a few possible ways right now: dead man switch with a 1 year ping time, key distribution to attorney / loved ones, online content where the winner receives funds.
We have far more control over what happens to our money after death than we have ever imagined. So at the very least, make it so someone can get your seed after death. Once you do that, you can get creative.

I think the percent of people who actually believe in tether are a small, tiny minority. There's another group of people, myself included, who consider it another centralized alt coin, audit or not. There are people who will invest on TA, market indicators, news stories, and there are those who just want to develop with the technology and aren't affected by the market. I don't think an insolvent tether will permanent damage the crypto landscape, it will make the survivors who come out stronger than before.

You are mixing a lot of different things together which is why you are confused.
Bitcoin core wallet is a full node, not a cold wallet. It keeps a copy of the blockchain so you can use it to verify your transactions since you control it and know it is following consensus rules. You can use it for sending and receiving money but it does not provide a secure method of key storage. You need to have it online for it to have a blockchain worth a damn.
Cold wallets do not store the blockchain, they store the keys in an airgapped, non-networked fashion. They usually don't store any version of the blockchain, just query nodes (such as your bitcoin core wallet) for any relevant information.

My question is what are the benefits of using a tumbler versus just using a new address for every transaction? How is sending your coins to a third-party, which is "marked" as a coin tumbler, make the coins you receive any more private?
I'm a programmer and have contemplated creating a coin tumbler, but I just can't figure out why anyone would actually use it over just sending funds to new addresses they also control. The only benefit I can think of is time delaying. But again, does that really obscure your money if it's coming from an address that is a known tumbler.

You got it. Your seed &gt; one way function that generates a string = your private key
Only those words can generate the private key when run through the function (or hashing algorithm as it's actually called). This is how those words can always unlock your funds because they will always turn into your private key.
You would waste a lot of time, energy, and computing power trying to guess all of the possible combinations. If you can guess someone else's 24 word seed, that's basically the bitcoin equivalent of winning the universal lottery.

Welcome! There is no bad time to buy. There are only bad times to sell. Good on you for wanting to take your bitcoin out and not leave it on the exchange. Not your keys, not your bitcoin!
Wallets security are grouped by cold &gt; warm &gt; hot. I can only really recommend cold for any term storage, but that requires special hardware or really strong precautions to generate private keys (not a windows machine, no internet connection). But medium and hot wallets are perfectly fine for small amounts (that you are ok with if lost or stolen, like cash).
Cold: hardware wallets (trezor, ledger), paper wallet (generated offline on a secure generator)
Warm and Hot: a mobile or desktop software based wallet. It's warm if you have multi-signature so there isn't a single point of failure. It's a hot wallet if you can receive and send funds with little effort.

Do not invest in bitcoin. Invest in skills that allow you to earn and spend crypto. Check around your area for people and businesses dealing in bitcoin. This should give you an idea if there is much use for bitcoin for you. Sell some things and your talents for bitcoin. Work for it and find new ways to moneytize your time for crypto. This way, whatever the coin of the month is, you are still able to make an income to live off of. If you are lucky you will never have to deal with an exchange. That is how you invest in bitcoin.

Dollars? gold? I just wanted to know what you would do with bitcoin if there was no cryptocurrency exchange or stock market equivalent. Maybe if you had some idea for a project or whatever. If it's just an asset to invest and make money off of then there are more predictable / stable markets like dollars and gold.

Honestly, there's nothing stopping every person on the planet from making their own coin. People and companies like starbucks will do this because they hate themselves for being late to the party, but don't want to show up empty handed. All this will do is create a digital gift card system. But the people have already tasted decentralized blood, and starbucks being a massive company that likes money, will quickly be singing a different song.

So it might be fun to experiment with a paper wallet then. Format a new system, preferably linux. Use something like  or  if you want QR codes. At this point you disconnect the computer from the net and generate the code locally. If you were using the code for serious money, you would wipe the OS before connecting it again. If it was for really serious money you would destroy the hard drives and motherboard in an ecologically friendly manner.
A better breakdown:  Notice is says not to use paper wallets anymore but if you are learning it can be a novelty.

Any blockchain explorer, full node browser. And as for retrieving those funds, vigilantism is never okay. This is the function of law enforcement, using good old fashion police work. Looking at the addresses to see where it ends up. If it comes across addresses of known exchanges or businesses.
The real focus should be educating people to secure their own money and to not fall for these scams. We are distributing the work a criminal has to accomplish to steal money. Instead of a hacker stealing info and finances from millions of people at once, they will have to go person to person waiting to get lucky. And if that person is wise to the scheme, or uses a multisig wallet then the hacker ends up with nothing.
The good of this technology will overshadow the bad. There will also be people looking to make easy money, and they might even switch to legitimate bitcoin businesses because it would just be a better use of their time than constantly failing to steal it.

It's a central point of failure, which is inevitable they will fail. You only need to trust them long enough to get your money in, swap, and get your money out. If you need to verify your ID, that's usually done with a third party anyway so that isn't really at risk. Plus, in today's crypto revolution, it's relatively worthless.

if you send it, yes. If you import the same private keys, no. it would be the same wallet.

Adding more zeros will increase the amount a bitcoin can be divided by without adding more bitcoin. Say you have 50 satoshi, the current smallest unit, or .00000050 BTC. If we increase the max decimal places from 8 to 12, you now have .000005000000 BTC, which is still 50 satoshi, but it's also 5,000,000 nano btc. The total number of BTC has not changed, we are simply increasing the amount that a single bitcoin can be divided by, so even if the value of bitcoin is over $1 million for example, there are still easily accessible smaller units. If all but 1 bitcoin was forever lost, we could still divide that one enough so everyone could still get their hands on some without printing new ones.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:37:04
Nowhere. You just have to do your best to create something that you think will benefit bitcoin and its users, and the users will let you know if they accept it. There's no CEO of bitcoin that decides what does or doesn't fly. Anyone who claims they are the CEO of bitcoin is a scammer.

These companies are primarily gate keepers of data, only letting you access your walled garden of information under strict control of their ecosystem.

Am a miner. If a mining pool wants to you register, then find a new mining pool. I'm not saying they don't have websites. But to sell your information you have to give your information. This is from the mining pool that I use:
**Getting Started**
There is no need to register an account with us, simple enter the monero address you wish to be paid out to as your username. Examples for different miners are further down the page. If you need to create a monero wallet, we recommend MyMonero.
**Connection Details**
There are multiple mining pool servers in various locations. Select the closest one to you in order to reduce the number of expired shares. If located in Europe we recommend using pool.minexmr.com since this will be more resilient in the event of one of our hosting providers experiencing issues.
Europe (France, Germany): pool.minexmr.com
France: fr.minexmr.com
Germany: de.minexmr.com
Canada: ca.minexmr.com
Mining Ports blah blah blah and so on. You can start mining to a pool using that information above and an open source miner, no registration or tracking cookies period.

Keys should never be stored on an internet connected device, especially now that we know about exploits like specter and meltdown which allow hardware level snooping. If you do generate keys / seed on a normal computer, never connect it to the internet again.
Which is why a full node is not a good choice to generate your private keys because it basically has to stay online 24/7. Otherwise your version of the blockchain will quickly become out of date. You need to keep your keys on a separate hardware device (ledger, trezor) or manually approve transactions on an offline computer and typing things out manually.
Honestly, you have you assume most security measures have been broken in secret and are being exploited by governments and hackers. Which is why a paper wallet is simply the most secure, because what is stopping someone from guessing your seed is more computing power available on earth for the next 50-100 years.

* Mnuchin was co-chairman of the trio's movie company, Relativity Media, but left seven months before it went bankrupt.
* Mnuchin's mother was a longtime investor with Bernie Madoff.
* During the hearing, it was also noted that Mnuchin had failed to disclose $95 million of real estate that he owned and his role as director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund in a tax haven. Mnuchin described the omissions as mistakes made amid a mountain of bureaucracy.
* Between June and September 2016, Mnuchin donated over $400,000 to the Republican Party, including donations to Paul Ryan and Donald Trump.

AFAIK they are all safe, it's an offline hardware wallet. There are security measures on the device that sign the firmware, so the package doesn't even come with a tamper proof sicker. Even if someone managed to do the impossible, it's not internet connected / does not report back it's keys. The device cannot transmit the seed.
Even if you received one that was already programmed (which is how scammers actually steal your coins, because they know the seed), you can just reprogram it. 
I get that you should not trust anything, especially from random people, with your keys, but am I wrong in thinking there is no way anyone can rework the firmware in a way so they can know your private keys on an offline hardware device?

Open source, decentralized apps are the way to go folks. We are reaching a point where we cannot trust ANY third party since we have no idea how they work. Crypto is going to save the world, not by making us rich, but by removing all trust in people and putting it in code. 
Imagine running the "code" for facebook on your machine and all data was blockchain based. Facebook wouldn't need a single server and you can see exactly how your data was being used. Obviously this would never work for facebook because they directly profit off your data, which is exactly what we need to eliminate.
I don't think we are far out from the average person being able to understand the difference between open sourced, decentralized systems and proprietary, closed sourced applications.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:52:42
Of course not. Coinbase didn't always suck. They got crushed by their popularity. It's hard to sympathize with centralized exchanges for decentralized currencies, but that's just the beast we have to deal with until enough people get their hands on crypto. Then decentralized currencies will reign supreme, with zero downtime, no central point of failure, etc.

The only way anyone can do harm to bitcoin would be to invest all of their time and money to purchase hardware specifically used for bitcoin, only to make bitcoin worthless.

I love how bad the news, wall street, everyone who made their way slow and steady using old money ways just wants bitcoin to fail. Some of them can't even continue their normal white collar crimes anymore because fighting bitcoin is a 24/7 operation.
And because crypto is unregulated, it's so obvious these people who go on TV and tell you price predictions, are trying to create a dip big enough to get back in. The higher it goes, the bigger of a dip they will try to create. They won't bother with understanding what it is until they've spent a good part of their life hoarding as much as they can buy.

I'd start with what you already know, software / e-commerce developer, find any centralized bottlenecks or vendors that people hate to deal with and go from there. Although, as a software developer, you really need to go through the "obsession" phase of bitcoin. I've been going through it for a few weeks now. Just pacing around thinking about ways bitcoin can disrupt just about everything. There are applications we couldn't even imagine before are now trivial because of the blockchain.
So first things first, learn everything about what bitcoin is (not just a little). Mastering bitcoin is recommended reading, free and open source right here

I agree Bitcoin has a serious learning curve, that requires either people learning new things or we have to come up with better analogies / terms. Older people are not quick to adopt the latest thing, but I can say my grandmother texts regularly and is a facebook junkie. They will use whatever their loved ones use. Because those things are incredibly technological yet their interfaces have been flushed out.
I do not agree that banks are 100 times safer. This is the fallacy that they use to take your money and loan it to the next customer. Do a search for "bank hacked" and all of them have been hit. Sometimes it's done with 0-day exploits that sit inside all hardware and software until sold to a hacker, sometimes it's susan from HR who falls for a phishing link. Card skimmers on atms will never fall out of style. 
The issue at hand is centralization. A hacker would love to spend all of their efforts going after one system with everyone's money (from the other side of the world), rather than physically breaking into peoples homes looking for recovery seeds just miles from where they live. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:34:41
GDAX has 0 fees for transfers, withdraws, or maker orders (but taker does have a fee). 
Paypal and coinbase (and gdax) are all registered money transfer entities and subject to the same laws and rules. Online balances and bank accounts are insured against wrongdoing by the FDIC, but they are also susceptible to being frozen if the systems think you have done wrong. Also, paypal makes lots of money from selling your information to just about everyone who wants to buy it: 
The important thing is to not leave anything of value on either since they are both targets for hackers. Your crypto is not insured by anyone at this point so if you let it sit on an exchange you'll learn an expensive lesson!
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:32:05
It should be said, bitcoin mining is primarily done on specialized hardware that only does one type of calculation. GPUs are not optimized in that way, and are used for coins like etherium, monero, zcash. If you want to mine bitcoin you'll need an ASIC, or several of them, space to put them because they are loud, cheap power, etc.
If you wanted a single GPU system that you can play the occasional game on, then you won't be mining bitcoin on it. Video cards are in short supply, and the ones you can find are more than your budget allows for. 
Which means the most efficient way is to just buy the currency you want with the money you have, leaving some for a hardware wallet to securely store your funds.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:23:42
It's the exact same thing. People trust these companies because they have built a reputation of monitoring and declaring threats. If you do a search for "false positive help" or similar you'll see every single one has a way for you to appeal in case your legit activity is marked as fraud.
Your business can be shutdown in the case these fraud tools refusal to whitelist your totally legitimate operation, for whatever reason. If you try to take your case to the internet, everyone will just side with the authority because who are they going to believe, symantec or realguitarvendor.com?
This company is going down that same path: trust our algorithm and trust our methods of determining who you should trust. Also if you think you are wrongly marked by the system, prove us wrong. It's the exact same thing.

The story behind that is very anecdotal depending on who you ask. My interpretation is that it's mainly about blocksizes and scaling.

3. There's no reason to use it! I can call up my friend and meet up at the pub to show my photo album of cat pictures. You just can't ever replicate that experience when you have to follow all of the steps of connecting to the world wide web with that god awful noise, so painful!

We need to stop pretending like our personal information, combined with metadata, was any safer in the hands of "trusted" third-parties, who might encrypt your data but give up the keys to wide reaching and sometimes warrant-less searches.
Law enforcement should love the blockchain because it puts everything out there in the open. The problem is they now have to do real police work to determine who is who instead of getting overly broad treasure troves of private information directly from companies.

I think the problem lies in you thrusting any amount of money around in an entirely new technology and expecting resemblance of how things used to be done (easy internfaces, password resets, tech support). There's a reason why we have warning labels like "don't point the laser in your eye" because people went and pointed lasers in their eyes and that's kinda where we are with bitcoin.
You really need to stop, take like a week's worth of breath, go for a walk, do something that isn't exploding at people who have nothing to do with the situation you put yourself in. Learn what bitcoin is, like for real. You can't trust anyone else to take care of this for you. The sooner you come to terms with what you are dealing with, the better off you will be, and maybe you'll even have a better way of explaining things that could be useful to others.

Sure it does. If we don't have enough bitcoins being circulated because people hold, smaller increments have smaller value, easier to spend, money keeps moving.

The problem is you are consolidating power at the top of a pyramid. It's almost guranteed this "not bank" will make more percent wise than the depositors. This is because mining costs money! So we need more money to buy more equipment, and power, and staff to maintain it. And that will inevitably lead to using more funds being spent than what would allow everyone to withdraw 100% of their money. If you are going to create a not bank, then try not to be exactly a bank. And again, we have much better alternatives like cloud mining or mining pools which let you keep your own hardware, just realize small but steady returns.

Any decision to increase the blocksize would be obsolete by the time it came to be. I'll use a nice and simple example. If you have a highway with lots of traffic, adding more lanes doesn't stop the congestion. And you can't always expand the highway because people freaking live there. If you do manage to add more lanes you just end up with more traffic on more lanes. Lightning and segwit is adding busses and hovercars without adding new lanes. That is bitcoin.

Bitcoin does not recognize borders. All it takes is two Australians conducting business with each other using bitcoin, you don't need permission. It does not need to be "accepted". You just use it.
They can't ban it because of the reason above: it does not require permission and it does not abide by any one country's laws. 
As for hiding it, you can't. It isn't really anonymous as everything is public on the blockchain. You can make sure to deal with only cash / bitcoin to avoid any transaction being linked to a bank card. But if someone could be monitoring addresses for activity they are looking for.

Well, bitcoin is not compatible with censorship. KYC and ATM laws simply cannot be enforced by any central authority because bitcoin does not have a central authority.

The trick is how. Only the first as last transactions are put on the blockchain. You can have countless 'off-chain' transactions between participants of the lightning network, for a few satoshis and near instant confirmations. It only bothers to make it "official" when the channel is closed and the final balances are submitted for mining approval. We don't need to put every coffee transaction on the blockchain, but instead it's taking all coffee purchases and just putting the final score on the blockchain.
I'd recommend watching Andreas Antonopoulos, he is a long time user and advocate of bitcoin and has many great analogies to commonly asked questions.

Welcome to the regulated financial system that we have had for decades: a 'trusted' middleman can take and send money from both participants at any time.
If you gave money to a scam and wanted a charge back you would probably get it back and hurt the scam from continuing. If you gave money to a legit operation but still feel scammed (like fear or missing out at all time high) you can still get your money back. Consumer protections are why you even deal with these companies instead of just cash. The issue is when capital one starts making decisions you don't like because others have problems.

Forget about the price of bitcoin for a second. What you have left is a decentralized, peer to peer, deflationary, programmable currency that allows you to be your own bank, and securely store and send money to anyone in any country without permission of a bank. And that capability is available today. Bitcoin is precisely for people like you, that need to send money across the world to a different currency. 
Of course, today it suffers from volatility, high-ish fees, and not enough people have it so you gotta deal with exchanges. But when those barriers fall, are you still going to be using bitcoin short term?

If you see bitcoin as an investment, you're going to have more questions than answers. You will try to make money and you will fail spectacularly, maybe go broke if you invest more than you can afford.
If you treat bitcoin as a global, permissionless, peer-to-peer system of exchanging value where parties don't have to trust each other to conduct business, you'll be set for life. Slowly acquire some, ride the dips, explore new ways of acquiring it instead of buying it, you're going to be much better off when you are able to take control of your own financial future.
If you want solid returns, put some money into a 401k, buy some stocks, savings bonds.

Placing, executing, or closing orders takes miliseconds which should make it clear there's an internal order book managed by the exchange. It's only a blockchain transaction when you withdraw it.

Tether and the federal reserve are apples to apples. Both are based on the trust and assurance of the central entity that also happens to print money when it wants to without any real outside oversight. Except tether has no legal obligation whatsoever to backup their claims as they aren't regulated.
Various crypto exists for various needs, but bitcoin cannot be regulated in that way. It's a trustless, decentralized medium of exchange and store of value. If you want to trust a currency because your government says so then decentralized, trustless systems aren't what you really want after all.

This may be an unpopular opinion but I really like what you did here. You really take into account the philosophy of the technology and put the emphasis on the bit and not the coin.

Next to the mastercard circles and visa bars, bitcoin blocks would be [eventually] instantly recognizable.

From the [bitcoin whitepaper]( section 2. Transactions (pdf adds the weird spaces) doesn't mention by name, but it refers to a "company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank".


Nothing is stopping them. Anyone can fork the bitcoin chain or start a new crypto (we have over 1300 atm). But why haven't they done so already? Because they are exactly where they want to be, and are not in the business of adapting to the latest technologies.


Owning bitcoin doesn't decide the blockchain consensus, that would be the miners. See section 11 in the whitepaper to see the impracticality of altering the blockchain. And they would need buy all of the bitcoin from all of the current owners, even more impossible!


They agree over the blockchain with the consensus algorithm. I don't mean it like we are club members and promise to think a certain way. It's just a protocol.

Private entities will definitely get into crypto insurance, they already do. The chances of the federal reserve ever backing crypto are close to none. If they do it's because they realize it's already too late for them and they won't have any more power than your average miner.
Severing our reliance on the federal reserve is not a matter of opinion, it's hard coded into the bitcoin protocol and agreed upon by everyone who uses bitcoin. Naturally, the old way of doing things like insurance, customer service, plastic cards will exist to help people make the transition, but over time the highly techy things involved with key management for example will be simplified and normalized overtime.

So there's a lot of feedback I could give, it's a 1+ hour video after all, but I just wanted to pick one: there has been no deliberate intrusion of a strongly generated private key. However, there are few successful guesses of weaker keys. "123456", etc.
Other than that, really meaty video (still just a third of the way through at the time of my comment). I like how you explain it in a way that you can basically do this stuff on paper.

Let's take a step back here. Is this really an easy way to make money? You're dealing with a volatile market, KYC exchanges, etc. Not what I would call easy, just the standard way for speculators and investors. 
An easy way would be selling your time or a product for bitcoin. Then you used that to buy other goods and services from others, and then repeat. Like do fiverr but with crypto.

So you exchange the BTC to FIAT on the exchange. The bank doesn't need to know or care because they aren't dealing with the crypto, they are dealing with the FIAT which was already given to you because you passed the KYC/AML checks of the exchange (I assume). What I'm saying is why would the bank even know it was an original bitcoin purchase, unless you told them? Doesn't really matter, just tell them to accept it or you will take your large sums of money to a bank that will take it.
And honestly, you sould have avoided this hassle if you just kept your money in bitcoin and spent it directly.

First of all, congrats. Based on your OP, I think you should go with your first instinct and keep holding on to the domain for years. Make sure it's completely paid to the max number of years, and your registration is up to date so you can always be reached. 
If these chinese buyers were seriously interested, THEY should be responsible for translators, especially if they sought you out. 
Have you considered keeping the domain, and exploiting it yourself? This is of course the hardest option, that would require way more effort and work than simply selling. If you sell, you will forever watch how the domain is used, and might even regret watching it become something worth magnitudes more than what you sold for.
However, it is yours to do with as you please, and if there's a price you are willing to be content with, then so be it. YOU have what people what, make sure you have thought it through and are not rushed to make a decision. Good luck in the future.

A central bank holding Bitcoin is a terribly DUMB thing. It's basically admitting defeat in a game where they have been winning the whole time because they write the rules.

Replace bitcoin with contraceptives, abortions, medical marijuana, gay marriage, or any disruptive technology (VHS, the internet, voip, email, social media).

Yes. Technically speaking, in order for bitcoin to survive, it needs just two computers validating the blockchain. So it would take a cataclysmic global event (a solar flare destroying all technology) to effectively kill bitcoin.

I'm confused. You bought the bitcoin 4-5 years ago and how did you exchange it for fiat? Surely you used an exchange which would more likely be the one giving you crap about AML and KYC. The exchange to bank transfer should go without problem. If they refuse, tell them you will take your business elsewhere, and actually take your business elsewhere.

You are almost there. As soon as you have $10.01 in circulation, then you are dealing with an inflationary currency, which is not what bitcoin is. Whatever solution you come up with cannot add a single bitcoin past the 21 million. Adding more decimal places preserves this rule.
If there was only $10.00 that exists and we couldn't print more, we then change allowed decimal places to $10.00000000. This way the TOTAL number of dollars is unchanged by creating more PARTS of the same whole. Which are worth much less and easily tradable for everyday things, etc. Cents would still be the first two places but the doodlycents would be the new amounts way on the end.
This is how you have more money to circulate without adding more money. Obviously we can't do this with fiat money, since you will need to mint new forms to represent smaller units (the opposite of inflation which mints new money to represent larger quantities, like 10,000,000,000 afghan note). Never has this ever happened because the mere act of minting new money is inflationary.
With a digital currency however, we CAN just add more zeros. If a satoshi buys a used car, and you want bread, you can now use 5 doodlysatoshis which is a fraction of the old satoshi. I don't know how else to explain it. If it helps, we will still have new bitcoins for another 120 years or so we'll have enough time to figure it out.

Back. This article seems completely obvious to me, but it might not be for others, especially those who want to change bitcoin to compete with alts. You pretty much nailed it. Bitcoin isn't going to do one thing better than the 5 coins who exist just to do that one thing, but it's not supposed to. It's the vanilla, the conservative base that allows you (the community) do with it what you want. We can't have every damn coffee or weed purchase sitting in plain sight for all of time. We need layers for scalability, privacy, and whatever else we want.
If bitcoin is a highway running thought a town, you can't just keep increasing the number of lanes every time you have traffic. You don't change all the signs to confuse the regulars because new people are starting to use it. You don't rebuild the whole road just because you have an accident. Bitcoin tries to intelligently reduce traffic jams, keep the same signs forever, and cut down the chances of an accident.
Choice article!

The banks are not changing a single thing: CEO's are still being paid 10,000x their lowest paid employee, interest rates are still comically low, they are engaging in the same activities that lead to the subprime mortgage crisis, except with more money, nothing has been innovated except for new fees.

I'm going to guess around a month (or less). The more I researched bitcoin the less I saw it as an investment. It's not at all an investment like a stock or treasury bond. It's a protocol, like email or http. It is programmable so two computers can openly communicate in a trustless fashion without any intermediary or human intervention. It is censorship resistant and does not recognize any border or authority that is not coded into the node software. It is so many things, but an investment is the last thing that it is.

The only reason we need kickstarter or gofundme is because it's hard to handle money from people over the internet. Bitcoin eliminates the middleman, a smart contract and multisig wallet can replace the core business model.
This idea is obsolete simply by the fact that increased bitcoin adoption will inevitably lead to increased adoption of smart contracts. No need to trust a middleman and pay a fee when you can just advertise your campaign for free over social media.

I get it's fun to come up with fancy ways of saying "go kill yourself", but you might be confusing me knowing you can't censor a censorship resistant technology with condoning child porn. This problem is much bigger than any part bitcoin plays and there is no easy solution to the problem.
Try to comprehend, there's no point in making in making a fuss in how technology is used, we should be going after the people responsible with everything in our power. The monsters behind child porn are documenting their crimes with cell phones, from their private property, and selling them over the internet.
My "stupid fucking thought" is the same idea Interpol is using to go after offenders with their Trace an Object program:  This is obviously a legal and ethical way to track offenders, but we can't always wait for the law enforcement to do the right thing in a timely manner when missing and abused children are involved.

How can you be sure it's coinbase? If you use gmail, you should be using this simple trick: if your email is example you can sign up for sites using e.xample or e.x.a.m.p.l.e and it all routes to your address. You can also do something like example+coinbase which also routes to your email without needing to set anything up. If you start getting spam you can see which email was sold.

Credit cards have been around for 50+ years. I don't think it's fair to compare it to a technology that is less than a decade old.
What we can compare is the number of people who have access to lines of credit versus the number of people who have access to the internet. If you are developing an internet product you expect your cusomers to have internet. Anyone with an internet connection have make, trade, spend bitcoin. The number of people who have a working credit card is much smaller.

Yes. If you put a limit buy/sell order on the books, it only goes through when there is a corresponding sell/buy. Some exchanges like GDAX don't even let you buy/sell from yourself (but weirdly enough allow bots so volume can be inflated). If you place a market order, you are buying/selling from the exchange. They can only do this because they have liquidity, or risk collapse if people decide to run with their deposits.

The house is worth 50 bitcoin or the down payment is 50 bitcoin? And mortgage payments are monthly. If bitcoin changes hugely on year to year, you could refinance. Anyway, doing the same thing we did with old money and just doing it with bitcoin is not always the best way. It works for now, but imagine there will be some entirely new ways to borrow money.

I've never bought a house, but I think everything is locked per the agreement. Unless you have a variable interest rate (which you shouldn't, always go fixed).

It's probably going to be more stable than anything we've ever seen before, because it's completely predictable monetary policy enshrined in code that we have never had in history.

You can check your address on a block explorer to see the transactions in, and the fee. Also, use GDAX for all functions and not coinbase. 0 fee maker orders and they eat the transfer fees (free). You are giving coinbase free money (you could be spending on crypto) just to use their mobile app.

Here is the same situation on GDAX
* Current price is 5
* You put a limit buy order for 4.99. If the price falls to 4.99 or less, you pay 4.99, with no fees.
* You put a limit sell order for 5.01. If the price rises to 5.01 or more, you pay 5.01, with no fees.
They also cover the withdraw and deposit fees. It's the same company as GDAX, except it's for traders. Give it a look so you don't pay a huge markup and fees for every transaction.

Yes, it's the underlying exchange behind coinbase, owned and operated by the same company. Here is how coinbase works:
1. Bitcoin price is 100
2. You click buy and price is 125
3. You click sell and price is 75
4. additional fee on top
What a scam! However, if you do everything through GDAX:
1. bitcoin price is 100
2. You set limit sell order for 100.01, if price goes to 100.01 or higher, you sell it for 100.01
3. You set limit buy order for 99.99, if price goes to 99.99 or lower, you buy it for 99.99.
4. You don't pay a fee for these "maker" orders.
Autobuy is great to average in your buys but it's just throwing money away. Check out this video series on how to use GDAX

Mining month to month is a bad idea, which is why no one does that. People who run massive mining operations know that they can't predict the PRICE of bitcoin on any given day, but they have a pretty good idea on the AMOUNT of bitcoin they can generate.

1. Citizens spend their money buying crypto.
2. Government makes it illegal to have crypto.
3. ????
What happens here? There are no longer legal avenues for the citizen to exchange their illegal asset for legal money anymore. They basically have to become a criminal to do so. So if they are ok with being a criminal "just once" does that make them a bad person? Would people simply "delete" their access, throwing away the money, spare change, life savings they put into crypto? Would they just keep the crypto hidden until it becomes legal or when they travel to countries where it isn't banned? People break the law all the time because they think they won't get caught, how will this be any different? A ban on crypto is an incredibly ineffective solution to the problem.

General computing software and hardware like desktops and mobile phones are connected to the internet and contain secret exploits which no one knows about. If you stored your private keys on these devices, there's a chance someone (or several governments) are just watching and waiting to take it. And as you know, the keys control the coin.
A hardware wallet places your keys on a device which is not internet connected. Unlike a paper wallet, which forces key-reuse and time consuming spend process, a hardware wallet simplifies the process of "air-gapping" your private keys. It also adds some safeguards a paper wallet does not have like pin-code and support for additional crypto currencies.

Inspect some of the more recently updated forks of pywallet to see if they have commits relating to your bestblock issue and trying those out.

Also, how do you know they don't have bitcoin already? When they voted to kill net neutrality, it's likely they all had unmetered fiber connections which were exempt since always. When they voted to kill healthcare, they all have free, unlimited healthcare not effected by their vote. If any politician comes out again bitcoin, you can pretty much guarantee they are already directly profiting from it.

I think you are using price and value interchangeably, but there is a distinction. Price is speculative ($ amount) but value is easier to define (decentralized, permisionless, etc.)
And you are right about moving coins off of the exchange but for the wrong reason. Merely being on the exchange, and not locked in an order, has no effect on the market. Bots look at the orderbook not at the exchange's wallet which stores everyone's coin. Once you place an order, it's visible to all for the duration of the order.
It's a massive security risk trusting your trustless decentralized currencies to a custodian, especially if you have no intention of trading it. Exchanges are not wallets, they are targets for hackers and you have no guaranteed recourse if funds are stolen.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:33:26

Exchanges could do this without needing to pay a third-party: fund a multisig cold wallet with the profits of your operation. This wallet can only be accessed if a smart contract is one of the signers that detects if the warm/hot wallets have been irregularly depleted (hacking). It's laughable when you have entities diving into programmable money and then just trusting an outside entity to save them with fiat. PROGRAM THE SOLUTION.
Also, these hacks happen because they keep way too much in hot wallets to begin with.

Exchanges won't be the way to go, too much work that will gradually eat at your small sum makes it not worth. Maybe a local bitcoins type deal for someone to buy the whole block.
If you think there is a future and want to SPEND it, then your course of action is slightly different. This involves moving it to a wallet that you control the private keys, practicing secure storage behaviors, spending it on people or businesses. 
Either way, it seems like you have a good learning opportunity ahead of you, and I hope you choose to stay involved rather than cashing out.

Yes. GDAX is underlying exchange that powers coinbase, and wholly owned and operated by the coinbase company. The difference is coinbase is more for the average person who needs one click crypto shopping (ease of use but you pay for with high fees) or the high-volume, automated trader (not as easy and less overhead).
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:37:52
A coinbase purchase:
* Market rate is 100
* Buy for 110 + 5 fee
* Sell for 90 - 5 fee
* Widthdraw to wallet you control: MORE FEES.
However, using GDAX...
* Market rate is 100
* Place buy limit order for 99.99, order goes through when price is 99.99 or lower. No fee.
* Place sell limit order for 100.01, order goes through when price is 100.01 or higher. No fee.
* Widthdraw to wallet you control: no fee.

Even if a ban happens, the chances of it being final and permanent are slim, which is why people will just hodl. I mean if it's banned and they can't even sell it they will have no choice but to hodl it. If they can sell it while it's banned, then it's a pretty ineffective ban.

They are in control of the private keys, so according to the rules of crypto, it belongs to them and not you. If something were to happen like an outage, hacking, or total shutdown, you would be shit out of luck. And they hold a lot of bitcoin which makes them a juicy target. It's almost a guarantee they will fail, just a matter of when. Their support is also uninformed and useless when you need them.
Best course of action is to transfer your funds to GDAX (it's the exchange that powers coinbase, same exact owners and operators) and then you can withdraw it to a wallet you control for free (they pay the fee). I would do some more research on how the blockchain works and test with a small amount first. This is a good guide for beginners:

If you are a developer, as I am, you should already know that answer. You can deploy serverless apps, without the need for a payment processor, collecting or securing personal information, needing to worry about scaling, backups, or downtime. You can charge way less than your competitors because you don't have to deal with fraud or customer chargebacks. Yes, it's just a slow database, but the magic is in the consensus. By surrendering all control to the network you can focus on actual innovation. Instead of building the same wheel everyone has to build to protect a private database of personal information, which is just making it easier for hackers.

I hope I'm wrong about this, but I doubt they will. Ebay will lose any ability to freeze or reverse funds once payments have cleared which kinda flies in the face of their money back guarantee...




First of all, ebay doesn't actually process money. That would be paypal, which is soon to be replaced by Adyen. In order for them to maintain that power over bitcoin payments, merchants would have to let ebay/adyen hold their money for months to ensure customers have a chance to get a refund. If you chose to receive your funds quicker, customers might have to wave their right to a refund, which is scary as hell to consumers. Even if there was some multisignature magic going on, Ebay is surrendering their power to guarantee customer satisfaction.

They aren't trying to stop it. They know they can't stop it. They can't become a massive mining power overnight or take their customer's bitcoin directly. They have to acquire bitcoin the same way we all do: buying it from sellers.

Have you tried to calculate the environmental impact of the traditional financial system?
* Plastic based cards which are regularly thrown away.
* Gas spent in transporting money
* Huge electronic footprint of existing banks, which do nothing to prevent fraud.
* Energy required to smelt precious metals into bars, products, back and forth
* Printing of new paper currency because of inflation or anti-counterfeit measures. 
* Wasted real estate for banks and entire industries which exist just to handle money.
It's a system magnitudes larger than bitcoin, has an equally large environmental footprint to match, and fails to prevent double spending. I don't think the energy is wasted, it's being put to actual use and makes attacking bitcoin impractically expensive.

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:43:45
Wanna know how I know bitcoin will survive?
The bitcoin protocol, which ensures transactions are immutable and never double spent, is secured by mining. As long as the people who are spending capital, time, and electricity to secure the network, bitcoin will live on. 
Miners will actually short a small percent of their mining rewards, so that if it goes down in price (they make money), if it goes up in price, the larger percent of their holdings increases in value. If you see a long term decline in bitcoin hashing power, that is the one true sign things are bad, since the blockchain will be susceptible to attack.
As long as there are more computers securing bitcoin versus the ones who don't play by the rules, bitcoin will survive. It's really that simple. You can ignore the FUD, the news, the bans, the dips... none of that matters to the rules of bitcoin. If the people who have real skin in the game aren't sweating it, then neither should you.

Running commands on linux is knowing linux lol. I would say the biggest reason for running a full node is because it's something you have full control over and know it is following the consensus rules. By trusting a third-party host you are basically removing the benefit of running your own node, as someone could potentially intercept or manipulate your remotely hosted node. If security means anything to you, exhaust all locally hosted options first like running linux on an old computer or even on a VM.

1. Kinda. There needs to be some software to control the hardware. Define your wallet, network settings, etc. But the hardware is key.
2. Mining bitcoin on phones is a waste. You are probably mining to a pool, which gives you a smaller piece of the pie over time. But it's not yours / can't be verified as fact until you are paid out.
3. Bitcoin mining is dominated by application specific integrated circuits. If you don't use an ASIC miner, you are wasting money and electricity because ASICs are specifically for bitcoin mining and can't compete with ASIC miners.

I think it's hard to not call Bitcoin a speculative risky investment, because it's primary function for many is buying and selling it for fiat. Once developers have enough time to work on scaling, security and adoption, the volatility stops, which is boring. Then people will start being paid Bitcoin because they can spend it in more ways.

Everyone is a bank. Professional money lenders, literally anyone with dosh willing to lend it, can set whatever terms to you and you can accept to borrow it. It can all be encoded right into the smart contract. Crypto is going to open up lending to a global scale much more than traditional banks ever could. Big loans, small loans, ongoing loans, loans we have never imagined. You could lend money around the world without leaving your house. If there's any legal trouble you have everything in the public ledgers.

How does this hurt the legitimacy of bitcoin? No where does this even mention Bitcoin. If anything, you should be suspicious of bitstamp, a centralized exchange. Although, your information was likely scraped from another source and the scammer purchased / stole your info and is phishing for bitstamp logins and wire transfers.

Your thinking is fundamentally flawed. The purpose of mining is not to generate bitcoins. The purpose of mining is to validate transactions by staking electricity. There is an incentive to respect the consensus rules, you can receive the reward block \+ transaction fees. When 21 million is reached, the reward block is now practically 0, but you still receive transaction fees for validating transactions.

1. Sell your talents or products and accept bitcoin as payment.
2. Mine altcoins and exchange those for bitcoin.
3. Invest tens of thousands of pounds to buy the necessary equipment plus the hundreds in monthly electricity costs to run and power an entry level bitcoin mining operation with no guarantee of return.
4. Just buy bitcoin.

The first ones were real "forks": splitting the code, dev team, and community. Random people with nothing to do with Bitcoin spending an hour to change some variables in consensus algorithm are barely worthy of being called a "fork".

When it comes to bitcoin in today's current state, I wouldn't call legitimate but poorly optimized fees transaction spam. If you are making transactions with the pure intent of raising fees for others, that would be spam in my definition. Inefficient use of the blockchain is expected for at least another decade until off\-chain scaling and fee calculations mature.
