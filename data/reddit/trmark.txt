That would probably be because the percentage of apps that are free compared to paid on the play store is much higher than the same comparison on apple store. I don't think that article takes into account the money the devs earn through adds on their apps

Well shit, I dunno. What I do know is that when developing android apps with the use of say, Android Studio, you can select how far back you want the app to be compatible by selecting the minimum API version to support. I assume it just enables/disables different features depending on what you select.

according to  as of at Q2 of 2017 android had 87.7% of the mobile OS market share. Sounds like a smart decision to make it an android app to me

Alternatively, on the first startup, you could have an overlay with a few arrows to each icon saying what they are/do. I was confused for about 10 seconds when I opened it but I can totally see how some people would be turned off by it.

You added the update, excellent! Also just want to say I've been using the app since this thread popped up, still loving it but the only thing I've found is that graphs for some low volume coins won't load like PhantomX for example

except that is much lower res and has a much lower framerate
