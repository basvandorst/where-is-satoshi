if the system wasn't fucked we wouldn't need loans to buy them. scroll out and ask yourself why you need a loan to go to school or buy gas.

Did you sign up with a .edu email? You cant expect that coinbase can pay every new unverified account $10 if someone tried to sign up using 50 new emails should they get $500 in Bitcoin? FYI now worth $20,000

@_date: 2017-11-20 04:13:57
Total average of the last 5 year S&amp;P 500 is 11.99% what figures would you use? Edit: "According to historical records, the average annual return for the S&amp;P 500 since its inception in 1928 through 2014 is approximately 10%." (quote from investopedia)

Exactly, my real estate investment is really to offset my Bitcoin investment. The reason I am buying them for cash is because I feel like real estate is a bit overpriced and if the market turns on me I could leverage them to buy more.
I really do believe Bitcoin and crypto have just started I also believe we will see tokenization of asset investing and I am much more interested in diversifying into tokens then traditional ways.
