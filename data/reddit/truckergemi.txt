I understand it’s a question set based on theory. I do understand that for all liquid supply to dry up it would take until then. That doesn’t mean it’s not fun to think about. 
As for “who cares”, the entire expirement of bitcoin was created to find something better. I imagine even Satoshi would care.

Thanks for the well thought out replies. I think all of this is incredibly interesting. I understand what you are saying about liquidity, but that leads me to one more question.

I look forward to the day when all these lightning tips are remembered as the days when the bitcoin reddit threw around thousands of dollars a day just for the hell of it.

If it does happen, the dollar won’t really have much value, so you are probably right. No one would even think of it in terms of dollars.

So how exactly do you get these small intip satoshis into your actual wallet?
