When meeting with someone? I've done localbitcoins deals in the past, usually meet at a bank so the teller can count the money during the transaction. Nobody is going to rob anyone in a bank lobby.

I've been hodling for years, I'd prefer to trade up for a more liquid version of these BTC. BTC for BTC.

Someone asked about the series. I'll just post that response here, too.
One is original series 1 with Casacius misprint. The other is a series 2. Both brass 1 BTC funded. Both were created in 2012. The 25BTC is unfunded.

That's great, I'm happy for you. I've been in since 2010 and a BTC SW algo trader, but I'm not going to tell reddit how much I have in bitcoin cause that's stupid. I will say it's laughably more than that so in this dick measuring contest, I win. If you've made money, why are you spreading FUD on BTC? There's utility everywhere in it, I'm not preaching 100k+/btc but I think it is currently undervalued.

Whelp, it'll be pretty easy for either you or me to say "I told you so" in a year's time. We're on either side of the fence. Don't go 'warning' people of your believed future. Bitcoins are very different from the tulip craze. There was no utility in tulips, simply a speculative investment. If speculative investment is all you can see with bitcoin, I'm glad you're not a holder.
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:22:45
It's funny, for being so against bitcoin, you spend an awful lot of time on trolling. What a sad sad person.

I use 15 watts for the whole setup. I have exactly 5 eruptors + Pi + a cooling fan. Bandwidth is not high.

Did over 1B searches on my trimmed dictionary from 2010. Nothing. I'm done with this.

Website slow as shit. Non-responsive on launch day. Cannot load prices when the thing actually responds to a query. Let's see how long this lasts.
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:08:57
You're salty cause you missed out on the early investments. It's not too late, we can have this conversation again in 6 months when the price quadruples again and you get more frustrated. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:53:58
It's slow as shit, far from perfect.

I've used the one at O'Neils. Took about 30s to cash out $20. Almost quicker than a standard ATM.
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:48:37
Thanks for some clarification Gox. I appreciate the anonymity choice. It is likely I will transition over, but not before the dust settles.
@_date: 2013-02-28 15:51:43
I would like all of these addressed before moving to the new system. Shame I cannot upvote more than once.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:33:46
Sorry, but this protocol is just NYSE's Wombat API open-sourced to flush out bugs. It's a shitty protocol built on shitty software. Don't think of it as an industry standard. I wouldn't tie this to bitcoins.

Neat little app. That's great for people that don't continuously get in and out, but buy and hold.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:04:41
How would you propose those are protected against a DDOS then?
If I could compile a list of 5 top exchanges to hit in a day, what's stopping me from compiling a list of 20?
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:40:14
March 22? In less than a month, we are supposed to have a US-based MtGox derivative? That sounds like regulations will pile on and all involved will be scrutinized.
How much of my MtGox information and prior transactions will move to the US?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:09:42
Sucks for them then...
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:18:12
International wire transfer to a foreign debit card and withdraw at the local ATM. 2 days tops.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:20:02
Then enjoy the massive manipulated market that a DDoS attack gives you. Cmon.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:19
You're assuming the ping is handled by the server. There is firewall hardware out there that keeps this from being an issue. It can deny and pass through at line rate.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:53:49
No no. Just proving you are a person should be sufficient. Solve a captcha or something.
@_date: 2013-03-15 20:36:53
I assume you could, but if you wanted a drop in infrastructure for your current hft algo (bitcoin or otherwise), I am providing that. I have taken care of the data ingest, normalization, delivery and the buy/sell/query side of the exchange. Granted, if you'd like to do all that, be my guest. I am offering that work at $5 a pop, pretty cheap.

Mitigate the DDOS with a whitelist.
Have a login server farm, with distributed IP addresses, like Google.
Once the credentials of the login are validated, transfer the user to the internal server farm that is protected by a firewall that has allowed that user's IP address through on a whitelist. Every one else should be blocked at the firewall and protect your trade servers. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:20:04
Or you could use  to get it into a PayPal account linked with your bank account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:38
Much harder to get on a whitelist than to not be on a blacklist. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 22:14:56
How will the IRS be involved? Will transactions be reported and tied to my identity?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:53:00
The point is not to break anonymity, but to keep botnets from flooding the one gateway the exchange has to the outside world.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:27
Yes, and each one should be registered as 'verified'.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:44:08
Thank you sir. Updated, and MtGox apps work again. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:49:14
I would assume, yes.
@_date: 2013-03-15 20:26:50
I take in streaming data via a python script and expose it to a trading algorithm. From there, it can issue trades via the MtGox API to buy and sell coin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:51:04
I would suggest a verification email be sent to the new connection and a one time password that would be used to whitelist that new IP. This is not a difficult problem to solve.
@_date: 2013-08-06 22:22:19
too damn slow
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:18:46
Or you could get verified and link DWOLLA and wait for that whole thing to work out.

SS? It will dry up in 15 years time, it's been run like shit. 
Welfare? Look at the statistics on how well that system rehabilitates people.
Education? Look at the United States' test scores compared to other countries'. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:13:27
All good sir. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:04
Of course my argument is valid. You already go through the trouble of giving them information, they should whitelist you and disallow requests that aren't. 
Basically, they should allow you on, because you (any IP you deem valid) are on a whitelist and botnets are blocked at the hardware level before the request even hits the server.
