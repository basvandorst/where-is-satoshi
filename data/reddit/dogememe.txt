I used to watch some kind of *Asian* drama a few years back. Possibly Korean. The weather was always sunny and nice, and there were lot's of cute girls. And a few guys that always ended up in some crazy tangled, elaborate story lines, often with a lot of slap stick humor thrown in. I wish I knew the name. I'll never admit this to anyone.

That's my understanding as well, that the network will compete by offering the lowest fees possible? But then I suppose the amount of hops matters too, right? So my wallet will perhaps choose a big hub with slightly larger fees than the rest if going through it would mean the shortest route?

It only burst because Avidius Cassius sacked Ctesiphon and his men brought back smallpox into the Mediterranean Basin. This killed up to 25% of the population in the empire, and then of course the Germanic barbarians attacked Pannonia when the empire was in a weakened state and the rest is history. If only Marcus Aurelius had attacked the Germanic tribes instead of the Parthian Empire it might have lasted another thousand years.

Indeed. Did you know that the amount of gold in the roman Aureus was decreased several times since Julius Caesar? Under Diocletian it was down to 0.667 compared to the Julius Caesar Aureus (100% Au). That can't happen to Bitcoin either. :D

If you have enough faith to follow it all the way down, you'll likely also be in constant belief that it'll rebound any minute. So selling would seem super risky.

The nature of crypto opens up possibilities for other models, Antonopoulos has talked about some. One is to spread the risk by lending to thousands of different lenders. If there is a demand and the market is allowed to respond to it, solutions will emerge.

Financially speaking it seems like a bad time to sell right now with the olympics and the block halving, and everything else that's going on in the world of dogecoin. But I admire you for committing to what you believe in, although I disagree on your views on the current state of the dogecoin community. What ever happens I hope you'll still be a part of the dogecoin community and the bitcoin community, it is after all we who make it what it is.

You can use WinToUSB to run Win10 or 7 from a USB stick.
If you use a Windows 7 ISO, make sure you insert the USB stick into a USB2 only port and not a USB 3 Port.  This is because on Windows 7 there are no USB3 drivers present at boot. With Windows 10 you can boot from a USB3 port.
Make sure the machine is not connected to the internet when you generate the paper wallet and erase the USB stick when done.

Dogecoin offer the same benefits over bitcoins as Litecoin do (dogecoin is based on litecoin). In addition to the technical improvements it has an image that makes it appear trustworthy and fun to the general public, something which is much needed as bitcoin in particular has a shady image due to a lot of negative press concerning drugs, money laundering, hacks, etc. I think what we're seeing with dogecoin now is just the very beginning of something truly great.

True but Bitcoin et al will switch to a quantum resistant encryption algorithm as soon at it becomes a necessity. At that point one should transfer the btc to a new address as the wallets with the private keys stored in the cloud are potentially compromisable. This used to not be a big problem, but now it kinda is. A paradigm shift is in the cards.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:09:47
Before asking if anything matters, you need to ask if anything exist at all? To answer that question you have to figure out what knowledge is (epistemology). Then the question becomes from where does knowledge come, authority, reasoning, or experience? If you come to the same conclusion as Roger Bacon, that only experience is *"effective and able to bring peace to the intellect"*, then you're in trouble again. Because the problem of induction dictates that your next bitcoin transaction could end up not verifying. In fact, at any point in time the entire bitcoin network could stop confirming any transactions and the sun could stop rising. At least that's what Hume would have us believe. ^^^Please ^^^help ^^^me ^^^I've ^^^opened ^^^the ^^^Wikipedia ^^^page ^^^on ^^^philosophy ^^^again.

The recent price rally might have been a bubble, but Bitcoin it self isn't a bubble. Bitcoin is a global, distributed and decentralized system of value transfer. The only thing that can replace it are other global, distributed and decentralized systems of value transfer, and should that happen it would be because that system could improve on Bitcoin. Even if that were to happen, Bitcoin would never go away, and the price will never reach $0 unless someone discovers a flaw that renders the entire concept of cryptocurrencies fundamentally flawed and unworkable.

When it was at 400, I was unsure if the rest of the world would ever catch on to bitcoin. When it reached 20K I knew bitcoin had reached main stream consciousness. Now that the world knows about bitcoin, the next question I have is if the rest of the world will realize the potential of Bitcoin like I and most people here do. Only time will tell, but if they do the price will also reflect that.
If bitcoin goes down to 1-2K that will either be because someone is manipulating the market to crash the price, or because the market experience a panic due to some external factor. In either of these scenarios I believe the price would recover, as it would be a temporary artificially low price. I believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value, and now that the world knows about bitcoin I believe that value is way higher than 1-2K.

As I understand it, there is an archive of old PDFs that's a couple TB big, but these sites also allow people to access articles directly by interfacing with the sites that hosts them acting as a proxy. If the latter part was shut down, then people would be unable to access new research for free, and only the corpus of old papers would remain. Then the only option would be the legal channels (university subscriptions or paying $10 per PDF.)
