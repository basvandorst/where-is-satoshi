Look man, I’m not a dick and not tying to be one. I love that you’re using your right to stand up for something you believe in, I love doing it too. Sometimes holding your tongue is the better solution though... I would understand if the guy was on a child slavery article trolling it but it was a bad taste joke trying to take edge off of something that has a lot of people wanting to die. Just take a second sometimes to see if it’s really worth getting offended over before you go at somebody else, it might help you find a meaningful friendship one day. Putting aside differences in opinion and not taking other words people say to heart can go a long way. Sorry about the friends comment, it was uncalled for.

Not denying it’s a serious issue but you seem like the type of person who will lecture their kids when they make a joke. Those people don’t have a lot friends. Take a joke and don’t get offended in the future (even if it hurts inside). 
You do not have to do anything. I just felt strongly about this and still have no idea why I'm doing this.

Perverts with millions are still perverts.

Wrong actually. Bitcoin was conceived from the hodly blockchain. We were specifically told not to peep over at the forbidden alts but then that bitch eve couldn’t help herself.
