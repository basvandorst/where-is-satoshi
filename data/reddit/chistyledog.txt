Raising rates isn't technically the problem. The real problem was price fixing it to near 0 for so long. Interest rates needs to be decided by the free market (more savings leads to lower interest rates due to supply and demand of money)
The Fed is dumb because it leads to boom and bust cycles and facilitates inflation

That's how you get sound money. The only thing that makes sense in growing the supply of money is to grow it at the pace of economic growth.
Yeah that's where interest rates come into play, if there is less money to be borrowed for Jim and Bill has already borrowed, then Jim has to borrow at a higher interest rate because the cost of money is more expensive due to the lower supply of borrowable money.
Bill has effectively crowded out investment for Jim since they're in the same market.
Edit: if it's available to be loaned out, it's not hoarding

I wouldn't be too optimistic about his appointment. I watched an interview he had on bloomberg and he backtracked on a lot of the things he's said about in the past (especially about the gold standard)
I'm confident it's just to appease his  type supporters which constitutes a lot of his base. This one guy can't do shit anyways.

That was on the deposit rate imposed by the central bank. Negative yielding sovereign debt has never happened. 
Negative sovereign debt this widespread hurts older generations that rely on less risky fixed income assets when planning for retirement, so overall this is extremely bullish for zero interest rate assets that have no counter party risk, such as Bitcoin and gold. This doesn't even account for the massively inflationary measures central banks will undergo in order to prevent deflation that they're so fearful of due to the high levels of global debt.

The problem with equities are that nearly a majority of capital comes from passively invested index funds with people treating these funds like a savings account. A downturn would trigger a run on these funds similar to how people would make a run banks in the past.
 I get what you're saying about how certain sectors would benefit, but something broader like the S&amp;P or the Dow would get killed in a bear market. The current level of passive investing now compared to previous cycles will be a bane to equities in general.

Where in history have you heard of negative nominal interest rates? Everything I've read has indicated that it has never occurred outside of the last decade (or 21st century at the very least).


It's presence is indicative of QE measures that have inflated bond prices and created a sovereign debt bubble. I don't doubt that it's temporary only because I think bond investors are speculating that central banks will further inflate bond prices, so they're planning on selling these bonds to central banks.

I agree. This is why I despise politicians who scapegoat the rich. I'm not even close to rich myself, but instead of hating the players people need to be aware of the rules of the game set by the State and central banks.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:16:21




I think the opposite is true. All they need to prevent deflation is some sort of UBI bypassing the treasury and straight to our bank accounts. People are going to realize how the rich are actually getting richer, and they're not going to be okay with QE just for the rich anymore. Sounds crazy, but 3-5% Core PCE would be better than deflation or hiking interest rates to stem inflation.
This sort of interest rate hike would require massive corporate defaults (all corporate BBB bonds going junk) and probably global sovereign debt crises. Moreso the US than anywhere since we have more unfunded obligations to service. The Fed will do anything to prevent this. Helicopter money, buying shitty corporate bonds, municipal bonds, basically anything. 
Either way a sovereign debt crisis for the US is inevitable as foreign central banks will be less likely to finance our debt and send dollars back to the States if we're just going to monetize it. We're really in a damned if you do damned if you don't situation.
This sort of situation is probably 2-3 credit cycles away, but I can't see a scenario where this doesn't happen regardless.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:48:54


I don't see this deflation due to deleveraging happening like it has in the past because I don't see interest rates rising in the near future. People pay off debts to prevent the cost of the higher servicing of this debt. I think it's more likely we'd hit an inflationary recession (stagflation) because central banks will do anything to prevent deflation due to high debt levels. They'd rather ZIRP/NIRP and print sooner rather than later. Even helicopter money if they have to. The level of populism rn tells me  we'd get a "QE for the people" so us commoners don't start bringing out the guillotine.

I sure hope it doesn't happen. But it's not all that far-fetched in [mainstream]( [economics](
Besides, the voting populace is too dumb to understand what money is. Even this Yang guy has convinced a sizable group that he can administer $1k a month pretending it can all come from taxes.

Lol. I mean at or below 08-09 levels. Outside of the big tech companies, many US companies would collapse under their own weight if interest rates were allowed to rise.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:39:48
You're incredibly misinformed. The defense budget is a fraction of what comprises most of our debt -- entitlements for the boomers.
Taxing the wealthy removes their ability to grow the pie and instead legitamizes borrowing from our (unborn) kids for present consumption. Nothing the government spends counts as investment as it doesn't lead to a profit/create value. Even throwing more money at public education just pays teachers and administrators without actually helping the kids.

The problem with lending from creating money out of nothing is that you have non productive assets increase in paper value. So FRB for a business makes sense as its productive whereas FRB for homes doesn't and overprices real estate and thus rent.
Also disinflationary currencies would not have excessively high interest rate, it would have lower rates because as the currency increases in value it would cheaper to borrow.
Imagine a high inflationary currency, those are more expensive to borrow because they're losing more value so the lender will require more in return.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:04:55
They prefer inflation to deflation because if the currency gained value people would default in this highly leveraged environment as the value to pay off the debt would increase. Of course there wouldn't be as much of a market for lending in deflation because people would save instead of borrow to spend.
They'd lose more money in deflation -- I don't think many people realize this paradox.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:18:16
The thing I don't get about deflation is that it's rarely ever relevant to the discussion right? By deflation I mean a decrease in money supply, even in Bitcoin it's not technically possible? It's disinflationary not deflationary.
My vision of Bitcoin if/when it takes over fiat is that we'd still have banks because people would still need loans. At least this time wed have a more decentralized banking system consisted of smaller banks interest rates would be properly determined by the supply of loanable money (free market) instead of it being planned by a central bank. Plus, people wouldn't be "hoarding" because they'd receive interest by parking it at a bank. 
I don't see why I keep seeing deflation associated with Bitcoin. It's price deflation (which is good because purchasing power increases along with productivity) not real deflation.
And yes, FRB for non productive assets such as real estate and buying stocks in margin was the biggest mistake we've made as a society imo. It's completely asinine if you think about it
