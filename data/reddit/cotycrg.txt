Mycelium is mobile only I believe. You can make a pdf backup of a mycelium wallet so if your phone is stolen you can keep the PDF safe
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:09:49
Yes. On bitcoin core, even if you make new addresses after they got your wallet.DAT, they would still be able to access them because of how it generates private keys.
I run a full node on a personal server box in my living room, but keep my coins on my android phone with an app called mycelium.

Not all torrents are for piracy. I could see myself seeding Space Engine, or something.

There is always the possibility of hardware based backdoors in phones, or any computer for that matter. It's a risk we have to take for the convenience of  using closed source hardware. 
Although if it turned out Samsung was stealing peoples bitcoins...and it was found out? The company would crumble overnight! It would he suicide, so I doubt huge manufacturers would do such a thing. 
But apps don't run in their own virtual machine, its just that their data is encrypted and inaccessable to other apps. Usually. Keyloggers are still possible. Don't be an idiot and download random apps that are fishy or not on google play.

I have my HD wallet backed up as a PDF, so there is no worry there. I could easily import the password protected backup on a new phone.

Android is sandboxed, so that alone makes it way more secure than a PC. 
Mycelium doesn't connect directly to the network - but it creates private keys and signs transactions with your phone - so it doesn't matter. Still just as secure.
I keep auto updates off though, so if they ever do anything fishy idiots with auto update on will be my protection against that sort of thing.

There ARE fees though, albeit they are small. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:23:06
I don't think you could get any amount of food for only $0.10. Personally I'd be insulted with such a small tip. Don't tip if its for less than a dollar. Its just silly.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:29:02
There are always fees with bitcoins. You can optionally not put a fee on your transaction - but  then you can potentially end up waiting a few days for a single confirmation. 
As bitcoin increases in popularity and age; fees will become a normal thing. It pays miners to keep mining, after all. 
Right now a typical fee to get your transaction confirmed quickly is 0.0001, which is tiny. But, it exists. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:40:52
You're completely right. But credit cards are thin cheap plastic. I paid $400 out of pocket for my nexus 5. I don't want some guy smudging up my screen, possibly dropping it.
NFC bitcoin payments will probably be the future.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:31:41
I keep this one in my wallet, with me. I also have the encrypted private key on 2 flash drives (one at home and one at my parents), my computer, and one copy online. 
I also use different keys for most transactions with my PC; and I use Mycelium on my phone to keep track of the cold storage key's value (you can scan in a public key's QR when you hit "new key" and it will let you see how much is there, without needing the private key). 
I don't keep all my eggs in one basket; just most of them. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:37:17
I run two full nodes at home, actually. I keep one on 24/7, it's running on a little micro atx build I did a long time ago that I use as a web host, teamspeak/mumble host, and occasionally game servers for friends. The other is on almost 24/7, but goes off for maybe a day or two at a time at most (personal computer). Not sure if that's bad for the network, hopefully not. They both have 50-ish connections at all times.

It would only be sync'd if Microsoft held your private keys.. Do you really want that?
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:57:56
You're not wrong. But imagine the brownie points an ISP would get for using their DNS servers to auto look up .bit addresses from the block chain for you. It could happen. Alternatively, I could see users setting up their own DNS servers with namecoin.
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:40:17
I feel like this is very misguided. How would the owner knows it's not coincidence that certain days make more money than other days? If the Mozilla thing is true, I would like to know the process they did to decide it would be a "$140,000" loss. Surely they didn't just watch for a few days and decide that was it. And when was it they tested? Was it years ago back when the public was mostly afraid of it, linking it with drug dealers? Or recently, after companies like newegg and Microsoft use it?
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:08:41
But then how would be sync? Also seems like a very risky way of handling it, considering facial recognition isn't perfect. And your fingerprint could change in the case of burns or losing a finger.
Lost both your thumbs? Goodbye to all your money unless there was a backup. But then what's the point of the finger scanner in the first place outside of the novelty?

The part with the guy at the register wanting to hold his phone made me cringe. I would have just walked out, honestly. Phones are expensive. He could drop it. I'd rather scan the stupid qr code myself, I'm not 12.

Its a java implementation of a bitcoin client. What they have written is pretty confusing, its not clear on exactly what is needed for the bare minimum. What you need to do to connect to other nodes, etc.

If they used some simple Angular in their page they could just fetch the current bitcoin price, then do simple math to figure out the conversion on the fly and display it in ()s next to the USD price. 
I do this (well with USD in ()s) on this site I made.

Are you literally 12?
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:25:43
He says that there should be a way for people to have a contact book of bitcoin addresses. This is very true.
Mycelium, the app I use on my Android, has this feature. Me and my girlfriend scanned each other's QR codes once and now we can send money to each other anytime without typing a thing in. Its great! 
Are there any PC and or Linux wallets that do the same?

Which I would also never trust my money with. I use both to buy btc, sure. But never store.
The other guy who posted was sort of right. You could easily just sync your public key. But that's only for viewing, not for spending.

Miners are confirming transactions and are paid the transaction fee + newly generated coins. When no new coins are made, they are only paid transaction fees.
The idea is bitcoin will be so popular by that point transaction fees will cover the costs of mining.

You're incorrect. That was a hard fork. Use a client before that patch and it will be rejected from the network.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:41:54
Would be incredible if the mycelium servers kept everyone's public keys on file, so it could send push alerts to users that receive money. That way our phone wouldn't drain its battery watching transactions itself.

I was answering the question directly, he never said gates would sell back in this hypothetical situation.
Nobody can really say for sure what would happen when he stops buying. But from history we can see that a drop in demand leads to a decline in price (entire 2014, after hype from 2013 died and people are slowly growing interest again). 
Dunno. In the end its really all guesswork no matter what either of us thinks.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:01:48
You don't need them running to store keys. Just back up the wallet.DAT file to a USB stick or something.
@_date: 2015-04-02 12:54:47
He'd start buying, then exchanges would dry up and price would sky rocket. If he kept buying at these prices as they were mined it would keep going up and up.
Then he'd stop and prices would "crash" back down to what they were before he started and you'd see a lot of articles about how bitcoin is dead and everything would continue as normal.
@_date: 2015-03-15 00:49:49
There is a a point in which miners will not sell. That point is when they make a net loss. Either they'll hold out (supply drops until demand raises) or sell from fear of never rising (things go on as normal). Saying the price of electricity and bitcoin aren't at all related is just silly. The majority of coins on the market are from new coins being mined and sold. It'll be awhile until they are unrelated, if ever.
Even when all the coins are mined, they value of a coin would still be determined by mining (miner fees etc)
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:23:31
I don't understand what you're implying. Halving would work into what I just said.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:32:56
So instead of using 12 random words you use 2 (email + password)? Sounds like it could be easy to break if a user had a short email and password. If you haven't, maybe put in password requirements to make it a negligible thing?

I've been using uTorrent 2.2.1 for as long as I can remember. Its just so FAST starting up. The exe is standalone and less than a MB. UI is so nice and has so many features that just WORK. Picking individual files and sorting their download priority is a must for me, being able to download parts of a file in order is cool too, so you can basically stream a video as you torrent it.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:27:10
Prioritizing files in a torrent and even parts within a file are super important to me.

The VPN was one of those "doesn't log their users" -- I wouldn't trust VPNs.

Its provably fair. The seed is a hash of the block at the time of drawing. Both of witch are visible on the website after the drawing. The lottery has been open for about two weeks now, but I've been shifting around how winners are decided on the programming side. I found a way that works correctly 100% of the time though, so when I get a chance I'll post the code to prove the winner deserved their win each week.

Everyone is really worried about this. But really as long as your stuff is encrypted, who cares? Don't keep your private keys unencrypted and you're good. That is, unless they can get the HDD to act as a keylogger. Then we're fucked.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:24:33
Because you're just wrong. Flat out objectively invalid conclusions.
Transactions per seconds have been increasing but not enough to matter. 
Transaction fees will be worth something to miners when you have 1000 tps instead of 7 tps. This isn't hard to understand.
More transactions per second = more fees per block.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:25:51
Only commenting to let any readers know this guy is flat out lying and pulling numbers out of his ass. Currently btc can handle 7 tps. Increasing the block size to 20MB isn't meant to be instant. It's meant to be a gradual increase in size over time (won't increase the size of old transactions) - and although I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, the tps is muuuuuch higher than he is saying.
Also, the idea is that as block size increases over time our storage technology will far outgrow it before it becomes an issue (assuming it keeps growing at the incredible rate is has been - which it is. I just bought a 4 TB HDD and a 1 TB SSD. Shits getting cheaper and cheaper every year).

I keep a lot of my coins on my Android. It's a sandboxed environment, so as long as I don't install anything extra ordinarily sketchy (which I don't see the average Facebook dwelling candy crush addict doing), my money is completely safe. Just for icing on the cake my phone is also encrypted and the wallet file is also encrypted. The screen had a pin lock as well as the wallet to send coins.
I recommend every single newcomer to use Mycelium instead of Bitcoin Core. Everyone. Its just better.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:04:19
More transactions happening per second = more collective fees.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:57:32
Even if that is true, the adoption of bitcoin is slow and probably will be slow for awhile. The block size won't increase that much until we have the hardware to support it. Super fast adoption is a pipe dream. By the time we have the tps reaching 7, our hardware will support much higher.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:54:40
Mine uses the latest block (hashed) as the seed, which is shown on the site. How is that not as safe or trustworthy? Its public and cannot be changed. No way for me to "brute force" the winnings or something.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:12:26
Not to be a downer, but I don't see it happening anytime soon. People have been expecting the dollar to crash for years and the world to turn to gold - instead the dollar is in a constant downward spiral and prices go up to compensate as job wages stay the same. It sucks but its how the world is right now. All we can do is hoard and promote bitcoin and watch as the world gradually turns to it.
Don't get me wrong, I'd love a huge influx of adoption but I don't see it.
I'm also the type of guy who sees bitcoin more of a store of value rather than a day to day transaction tool (although I understand it is possible and wish it would happen). Just trying to stay realistic and keep emotions out of financial decisions.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:51:09
Then maybe we should write up a way for block size can increase based on usage. It'd be tricky to do, however, because the whole point is to remove spam. But maybe we could just remove the cap altogether. Its something worth the research for sure.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:55:57
The block limit is in for a reason. It protects the network from useless spam. 
This isn't as big of an issue anymore now that miners are making proportionally less in new bitcoin compared to transaction fees from awhile back, but its still a threat. So we should keep it in at least until transaction fees outweigh new coins.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:49:05
