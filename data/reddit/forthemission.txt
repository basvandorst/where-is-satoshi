Clearly the content of this article is a repost from a long time ago.

What are the C and O parameters in this URL?

A lot of people use it because there is no fee for trades that add liquidity.

Yeah I split my active trades between GDAX and Gemini, and cold storage elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:37:48
Don't confuse [Coinbase fees]( with [GDAX fees]( they are two different fee structures. All trades on GDAX that add liquidity to the exchange ("maker") are free.

Its not really about just the ETF, its about the regulatory precedent it will set and the flood of Wall Street money potentially behind that precedent.

Have any of you had problems with the candle charts in GDAX for the last several days? My charts flash and disappear, then reappear with only partial data, etc. Never had these issues before this week.

Some slight rejection again.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:50:05
Huh, I've never had an issue. It's Chromecasting from my laptop and I'll occasionally go do something on my computer.

I didn't notice at first, but you can see my trades in the bottom right.

I could build a row of miners into the wall, just below the soundbar and so that they stick out in both rooms. Boom, new heaters.

Haha, the TV is actually really light. Sub 50lbs. I hope it stays where it is
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:55:23
No, I have a recessed outlet that will power the tv and soundbar. It also has a cut out to drop the cables inside the wall. I've got another receptacle that opens the wall for the audio cable.

Whenever the spread is greater than $0.01, take a shot!
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:51:44
This is phase one. Just put up the TV and soundbar a little while ago. I've got all the electrical boxes for the job, just need a free weekend :(
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:08:27
You're not stupid. This is the black background, the colors just came out goofy in this shot.

I left my computer for an hour, came back and saw the peak and now the fall.
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:53:29
I agree that it's generally a nice platform. I think if I were trying to use it as a "savings" account, I wouldn't have a problem. For now though, I really like some on the features I've been use on Gemini.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:34:10
We will hit $1000 again much faster than the last fall

Only becuase I'm at home this morning: [the goods](
