Is there financial data that supports this hypothesis? Because I've been hearing it will be stable "soon" since Bitcoin hit $100.

How is BTC more secure than other [established] digital currencies? I understand that it's network is potentially stronger due to it's size, but it's not like the smaller currencies are being attacked and broken on the regular.

My side strategy is to buy cheap shitcoins and put in sell orders to convert back at 3x my buy price. It's actually been working out pretty decently. I've more than doubled my BTC value since the January correction began.

That's not how any of this works. We took a big psychological hit. Volatility might be fun for us that have been here for years, but 20k is months away now...maybe even another year.

I think he may have invested $10k of USD close to the ATH. So he's lost thousands already.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:12:34
Sure, that one, or the one earlier in April of that year. There's always a reason for it, but the pattern looks the same. Bitcoin will recover per usual.

You weren't here for 2013 I see.

You might be good at discovering patterns, but shorting is very dangerous for beginners. You can also lose a ton of money shorting Bitcoin.

I've been around crypto since 2011. I don't hold any Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash anymore. BTC is absolutely useless for it's original intended purpose and LN has been "almost done" for a couple years. I still believe in BTC, but the Core devs are going to have to gets things moving again because I'm no longer willing to hold coins that aren't usable in a practical sense. With all the money pouring into crypto this year, you'd think we could have had a long-term solution going by now.

I bought one Bitcoin for $200 in early 2015. I probably should have kept it.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:25:58
What's the point? Why not just take the rent money and buy Bitcoins?

A few million here, a few million there. Pretty soon you're talking about real money.

Usually these type of things only work once, but maybe it's been enough years for a new wave of morons to buy pixels. I'm getting too old for this.
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:06:59
Yup. Let's be honest. He was gonna do it anyways.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:39:26
People still move money through BTC before buying alts.

Five years ago you could run the entire Bitcoin network hash on a single Antminer S9.

Based on historical trends and bubbles, Bitcoin continues to rise and fall with massive volatility. But the fact remains that it has consistently risen in the value over time. I'm not seeing any new patterns that indicate otherwise.
I hold 0 BTC, but I absolutely will buy back in when I think we've reached pre-parabolic levels because I believe the patterns will repeat themselves again in the future just as they have in the past.

You still couldn't afford it. There are plenty of worthless token coins out there with multi-millionaire dollar market caps.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:03:38
You shouldn't put in any money you can't afford to lose. Bitcoin (and other currencies) have a nearly decade-long history of instability. Until proven otherwise, the only thing that remains relatively certain is that it will go up in value over a multiyear period.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:53:06
Keyword is "massive volatility." I expect the stocks I buy to go up in value as well, but massive swings in value are much less common in large market stocks so they are less risky. If any commodity becomes overvalued, that doesn't preclude it from continuing to rise in the future after a major correction. Come back in one to three years and the landscape will be far different.

The sad part is the folks who took out massive loans in 2013/2017 to fund their speculation. That's not a sensible financial decision. I wouldn't ridicule them, but those kinds of investments are very similar to gambling.

Would you judge someones decision to bet it all on black in Vegas?

I remember reading that cover story in the print issue.

Nope. You've already lost ~~\~$850~~ ~~$1040~~ ~~$814~~ ~~$1058~~ $1184 and you're probably gonna lose a couple thousand more before we hit the bottom.
