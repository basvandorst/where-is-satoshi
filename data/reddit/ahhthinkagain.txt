its not felony tax evasion if the laws cant be applied to cryptocurrency. Techniqually everyone thinks it "monopoly" money. Monopoly money can't be taxed and you cant be charged with "tax evasion" if it the state doesn't currently even recognize it as an asset of value. Lawls

I guess you missed what i said in my other statement jackass. If he has a loss on any of his other investments he can wipe out the gain which would result in zero tax liability. Also, thank you for pointing out the one spelling error within the statement. I'm sure you got a lot of gratification out of it. you should really read the rest of the comments before getting on your horse.

dude the other comment was right above what I said prior. Lmao you truly have the intelligence level of a potato. At least learn how to read before you start posting on social threads. Makes you look like an idiot lol.

Also, its a very common practice towards the end of the year to sell of assets that obtain losses. This makes it possible to offset his capital gains tax. If you dont do that to lower your tax liability you're actually losing out on money. This is a common practice.

Dont worry about all these negative people trying to bring your thread down. These are all the same people that sold their crypto's today. Your sample size is small however, the data that supports these 3 data points isn't. It doesn't take much more research to support that you have a positive trend. Ignore the asshats on this thread that still have their mothers make them lunch for school.

refer to other comment. If he has a loss on any of his investments he can use that to wipe out the tax liability. Go fuck yourself =D.

Soon enough he will have a 50k loss to go along with his 50k profit which would wipe out his profit margin resulting in "no tax evasion" because he'll have the loss to deduct.

Well good luck because you tried buying a decentralized currency and your bank has every right to deny your request for refund. Instead of just jumping into BTC you should've research and knew if your bank was going to allow such transactions. You can't just assume that your bank is going to be "okay" with these transactions. They're a bank they make money off of your money....it's centralized...They own your funds not you...

I'm pretty sure when you "sell" your BTC on coinbase its then deposited into your Fiat Currency which then you can withdraw. At least this is what I've dealt with each time.
