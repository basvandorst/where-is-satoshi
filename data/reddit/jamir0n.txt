Thank you Andreas for pointing that out. We heard you loud and clear good sir.
Also, gratitude extended for writing this brilliant book; of which I believe a new edition is overdue and eagerly anticipated.
What your position on the ongoing HF/SF heated debates and the "de-decentralization" threats to btc, etc. as far as technicality of it and whole Eco-system implications are concerned?
Are those issues covered in the 2nd edition?

Appreciate you taking from your time to contribute and educate as well :)
Could someone cloud download it, coz I can't atm unfortunately, and possibly link it here as well?
Everyone in the BTC community noob&amp;up needs to read this invaluable book, IMO.

Objectivist libertinism is a joke and would stand a real test. If it does we'd be back in the jungle, a hunter-gatherer communes of selfish barbarianism.
Humanity didn't progress thus far, with some minor setbacks for sure, to be dragged back to the animal-nature likes of Rand and Friedman and down to the abyss by some useful idiots who profess "all for one but one ain't for anyone but himself!"
Brutal Darwinist capitalism isn't the answer, compassionate responsible capitalism can be. I.e. Jesus vs money changers.

"Libertarianism roots lie in liberalism whose roots lie in the protestant reformation. All protestant nations carry the libertarian disease to a certain extent."
The relationship between libertarianism and Protestant reformation can, and should IMO, be explained in socio-political contest. Given the tight grip of "Rome" over Europe's economy and oligarchy, libertinism was adopted as a form of viable resistance and Econ-political protest.
More like a marriage of convenience fit for the climate back then and there and not in any case inherent within original teachings of protestantism, per se.
Care to elaborate on that statement of yours?
