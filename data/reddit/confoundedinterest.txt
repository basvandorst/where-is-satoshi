C'mon folks. Settle down.  Bitcoins are not "stored" in the browser.  We merely use various applications (QT, Electrum, MyCelium and browser extensions like KryptoKit) to communicate with the bockchain.
I had lots of bitcoin in my so-called 'KryptoKit' wallet.  They are all still there happily awaiting my joy and whim. Spent some this morning using MyCelium instead while awaiting Vilatik getting things back to normal.  I will use KryptoKit again immediately it is fixed simply because it is THE cleanest and most convenient interface to the blockchain on the planet right now.

Just to confirm, Vitalik's instructions work like a charm on Windows too.  Download 'Windows Grep', do the search as Vitalik describes, copy your brain wallet phrase, enter it into something like bitaddress.org.htm to recover your private key, enter your private key into another client like Mycelium, Electrum, or blockchain.info and, presto, you will have access to whatever bitcoin you were managing through KryptoKit.
Hope you get it all up and running again Vitalik.  I really miss both the bitcoin and the messenger elements of KryptoKit.  While you are at it, extensions for other browsers???  Firefox/TOR especially?

I use KryptoKit  as my daily 'debit card' analogy.  If it comes back up healthy, do give it a try.  It's a real delight. Nothing like it for convenience when browser shopping or donating online. Obviously, for the reasons you describe, it's best to only keep a few hundred bucks in any wallet that extensions like KryptoKit point to.  Use something like Electrum as your 'checking account' or 'credit card' equivalent.  And, finally, paper wallets and deep cold storage for your 'savings account' equivalents.
With that caution, do give Kryptokit a try when it reappears.  It really is terrific.
