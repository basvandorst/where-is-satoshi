More to the point when is all his coins and fiat going to be taken off him and handed over to the customers that he ripped off.

My mate on Friday phoned me and told me to cash out of bitcoin as one of his customers who is a Rothschild Banker told him that a women was killed in Singapore who was setting up a BTC Exchange and that bitcoin was going to crash.
I told him that his banker should get out of Fiat as there had been sudden rash of banker suicides and that fiat was going to crash.
I think he got the point on that one ;)

Sorry but for me i want a card that does not need some one else as quoted "As long as you keep depositing Bitcoin, we will keep converting it and loading cash to your Cryptex Card"
I want a card that automatically is connected via my account on Blockchain that i control completely.
In Effect a "Blockchain Debit card" where i have complete control of wallets that are connected to the card how much i can withdraw and deposit with out any third party involved apart from the Blockchain. 
So Blockchain guys how about it?

I'm glad some one has finally brought this up your all being lied to by the presstitutes of the western world.
There is more at stake than you realize going on have a read of  Dr. Roberts was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy by President Reagan so he knows what he is talking about Geo Politically. 
Also start listening to anything by Gerald Celente who will give you future trends events globally.
Have a listen to Jim Willie here is a 2 part piece 
Don't believe me do your own research but you only have to look into history and you will find your answers who NEEDS this war the most and who is banging the drums the most.
Don't believe CORP Media they are lying to you.
War is a Racket ! 
Sorry just planting seeds ; )
