Yes it is possible to choose not to use a car if you can't get a vanity plate. Especially when it is possible to use the older style vanity plates.

But they did not use BTC. They used their international shipping tokens, which is based on ETH. You can visit their website at

That's how vanity addresses are created. "looking for a way to create a vanity address" means "looking for an automated way tp create vanity addresses"

I don't like the "stick to 1mb blocks" policy of BTC.

Learn about the technology. This is not one of your classic financial instruments. This is something completely new.

So you are suggesting that other coins are better for buying a coffee. I thought bitcoin was THE digital money we were dreaming of.

BTC transaction fees are ridicilously so high. better use a bank.

Dogecoin is such coin and its going to the moon bro.

When did the transaction confirm? Or did you pay more than the tip itself for the transaction? I think you should be using LN for tipping but it is beta now, so congratulations.

Bitcoin is for spending. It is a currency.
