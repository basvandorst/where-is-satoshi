When huge policies like this are in place, insurers do their own diligence to ensure these kinds of shenanigans aren't putting their money at unreasonable risk.

Which is fine, it's doing what it's meant to be doing.  If everyone just hoarded it, would be valueless.

What if his actual conversation was [this]( or none at all?
Like I said, I think this is probably real.  But, particularly when the alleged offense is lack of authentication, some harder confirmation is probably due before the pitchforks come out, at least if they're not to be incredibly hypocritical pitchforks.

I know the odds of it coming back to bite him are very low, but it's still information he/she doesn't have to give, and I'm a passionate supporter of always using best practices.
Say this terrible employee releases their email out of spite, and they'd like to try to deny it, one could figure out from the image down to a pixel or two whether it was likely or not the leaked email was the same.  Dude's reddit account is three years old; could help confirm or narrow down a dox in other situations, too.
There's just no good reason not blank things out when it takes the same time.  If it's necessary for context, takes an extra 10 secs to draw/type in "(email address)".
I agree it's laziness in a way, but when being lazy and being vigilant take the same amount of time and effort...

Very interesting!  If you ever get to make this argument, whether it succeeds or not, I hope you will take the time make a post here about how it worked out?
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:59:58
Just since this post is arguing for proper skepticism/paranoia, two things:
1.  Even though my gut says this is real, this is just a goddamn imgur image of a chat/supposed chat.  Along the same lines of OP's argument for authentication, why should we take this conversation as legit with no question?  The potential risks from bad actors are almost 1:1 between OP's argument in chat, and this post.
2.  If you're going to take the time to obscure your email, don't do it in a way that shows its length, or even its host.

Well, if this completely unverified story spreads from there, at least we can probably expect some official clarification from G in the next day or two.

It's not completely subjective.  If it didn't have a objective use or uses, or wasn't ever used in those ways, it would have no value.
Not disagreeing that people exchanging savings for goods through bitpay will have a downward effect on price, just stating that overall, it's good for BTC's future.
Your last point may be true, but having people use it through processors like Bitpay is at least closer to that than if it was just sitting stagnant in wallets.

Self-reported, self-enforced transparency or "transparency" isn't worth a hell of a lot.
Some exchange being "transparent" would end up fucking another group of people not to far down that line.
Outside auditing from reputable companies could help; I'll believe that's happening when I see it.

I'm sure there's already legal precedent for this, set by some case with gold or silver perhaps.
It's an interesting question, if they have to seize non-BTC assets, measured in USD, how they would measure the damages.  My gut says they would use some accepted of the BTC at the time of purchase, but you never know.

Hard to believe the government would either intentionally or unintentionally leave in such a prominent calling card - that's very in keeping with the completely uncritical and derisable portion of conspiracy thinking - but more perhaps more importantly, it seems even more unlikely they wouldn't have built in the encryption standard with the built-in back-door referenced in this very fucking submission, as a self-destruct button if nothing else...
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:11:05
That would be a more useful answer to the issue if they made any effort to explain *why* there "was a delay in communicating ACH transfers to the bank", but they seem content to breeze by that point and just throw out a glib "sorry!".
Does their answer there instill confidence in anyone?
Edit:  I see they've addressed it in more detail below.  Maybe they should update their answer on their site?

Banks got caught holding a bunch of them, but the banks' whole business in that was selling to them to common and corporate investors.  There were countless individuals, mutual funds, retirement funds, municipalities, and so on who all invested in them.
I'm not really sure where you're trying to go with this?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:23:44
Mortgage-backed CDOs come to mind first.  By the time they collapsed, a significant amount of US-originated one were held internationally, and some other countries like Ireland had followed similar suit with their own.

What do people think the best way to incorporate tips (like at a restaurant, coffee house, bar, etc.) is with this?
For anyone not familiar, receipts with written-in tips on credit/debit cards are updated and "charged additional payment", usually at the end of the night.
Probably simplest just to give a customer a printed receipt beforehand and let them write in a tip before you run the transaction, since someone paying out/closing a tab is going to be gone before the payment's confirmed in any case?
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:50:35
People might downvote your comment, and to be fair, it's speculation.  At the same time, just choosing to believe otherwise "because, Bitcoin" is putting an insane amount of blind trust in an unregulated company that has very obvious financial incentives to play around with timing and cancellations, particularly if it's a small company and vulnerable to upswings.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:56:06

What would banning do when the vast majority of the many bullshit posts are from new accounts or newly active ones like this?  There's nothing to stop it.  Honestly, the obviously bullshit "When's the best time to buy BTC?" etc. etc. posts annoy me more.
This has to be the hardest subreddit to moderate on all of Reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:58:24
My goodness, I really hope you just wrote this as something fun rather than spent any serious time on it.
Assuming such, thanks for lulz and fair satire.

Sorry, was just kinda breezing through.  I am not a tax accountant, but I'm fully with Codyave, it's very safe and reasonable to treat it as capital gains right now.  If you bought them as an individual, and then sold them at a higher value, it's going to be capital gains.  If you haven't sold them, and thus haven't realized a gain, you don't owe anything and shouldn't have to report anything.
If IRS decides it's something different and/or that you owe more, they'll let you know, but they're not going to arrest you or fine you.
Things obviously get more complicated if you mined them or were paid them for services.  Would definitely talk to a CPA if one had sold a significant amount of BTC from either of those sources.
tl;dr - Definitely don't overpay to play it safe, but definitely pay CG on realized gains.

Very sorry for your loss, and there's no reason to doubt your specific story in this sense, so please don't take this as directed at your case here.
But this make me curious, is there a pragmatic way for people in these cases to verify that a transaction in the blockchain was taken from a wallet they control?

Yeah, OP writes in a style as if he's going to inform about some remedy to the problem, and then doesn't provide any (which is fine, because there isn't any - it's the nature of the beast).
So then you ask why was this written by him, and the most likely answer is that's just a plug for his company followed by a bunch of long-winded shit that he thinks will support his credibility as professional that is, unfortunately, obvious to the level headed people here and that will never ever be accepted by the fanatics here.  So probably a waste of time for him, eh?  I know it was one of mine.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:42:14
That is some bizarre down-voting on this submission.
Fwiw, I remember seeing a speech by a google employee online from a year or three ago saying that escrow was technologically possible in the BTC code (as in there waiting to be used, in some way) and that it was possible to use some objective outside data to trigger the close, but I can't remember/probably wasn't clear on how that's implemented, and how many peers are required to implement it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:31:17
I wouldn't go that far.  There are plenty of shady contracts out there, and a horde of people looking to scam bitcoiners with their "businesses"
It's just, even having no prior knowledge of Robocoin, it's clear this is a (possibly unattractive) franchise model after the first paragraph or two, which I think OP and other poor souls like SwagPoker might not have gathered.
Then again, it might just be Swag et al who are the poor souls.  OP might be rolling out a competing business in a week or two...
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:14:20
I don't think the people upvoting this submission or making comments like SwagPoker have taken the time to even slightly understand what this contract or what Robocoin's business is actually doing.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:06:02
That's always what I assumed people posting here meant by "visibility", rather than getting help for themselves.
Maybe if that visibility leads to less new customers in the short run, it would allow the company to better deal with their existing customers?

Asking about Bitcoin here at the moment, during another bullrun/pump/bubble (depending on how one sees it), is like walking into a SeaOrg meeting and asking about the pros and cons of Scientology.  Despite the fact the value has just shot up over 17% in the last 24 hours, an even greater percentage of people here seem to be pooh-poohing the possibility of a crash than there was last time, right before the last crash.
Getting his coins to an exchange where he can cash out if he wants to might take longer than this run has in it.  Or maybe it'll run up to $1000+.  He might want to work on that quickly, though, just so he has the option.
Virtual currencies are surely going to become an important part of the global economy as time goes on, but whether BTC is the primary one, or an important one at all, in that future is far less certain than the answers here so far might lead you to believe.
Hopefully, at worst, he'll have bought an important life lesson for cheaper than he might have later in life.  Since it seems he's probably not a true believer who's intending to hold the coins for the long term, maybe he'll even luck out make a profit.

I'd imagine both got it from the rather terrible (or, alternatively, before we all got spoiled over the last few years, mind-blowingly terrific) automatic [google translation] (  I could see one coming to either contradictory conclusion from it if one wanted to hard enough.
Are there really no native Mandarin speakers here at this time of day clearing things up yet?
Or maybe is it about as vague in its native form as it is in its translation?
