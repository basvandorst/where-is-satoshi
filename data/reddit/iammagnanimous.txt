Maybe dick is unnecessary but your arrogant attitude is unbecoming. It appears as though he is looking for a reasons why some miners have not adopted segwit not spreading fud.

OK that makes sense. Was there fee's for transferring GBP into the account other than from your own bank? I was using circle with debit card so no fee's at all which is what I am hoping for.
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:02:55
I wonder if you could use this to buy and sell btc
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:10:12
So If I have a bank in the uk and I want to send myself some peso's, I can buy BTC on Abra and then buy peso's from a teller. Or could I be a teller and sell btc for peso's?

I used Kraken for most of my purchases but towards the end  the transfering company from my bank to Kraken wanted me to prove the sourse of my funds and held my money for a month until I provided unbelievably excessive personal info. In the end they made the transfer but said that that was it, no more. It would be great if they could transfer directly from a debit card like circle did
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:52:13
So you wire transfer money to their bank in Estonia, buy BTC then can you send your bitcoin to your wallet? They say sending BTC to third party wallets forbidden. How do they know if your wallet address is a third party or your own wallet?

I love listening to this guy he hits the nail every time.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:04:25
The problem was that the person demanding the invasive personal information did not seem to be following any guide lines it seemed that he needed to be satisfied and that was it. He took a dislike to me and as he demanded more invasive details I kept providing them until he ran out of ideas or go bored. He now knows how many pimples are on my wifes ass. It wasnt Kraken, it was their payment provider for GBP. Nothing to do with the US.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:38:54
OK I see your post below with the fee's. Is the 10 pounds from your bank or their bank? My bank would charge 15 pounds plus whatever the receiving bank charges.

It was Paycash Krakens payment provider for Int wire in USD or GBP. The only other choice I had was to transfer in Euros and pay the exchange on top of Krakens fee on top of my bank fee.

It doesnt matter what software you run as long as it has segwit. Once segwit is activated the miners will reject non segwit blocks. Your core software has segwit. So dont worry

@_date: 2017-07-18 05:07:24
So this is just Segwit right? What is the difference between this and the original core implementation BIP 141 I think it was?
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:00:02
Well then why would someone buy 50,000. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:02:11
In 10 years we may need 800 or 8000 MB. See how pointless it is? Another scaling solution is required!
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:44:54
Yes this is what I think a lot of people dont understand. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:20:25
What are you babbling about?
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:43:18
If core updates their segwit1x with the same governance model as segwit 2x without the HF then I think most will switch to that. This seems the most logical outcome.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:30:59
No I was not planning on running the 2x. A hypothetical question.
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:30:58
to start with
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:14:18
I was not making a point I was asking questions and trying to understand something
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:20:46
Finally the voice of reason. It doesnt seem like many understand this. This is the way forward. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:39:39
What I am trying to understand is once segwit is activated anyone can run the core implementation if they choose and if they are the majority then the HF will likely not happen? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:57:19
I am aware that a majority is not required for a HF that was not one of my questions. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:34:50
Well If a minority of the 5 constituencies of the BTC community does a HF do you think it will be a success? Perhaps that is why they do not happen very often and the ones that did failed. This idea is what was implied when I used the term majority in the above statement. 
 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:22:42
Yes we are all aware of the possibility of a split that is not the point of this conversation.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:11:47
 I certainly was not talking about whether a majority can prevent a hard fork. Anyone can fork at anytime.Yes it appears that you did misunderstand. I do believe a HF will not likely happen. Here is a quote from Alex Marcos in a tweet with Jeff Jgarzik "There have been many HF implementations, so far the market has resoundingly rejected them all. You think yours will be different. We'll see." This was not the point of the original post and I am not interested in debating it but Alex's coment is in line with my thinking.
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:19:35
Do you think an average block size of 4 MB will be adequate in 10 years?
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:51:31
Millions of people can buy an RX480 or several from thousands of vendors. How can you compare that to asics? It replaces Jihan with you and me.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:40:07
You guys just dont get it. Take segwit now and dont upgrade to the HF when the time comes It has been explained several times that segwit and the 2mb HF can not be packaged together.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:30:02
Perhaps I should have used the words "not likely happen or not succeed". I didn’t realize some people would be so pedantic 
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:22:13
Why couldnt you just send it to shapshift and change it to Monero or dash or zcash then to your wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:58:37
Strange my first thoughts were to buy more btc so I will have more of both after the split
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:33:20
so these will be separate chains once the miners activate segwit2x? I thought that will happen with the 2xHF in a few months?
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:59:36
almost 65 now seems BU is loosing out.
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:28:22

He seems like he is tired and fighting a loosing battle. I think he cares about BTC but has a different vision.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:37:47
OK so it needs 80% right? But 22% are signalling segwit. Am I correct in thinking that it will never get to 80% unless the segwit crowd switches to BIP91?
