No need to. Anyone in bitcoin over 2 yrs would see the irony in this.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:10:08
This sub needs to remember this great quote 
" when you tear out a man's tongue, you're not proving him a liar. You're only telling the world that you fear what he might say"
Let this sink in before using " its a private domain" justification again.

Inside trading. Did you really believe Bobby Lee saying everything is fine? The fcker is fooling all of you
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:26:57
Internet isnt a safe space. If you want Theymos to be your daddy, stay off the internet. 
Shutting down other views because you dont agree with show you're afraid.
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:43:18
What make you think that?
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:01:30
I think you mixed up /s up there. 
Which makes more sense to you? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:05:15
Lol ... No
Thats YOuR definition. 
I'm sure many others see it differently. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:18:57
Lol keep that name calling.... Until reality hit your face
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:53:44
You gotta catch up. We're in fighting stage now, not denial. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:46:09
Why do you call yourself a yoda while you have no fcking clue ? Read the whitepaper again. 
miners are supposed to act in the best interest of themselves. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:43:19
OP, we're pass the denial stage already. It's "fighting" stage now. Catch up bro.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:16:49
But the people in this sub told me Bitcoin is a store of value... Like digital gold. Bitcoin is not digital cash or peer to peer payment network. 
So, I'm confused. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:45:18
Look like i will move there
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:13:28
You sound alot like Hillary supporter. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:29:02
How nice of you to use their service for free yet choose to ignore their message.
At least stick to your principle and don't be a hypocrite. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:08:48
He would be very wealthy. If those alt can keep replacing bitcoins that means he buys low and sells high. 
Are you dense?
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:02:38
Dumb ass , the miners already have the power to harm Bitcoin if they want to. BU does not extend any of those power.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:52:23
Your comment shows you're very smart indeed. 
Now go tell yourself that 5 times.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:29:25
Why do you keep talking like you actually know it? All your opinions are very laughable.
Oh...since when programmers ( very loosely title) know and understand game theory? Let people with CO background do the analysis.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:42:39
You're dumb as fuck if you think the mining capital is the same as when btc was $10. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:27:56
Blockstream disagree with you. If its money then why they say its not digial cash but settlement network. Is Swift money? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:17:20

Bobby Lee : everything is fine. 
( while he is liquidating his stash as fast as possible..... Laughing his ass to the bank)
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:57:51
Fun fact: Facebook was valued at $102 billion 8 years after its debut in 2004.
I wonder what bitcoins value would have been if we had scaling hardfork in 2014 instead....
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:41
The most accurate description? 
Nah.... The most fit for your narrative? yes
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:56:45
Let me explain to the non Chinese what this means....
This means we are ordered to make the statement. And we are no longer in control of our businesses

Not gonna work. People agree to pay fee for safe vetting. Last thing i want is getting raped by some stranger because i want to save $5 in fee
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:24:14
Honest question? How much did you get for the article? I want to be a journalist in bitcoin space too
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:05:00
Well this is You cant expect much intelligence. Only sheeps hang around here
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:13:50
Why is it capital gain?
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:06:17
I like your pro -Trump analogy.
Guess what? Trump won. So yes big block will happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:43:12
How is it capital gain? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:39:58
So much for cyberpunks....
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:18:00
Gosh you're so stupi. Why the fuck you talk to ..."financial planner"? Their only job is sale. 
What the fk do you expect?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:36:26
Well you can use Bitcoin Cash now. No need to complain.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:35:58
Dumbass. Read my question again. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:39:20
Lying piece of shit...
 Bitcoin did not exist in 2008/2009 dumbass
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:59:10
Best devs? Hahaha
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:06:53
Lol what are we? A bunch of communists meet up to tell each other how great we are?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:37:16
This talk is nonsense. Andrea is not knowledgeable in economy to give an answer which isn't about technology. 
Mining will always be centralized. This can be proven by mathematical models. The fantasy part in his talk is that as you hit the cutting edge of technology, you will see mining chips in toaster, household appliance.  That is utterly nonsense. 
I would respect him to simply say " i do not have enough data and mathematical model to comfortably answer that question" than spilling fantasy , infeasible prediction.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:08:18
Lol how do you know he wrote it before creating Silkroad? 
 He is a hypocrite
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:55:56
Dont be stupid, how many decimals do we have in bitcoin?
People can trade bitcoins with just tens of dollars. 
Most of these traders dont even transact on blockchain. 
In addition, trading bots will always be there
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:43:50
Thats not double tax. Are you stupid?
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:16:50
Hmm i wonder why Jihan and Roger but not Adam, Greg, Luke, Eric.... You know the whole Blockstream and UASF?
Dumb ass
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:52:10
If you havent followed the issue why weight in your ill-informed opinion?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:46:02
Yes you're wrong. You dont understand how Bitcoin works. Please read the white paper
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:41:14
OP dont you think someome has already tried to make the same argument in 2010? 
This has been covered so many times i wont bother repeating. 
I just leave you a few questions:
Does Facebook or Instagram have values? Why are their stocks traded at a certain price? 
Does email have values? Why is it free ? 
Answer these questions will help you to rethink what value means.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:44:26
Until you post something negative about Blockstream or anything Theymos does not like. 
Freedom of expression, motherfucker!
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:48:32
Lol keep repeating it few more times it would become true
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:53:21
Redditor for 2 days? Is this for real?
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:40:50
No one gives a shit about what a lunatic thinks. Who knows if he's radicalized.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:53:54
If you believe in Bitcoin future value, please document every transaction ( takings pocs of bank withdraws, then record date and price of the coins you purchased) .
Later if you ever need sell, this would help you to file tax properly. 
Think 1btc = $100,000 at the time you sell.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:47:39
Aw... This sub is wonderful isn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:38:14
You have just described the basic intro of crypto. That has nothing to do with BGP. Please stop writing nonsense to confuse others.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:48:09
You're even dumber than i thought. Capital gain tax is only tax on the gain of your investment not on the same money that was taxed hence its called capital gain tax and not capital tax. 
Do you even understand the word double means?
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:38:57
Beware, Brain wallet is the worst way to secure your coins. This has been covered intensively way back in 2012

Dont forget to read other sub for more info /r / btc
Otherwise you will get one sided propaganda
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:19:06
So does Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:06:34
Aw... This sub is full of wonderful people...

Bucket shop is not news. Its actually very common. 
However this dud is just rambling nonsense as this has nothing with the current rally. Stop listening to nonsense.
