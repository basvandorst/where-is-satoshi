Bitstamp is going to become the next MtGox, they are starting to crack down on KYC procedures and are going to start holding bitcoin funds aswell, not only FIAT. Now instead of MtGox telling you that your funds got "hacked" Bitstamp will be telling you that your funds got "frozen".

because you are just too dumb to understand that you can mine an altcoin if you know it will rise. However the companies do not want to gamble with mining shitcoins so they leave all the fun to you.

because they did not go for bitcoin directly but for the idea of alternative currency. The patents Ebay and Gemalto are presenting are pretty broad and have some time before being approved, but Western Union already got their patent granted, which is concerning.
