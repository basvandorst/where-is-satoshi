Don't have a ton in bitcoin just enough for a nice rainy month. But if you have larger holdings I would probably see what this adviser is I  his professional opinion he thinks about bitcoin and how much he or she knows. Kind of put the feelers out. If you feel comfortable about disclosing a small amount go ahead but I felt the same way when I talked to my advisor who was not fully informed (this was long time ago) so I just talked about what I could and just left it at that. I'm sure if I brought it up again I'd feel he would know more and I would discus the holdings o have in full.

Personally again IMO we will see fees all over the place high low and just a roller coast for at least a bit...bit when it comes to them being that high I assume something will change as people get more involved. Again just a shot in the dark butbo shouldn't be aomethin g to be truly worried about till the high fees stick around.

If more people understood this the world would be a better place. Also reporters now a days are not worth a grain of salt.
