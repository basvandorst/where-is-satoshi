If segwit enables lightning then it does enable continuous scaling. I feel segwit is better understood as the first step in building lightning networks, rather than a solution in itself.
However, I have to admit, I haven't been paying as close attention to the bitcoin space as i did in the past and it's impossible to get neutral information on the merits of both segwit/lighting and BU.
I watched this talk about lightning: 
And it does feel to me though that it's a better solution than just increasing the block size.
The goal of a block size increase seems to be to allow us to keep using bitcoin in the way we have been: always managing our own keys and directly making transaction. That approach doesn't seem plausible for nontechnical mass adoption. Most people are going to want a third party to manage (and insure) their keys, and to use bitcoin in the way they use their online banking.
As long as there's a possibility still for grey-market and cypherpunk 3rd party providers, then I don't see the problem.

No, someone has to actually store gold. You have to store bitcoin, but it could be a private key written on a piece of paper, or it could be a PNG image with the key embedded steganographically.
Even then, you're not "possessing bitcoin" you're just possessing a password that allows you to spend this ephemeral thing that is "stored" in every copy of the blockchain, but also kind of nowhere.
Also, you can't memorise your gold holdings.

You still don't seem to comprehend the reasons why central planning is impossible without a way to signal everyone's subjective preferences into the system.


You completely misunderstand. It seeks to satisfy the preferences of individuals to the degree that they can afford to bid into the system.
If you have a lot of money, you'll be able to have your (subjective) preferences satisfied to a greater degree than someone with very little money.
Capitalism doesn't "seek" to do anything, it's not a sentient living thing. Resource allocation is an emergent property of the system as a whole as individuals seek to satisfy their own preferences.
I'm finding it very difficult to explain away some of the core misunderstandings you have. 


This doesn't make any sense at all. You fundamentally misunderstand the point, that market prices represent a huge distributed computer system that allocates resources. It's not 100% efficient, but it's simply impossible for a centralised entity to be nimble, or possess enough information and processing ability to make these choices on their own.


No we haven't we've been able to make crude simulations of markets that don't really correspond at all to the complexities of human preferences. And in those simulations, the preferences of the AI agents are queriable is quantitative (not qualitative) data.
You badly need to read Hayek. I'm simply not smart enough, and don't have the time, to unpick all your misconceptions. If you read Hayek's stuff on information theory then you'll find it very difficult to come out the other end holding the same views you do now.
You seem like a smart guy, read Hayek. Central planning cannot function, there's a reason every attempt at it ends up like Venezuela. The flaw is inherent in the set-up, and Hayek explains far better than I ever could why.
Hadn't noticed this but:


That's exactly what I said. This was my exact point. That computer can't help you make these calculations.
You can't even centrally plan ice cream flavours, since that would require taking surveys in every single area of the country (at a fine grain) of what ratio of people prefer each flavour, and at what percentage of the time. Those tastes may shift over time.
Currently, owners of ice cream shops will notice what flavours people buy in this area and in what amounts. If they have leftovers, they'll order less next time. This will reduce demand for that flavour. It may be that certain flavours, while liked by some, simply don't have a high enough demand that anyone would buy them at the per unit cost (a higher unit cost normally occurs due to a smaller batch size). However, it may be that there's one rich guy who loves that flavour and will pay a much higher unit cost for it. In this instance it would still be worthwhile the shop stocking it.
This web of preference is far, far, far, far too complex to centrally plan even for something as stupid as ice cream. You have not got a hope of centrally planning anything more complex.
For example. In your centrally planned economy, you may allocate iron and steel to the industries you feel deserve it, due to your calculations based on existing usage. However, another company has discovered a way to use iron and steel way more efficiently and can see a way to make an enormous amount of money in this way. Your system doesn't allow for one of the external nodes to "know something" that the central planner doesn't. In the current system, they can simply outbid other users of steel, since they know their profit margin will be higher anyway.
Very often in the market, there are several external nodes with competing ideas about who can make the best use of the steel. It's not clear who is correct. A central planner would have to somehow allocate resources based on the percentage likelihoods of who is correct. The market just performs small experiments with investor's money. Those experiments that pay off, automatically, and by virtue of that success, can then expand their percentage of the resource allocation. It's a very efficient system (not perfect) and you aren't going to improve on this with "central planning and neural networks." We already have the neural networks, they're called people and the price system.
I'm a computer scientist with a large amount of economics training too... I can tell you right now, central planning is dumb as fuck. The bitcoin equivalent would literally be "why are we expending this energy on decentralisation, why don't we just have a central database. In fact no, why don't we do away with bitcoin altogether and just have the government decide what goods and services everyone needs" So it makes me wonder why you'd be in this sub if you don't fundamentally believe in markets and decentralisation.

Capital is not above the state in the US. The government still taxes capital, capital doesn't possess armies, capital can't arrest people, capital has been unsuccessful in influencing elections to its ends (see the loss of the wall Street backed candidate). The state is far more powerful than capital. The state literally defines the rules of the game for capital. Sure, capital has a moderately successful time lobbying for rules favorable to them... But the fact they have to beg and influence shows who the true masters are.

tbh, most ordinary people will still keep this btc in something resembling a bank account. Managing and protecting keys is too fraught for the average person.
Even many technical people won't want the risk of fucking up their back-ups, being hacked, etc etc.
The precursors of banks were people you paid to store your gold and silver securely. We'll just return to that.
The fees will be very low too since storing bitcoin securely is theoretically far cheaper than gold. For a start bitcoin doesn't take up physical space and doesn't weigh anything.

There could never be a rigorous mathematical proof of that. You could never define all the variables. Even physics can be difficult to use mathematical proofs within. Mathematical proofs are only really 100% effective in the field of pure mathematics. For all else your model could just be wrong. You could just be proving the mathematical correctness of a model that doesn't correspond accurately to reality.
Empiricism is also similarly difficult in social sciences due to the inability to have real control groups. There are always many variables differing in any comparisons.


Computers cannot help this problem at all. You need to read more econ. Particularly about how value is subjective. In order to use computers to solve this problem there would have to be a scientific unit called "utils" that could objectively allocate how much more valuable, say, a paperclip is than a chair.
The reason market prices work is that they involve individuals bidding on what their preferences are. In economics, generally what we aim for is to satisfy everyone's preferences as highly as possible with limited resources. That's an optimisation problem, and requires a feedback mechanism whereby individuals can signal their preferences back into the overall system. The bidding process of "well, maybe i'd like this good/service but not at this price" is what makes market prices so incredibly effective.
That isn't possible with central planning of any kind.
You need to do a lot more reading.

Even rich people go to jail. Just because they can usually afford better lawyers, and can afford to obfuscate their tracks well enough that the greater legal entity (the company) takes the fall instead of a single person.
The very wealthy still live under the state's boot. They just can afford to wriggle around to more comfortable positions more easily.


It's totally irrelevant. The "powers that be" in capital did everything they could to try to prevent the current outcome. The failed.


Not sure what crime pixies are but I'll roll with it. The existence of parasites suckling on the state overwhelming power does not mean that those parasites are the "real power." If you have an intestinal worm, you may find yourself craving certain foods, since it has some evolved ability to influence your behaviour. You're still the one with the power over your life though, and you can take medicine to destroy the parasite if you choose to. The state, with a signature of a pen, can throw off all the parasites any time it chooses. It chooses not to because there's a degree of symbiosis in the form of campaign contributions etc. It's a "you scratch my back, I won't break yours" relationship

The problem is your reasons assume that, were it not interfered with or its roots destroyed, communism could actually exist.
It has much deeper problems than that, rooted in the information theory aspects of economics. Economic calculation is impossible under communism.
This has been known for about 70-80 years now, and the USSR (yes, not real communism, etc, etc, etc not relevant) diverted most of the economics research towards finding solutions to these problems (the role of free-floating market-prices in economic calculation and in providing information to economic actors... and how to achieve the same thing without those market prices) . They never did. About the only left-wing anarchist system that could conceivably function is Mutualism.
Though even then, I think the system would have huge problems incentivising investment in capital and infrastructure if you can't have private, absentee ownership.

Everything about bitcoin is steeped in the culture of the cypherpunks of the 90s. Most of the early contributors were old school cypherpunks. Bitcoin itself fulfils one of the most important desired pieces of crypto the cypherpunks desired: digital cash. Satoshi himself cited papers by a bunch of cypherpunks. In fact it's fairly obvious that whoever Satoshi was, he was around in the glory days of the cypherpunk mailing list.
The venn diagram of cypherpunks and people who consider themselves "crypto-anarchists" is pretty much entirely intersection. To deny the link between bitcoin and the broad ideologies that fall under "crypto-anarchism" is absurd.
Claiming that capitalism and anarchism can't go-exist is equally ridiculous when Bitcoin basically embodies both those things. The Bitcoin-enabled online drug trade is raw anarcho-capitalism. If you don't believe me, then think it through. We have anarchistic money and anarchistic ways of communicating with no central control. This is used to facilitate business between capitalists (for example weed growers, they make money via their ownership of capital: the seeds, and growing infrastructure) without any government enforcement of contracts or dispute resolution. You don't think capitalism and anarchism can exist? Open your eyes.
I'd be a lot more skeptical that communal ownership and distribution can exist without centralised power. All anarcho-capitalism needs is a means to defend what's yours.

The problem with viewing everything in terms of classes, is that it ignores that different rich people have profoundly differing interests.
Tariffs will profoundly hurt many on wall street. They will help some who have interest in US-based manufacturing businesses.
If capital truly was above state, Trump wouldn't have won. End of.


I actually agree with you 100% on this, but I just hate it when people pretend that corporations in the US are actually more powerful than the state. It's demonstrably false.
In the US, large corporations are cronies; trusted lieutenants and aristocracy to the real power. This is still a huge problem. I'm a staunch libertarian, I hate crony capitalism. I just would prefer we correctly identify the real issue: that there's so much state power for cronies to influence and suckle on.

Explain to me how the international drugs trade exists then. Even better than that, explain how legal trade occurs between countries that have no treaties in place to allow the trading partners to make use of either country's legal system to settle disputes.
There are ways to enforce contracts without the state. Many of them aren't pretty. Some are more benign like reputational capital.
If you don't think contracts and property titles can be enforced without the state, you need to look into the multitude of times and places that they are.
The truth is that the overwhelming majority of people on the planet don't have access to, or can't afford, to use the state legal system to enforce contracts and settle disputes. They still manage to do business.

Not true. The total value of all goods services and accumulated wealth in the economic system is not static. The fixed pie fallacy is the most common one in economics.
In the 1400s there was very little wealth in general. Now everyone is much better off despite there being a lot lot more people.

It's possible for both goods to increase in value against some other good. In which case your wealth would increase regardless of which one you picked.
It's also possible to make gains in one tradable pair while losing value on the whole.
There's also the fact that the value of goods changes for those not engaged in buying and selling. When the price of bitcoin rises, the total value of all bitcoin rises against the dollar. All those people who aren't engaged directly in trade at that moment see their net worth change.
I.e. it may only cost X BTC to move the market, resulting in a gain in value for all holders which is many times greater than X spread across all owners of bitcoin.

Because the mining system is like a lottery for who gets to create the block. Without the mining system (or some replacement that accomplishes the same task) then who decides which block is the "real" one when there are more transactions pending than can fit in the block?
The full nodes could just publish competing versions of the next block (with transactions blocked that they don't like etc). In the current system miners can censor transactions, but only if they win that block. For example there have been historically malicious miners that have published empty blocks.

I added a little more to my previous post while you were replying.
Who said invade militarily? All you do is move in in large numbers (there's no borders or immigration) and form a "democratic state" among your supporters. You make them sign a voluntary contract that says they're subject to the laws of that state and can't leave. A lot of people would sign that document for state protection (and you know this because today billions of people are content to live under a state). Then when you get powerful enough you just start taxing the people who held out from signing your document.
If a majority of people in your AnCap society don't have any particular convictions about Anarcho-Capitalism, they'll form a state, then they'll impose it on you too. Therefore in the current world, you'd need to have strict immigration controls to preserve your AnCap society.

I don't mind Rothbard but the whole "you can leave your baby to starve, naked and in the cold because to require otherwise would be coercion and positive rights" is pretty distasteful. Sure, it's a logical outcome of the NAP, but it's pretty horrific.
Tbh, the NAP in general has some serious holes in it, most of them regarding children. Some view children as pure property without rights until an age of maturity. Some take the opposite view that children are fully independent beings from birth.
So, things like "you can't go out and play in traffic" or "it's time for bed" would be coercion. It also leaves open absolutely no forms of discipline to the parent. I'm not even talking about physical punishment, even things like "grounding" or, like my parents did when I was little, have me sit on the bottom stair as a form of time out.

Trust me. Just try *not* being a kind of leftist and see how much "live and let live" you get. Anftifa, who are mainly anarcho-communists, have taken to rioting to prevent anyone right of centre from speaking at american universities. I've been following this pretty closely. It is **not** a "they're both as bad as each other" sort of thing going on.
The most recent "battle of Berkeley" I admit I was happy to see them chased out instead of just going unopposed as usual. But I don't really like the fact that these extreme leftists have created an evolutionary pressure on other parts of the political spectrum to be violent in self defense. This is Weimar Germany shit and I hate to talk like a small child here but: they started it. When one side of the debate is violently shutting down the other, and discourse ends, and you get roving street battles: That's v worrying.
As a right-libertarian I disagree with a lot of the populist or alt-right positions, but they're actually willing to have a conversation. You seem to be open to talking too, but you're a rarity on the left. And it doesn't surprise me that someone as reasonable as you is a Mutualist.

I can't decide if I'm an AnCap. If we can go full cypherpunk and just cut the state out of being able to tax us... and it actually doesn't go full Mad Max then no-one will be happier than me. I think though deep down I'm more a classical liberal.
There are some things I have some skepticism. I'm a European, and I'm not entirely sure that trying to integrate all these refugees is going to go all that well.
I think an Anarcho-capitalist society would be fucking amazing... in a world where there was a rough consensus amongst everyone that it's a good thing. Similar to how there's a rough consensus in the world at the moment that "democracy is a good thing."
The problem with a borderless ancap society is all the entryism by people who don't hold those ideals.
If you have a good think about it: we already live an an AnCap world... it's just there's a bunch of thugs threatening us for a cut of our money and most of those people have been indoctrinated to view it as something other than that. We're free to do business however we like... as long as the thugs don't see.

Oh, well I'm glad you cleared that up. Those studies that tried and failed to link vaccines to autism are invalid because the government (who didn't perform those studies) is often incompetent.


You are correct, dietary science had a lot of errors which are being rectified in the form of peer reviewed studies. Totally irrelevant to vaccines though.


ecowatch.com ...wow, sounds like a really reliable, neutral source with no agenda at all.




Gonna 99% bet you learned that word on an anti-vax site and didn't know it before, and that you have no formal expertise in biology or chemistry.


Ah, using the "elaborate phrasing to pretend to be intelligent" tactic. Genuinely intelligent people actually usually use plain speech.
What you don't actually understand is that if you present me with genuine peer-reviewed studies that there's a link between autism and vaccines, I'll take it seriously. You can't though, because they don't exist. And there's no evidence I could show you that'd change your mind. The only one that exists is the first one by Andrew Wakefield which is a proven fraud. No-one else has found a link, despite a lot of effort.
I remember this all well, because I'm from the UK, and Andrew Wakefield was a British doctor who conducted this "trial". The anti-vax thing started in the UK, before idiot American celebs promoted it over the pond.
Finally, my step-father is a doctor, my mother is a nurse who goes to schools to administer vaccinations. They've both read a lot of these studies related to vaccines. They have nothing but absolute disgust and contempt for the anti-vax movement. There are children that can't be vaccinated due to existing health conditions. You put those children and your own at risk by not vaccinating them.
You idiots have swapped an imagined risk of autism (which if it exists is so low as to be indistinguishable from the statistical margin of error) for real deaths, and disabilities of real children.


Whhhhhaaaat a cunt you are. Take a long hard look at yourself. I'm actually laughing reading that comment. Jesus. I can't imagine being that much of a total fucking douchebag.

If there's a split, it's likely one of the chains will continue to exist, but it's very unlikely that two versions of bitcoin will exist with a comparable price. One of the chains will "win" as the one the community chooses to continue to call "bitcoin".

What formal medical and/or chemistry/biology training do you have (my bet is none).
Why would the be a conspiracy to ensure vaccines contained Mercury if there was evidence it was unsafe.
You have evaded every one of these questions.

You can't lose your coins, on either chain, if you just leave them.
What the combined value of those coins on both chains will be... depends on how contentious the fork is. Best case scenario is there's no contention, the network just moves over to SegWit and no-one makes a serious attempt at a preserving "Bitcoin Classic" like what happened with ETH.
Next best scenario is that someone does try to preserve the old chain, but the community largely rejects it in favour of the UASF chain, then Jihan and Roger are just left with a shitty altcoin that no-one uses.
After that things get complicated. It's hard to accurately judge how strong the support is for each side of this debate. We could end up with two bitcoins with comparable levels of support... which wouldn't be ideal. SegWitCoin and ClassicCoin would both lose significant amounts of market cap, and it would take a while for a clear winner to emerge. It's unlikely they'd stay split forever though. As soon as one chain gained momentum, people would pile out of it into the other chain.

Look into what happened when eth forked. People who held balances before the chain split now basically had a balance on both.
ETH and ETC were basically separate cryptocurrencies with a shared history up until a particular block number.
Of course, it wasn't really advantageous, because the combined market-cap of both was less than ETH's market cap before the hard fork. (The uncertainly caused a large sell-off).
But those who believed in the hard fork just sold their ETC and kept their ETH. Those who believed in ETC sold their ETH and kept their ETC.

Why do you keep bringing up butter btw, it's neither relevant or a good metaphor.
What's your suggestion? The science was inaccurate there, so you're right about vaccines?
Explain to me, please, why if there's strong evidence of this link, that we haven't changed the way vaccines work?
And explain why you haven't arranged to use vaccines that don't contain any mercury compounds? If there's a market for non-Mercury vaccines for anti-vaxxers, why wouldn't companies be all over it. They can probably charge a premium.
I just don't understand why you think the science would be covered up, or why the market wouldn't respond.
Vaccination is generally considered one of the greatest achievements in medicine. Untold suffering of horrific diseases that were commonplace have been averted.
Everyone I know was vaccinated. Not many autistic people in that bunch. So to claim you know for certain that my child will be autistic seems fairly... Well... Autistic.
Even if there was a slightly higher prevalence of autism with vaccines (no good evidence)... It would even then still be worth vaccinating. Slightly higher rates of autism is better than the horrific things people went through as recently as our grandparents generation.
I'm still betting you have no formal training in any of this. I don't know of any anti-vax people with medical training.

Or you're mixing up correlation and causation, in that the deflationary periods were a period of hard, poor, frontier existence.
I'll give you the assumption that deflation is terrible in a fractional reserve system. It can unwind the whole system if unchecked. But with sound money, it's not a bad thing.
Inflationary currency is certainly one major reason for the vast inequality. The poor hold their savings in cash, the rich in assets. Inflation is a transfer from cash holders to asset holders.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:41:21
Why did loans exist prior to 1913 then?
In the United States at least, the currency actual experienced steady price-deflation for most of the post-civil-war 1800s.
And tbh, lending out a deflationary currency makes more sense than lending out an inflationary one.
An inflationary one, you have to goose the interest rate to make sure you don't lose money on inflation. (because they're paying you back money that's worth less in purchasing power than the money you lent them, on top of the interest to account for time-preference).
A deflationary currency you can charge a more modest interest rate, and not worry that inflation is going to be higher than expected and wipe out your profits.
*Borrowing* a deflationary currency is a little more risky, since you'll be earning less money for the same effort nearer the end of the loan repayment period.
Lending a deflationary currency makes perfect sense, even more so than lending an inflationary one, because the time-preference relationship makes it more advantageous to save and invest (making loans being a kind of investment) than to borrow and spend.

Sure, but so does loaning a guy $28,000 and watching hyperinflation reduce its value to zero while it's locked up in the legal payment timeframe.
Ultimately, whether something is "hyperinflation" or "rapid price deflation" like bitcoin is a matter of perspective.
Compared to bitcoin and ethereum, the world's fiat currencies are currently undergoing hyperinflation. If I lend you $1000USD on a 10% interest rate, when I could have invested that in BTC... that's functionally the same thing as your money undergoing hyperinflation while locked up in a loan.

You assume that bitcoin will always be exponential. It's not going to be loaned it while its on this trajectory, for sure.
Not because it doesn't make sense to loan out the currency, but it doesn't make sense to **take** the loan.
Loaning a guy $100 and being paid back $28,000 sounds pretty great to me. Better than loaning him $100 Venezuelan Bolivar and getting 10c back.
Extreme fluctuations in value are what make loans unviable. More so than the direction of change.

At no point did I deny that, my only caveat is "for now". One day it will level off. At the moment we're arguably experiencing a Grisham's Law moment. When the dust settles, then we can spend.

I bought 1.7 bitcoin for £20 in Jan 2013, and sold for £160 in October (note the month) 2013.

Because that's always true and at some point you starve to death, and people still bought things prior to 1913 when there was a small deflationary effect.
Whether you have 1% inflation or 1% deflation will make only a small difference to people's spending habits, because even now most people view money as a static thing. They feel like a $45k salary is the same thing as it was 10 years ago. People aren't fully rational economic-maximisers.

Some of the most desirable goods in our society are extremely deflationary.
