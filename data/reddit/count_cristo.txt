I agree, most folks are just jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon. And it is hard for the general public to truly understand bitcoin and crypto currency. However, we can see bitcoin is becoming an industry with all the bitcoin startups, and with that we will see technology that will simplify the idea of bitcoin and eventually make it something that can be well understood to for the average person. I think that technology is moving really fast and although bitcoin is still in its early stages, like internet was in 1990's, it is likely that bitcoin is going to advance rather rapidly and in my opinion that will be in the next 5 years.

Good point. There is a great amount of factors that come into play here. It is a very dynamic and full spectrumed subject. That is why bitcoin is so admired...

I'll give you some Doge in exchange for some Bitcoin ;)
But regardless of the odds, the more I look at this thing...the more it seems like a really big deal. Did you see the Executive of Mastercard make his address on how bitcoin can't be trusted? It almost sounded like Mastercard is begging for people not to use bitcoin. Ofcourse, all the big financial institutions are worried. They may just get put out of business.

Prediction is based on events. But I would say that in the next 5 years.

Yea, them and MasterCard....I just wrote an article pointing out how MasterCard recently stated that Bitcoin can't be trusted, yet MasterCard holds a bitcoin patent which incorporates the crypto currency into a MasterCard operated online shopping cart. How I ironic.

I think bitcoin is going to reach ridiculously high numbers, but that is just my opinion. I remember when bitcoin first came out and everyone had their doubts, except those who fully understood the technology. I couldn't understand what bitcoin was, so therefore I didn't bother with it at first, but now I am sure that it will replace fiat money, or at the very least will be a stepping stone to a new monetary system.

Good point. I don't know why I keep thinking that Spring of 2015 will be the right time...

Their monopoly is over, and so are their outrageous fees.

Yea, they don't like a good competition....that's a no no

Prediction is based on events, rather than a time table. For example, the widespread adoption of bitcoin ATMs and debit cards. Look at the ATM maps, and read the news, you will see that bitcoin atms are popping up all over the place. Paypal and Microsoft are adopting bitcoin as well.

There is a lot of things that come into play, which may determine the value of bitcoin. The U.S. dollar for example, I am sure if the dollar crashed....bitcoin may very well shoot it's way up. Things like the economy and government restrictions should also be taken into consideration. With Russia contemplating on restricting the use of bitcoins and China as well....All in all, I believe that the people and our acceptance of bitcoin will ideally give it it's value. The more people that use bitcoin, the more infrastructure we will have being built up around it. We are now in an era where there are bitcoin ATM's, exchanges, and merchant services; and this is just the beginning phase of its standardization and widespread use.

100,000 000 is unlikely, but I wouldn't rule out the 40,000 USD mark. 
P.S. Not all your bitcoins, but generous donations are welcome.
