CNN Breaking News: It's not looking good for the new online payment system.  The Bitcoin CEO quit after corruption charges, China is pulling out their funding, the company will probably have to file bankruptcy soon to pay off it's creditors.  Time to short sell the stock.

Couldn't you just have 2 independent groups -- one who issues coins, and one who counts them?

Neither of those strategies will be very effective when the price only goes down.

The Federal Reserve is a corrupt corporation that creates and manages US dollars on behalf of US banks.  They shouldn't need to, or even be allowed to have a policy on other currencies.

These banker guys are getting scammed. You can get someone wacked for only 9 bitcoins.

Buy something that you can use every day like VPN service.  PIA accepts anonymous bitcoin payments making your internet traffic completely private.

Does Mark Karpeles know how many bitcoins it would take to have a hitman eliminate him?

The price is really stable and increases in value really quickly, while at the same time preventing money laundering and is totally anonymous.

In the future there will be 2 kinds of people.  People have bitcoins, and those who have fractions of bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:49:01
Opinions like that are just fine with me cause eventually the true believers will be the only ones with over 1.0 bitcoins.  The rest of society can one day fight over the nanobitcoins left over after the great crash of 2015.

Paypal is irrelevant these days.  Way too expensive.  In Canada we have email money transfers that happen immediately, and are free with some accounts.  Bitcoin just takes it to the next level.  Just don't use eBay and you never have to bother with Paypal ever again.

Is there really somebody out there who had cash deposited in MtGox and is now able to buy bitcoins at $150 ?  Or is it all an illusion?  What is real?

Warren Buffett won't be around long enough to witness Bitcoin overtake the US dollar in transaction volume per day.  So it really doesn't matter to him whether or not he looks like an old fuddy duddy.
He came from a different time, and will absolutely be proved wrong.

Use bitcoin to buy computing capacity on a virtual host server, run the bitcoin software to generate more bitcoins.

Joe Manchin also doesn't understand calculus, he called for a ban on calculus 3 years ago, but that didn't go anywhere either.

Short answer: nobody knows, bitcoin broke new ground, leveraged a lot of technology to create something legimately useful and potentially extremely disruptive to a lot of powerful entities, it has both first-mover advantage and critical mass, but noone expected it to be so valuable so quickly and noone knows what it's price will be in the future.
Long answer: Yes... but it would take some explaining.

Maybe people should stop using Magic The Gathering Online Exchange to trade their financial currency.  These guys are clearly unqualified to act as a Bitcoin exchange.  So just stop using them and ignore them.

Too bad you can't buy bitcoins with bitcoins and eliminate all this nonsense.

It's not surprising that old fashioned people don't understand and don't like new technology.  Maybe the bitcoin community should send Buffett and Krugman a VHS tape of what bitcoin is.  Apple on the other hand are just idiots and are going to find themselves on the wrong side of the coin.
