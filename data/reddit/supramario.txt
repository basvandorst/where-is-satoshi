The idea of gold once was a accepted currency. I'm not saying BTC will never be accepted as a currency but until the common person can go to the store and swipe their card and spend x-amount of a BTC, then it is a gamble.

Until you can walk into a store and buy a loaf of bread with the swipe of a card, BTC will just be a gambling and market based coin, nothing more.

Then show me where the 5 billion current price is in infrastructure, again...right now, the $400+ is pure speculation. PERIOD.

I don't understand why so many here keep saying this isn't a bubble. There is no infrastructure to handle this price right now, every bit of this is speculation buying...nothing more. People need to stop acting like this isn't a bubble...

Believe me I want Bitcoin to take off, but I know it needs to do it slowly and it needs to create infrastructure to be able to take off and be used by not just tech savvy people. Right now it is pure speculation. 
How can it be used as a transactional currency when it's cheaper to change my money from one form to another or send money via paypal. I'm also not worried when I do send USD to people....with bitcoin right now, everyone is. Until the infrastructure is like say banks and CCs and accepted by large retailers, we have a ways to go.


And here is the problem. People like to touch stuff, be able to handle their currency. Bitcoin cannot do that currently. Yea you can get cold storage coins, but in reality, its a 1 time use. Hopefully some day even my mother who barely knows how to send email will be able to use bitcoin, but right now...its not. On top of that a currency is only as valuable as those who use it and stick with it to buy and sell goods. Gold and Silver work because it's a defacto currency with limited quanities that everyone in the world knows about, on top of that people can hold it. Bitcoins not so much. 


Because a large influx of price without the supported infrastructure is a bubble. The housing market was a bubble, because the people driving the prices up and paying for them, couldn't afford the price increase in the first place. It's why myself and a few friends were able to purchase 500k homes for less than 90k, because the market corrected the home price...the house wasn't worth that even though people where trying to buy and sell it for that price. Now it has corrected and its worth what the infrastructure of the housing market says it's worth.

This is what is scaring me about this massive bubble, big players are going to see $$ soon and cash out. We can have a massive growth but if there is nothing to spend it on and no infrastructure to hold it together then this thing is going to pop and a lot of people are going to be out some serious cash. $100 is where the infrastructure is sitting, not this massive $400 bubble, as all it is at this point is speculation that the infrastructure to handle this price will catch up fast....very very fast.

Haven't sold, and probably won't but this isn't my point. I just don't want to see it fail, and speculation is a good way to watch something fail...

I like it like that. People aren't going to just hold hands.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:21:59
This, I'm very new to this, but I know it will crash again. Sure it won't go down to $10 a pop but I'm betting around $100 or less. I've only purchased around $25 so that I can play around with it and figure out the wallets and how to store it safely. Right now all I am seeing is a bunch of people wanting to invest only to not understand how to properly protect their investment....I foresee a lot of theft coming soon.

This is where BTC needs some serious development, right now it's more of a volatile way to xfer currencies and buy from shops that have adopted it to get in on the money...btc needs to step up and become as easy to use as it is with a bank right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:33:16
This...awesome to see it this high but it's going to pop...
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:12:59
Small retailers taking in bitcoin. Until more than just small BM and internet shops take it, it will not be worth what you think it will.
Please tell me there is infrastructure out there right now willing to purchase and use 5million worth of bitcoin. There isn't. PERIOD. This is a bubble, don't be stupid.

I'm still completely lost about the paper wallet stuff, reading and reading just gets me further into a massive "umm"....I want bitcoin to succeed but I'm afraid if it's this hard to pickup and figure out, we will be in for a rough ride. 
BTW, I'm not a simple computer user, I'm a Systems Engineer for a large MSP.
Back to reading.
Gotta figure this shit out.
