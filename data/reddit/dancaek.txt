Do you know if it is correct that after that 11.3k, the next 9k would be a lower rate of 10%, and then 20% after ~20k?

I took that bet too after sorting Facebook and Twitter posts tagged 'Trump' and 'Clinton' by 'new.' I put a week's wages on 6:1 and then bet half a week's wages the other way when FBI re-opened to get 7:1.
My friends were laughing at me for it. Same as Bitcoin. They still laugh now. C'est la vie, sheep.

Maybe the angle is that, assuming society recovers, you hold secret value that is likely to carry over in the future, whereas cash value is likely to be wiped out Venezuela style.

Whilst it doesn't appeal to the purist, in this scenario, I could imagine bitcoin roaring in value, albeit with a heavy dose of manipulation, then when all is said and done, it can't be created out of thin air and we move into a new financial era.
Personally I see a successful bitcoin contributing to a fairer financial world - moving forward after the points you described. I see these sort of events as a necessary evil to get there and I think it presents a good opportunity to make money in the process.
It's extremely interesting to watch and I suppose it could play out in a variety of ways, but knowing the world we live in...

I rack my brains on this, but with the hodlers and lost coins, the rise could potential be exponential? Like everything in this game...

We need a bitcoin shitposting sub

You shouldn't, but I still see it as a necessity in day-to-day life for the average person.
Going 100% btc is certainly ballsy, it's not on my immediate to-do list.

This happened to me.
The ex will only understand when the truth comes about beyonce and kanye. Its sad really.

Interesting patterns, but it all goes out the window if an external factor comes into play.

Okay thx brb... popping to the bank.

I've always kinda imagined that in this eventual scenario, we would secretly be filthy rich and taking a flight to somewhere dodgy or financially liberal.

I mostly see it as an investment in blockchain technology. Whilst I believe in BTC, I also believe it may one day be wise to recognize that other blockchains may have more 'practical' uses. BTC will in my opinion remain a go-between that everyone in crypto uses - like a bureau, a kind of translator. Therefore I see BTC as store of value, with great potential to appreciate based on blockchain technology, even if it does not take over the World in itself.
I also use it so that the banks don't have so much of my wealth. It has a political value for me.

Have you any luck? Exact same issue for me!
