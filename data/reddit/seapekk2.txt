If you start reading about investing, bitcoin, stocks or whatever passive income then at some point you realise that you are already improving yourself and making money. Don't expect to be rich over night. It just won't happen. Just read about crypto and make it to your hobby.

That's okay. Just wait
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:38:40
It's all normal. Don't freak out.

It's illegal to do drugs, buy sex and whatever. If a large group of people wants to deal with crypto or other activities it's hard to stop them.

Just let it go. You are never going to see your bitcoins again. Maybe you should buy new ones?

Soon as you see 4000 there's no "long term" in your head. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:42:17
Why someone should cry? I don't get it
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:30:14
Borrow some then. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:27:22
Umm. When you register for websites then usually everyone agrees with "Terms of use" i reckon that you had to agree as well. There's nothing to complain about

How much did you invest. 100bucks? You lucky bastard
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:40:42
Everyone is happy when it rises. You can also make money when it falls. Don't panic
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:12:15
Then make your free market

You can try shorting. Quick way to make much much money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:44
Why would i do that. I'm going to eat nice and juicy steak for christmas
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:16
There's no one to blame but yourself
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:17
But "idiot Swede" was right. It is useless right now. Can't even buy a cup of coffee for that. It was meant to be super fast and cheap currency without any high fees. It wasn't meant  to be make you rich thing. Every bank is much cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.

Would you like to eat my shit for 1000bucks. I promise you, after that others will eat your shit for 5000bucks
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:06
Yes, it's right time to buy for everyone. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:34
And then buy back at 11grand and repeat
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:00:47
It was stillborn. Never been alive. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:06:44
Every kid can get 20grand loan from bank. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:57:51
It's quite easy in china. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:04:58
Maybe it's submarine
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:11:44
Well, it won't. If someone has shit load of cheap coins then ge can do whatever he wants with market
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:09:33
How come bitcoin is going to help them?
