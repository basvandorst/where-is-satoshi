Are the HD wallets compatible to mycelium or electrum?
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:03:27
Damn, get the f**** bitcoin ceo and tell him to bring up the blockchain again!
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:37:13
look at this.... 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:27:16
Is it just one hacked account or multiple? Any problems maybe with a broken random number generator?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:00:05
@_date: 2016-08-15 15:52:55
No not really, we also dont have monthly subscriptions. You just pay for the sms you receive, no monthly costs. And no, its not very profitable, it's just running because we use it by ourselfes.. :) I've also seen some competitors growing up and dying again, so it looks like its not a big business the moment...
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:15:02
to buy or not to buy, this is here the question...
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:15:30
Then could you maybe ask someone in the other department?
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:41:59
So we should fork Bitocoin...! But damn.. The shortcut BTC is already used.. Maybe BTCC.. But this is also used.. BTCCC? sounds idiotic.. :D
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:44:52
See here why its a quite bad behaviour, its a really nice writeup: 
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:34:15
same story here :)
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:34:32
Have your keys been compromised? You use multisig addresses or? and one private key you own.. or am I wrong?

Could you say something about the future of mycelium gear?
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:09:52
Here are the first calculations... maybe ~75 mio usd.. 
Edit: Recalulated the amounts
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:30:52
Can you share the transaction id? how much btc is on the receiving address???
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:16:12
I think its much more... 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:19:53
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:44:18
bfx doesnt have cold storage.. each user has an own multisig wallet.. and it seems that the hacker had access to some/many? private keys..
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:37:37
but the trading on the exchange itself is generating much more volume.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:16:35
true.. thx
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:11:39
yeah please... :O

I really  cant understand this argument? I mean? Really? Please explain it to me...
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:38:57
I wanted to downvote this post.. but then i read his article and i have to say that it was not so bad.. he made some good points... tldr: article was better than the title..
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:05:02
big crash within the next days... if the final amount of lost bitcoins is stated, price will slowly go up again.. at least thats what I expect..
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:39:27
OMG READ THIS: 
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:30:37
i also have a unique trezor email, but didnt receive any spam/phishing.. So i cannot confirm this issue.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:34:01
at least its clear now that it wasnt 4 days :D
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:05:28
Trading volume means nothing in China, they have no fees. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:31:30
also didnt have any problems...
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:45:12
You should wait some hours.. i think there will come an even bigger drop..
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:14:00
Do you know something about mycelium gear?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:51:48
confirmed: 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:59:18
pfff. if this is really true, than it looks really bad :/ roughly 78 mio USD...
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:19:03
no. just postponed..
@_date: 2016-08-22 08:44:43
Thank you for this interesting tutorial!!!
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:20:57
Hm... Dont know if dash and dodge and other altcoins is the right way.. no need for altcoins on my own. hope your new wallet is at least as usable as the old one - and i hope you are not having too high targets and loose your focus / quality because of a too broad field of development. 
can you maybe also give some updates on how you will continue with mycelium gear? It looks like the development is stalled? Last news is from 2015 on twitter?
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:48:00
I think they have this option, but has to be implemented by the bitgo buisness customers (f.e. bitfinex).. if they dont do it, then this functionality is not available..
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:46:14
Or... 420 mio usd.. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:30:27

lets see :/
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:54:31
got it :D
@_date: 2016-08-27 15:03:32
get a trezor! Works great and is really the most secure and easy storage!
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:01:07
look at this thread.. 
if this is true, the loss is ~90 mio usd..
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:56:58
Its so secure, nothing can happen anymore!!!
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:36:10
omg.. this is really retared...
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:38:12
yeah maybe..
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:24:52
true, you are right :D
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:55:08
Sometimes there is, sometimes not :)
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:35:15
We don't know. And the exchanges also don't want to publish this details, because with this fees they can say that they have the highest volume. Also when it doesn't say anything. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:44:14
Worked also fine for me in Austria, Europe! :D
@_date: 2016-04-29 09:33:09
Sure it's not fake when real users do it. I've never said that? 
But the volume of bots is quite higher than of real people trading on zero fee markets.
Also I didn't speak about generating traffic by the exchange owners, I think you are misinterpreting something here. And sorry, but I don't agree with your statement, that fees don't have anything to do with blowing up volume.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:54:50
No, I'm just curious..
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:13:13
yes, same here, bitcoinwisdom also doesnt show any trades
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:44:37


Why restrict it to governments? Nowadays private companies are sometimes much more dangerous..
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:24:57
Keep your head up and don't listen to the trolls.. Looks really cool :) 
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:28:56
OP can really ignore this answer...
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:24:08
damn.. :D
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:52:17
Thanks - your communication is really nice.. not like other exchanges.. your open communication is really good!
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:53:37
I know, but I was asking for the price expectations, not the time of occurence..
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:00:21
It's not fun. I can tell you.
@_date: 2016-04-29 08:31:28
what do you mean with internal bot trading? if you exchange btc &lt;-&gt; usd via bot, the trade will be visible also for all other market partners? and increase the volume?
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:27:35
Lol.. Recent blog post from Peter Todd.. That was in January. In bitcoin time this is ages ago.. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:20:46
Here is one transaction/deposit address from me: 
Seems that they reuse adresses and have high balanced change adresses... (11k, 48k USD)
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:40:17
Ah cool, didn't know that. Thx! 
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:23:00
same with mycelium gear... no updates since 2015?
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:24:30
This is in the website..
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:22:11
Here is the whole transaction: 
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:41:24
Thanks peter!!!!
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:30:18
Gratulation to your trezor, they are really great devices... I think with mytrezor its not possible.. If you want to change the fees, you can probably do it with electrum, another software wallet which you have to install on your computer.. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:23:48
thanks for this interesting answer!
@_date: 2016-04-26 22:17:45
Yeah it was really quick.. the time between pressing "send" on my phone/mycelium and the payment confirmation was about... 0,75 second?
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:25:32
Its quite interesting for some people, since the bitcoin integration was released in steam some hours ago and maybe someone is interested in the shopping-workflow..

@_date: 2016-04-26 12:08:51
Really useless news, due to zero fees in china...
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:25:52
Can you maybe tell something about the mentioned amounts here? 
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:46:14
there are none as far as I know.. Except Bitstamp with their new btc/eur trading pair in their first month now (or so?).
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:43:10
Worked already great for me! Thanks! I really prefer bitcoin now! I ordered a HTC Vive shortly after the release, and I have really big problems now because of expired credit card authorization, other problems from the CC gateway... With bitcoins its much easier and faster! Love it!
@_date: 2016-04-28 08:19:14

@_date: 2016-04-04 18:01:34
Didn't look at the source code, but it's nice that you are spending time to improve your Bitcoin and coding knowledge... I would just recommend you to learn how to use git and release your source code for example over github.com! They have also nice tutorials how to work with git! 
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:32:39
You didn't understand? why not? whats wrong? :P
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:39:49
Nice way to launder money?  :) if you are miner.. Or have a friend as miner. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 09:11:38
They had several bit security issues and outages in their service... So a lot of people are not trusting anymore blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:59:55
This is not a security bug in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:34:51
Do you have teamviewer installed? there were a lot of reports about stolen wallets over teamviewer some time ago..

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:28:52
See the cornell study: 
and richard heartwins talk about it: 
Basically there would be no technical problem to increase the blocksize to 1.01 MB, but the deployment on the network leads to many problems (network partitioning, forked chains...), since it's a hardfork and old clients get incompatible. So you either go with a big change to make this change worth (but which leads to more centralization) or let it be and use scaling technologies like lightning, mast, schnorr which scale much much better than a block size increase.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:27:02
Yeah ripple also pumped!!!! I mean.. Dodge is the clear winner though /s
@_date: 2016-04-30 10:26:39
I also do, and it takes usually at maximum 2 days to confirm.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:46:22
Cool! Thanks a lot guys and keep up the great work!
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:43:13
Yeah.. Unregulated exchanges like Mt. Gox are much better ;D /s
@_date: 2016-04-25 09:08:10
this were the times... mt gox.. lag time &gt; 1 min.. :D
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:38:39
@_date: 2016-04-25 09:10:24
I also send my transaction most of the time without any fee (no fast transaction needed, also with the low possibility that the transaction gets discarded)... It just takes some hours (max. 2 days from my experience)..
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:14:50
If you have been member in the bitcoin community for years, then no - this is not big news.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:01:42
lol wtf
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:13:25
You dont have to be online all the time for lightning transactions to work. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:18:24
Hm, looks like huobi has stopped trading...
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:04:16
It's not parody just because someone writes parody somewhere. It depends on the content, which is clearly not parody.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:45:35
Since segwit is more and more used, spamming the network with low fee txs gets much more expensive to be effective and it seems that this spam stopped now (at least a bit, there is still some ultra low fee tx generated).
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:02:51
And except the shitty fees they charge for their incompetent btc withdrawals and their outages when there is a lot of volume.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:27:37
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:01:17
@_date: 2016-04-15 08:00:20
Which wallet did you use?
@_date: 2016-04-29 07:56:35
Because bots blow up volume for nothing.. its the same like when i give you 100 USD, you give it back, i give it to you again, you give it back.. lets to this 100000x times (quite easy with a bot in some minutes) and then look: we have a minute volume of about 10.000.000 USD! So we are the biggest market in here! :) (but in reality we only have 100 USD traded).. If there would be fees, then the 100 USD would disappear after some time due to the fees, so there would be less trading if it costs something.

Since we just found out about spectre/meltdown, I would not trust any "secure element" out there. A general purpose chip which is easy reviewable is much better than a closed source "secure chip".
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:17:36
this is just a guess.. i mean, you are saying: if it goes up, then it goes up. if not, then it doesnt go up at the moment.... There is no qualified opinion inside, like: in 2 weeks we will cross 3100 CNY. And there can't be, since every technical analysis which I knew - failed. thats my opinion.. Everything else is just guessing.
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:53:20

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:11:50
You took a too low transaction fee, blame yourself.

Lets hope they keep it this way.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:45:27

its not big.

Lol such nonsense. I hope this is not true... 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:38:21
You can use a watch-only wallet by adding your xpub key to your mobile wallet like electrum or mycelium, so you can watch it (and keep your coins safe). Sending requires the private key, so this is not possible if you want to keep your coins in cold storage.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:14:09
Never use float for currencies.
@_date: 2016-04-28 16:51:20

Great video: 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:19:44
I think the main problem right now are bugs while creating the transactions and writing them safely to disk - if this fails, your coins are lost. But this is not related to lightning, but to all new wallet features which are developed in bitcoin land and are related to transaction signing. In the end you have signed, real bitcoin transactions - which are fine since the beginning. No need to stay online all the time! The only requirement is the "watchdog", who checks if your counterparty sends malicous old singed transactions - but this doens't have to be your wallet.
And you can close the channel whenever you want, its not related to if your counterparty is online or not, afaik.

Let's think about it again. What will people buy if tethers value goes to zero? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:02:06
Fees and txs != adoption. Many companies are batching now their transactions, so you will see less transactions but with same adoption level. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 00:28:01
Nope, bitfinex too...


@_date: 2018-01-31 17:40:40

Haha Hahahhahaa this is hilarious and so wrong.. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:33:38
Sliders suck in general imo. Would be nice also to add the USD price for a default segwit transaction, and set the default to segwit anyway!
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:51:16
Is the derivation path the same on all pages/ledgers?
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:38:58
See screenshot here: 
Just check out their page, start an order and go to the payment option type.. Works via BitPay.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:51:37
So what happens if ETH evaporates? Where is the difference?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:10:53
Its not really relevant if a bigger merchant stops bitcoin payments temporarily.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:16:07
idiot. Doesn't know what he is talking about, but at least he is vocal. lol.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:20:22
The scaling problems are not related to bitcoin, but to the blockchain technology itself. You can see this with ETH too, where many people said "oh look at bitcoin, so high fees... ETH will never have fees above 20 cent". =&gt; ETH has now on average ~3 USD fees. So no, I don't think any coin will replace bitcoin - because they will face the same problems if people start to use it. 
Bitcoin has the advantage, that many developers are already researching and implementing these new technologies like lightning, mast and schnorr - other coins are still in the illusional phase of believing in unlimited onchain scalability.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:14:24

@_date: 2017-12-31 00:13:49
OP please dont send your wallet to some stranger on the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:57:33
which really means you pay now for stupidity xD
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:31:25
 too
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:21:45
hahaha, nice one :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:52:19
Better get a new girlfriend xD
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:19:52
Hodl for sure
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:54:49
If you could not find a way, you should obviously not do it...
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:01:21
No one likes bears, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:38:34
is this block invalid or just doesn't allow collecting the reward?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:53:28
probably :D
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:36:02
Into USD or EUR you mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:45:48
Does it not work the other way round too? Is it now easier to long bitcoin too?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:26:33
Nonsense. Bitcoin skyrocket because its bitcoin. Not because of some shitty altcoin pumping company.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:47:54
LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:05:00
Your picture is incomplete, please take a look at 2011: 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:40
The reason why we are in this situation is because too many people are just screaming "oh please do something against it" - instead of doing something by themself. This is open source development, not some product which you paid for.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:07:39
please.. use the search... there are 10 posts like yours each day. better spend 2 minutes of research instead of posting spam.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:03:35
Your post is nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:34:21
insider trading. Also trading desks (streamed via youtube) had realtime data, even when the cboe website was down.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:50:04
Right now, I'm euphoric.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:11:19
Stopped at Bitcoin unlimited. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:39:08
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS SHIRT!?!?!?! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:26:38
Yes, because more outputs =&gt; bigger size of your tx =&gt; bigger fee. But this is in general, not related to any version release.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:22:16
See here: 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:47:17
Then everyone of us owns a small part of McAffee.. or? xD
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:59:54
Kraken is really a shit hole tbh.. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:53:17
because its the only coin which is used successfully
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:00:26
Looks like you have no clue how Bitcoin works. Also fees didn't rise, only the dollar value increased. You pay the same btc for a transaction like in 2011.
Sure this sucks, but please complain to companies which are sending too high fees and are not using existing scaling technologies. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:02:47
Then I dont get the point why everyone is only talking about shorting?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:41:23
Came to post this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:00:23
You are absolutely right, the bubbles from 20010, 2011 and 2013 looked also like this!!! /s
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:58:27
Why did you spend your 5 minutes to write this post, instead about learning how to develop and improve lightning by yourself? Posts like yours are SPAM - if you feel there should be something done - get the hands out of your pockets and do something against it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:33
mute her.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:13:07
Blablabla I don't know anything, but at least I shout it out as loud as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:56:56
bank size too small.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:37:38
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:54:14
thanks for pointing this out!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:16:35
Did you have 2 FA enabled?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:27:21
Maybe use a trezor and advanced recovery?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:59:39
there was also a lot of fear in the bitcoinmarkets slack... rough times
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:03:09
Yeah it's obvious 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:28:17
which will lead to even more centralization on the eth network, without some 2nd layer solutions.. Just look at this graph: 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:56:23
this should be stickied.

@_date: 2017-12-17 10:18:59
ahahahaaha this is great. upvote.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:58:39
did you verify the gpg signatures? do you have teamviewer installed?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:25:41
Thats nonsense, I sent 2 transactions with a fee of 18 &amp; 20 usd and I was confirmed within 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:00:17
Yeah please check - if its hijacked and a virus, other people will have this problem too! Please verify the signature of your exe!
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:08:17
We all will miss the meme pool
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:07:29
I thought that's the plan??? Wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:33:57
nope. CBOE was bullish, and CME will be the same. You need to pay 4x more to go short than to go long - so yeah... bullish af 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:33:29
Maybe poloniex is spamming the network, to get gains from altcoin trading?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:03:50
Why not both? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:34:03
It had negative impact on the USD xD
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:08:30
Coinbase is using MongoDB as their database. Now tell me about incompetence in bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:07:22
It's not hard. Samurai wallet implemented it in some days - and they are a small company.. Most companies were just too lazy - or were driven by political agendas.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:50:55
Maybe it was a mod :P
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:21:32


Nonsense. faked volume due to 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:09:18
50 minutes passed, so where is now your 30 minutes update :P
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:50:04
So nice!!!! GOGOGO
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:49:38
I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:44:05
Around 500k-1.000.000 USD / coin :D
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:34
you should promote more on reddit, didnt know your company! Will recommend everyone to switch :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:46:49
You are absolutely right, the bubbles from 20010, 2011 and 2013 looked also like this!!! /s
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:23:55
Oh lol, such a fail. It clearly is Safety and Exchange Corporation :facepalm:
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:37:19
23 USD to be safe for the next crisis. cheap.
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:55:19
It's game theory... You need more quite more than 50% of the users to switch..
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:28:12
Naaah.. 42 is the solution for everything!
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:48
that sounds like nonsense, since yesterday the CME launched a licenced bitcoin future market with regulatory approval.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:08:46
done and upvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:28:11
yeah you are right, the usability and explanation in wallets should be really better... but still: everyone is responsible for his own actions. educate yourself before using new technology is probably not a wrong idea.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:23:12
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:17:34
broken wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:23:04
Haha.. didn't know that one.. nice :D
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:20:17
BitcoinReminder.com also supports 20MB blocks (or even more?). 
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:13:45
Two weeks!
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:09:57
Install GPG4Windows  and compare the signature of your downloaded file with the signature file which you can find on the electrum download page  (see "signature" file right to the download link). If they have the same checksum, electrum was fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:10:22
Github please!!! :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:31:07
waatts happening??
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:06
It would be cheaper to send one single transaction with multiple outputs than sending multiple transactions with only one output (one output + change address to be precice).
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:35:31
Main address and one of the recipient addresses are linked to MtGox/SilkRoad and polo as it seems!

Two weeks!
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:47:48
as far as I know, it is open source - but not free software.. so the description is technically correct, but maybe missleading for people which don't know about the difference.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:03:29
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:20:30

Yeah, about 7 years... My coffee cup says the same :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:12:34
No he means sell
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:35:54
We can do it, because we are experts™... 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:55:29
This just works when you focus on the last 7 days... If you look at the last 30 days, it looks different.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:29:15
works already in firefox
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:15:22
Ah ok... Really? When I calculate the problem is about 33kbyte per second (20mb / 10 minutes / 60 seconds ~= 0,033MB/s ~ 33kbyte/s)? Also doesnt make sense to me.. each youtube video is using more bandwith..
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:27:08
Come on, it will take just two weeks™..
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:00:15
Please turn it on again... It feels really unconfortable and disturbing... I don't like this test, sorry.
@_date: 2015-12-06 21:44:18
Depends on what you play :P
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:48:54


Yeah I know, but a lot of people say that storage is so expensive that a bigger block size would be a problem.. And I can't understand this argument?
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:27:43
hm.. yeah looks like its different for everyone.. for me it works fine...
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:23:26
Can someone explain me why a lot of people say that people cannot afford hosting a full node with increased block size, when we have pruning very soon?
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:37:17
tatatatata duck tales!
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:57:45
this. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:40:53
You can show me that running bitcoinreminder.com is a good idea :D
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:18:35
Hm this sucks somehow.. Maybe its a jealous person, which is attracted to have more votes than others :D
@_date: 2014-10-10 12:54:20
I dont understand completly what you want to say... You spend gold for everybody?
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:40:52
So this means nobody believes that the price will go down further? 
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:24:04
We also have very often problems with their API on BitcoinReminder.com... And support is also quite bad..
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:53:42
To be honest, I didn't know until th end of the video if this is serious or just a just parody :D
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:59:56
Great that it worked for you, we also got some text alerts last night.. :)
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:21:13

Happy UASF day guys! :) Was exciting!

Just want to post this interesting thread here for further reading: 
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:57:49
haha nice one
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:22:03
Why is it trending today? Or you mean in general?
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:04:35
Is it true that the bitcoinqt 0.8.6 are not vulnerable to this bug? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:30:44
Got the answer: 


@_date: 2014-09-20 08:41:09
Yeah we are in the top 5!
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:20:16
So we need more... bad news? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:51:42
Shall we remove Mt. Gox from BitcoinReminder.com?
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:15:27
At the moment its around 36-37%.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:22:13
Stop spamming
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:32:56
bitcoinreminder.com is maybe for offline users..
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:41:30
Im just linking this thread: 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:08:18
Sounds like a great thing :) Can i have some? :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:17:46
And the word "bitcoin", the decreasing price is nasty in general..
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:41:31
Wenn Sie die Bitcoins behalten und Bitcoin crasht, dann haben sie einen finanziellen Verlust. Wenn Sie keinen externen Zahlungsanbieter nehmen und ihr System wird gehackt, haben sie einen Imageverlust. Es gibt schon viele Einzelheiten die zu beachten sind... Vorallem im Hinblick auf Newsmeldungen wie "Busunternehmen XYZ hat stolz als erstes Bitcoin-Payment eingeführt - nur funktionierts nicht".. Womit die Firma dann wieder so ein bisschen als Trottel dasteht..
@_date: 2018-05-05 23:01:50
Don't be rude! Maybe he is a miner and just checking his coinbase transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:26:39
wall away?
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:10:58
Good, so maybe someone can take a look to find some interesting news &gt;D
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:02:07
Anyone tried to reconfigure the mt gox ubikey with the software provided by yubikey? ( Maybe its at least working for some other things, like static password generation...

Summary pls, thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:24:27
In another video he sais also the sentence "es tut mir leid"... which is german and means "Im sorry"..

@_date: 2014-07-07 13:00:38
Why do you think it will take 1-2 years? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:57:48
But i think its kinda hard to buy it ^^
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:53:43
I just saw the video when he left the house... Now i think the amazon ratings are matching to this nakamoto... Because in the video he says at the end "es tut mir leid", which is german (im sorry)... In the amazon rating there is also one single german sentence... which means that there is the big possibility that these ratings are really from him..
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:46:23
Yeah, for me it works also great... This product is really well developed.. So good, that its quite suspicous that there are no flaws or bad experiences.. :D I'm quite excited to hear more opinions..
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:31:30
Where did you get the information for,that the most money is borrowed?
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:37:13
yeah here too... in vienna
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:56:27

nice thanks
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:11:25
I think they just want to trigger the stop-loss limits and buy cheap, just to resume to the normal price afterwards..
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:55:48
Ahhh... cool..then its really impressive! Thx!
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:19:37
open wifi without vpn is not related to apple products. Im also not sure if internet explorer is behaving better with security issues (seeing over the last 20 years..).. Im just saying that from my own point of view, at the moment osx is more secure to its unix basis than windows.. its just my own private feeling and experiences over the last 10 years..
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:41:52
I think bits is a great word for bitcoin parts..
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:46:48

on digitalocean you have to choose a bigger server, since they dont have  space upgrade... and this can be quite expensive..

@_date: 2014-08-10 21:07:42
Yeah great idea..
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:21:02
Then good luck :)
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:36:42
Did you wait for the whole reindexing when using the oldest backup? you can only see the transactions which are already processed in your bitcoin client?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:30:04
try our service, bitcoinreminder.com ;D
@_date: 2014-10-20 07:21:33
BitcoinReminder.com :D
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:46:20
Is there site with your algorithm to look at?
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:08:40
Probably they made a small arrangement with a small dealer and post this just for promotion.. And all of us will be dissappointed after the release and the price will drop.. i see it coming.. :D
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:09:41
Why are BTC givaways disabled?

Go to a local meetup group, there you can find other people with the same interest... makes fun and you will realize there is nothing wrong with you, you just have to find the right people..

Is that really true?
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:12:59
Yeah.. At BitcoinReminder.com we are happy now that the price is changing haha.. :P
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:09:55
No, i was mentioning the base price of the reminders. F.e. an SMS reminder before is worth $0.2 and costs about 0.000333 BTC. After the change to Bitstamp it costs only 0.000111 anymore. I should have written this more clearly, sorry.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:37:53
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:11:02
So is this story already posted somewhere?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:12:58
haha nice
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:37:47
I think its only for persons which have activated 2FA... Then it makes also sense to request it..
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:16:46
How do you finance your service? We also provide a service like you, but have to pay for sms and infrastructure... Beside earning something for our life.. How do you do it if I may ask?
@_date: 2014-07-22 16:41:29
me too?!?
@_date: 2014-09-02 07:19:58
Dont know.. But it is similar to this nice site: 
@_date: 2014-09-21 00:01:15
Anybody knows how long this code will work?
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:54:27
Great! I think it's really important to keep the full node amount high!
We were also running some other full nodes (payment ect), but this time it's only to support the Bitcoin network.
I'm really happy that there is a big community which tries to keep the track for the further bitcoin development!
@_date: 2014-04-25 09:42:31

@_date: 2014-03-27 08:39:53
Nice car!
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:07:29
which wallet is it?
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:20:12
I also think like this... at the moment: 382.95 $ on circle, 381.49 $ on Bitstamp.. So around 0,4 % more... Not much.. Maybe its just a coincidence..
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:10:09
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:44:37
i like osx more because for my development things, the terminal console is much more powerfull in osx than in windows..
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:06:27
Maybe its from cloudhashing.com...
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:44:01
You should build you system more on already tested open source software.. building all code form scratch is probably the most unreliable way to produce stable code from the beginning. 1An3EpR7AoVt7NHCzvhG3NLfRsdB6wcgv5

Its getting more and more exciting...
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:08:52
Is it safe to receive transactions with the normal BitcoinQT app? Or shall I wait for an update?
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:13:27
On Bitstamp you already have to confirm a withdraw by clicking a link in an email

Yeah you are right.. But i think it would be better than nothing.. Imagine if this comparison existed before MtGox total fail - i think a lot of new users would have chosen another exchange... and less people would have been affected by mt gox...

Ok.. Have fun financing hundreds/thousands of users and still keeping your service reliable over high quality sms routes. BitcoinReminder.com was also for free the first two years but with increasing daily work for support / technical adaptions a fee was needed to make the continuing development possible. A free service is really great, i also shared this idea, but in the end..  Anyways, you have a great service and i wish you the best for your further development.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:01:29

Did you also thought about the datacenters of the banks? They are also using a lot of energy for storing your bank account data... The same does bitcoin...

Is it interesting?
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:26:13
And, whats the problem? You can buy cheap coins.. Bitcoin will come to mainstream, so why hurry?

OMG!!!! He is in the elevator???? I have to tell my wife about it..
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:53:02
But if google/nsa (i know it would take too much time, but just in theory if there is enough time) would make this pages indexed, it wont be a problem to lookup the private key for a public key or?
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:56:15
absolutely true :D
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:39:42
I dont think there is something suspicous, the coins are still at this address.. Otherwise i think someone would use a mixer service or something like this.. So it maybe it happened during the update process, to ensure your wallet is save enough? (i dont know if this makes sense or is reasonable)... Did you try your old wallet and rescan the block chain index? with a newly downloaded exe file? hope everything will become fine for you again..
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:46:18
also make a backup of your current wallet.dat, before trying it with an old one!!!

@_date: 2014-04-22 16:08:40
It sounds like a great idea, but isn't it a problem, if bitcoin increases the precision of the bitcoin? I mean if there could be more than 8 decimal numbers? f.e. 0.00000000001 is the smallest unit?
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:01:16
Cool, thanks!

@_date: 2014-03-02 12:06:28
Yeah, I know.. But this is not what i meant. tThere is a difference between using a latest/nightly-build and a new released stable version.. I would never run a alpha version for my normal production wallet...

I also dont see anything spectacular on bitcoinwisdom/bitcoincharts/bitcoinity...
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:58:22
It's a big deal... Its really unprofessional do generate random values like this... they didn't even use https instead of http, so a man in the middle attack could occure...
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:10:27
You only think about USD... I think there are much more currencies out there :) So collect just all currencies of the world together and then calculate your market cap :)
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:53:53
Ah great, thanks for the clear up. But is this also valid for old firware versions? Like 1.3.1?

Im not sure if this is really true.. Sounds too much for me.. Or?
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:22:40
I'm with you, i was just amused because your wrote "the new version is soooo stable" and the first thing i saw in the bug thread was a gui which wasn't working as expected (so it looks like nobody looked at the gui when testing).. Beside this many "ooops, i forgott..." from an armory developer.. it was just somehow funny, it wasnt meant to be negative... armory is a great wallet, i dont want to say anything bad..

@_date: 2017-02-25 19:26:02
But people ARE voting by choosing their node client. You wouldn't use a segwit client, if you are against it - or? And it is like it: the majority of the community supports segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:28:21
daaamn... would be worth 500 millions USD now.. but at least it was from 2011.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:48:23


Sorry, but this is false. Please inform yourself about what you say. Segwit nodes are already more than 48 % of the network, so its quite clear that the community wants segwit ( It's just the miners which are lagging behind, but as you can see on the bitcoin.org page there is still a lot of work in progress: 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:19:44
haha nice...
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:34:50
But no fees - so if you compare empty blocks to blocks with fees, they have quite a big disadvantage of loosed profit.
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:19:34
cool! nice! 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:42:28
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:38:29
But do you think this is a good idea? Somehow a voting from users? I mean with the current discussion about bitcoin unlimited etc... If I would like to vote against miners which support it, which other possibilities do I have? except posting in forums..
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:12:28
Im just linking this thread:

I post a lot and I also never experienced any censorship. Downvotes yeah, but nothing more. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:35:42
Anybody knows why they dont release small versions more often? i think this would reduce the possibility of putting wrong code online, since its easier to track if something wrong happens? (like wrong fork of blockchain,...)
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:39:07
why only 121 btc? why not 210 ?

Haha great!
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:26:51
I read the artice, I just don't understand what the author of this article want to say? small prime numbers are a problem of all encrypting/hash functions? (maybe I don't get it, because my motherlanguage is not english).
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:27:34
tx id?
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:44:51
I don't think so.. I was optimistic before the GBTC start.. And was disappointed afterwards.. I think it will be the same like GBTC... Nothing will change... 
But I would prefer to be bullish, if I could choose :D
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:45:06
It just shows that they are not against it. If I would deny segwit, I wouldn't use a wallet which supports segwit.. no?
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:36:22
As far as I know is segwit downward compatible, so it's not a hard fork. SegWit transactions would just be mined by segwit supporting miners. For old nodes, these transactions would still look valid.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:45:34
Leave it more time to promote this idea! Maybe in 1-2 Weeks? And announce a final date so it can distribute?
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:24:08
If nodes only send segwit transactions, there would be no profit for non-segwite miners - maybe this could help to feed adoption?
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:44:11
pump and dump... also it's much easier to influence the price of alt coins in comparison to bitcoin... so 1 mio USD in alts shows significant price changes, in bitcoin land not much will happen...
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:44:08
But the nodes are already showing by more than 50% that they would support SegWit. I also think that the BU nodes will decrease in quite a short term, like Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT... It also costs money to fake so many nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:00:52
Sure, but keeping a lot of fake nodes online is expensive. Short durations cost less than long durations.. I think this is also the reason why classic/xt nodes dropped significant after a period of time - they just turned off because it costs a lot of money. So if you look at the chart, it means that longer durations are (probably) more trustful. But yeah, I know what you mean - measuring signaling is always not really objectiv or unmanipulated.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:23:50
That sounds not economical logic... More bandwidth = more costs - so why should the user count increase? makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:23:31


There are already more than 50% of nodes which support segwit. If we would activate it now, we could do it already (maybe not very stable with around 50%, but it would work atm).
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:08:28
My post was about if we acivate segwit handling now for the nodes. Majority of the miners is not needed for network constraints (like if a block is valid or not) - the (majority of the) nodes decide this (which are currently supporting segwit)!
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:05:17
no huobi is back online again.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:32:06
I don't know if you read my original post carefully. If we activated segwit for the clients NOW (and keeping the node count pro segwit the same like now) - the transactions couldn't be spend by anyone.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:01:39
nice site :)
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:37:03
they would be valid - but if they choose to not accept them (due to political reasons), they would loose the fees of the denied transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:30:44
Thanks! Good guys, good guys :D

yeah I think a lot of people would not complain then. For coffee transactions we will wait for lightning?
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:30:08
No, just use the default fee in mycelium... No thing to worry about. There are just a lot of users which mess up their settings (or just try to send transactions with zero fees) and then they complain. I send several transactions within the last weeks and they all were confirmed fine within 15 minutes with the default fee. no need to calcuate it by your own.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:52:52
TLDR? What is this thread about? I dont get it?
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:51:38
Please notice that there are many paid posters and socket puppet accounts, which post only postive things about BU and discredit bitcoin core... 
See: 
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:15:39
i know :D
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:55:00
haha nice one :D
@_date: 2017-02-25 17:02:45
this is only true if the majority of the nodes is denying segwit transactions, which is not the case anymore - we have more than 50% of the nodes which accept segwit. So your argument is not valid at the moment.
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:45:42
Or just pump and dump
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:05:19
Maybe you should create a company named something like Neo &amp; Bee :P Just kidding.. Good motivation!
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:45:12
Yeah I also just saw it... Gist is here: 
Looks great!
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:49:25
Sorry, but this is false. Please inform yourself about what you say. Segwit nodes are already deployed on around 48 % of the network, so its quite clear that the community wants segwit ( It's just the miners which are lagging behind, but as you can see on the bitcoin.org page there is still a lot of work in progress: 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:46:27
i think we can do this soon with the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:10:07
Yeah, what has this to do with the discussion?
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:58:17
and what about storage? maintainance costs? maintainance time? why do you leave this factors out? what about bigger orphaned chains? what about harder ddos prevention? what about bad code quality and poor review? the last unintended Bitcoin Unlimited fork is just some days ago, as far as I remember?
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:38:59
yeah this makes no sense...
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:48:56
And is the news already released?
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:23:47
Ahhhh: 250000.00 ask price ^^ To the moooon :D
Edit: ask price, not bid, sorry..
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:34:10
ah ok... but would be cool to see this functionality in the wallet apps implemented or?
@_date: 2017-02-11 09:54:20
amazon name!
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:46:51
i repeat: it doesnt matter what miners do. the nodes are the ones  which decide which chain is the valid one - the other chains are worthless. so even if 100% of the miners mine on chain A - if not more than 50% of all nodes accept chain A, A is invalid and worthless.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:10:24
haha damn... fixed it :D

@_date: 2015-05-07 21:25:01
Why shouldnt you be able to store an existing private key? didnt read it in the announcement?
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:24:55
I'm fine with that... The thing is that it would be 27 cents independent from the whole amount - it doesn't matter if I send 10 USD, 100 USD or 100000 USD... Block space is limited and I can understand that I have to pay a bit to use this great network and I can be my own bank.
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:18:59
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:44:43
Better sell your coins! From your point of view, price should crash really soon?
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:13:54
This is only the true if less than 50% of the bitcoin nodes don't accept segwit. But this is not the case, there is already more than 50% FOR segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:28:21
Yeah... But it costs a lot, money and time :/ And in general it's really rediculous that some miners can prevent developments which are supported by the majority of the community.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:22:35
yeah, sounds cool. now we need someone who does all the work and project management to keep it going... anybody interested? :D 
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:40:50
Then go to your bank. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:01:12
There are solutions which will come like lightning network which will enable this.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:27:16
Would maybe be a good idea... I would probably support such a step.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:38:19
Ohh, thx :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 08:16:03
I see, thanks!

thanks... waiting for flag day :D
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:47:44
sell them before at lower price, since everybody is scared.. and buy them back later for a higher price because bitcoin showed no problems during the migration :)
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:49:11
TLDR? thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:58:34
What means this post? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:50:20


Is this really the way you want to continue our discussion?
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:28:43
Yeah, you are right.. who needs full nodes? It would make bitcoin much more user friendly if everyone uses only SPV wallets... I think the miners could take over to host the nodes.. or? /s
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:13:17
really? damn, missed it.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:35:42
Yeah, I also have someone, which rejected my thoughts about onecoin being scam "because a lot of people say this about bitcoin too"... some people are not teachable...
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:47:20
I think this post is missing that security is not dependent on a specific programming language. You can create secure services with nearly all programming languages (which are build for things like this).. It's more a matter of skills how to use this programming languages, so I'm definitely not agreeing with your post.
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:53:22
Damn, looks like hard fork... 
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:50:41
How did you generate this transaction? 
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:37:46
Interestingly it shows that after the blue 20% area, the correlation is negative? not positive like before? strange? 
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:20:56
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:05:48
ahm. yeah. sure. go ahead if it works for you.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:33:06
well said. lets get these agitators to understand that the users/nodes are the ones which create the rules.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:49:50
Yeah, I know - you/we are right, or did I post something different? You can check my history to see that I also posted this argument already several times..

You just have to look how suggestive and manipulating all these BU posts are - and during which timeframes. usually they come in waves.. weeks and nothing happens, and then suddenly 100 posts about BU and deep downvoting of counter comments.

its not illogical. look at the growth of bitcoin core nodes (looks like organic) and the rise and crash of bitcoin classic/xt/unlimited - it clearly shows that a lot of the classic/xt/unlimited nodes are fake. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:40:06
paging - can you maybe bring "official" light into this? :)
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:23:41
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:07:14


I think one of the points why miners are against segwit is, because the fees would drop (and therefore get less income) =&gt; and with this less power. But this doesn't mean that segwit is a great development which will improve bitcoin and it's scalability (and a lot of other things, which will be enabled by segwit, like lightning, MIST,..)
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:08:07
Hm true... But if I could choose a negative list (which excludes only specific miners from my "available list"), it shouldn't be a problem or?
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:48:53
thats not valid for bitcoin. the nodes - and only the nodes - decide which chain is valid. even if 100% of the miners mine on chain A - if more than 50% of the nodes say A is invalid -&gt; A is invalid (even with 100% hashing power)! Nodes are enforcing the global network constraint - not the miners.
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:59:02
It makes no economical sense that miners continue working on an invalid chain. If all miners would stay on A, there would be at least one miner who mines on B - and get ALL bock rewards and fees. A is worthless. So all miners would choose to go wherever the node majority is for.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:01:22

you are right.. transisto, see this for example:

Not many details... First paragraph is only about bitcoin in general, then about big volatility and consumer protectors say its unregulated... But still cool to see it opens!

i think this is just a hype.. i cannot imagine that the ETF will be approved.. too risky and no avantage for the SEC.

Naaa.. i think you are a bit too pessimistic here.. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:49:09
Yeah good idea, let's move all these BU there... 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:22:06
No, if nodes only send segwit transactions, there would be no profit for non-segwite miners (updated my post).

I'm not sure about this... See also my updated post.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:37:35
Please reread my post. I'm not writing about altruism, but about economical pressure for miners to start accepting segwit transactions.

@_date: 2017-02-05 17:42:42
But if every exchange operator offers an API where you can post your transactions (lika ViaBTC), you could choose your preferred miner? I mean, we just should talk to the mining pool operator to offer an API like this, or do I get something wrong?

did I mention a hash?
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:48:53
Sorry, but I don't think you know how this works. If the majority of the nodes reject blocks, the block becomes invalid and the bitcoin reward worthless. Nodes enforce the network constraints - not the miners!

Its also sad that a lot of people think that innovation is just coming because someone is just motivated. Satoshilabs spend a lot of money for development/testing/research and I can understand that they want to earn their spent money back. Just copying work from other people KILLS innovation (sometimes!, in this small market at the moment its true) ... Would you ever create something like trezor, spend a lot of money, to know that you just pay for it and never get your money back? I don't think that you would start...
@_date: 2015-01-29 08:46:02
I can't understand why everybody is complaining...?
These guys put a lot of effort into developing the firmware and hardware and helped really to develop a secure bitcoin environment.
I can't see the problem with the licence change (maybe except the way they changed the licence): YOU STILL CAN DOWNLOAD AND CHANGE IT FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE (NON-COMMERICAL USE != PERSONAL USE!)!
YOU ARE JUST NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE PROFIT OUT OF IT!?!

But I think your Bitcoins are not the biggest problem then :D
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:59:14
as far as I understood it, the sender has to send 10 bits to each receiver.. So if I want to send to x-thousand users, I would have to send 10 bits to each of my x-thousand receivers? each time? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:56:10
it doesnt matter if the mempool is full.. the most transactions have a smaller than the default fee, so normal transactions are included without problems in the block.. just the dust/spam transactions have to wait longer..

absolutely, thats what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:39:14
sorry, but bs. all this stuff is so infantile and trolling, that I'm quite happy that the mods keep care of this community.

First of all I would like to thank your for your great work and effort for the bitcoin community.
Also for this research I would like to say: "Thank you!". It also matched my expectations (see
It's really embarrassing to see that someone just copies your hard work and even EMBEDS MALICOUS CODE into this firmware..
Totally unacceptable! And I'm really willing to pay for your product (instead of the cheap one), just becaue I want to honour your hard work and effort!
For me, the price is ok! Thanks a lot!

Why is trezor missing?

I think you miss the difference between free software and open source...
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:14:55
are the nodes really able to handle segwit right now? or are they activating segwit handling after miners started signaling more than 95 percent?
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:02:24
yeah, but get rid of the malicous code they put inside...

One minute is quite important in the vertical industry :P
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:32:49
It's way round: the minority chain (non segwit) is invalid, therefore all mined blocks there would be worthless. There is no incentive to continue mining on the (by the nodes) not accepted chain - because their block reward would be worthless.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:34:16


Nobody knows, but as it seems the next steps will be to get segwit activated (hopefully) and then IBLTs and weak blocks, maybe with lightning (which will be really cool)... But yeah, it's open source software so anybody can work on it.. And since core is focusing on stable and well tested software, it can take longer than expected. 


I doubt that anything will change, there are already features / variants of coins which get tested on other blockchains. Thats nothing new.
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:20:07
So? No response? I would also be interested..!
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:34:23
yeah these manipulating and suggestive BU posts really sucks.
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:28:19
The blocksize was just to small. But I think with unlimited hodls it still won't work. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:15:33
We should really try to get an official statement from the reddit mods that this ban was unjustified and look for the one who is responsible..
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:15:39
Sorry, never heard of Raiden Network. 


Not true, googling some seconds shows this: 
The big plus with bitcoin core is, that its really well testet and peer reviewed. If you look at other coins (or bitcoin unlimited), it shows that there are only a few people working on it, which can lead to deployments with poor code quality and financial risks/fails.. Bitcoin unlimited hat an unintended hardfork just some days ago.. 
So I stay with core, because they have the most developers and best peer reviewed developments - and these things take time... 
You simply cannot have both: better reviews and stable code (but slower) or fast deployment time (but bad code quality and testing.

No, I don't think so..

You know that more than 50% of the bitcoin nodes support segwit already? Compare the amount of miners and the amount of nodes and then tell me again who the dictator is.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:47:08
How? I don't think you understood the proposal completely.
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:51:40
Better call coinbase instead of asking here? 
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:46:11
Why thursday? Shouldn't it be then tuesday  (=chinese monday, if monday here is chinese sunday)?

@_date: 2016-01-04 07:32:14
I would say that it's more safe to just download the blockchain and transfer your bitcoin afterwards with a normal transaction. A lot of people do small mistakes at the beginning which result in btc loss... Better stay safe at the beginning :)
@_date: 2016-03-15 07:45:53
Since there are still big security vulnerabilities in docker, I wouldn't recommend it for something like a value store... Better use a dedicated server or another completely seperated virtualized server (but this is maybe also already somehow insecure, if there are security flaws in the managing supervisor)...
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:48:52
Here is someone who wrote an articel about exactly this - activateable via soft fork: **MR POWA**
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:40:57
then better post the link where gavin discusses these issues..
@_date: 2016-03-11 15:26:38
....pfff catastrophic failure.. sounds like fud..
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:18:45
I trust the core team, with their (maybe slow) scalability plan.. I think the whole panic here is overhyped.. So from my point of view, it should be SW + hardfork afterwards.. Not at the same time... The discussion is quite too overheated, so I believe the core devs, which did a great job..
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:58:09
What do you say about /14? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:41:59
I really missed you :D
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:52:33
oh god this is hilarious :D thanks for mentioning...
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:39:38
Thank you! Hard work :/
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:31:50
Yeah but this is quite hard and costs a lot of time and money. what happens when we activate segwit transactions NOW for wallets?
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:51:09
bitcoin core can already handle segwit. there are just no segwit transactions happening at the moment (also because of the anyone can spend attack, which could occure when not enough nodes support segwit - which is not the case at the moment because we have a bit more than 50% of nodes pro segwit)
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:37:01
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:15:04
And which 4 flaws?
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:51:42
tell us when you finished!
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:37:39
uh nice... I also have an old monitor.. can I download more resolution somewhere? :D
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:32:06
YOU SHOULD REALLY STORE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS SOFTWARE! (NOT)
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:50:34
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:12:51
or this (read until /28!) 
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:50:48
So then, stop complaining and use whichever blockchain fits your needs? I don't understand why you complain?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:34:31
yeah, I think the same..
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:53:30
Are there any updates? Do you know already when it will be released?
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:41:12
I don't think you completely understand how Bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:24:06
Then I will leave it, I think it's important to spread this information. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:06:36
maybe you should try to tweak the dbcache value? how much are you using at the moment?
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:41:37
damn, posted the same :D
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:06:30
So they also only want to hear votes about things they like.. no others...


@_date: 2017-02-25 20:04:15


It just depends on the majority of the nodes, if blocks &amp; transactions are marked as valid.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:04:12
Maybe also set the dbcache setting in the settings (or bitcoind.conf) higher.. I think the default 100MB is really low.
@_date: 2016-03-18 19:14:18
You are right, drugs exist only in america. just saying..
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:25:12
thx, updated it
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:50:02
exchanges would list BU as an altcoin...
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:44:09
Ah ok... I thought you mean "trezors ARE shit".. Sorry, english is not my mother language...
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:00:54
Yaay I'm marked as "getting benefit"  :D But I don't have a bot.. I'm honest :P :D
Edit: Damn, I was just upvoted once.. the other time i got downvoted, says the list... So, proof that I don't have a bot :P
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:00:12
This scares the shit out of me (read until /28!) 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:51:13
hm i see... 
but I still think that viabtc is realizing that there wont be a solution without segwit.. and they are getting forked out sooner or later by the community if they dont change their mind.. we will see..
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:26:48
if we get a hardfork from bitcoin unlimited, more bitcoin nodes would decline to accept bigger blocks.. no?
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:45:04
this filing has nothing to do with the bitcoin etf... this is filing SR-BatsBZX-2016-80, we are looking for SR-BatsBZX-2016-
*30*. just because bats is in the name, it doesnt mean anything.. bats is just the exchange... these filings are not related, stop spreading nonsense - this was already cleared yesterday several times.
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:32:40
I just recommended what most people suggest you: wait and finish downloading of the whole blockchain (which may take a long time). Afterwards, when you are in sync, you should see your bitcoins without problems. And after this, you should transfer them to your new electrum wallet with a normal bitcoin transaction.
So just wait, and after full sync, continue with your transfer.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:16:43
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:09:59
yeah, thought also like this :D
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:53:18
sad story...
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:06:13
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:48:51
would be nice to get paid :D but no.. unfortunately I'm a private person and I do this in my free time...
But why do you think? Running out of arguments?
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:09:15
I deleted it... 
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:18:50
there were much bigger problems in history than now... bitcoin unlimited will evaporate, not because core is so superior.. but because BU's development is lacking technical skill (and its even lagging behind already!) and (not faked) community. this "omg all people move to altcoins" is just pump and dump... 
sure atm it doesnt look like sunshine, but I'm carefree that bitcoin will evolve much stronger and more robust than now. Solutions are already here, just the way there has to develop. 
and another thought: the problems which bitcoin has, is that it is demanded TOO MUCH.. how can this be bad? :D It's like you have a shop with too many customers... Really bad, hm? :D
A lot of altcoins also don't have these scaling issues, just because no one uses them... I'm sure other cryptocurrencies don't perform better with the same load (and with the same level of security which bitcoin has) and will get the same scaling problems like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:01:43

Do you really have the latest version? It is 0.14? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:00:21
:D we will see..
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:54:36
great! Welcome on board! :D
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:13:42
lets see how many renowed bitcoin developers are on BU side: 0... also: nope!
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:20:38
the whole thing is not about blocksize.. It's about the monopolizing the mining environment... If Jihan has the absolute monopole, he can also dictate the sell price of Bitcoin... Which can make his fees enormous! Think about that.. I read about it today and it clears up why this situation is like this.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:04:35

bahh.. I'm really happy that most of these morons stay in @_date: 2017-03-17 08:19:11


That doesnt include non listening nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:57:23
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:47:48
What has been changed? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:51:02
thats not true... the valid chain is not chosen by the amount of hashrate, but by the nodes which enforce the consensus rules!
And sure miners can attack bitcoin, let me copy this here: 






(maybe there is even a zero day exploit in core nodes, which will be triggered just on the fork start.. who knows...
or maybe they are firing up 10.000 fake nodes.. (i dont think this would give much power in reality, but make a bad PR for core chain, like "you can see that there are much more BU nodes than on core" - dumb media / news will take that and publish it without deeper investigation))
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:43:37
bitcoin is trustless ;)
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:34:37
and? 0.14 is segwit? Not?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:39:43
tell jihan please.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:33:02
i think its at least an interesting proposal and I'm happy that someone is developing - or at least thinking about further solutions to the current situation.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:11:05
i think everybody would be happy if we continue faster.. but some things need time... longer than you or me like :/
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:25:22
ouch :D
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:45:21
on what facts do you base your argument? i cannot see any.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:25:04
For completeness, here is the mentioned mail:

lol you are right, thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:14:49
Sorry, but your argument sounds not very reasonable. A user who is a beginner, who doesn't know that his wallet supports segwit - has enough technical knowledge to decline segwit (but still uses it)?  lol.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:53:47
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:02:10
there was once an interview, where they asked a BU developer, if he would work with Core, if core would do EVERYTHING the same as BU. He said no.. There are just politics and emotions, no technical basis for BU.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:38:08
yeah, you are right.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:58:58
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:49:17
Yup, also came to my mind... No compromise needed, Segwit is a great solution and blocksize increase already. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:04:24
Yeah, looks like they start testing! 
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:46:16

@_date: 2017-03-13 08:28:27
I think you should inform yourself again about uasf.. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:39:29
there is no technical reason to compromise, we already have a solution. everything different is just bullshit, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:36:37

No: You can submit changes there - if the communit likes it, your things get merged. If community is against your changes, you can still copy the source code, compile it yourself and apply your changes and distribute them (like bitcoin unlimited does).
I will also copy this here:

You can, but nobody would agree to your transactions and you would get banned by the connected nodes.

@_date: 2017-03-22 10:58:30
Maintainers are responsibe for merging the changes.. This is the same for all open source projects, also for big projects like Debian,... this does not mean that they have power.

I also asked them on 15th March what they would do in case of an HF.. Also sent another mail some days later... No response.

but thats not how jihan wu is behaving... he is already preparing for a hard fork.. check out his twitter posts... with this behavious, the only intent can be to harm the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:00:33
I also find it somehow confusing which type of "ready"/"yes" answer about the support of SegWit/BU is the "more supportive" one. I've also talked to people in slack and it's really not clear, if you should choose "ready" or "yes" if you are strong in favour of supporting segwit f.e.? Could you maybe also make this more clear? It's really confusing.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:15:09
The pull request has been merged now! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:14:03
Then how would it make sense, that a against-segwit-miner is supporting a po-segwit client? doesnt work out...

this is just source code, you can compare the changes here:

@_date: 2017-03-19 20:38:54
I think all core devs are against a preemptive HF... Just in case everything fucks up - and as one of the last counter measures - a HF will be taken into consideration.. This means not that you shouldn't be prepared and test it, just to get sure.

Cool, nice one! Will take a look at it!
@_date: 2015-05-02 09:28:32
Haha great, I nearly had to cry when I watched this trailer, so dramatic :)
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:01:48
I didn't state that, or?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:22:47
but they cannot implement it, because they have too few good coders.. their backlog at the moment is already scaring.. we have bitcoin 14 out already, they are still at version 12!
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:21:26
Thanks! :D Shall I delete this post?

@_date: 2017-03-19 20:48:58
ähm no, they have different consensus rules and cannot be mined at the same time - they are just invalid to the old nodes. and good luck with your environment if you end up with 1 single mining pool.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:48:52
What about the people which lost money due to the price crash of ethereum? What about the people which were not in agreement with the rollback?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:22:05
Lets UASF them off the network.. bitcoin nodes unite!!!
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:21:31
as you said: the whole thing is not about blocksize.. It's about the monopolizing the mining environment... If Jihan has the absolute monopole, he can also dictate the sell price of Bitcoin... Which can make his earnings with fees enormous! Think about that.. I read about it today and it clears up why this situation is like this.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:50:37
Dear mods, **COULD YOU MAYBE MAKE IT STICKY?**  :) 
Would be nice, I think it's important to get more people into reviewing the BIP :)
Edit: Maybe also add the url: 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:01:33
There is no technical reason for your argument 
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:37:26
It would be great if could offer a repo by himself, so we have a somehow "official" source? 
@_date: 2016-01-27 07:50:57
I cannot endorse your statement. I have multiple servers on azure and digital ocean.. And azures availability, latency is really bad in comparison to digital ocean.. And it even costs about 300% more.
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:09:14
I don't want to be rude, but...


@_date: 2017-03-18 11:28:55

I think you don't really understand UASF, maybe you should read it again.

Not if Jihan then could change my post title :D

Thanks, but there are no service/autostart calls included? Also pruning is not activated, so it won't work for me on a small 5 usd box?
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:02:57
Haha best comment here. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 13:08:12
Hmm... We didnt made it.. :(
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:39:41
But what do you do if the valid minor chain gets attacked? Let me copy this: 






(maybe there is even a zero day exploit in core nodes, which will be triggered just on the fork start.. who knows...
or maybe they are firing up 10.000 fake nodes.. (i dont think this would give much power in reality, but make a bad PR for core chain, like "you can see that there are much more BU nodes than on core" - dumb media / news will take that and publish it without deeper investigation))
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:47:10
Great, welcome! :)
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:49:11
Hm sounds interesting.. But I doubt that miners would agree to this - i mean, same thing with segwit... at the moment it looks really cumbersome..
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:41:46
I had to turn off my cloud node, because it was running out of disk space.. maintainance costs are higher, no doubt.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:00:43
hashrate doesnt make it secure, its the nodes which make it secure. miners only order the transactions, the nodes enforce the network constraint and decide which blocks &amp; transactions are valid - and which are not.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:26:01
damn this is scary....
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:30:19
How can I embed an image here?
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:35:11
Maybe check out this really nice bitcoin guide: 
My node on digital ocean (no wallet, pruning) costs 5 USD per month, bandwidth is (nearly) unlimited.. Maintainance maybe 30 min / month.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:15:44
my thought is, that we will maybe get segwit activated with it. i really dont think they can get off a successfull hardfork after segwit.. i only care about SG, the rest is just fantasy imho.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:43:57
YES! CAPSLOCK ARE ALWAYS GREAT!!!!!/!"§!"§!"!
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:31:52
happened to me before.. compiled the master branch and was wondering why my node didn't signal UASF ^ ^
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:36:10
Not really source, but here is an article: 


Edit: Here is a post of Wang Chun: 


@_date: 2017-03-18 20:58:25
I'm not sure.. what if they only want to destroy bitcoin, by ruining its usefullness due to reorders in transactions? and short bitcoin for pumping altcoins? what is, if they dont intend to create an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:19:08
thats not true. 5 more nodes which help other nodes to validate.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:19:25
can someone explain me if this new POWA approach will make current miner hardware useless after activation?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:16:20
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:02:56
this is BIP 148 more or less (50% of the nodes).
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:56:29
but what is your solution, if we have miner with more than 70% hashrate, which attacks the core chain?
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:04:44
i also dont know... a lot of these things doesnt add up somehow...
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:55:17
but what is your solution, if we have miner with more than 70% hashrate, which attacks the core chain? I dont get it?
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:39:35
What is so special here?

where is the difference between your mentioned ways of coping with it?
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:57:19
yeah, should be taken into consideration...!
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:14:28
Yeah.. Waiting for other comments.. Would really like to get things running...!
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:08:19

yop.. :D
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:10:20
No. It works also without, but with limitations (like fixed timeouts)
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:08:29
... jop... :) I also don't get it...
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:25:53
You are right, seems like a fix has to be applied... Will talk to someone who will fix it, probably shaolinfry himself..

unfortuately it looks like ETH was just pumped and dumped.. crashed today around 40% down...
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:22:57
unfortunately this list is quite outdated.. we submitted more than 40 items there some days ago.. still not changed.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:57:48
fair point...
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:55:32
yeah, but maybe we can get segwit activated with it :)
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:40:27
segwit changes/increases the ad hoc limit.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:27:29
Yeah, lets scale Bitcoin to a bigger level!
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:21:01
So, go ahead, fork it and make some good commits! Where is the problem?

buy when its low, sell when its high.. not the other way round :)
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:26:24
lol.. :D but at least you are part of chart history now :)
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:20:08
Segwit is a real blocksize increase to 2mb. With new data structure we can get even 4mb blocks soon! 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:15:35
The pull request has been merged now btw 
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:56:01
haha nice writeup :D
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:06:49
if we make a long enough activation time, could we prevent that miners suffer from this Pow chain - because they have more time to adopt? I know some (segwit/core) miners, which are scared because they invested quite much money in it - I really wouldn't like to hurt them ( and their fine behaviour).
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:03:06
If these maintainers would do something, which the community would not accept, the community would immediatly switch to another maintainer / fork (copy of this repository). Merges are only done, when community agreed with it (see here one (random) issue for example:  
So basically yes, the maintainer could decide which merges go in - but he would be replaced immediatley if these changes are not in line with the community.
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:06:05
Yeah, this came also to my mind... We just need a rich person (or twins :D) which want to do something like this :D
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:47:16
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:11:13
it looks like after all these years you don't understand at all, how bitcoin development and it's development environment works?
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:40:36
we were also not so mainstream like nowadays ;)
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:44:27
yeah, i think the same.. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:43:35
pffff... BU is a political campaign... they are not developers.. just scam, more not.

As we learned from Mt. Gox, coffee is the most important thing! :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:33:23
me too.. great :D
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:44:10
thats not true... the valid chain is not chosen by the amount of hashrate, but by the nodes which enforce the consensus rules!
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:21:06
Did you do some research? With segwit + 2MB HF we will have blocks with 8MB at the end? 8MB will lead to 420 GB / year. Rich countries can afford that, poorer countries for sure not. Do you really want the nodes go down? If we would have 8MB since the beginning, the current blockchain (107GB) would now be at least 700GB?! 
Also I was talking about the development environment of bitcoin core - not about a HF at the moment?!
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:39:15
I'm really happy that you take the downvotes on you, your comments are really gorgeous :D upvote! 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:35:50
yeah... but if nodes dont follow (and stay on old consensus) your chain will be worthless... its like you buy drinks and invite 3000 people to your party - and no one comes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:30:40
Maybe not every drop, but I'm sure we will recover sooner or later.. Holding and buying! 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:14:27
absolutely :D uncut :D
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:28:47
lol.. next fuckup...
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:25:53
with bitcoin testnet you could also do this since 2007... how is this news? lol
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:34:33
Ahhh: 
its really about punishing miners if they attack the chain.. but not remove them completely


Damn.. this is great! And powerfull! LOL :D Bitcoin is such a great technology and this community.. wow :D I'm astonished quite often.

Was there some days ago about a lecture for bitcoin taxation.. didnt get in because there were so many people, that they couldnt let anyone more inside..
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:58:24
I will just copy paste an answer of me from slack, hope its ok for you. With an attack I mean something like this: 




 &gt; but no one knows.. at the moment it looks like most nodes &amp; exchanges/wallets will stay on core.. but yeah, as I said.. no one knows how dirty it can get really
(maybe there is even a zero day exploit in core nodes, which will be triggered just on the fork start.. who knows...


@_date: 2017-03-09 20:47:07
you should really be ashamed.. your thinking is really disgusting... 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:00:30
why is this big news? dont understand..
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:18:43
yeah.. also waiting for a well tested version of this :D
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:19:38
Here you can read here how the process is working: 
But in general: You can just click in the (bitcoin repository)[ on "fork" (which copies the code to your account) - and you can start immediatly to change things there - and build your own bitcoin client! 
That's the way this version system (GIT) works - there is no central server - all copies can be merged to other copies (it's like all repositories are code-servers :))
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:54:58
Yeah, viaBtc hat an outage (and antpool too - oh such a coincident!): 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:16:31
So why is he against a segwit activation?...
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:25:52
Cool!!! Please post on bitcoin dev mailing list! 
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:10:43
you can always settle the transaction if you want on the main chain?
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:46:04
i think you are missunderstanding how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:18:57
Will cite this :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:48:29
You know that bitcoin unlimited is blocking? core has solutions and community is just waiting for the donkey miners to start segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:08:06
look at other submitted posts
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:46:03
I think its not related to the operating system.. You just have to look in the bitcoin app preferences in the menu?
Anyways, synchronization with core can take a day at the beginning.. but 10 days look a bit long.. bad internet connection maybe? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:34:23

@_date: 2017-03-17 19:49:54
if they are running a core client, they are signaling segwit? or did I get something wrong?

@_date: 2017-03-13 07:41:56
but when I run a pro segwit/UASF node and flag day comes, and majority is still against segwit... Is there not the problem about this anyone can spend thing?
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:10:40
Wow nice!! Let me think this through... 
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:55:48
Already prepared.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:13:13










@_date: 2017-03-12 23:45:34
thanks for pointing this out. maybe this should be made more public, that the risk is on the UASF side... So everybody can choose what he wants..
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:39:09
BU was never about the blocksize, nor throughput of transactions (can be enabled with segwit and lightning easily). The whole point was to keep the miner fees high - and for this segwit has to be denied, because it enables lightning network, which would reduce miner fees drastically (at least this is what some miners believe at the moment and is maybe not the case in reality).

@_date: 2017-03-07 21:15:39
they are too stupid to do this.. they are not even able to copy code.. so they are still stuck on bitcoin core version 12, and we have already 14!

nothing new... paid shills everywhere..
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:26:39
No, this was just published by someone (not shaolinfry). So it would be good if we can get a "official" repo.. Your mentioned repo contains the bug which is mentioned in the title.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:11:59
lol.. :O
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:24:37
sorry, wrong. consensus is enforced by nodes and the economical majority - not by the miners. even if 100% of the miners mine a specific chain -&gt; if its not valid to the majority of the nodes, these blocks will get denied and will be worthless - regardless of the hashpower.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:16:09
ahahahahahaha lol... i dont know how you can be so misinformed... 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:48:20

get a trezor...
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:46:01
this is another question, you started about consensus. Yeah, there will be problems for sure.. 1 block in 70 minutes... will lead to really big fees (big income for the minority miner otherwise =&gt; more incentive for other miners to join). but only if nodes stay on the minor chain... but at the moment it looks like this (not like ehterium where bigger part of community was pro fork).
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:03:04
as mentioned in your article, this works only until the first difficulty adjustment - 2016 blocks / 2 weeks.

nono, the CEO of bitcoin hanged himself! Bitcoin is dead!
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:18:19
yeah, but I think after 6 months it will get heavier to activate it, since BIP 9 activation is only until november.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:31:00
I think the current unofficial  uasf github repo owner will fix it when he reads the comments.. But yeah, good that this code is getting reviewed now!

It's bitcoin core 0.14 (current version) + small patch for emergent consensus :)
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:11:08
thanks a lot for your great work!
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:37:33
I heard they mined segwit accidentially somehow, but not sure if this is true.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:52:29
hard work :D
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:47:49
i dont think this proposal is about launching segwit now? I don't think that hardforks are good.. But maybe better than BU hardforking by itself..
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:35:22
yeah :D
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:53:42
Yeah I know, I'm also pro core &amp; segwit. Then lets call it the minor, but valid chain.
You know what the valid minor chain can get attacked? I will post following from slack (this is the reason why I'm concerned about the bitcoin blockchain... really!):






(maybe there is even a zero day exploit in core nodes, which will be triggered just on the fork start.. who knows...
or maybe they are firing up 10.000 fake nodes.. (i dont think this would give much power in reality, but make a bad PR for core chain, like "you can see that there are much more BU nodes than on core" - dumb media / news will take that and publish it without deeper investigation))
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:30:07
damn.. this is really a great idea.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:01:50
I think this is just because Bitfury started to mine spam transactions.. So it seems that it became too expensive to spam the network maybe..
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:59:45
yeah, there are a lot of companies which support open source project, redhat, suse, even microsoft is supporting open source projects, even with fulltime employees. but none of them (also not blockstream) can force users to run software which they dont like. everyone can participate, just clone the git repository, make some good changes, let it peer review and maybe let it merge if community is ok with it. 
"Blockstream" is neither an argument nor the reality how bitcoin is developed.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:04:39
True! Also waiting for more confirmations... But at least you can see that there are not many changes.. But you are right, we should wait for further reviews!
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:43:44
you dont have to open a paymentchannel by your self? with lightning network transactions would be much cheaper than now?
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:26:14
We just have to make sure, that the economical majority supports segwit (exchanges, wallet providers, other services,...), by asking them to annouce their stand in public.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:04:50
Looks like they started with testing! 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:37:55
Maybe :D Would be a bit expensive tough..

it is clear that the whole paragraph is in the context of same consensus rules, not different rules or altcoins.

Yes, I already wrote that he wrote that he didn't wrote down the seed...
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:44:06
you mean they disable segwit support in 0.14? im not sure if this is possible?
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:35:27
he calls him already as the bitcoin jesus.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:26:45
Core can only change code, not users choice which software they actually run
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:55:57
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:39:18
if enough nodes switch, miners will be on a chain without users -&gt; No users -&gt; no value. It's like inviting 3000 people to a party - and no one comes :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:50:00
yeah.. i think all sane people would prefer a human solution...
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:37:37
ok... I will do the math for you: 32.836 / 51.879 USD = ~0.633 % (current base of the price before), which is a loss of about ~36,7 %.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:33:43

@_date: 2017-03-09 08:59:18
Lol :) 
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:27:09
Yeah, would be great!
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:55:11
You are right.. A PoW change is not desired by most of the core supporters. Things are getting only prepared for the worst situation, literally nobody wants a hard fork - except Jihan. I also think that the BU chain wouldn't survive long! But better to be prepared, than to be desperate and not prepared... :/ And you know, if BU is attacking the minor chain (so maybe your chain) - and you cannot mine blocks or get fees - your mining equipment also doesnt produce any profit.. :/ So it's good to have some mechanisms to influcence the current situation - even if we don't change PoW at the end. I'm really happy that there are miners which act sane...! Thanks for your support - lets defend bitcoin together! :)

segwit is a softfork and already deployed = current consenus
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:18:43
thanks! and damn, that its at least 550 MB.. so not possible for me..
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:40:31
i said around 40%, it was just a quick caluclation without calculator before. 
But yeah, if you feel better with -36,7 % than -40%, take it :)
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:59:10
there are also a lot of technical problems with BU, so i think it's fine to address these issues.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:54:24
but what is your solution, if we have miner with more than 70% hashrate, which attacks the core chain?
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:22:33

@_date: 2017-03-12 20:56:02
after some time (=after a specific amount of blocks), segwit is just activated without further processes. non-segwit transactions / blocks will be denied. i hope we can get segwit running with this... more than 70% of the nodes support segwit already, just the miners lag behind. this idea is giving the votes to the nodes and economic majority (wallet providers, exchanges, services,...), not the centralized miners.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:57:05
Sorry, but are you trolling? Just take a look at the site which I posted:

trial and error... you just have to try often enough to find out.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:49:14
if users are not following hashrate, users WILL decide what happens..

hihihihihi :D
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:11:57
lol... socket puppets on its work... yeah.. downvote me. ( i mean the postings favouring BU).
@_date: 2016-03-15 10:12:43
Just some days ago i looked at a (german) presentation here:  
Also on the last black hat conference there was a presentation about security flaws in docker:  
There are also discussions about "what security means", f.e. this bug - which is maybe a security threat, but was dismissed as "beeing a feature": 
IMHO Docker is a relative new product and even if some companies say that is stable and useable in production (and maybe even works fine in general), I wouldn't trust it that much to keep a bigger amount of bitcoins in it. Trust has to build over time, and for this - docker is just too young..

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:16:44
but segwit doubles already the network capacity... lightning is also already running on testnet... and as I mentioned, I don't think that its about transaction capacity at all.. it's about miners, which are afraid that they lose parts of their transaction fees because of lightning and are therefore blocking segwit (lightning can only play out well with segwit enabled). Jihan mentioned the loss of fees today in his post - and I can agree with him.. I would also be angry when I lose money... Maybe we have to find a better way to compensate miners in change for accepting segwit / lightning.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:35:05
true... maybe they learned from it... :/
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:07:00
Great guys! Lets keep together and defend bitcoin against these attack! We are acting the the same way - it's important that also exchanges, wallets &amp; services have a clear stand against this threat. Keep up with your good work! :)
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:31:57
What is the minimum price to make it rentable to mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:04:33


I just replied to the comment above?! I think this is not uncommon in reddit :)
segwit is mainly a big software patch which fixes a lot of problems - and a "minor" change is the compromise to a higher blocksize. just opening a larger blocksize only kicks the problem down the road, blocks will be full soon again. segwit enables (or improves) lightning network, which can handle much more transactions like the bitcoin chain - with having nearly the same security like bitcoin. and to be honest.. This whole BU theater is just about miner fees - nothing more... If you really care about low fees - you should support segwit!
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:03:50
In the 0.14 branch: 
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:43:48
I think this is one point of the discussion now. In general there is a large amount of support in the economical majority (exchanges, wallet providers, nodes (which are nearly 80% of supporting segwit)).
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:36:12
thanks for this info... Is it already public somewhere?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:13:41
I hold! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:45:48
maybe... but as long as we get segwit activated, it's ok for me... :D
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:27:28
~~can someone explain me why the minimum ram amount of pruning nodes is 550?
it would be great to reduce it to 400, so it's easier to launch a  node on a digital ocean 5 usd server?~~
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:29:37
ahhh ok, now I get it... It's not planned to do this as a "general hardfork", but only in case of an attack?
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:22:35
yeah interesting to see what will happen.. i think most people just want the best for bitcoin... also interesting to see what will happen with the new bitfinex prediction market: 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:05:21
why? BitcoinEC = Core 0.14 (segwit) + "Emergent Consensus"-patch
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:42:19
yes yes yes yes yes :D
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:12:19
Damn, why didn't you wait with this announcement for the start of their hardfork.. :P
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:51:22
yeah..! *facepalm* :D
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:20:03
thats not true... the valid chain is not chosen by the amount of hashrate, but by the nodes which enforce the consensus rules!
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:28:16
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:51:45
there are no binaries as it seems.. You have to compile it yourself at the moment..
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:28:57
miners are just ordering VALID transactions, if they include INVALID transactions, their blocks get discarded. the propagation of valid transactions is done by nodes (or nodes get banned, for sending invalid transactions). Maybe read the paper again.. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:24:47
I'm not sure if you should really use gear... As it looks there is no development, response time are really long (if at all someone is responding)... They should either ask for money and improve service or turn it off.. I'm not really satisfied.
@_date: 2017-03-01 07:50:15
Because it's easier to try it another time later, if you didn't receive a written paper with "declined" on it. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:33:54
Yeah.. I don't know which wallet he used, but this seems really bullshit to me. I also do payments all the time and most of them have a transaction fee of about 4-6ct.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:34:07
scream. and hold.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:17:55
you know that we then would get 8MB blocks in the end, which generate around 420 GB / year? 420GB is easy to pay in western/rich countries - but not in poorer countries. Do you really want to lower the node count? If we would have BU since the beginning, the current blockchain (107GB), would be at least 700 GB now.
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:53:50
I think it works at the beginning, since the xpubs of both are valid bitcoin addresses, but later the address generation will be different probably.. Would like to hear a more professional answer, if there is an option in copay or mycelium to make it work maybe..
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:15:11
Did you make a backup of your kryptokit data? there is a one-click backup feature?
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:06:45
Also my thought..
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:03:01
I dont know, I just posted it.. I think it would be great to get segwit started and get a bigger block size?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:54:17
the technical downsides and the poor code review, the low amount of developers which code and the already existing backlog of changes of bitcoin unlimited, compared to the bitcoin core repository are really scaring... The problem is that there are a lot of paid people which spread FUD and lies about core... Almost all of technical skilled people are for segwit and against bitcoin unlimited.
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:22:45
Yeah, just stop this sheet!
@_date: 2016-06-27 09:47:25
It just shows it increased 1,2%?

Happened to me with with another service.. usually there is workflow where you can reset your 2fa. either by deactivating via email, or you have to send your id or other things to the service. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:43:05
But: if you are against Segwit, you probably wouldn't run a client which supports it.

@_date: 2017-03-13 16:49:00
Sorry, it seems that you really didn't understand the technical basis of bitcoin. nodes enforce the network constraint - not the miners. if 100% of miners mine an invalid block, the majority of the nodes would reject it and the reward would become worthless. please inform yourself before posting such nonsense.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:43:59
fees would go up... I'm not sure what happens more.. I think all core noders would set the minimum tx fee higher, so these spam attacks would cost much more maybe.

did you install the browser bridge? Maybe try it also with another usb cable, they are sometimes making problems... and general advice: reboot and try again :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:24:24
1) Yes, this is your "new platform", you can and probably should transfer your bitcoins to your local pc
2) electrum will generate mutiple addresses for you, every time you click receive, electrum will generate a new unused address.
3) When creating a watch only wallet, you just have to import a so called "xpub", a public key, where you can see all transfers of all generated transactions which belong to this public key
4) backup is really important! Please write down your seed and keep it at a safe place.. But as long as you wrote it down and keep it safe, you should be fine.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:40:11
I also think this is somehow planned... All of them are using too low fees, which normal wallets are not creating these days..

If you are on iOS, then I can recommend Copay or breadwallet. From coinbase (after you bought bitcoins) you can send to both of them and also to electum. whereever you want :)

@_date: 2017-03-16 15:28:11
Lets get segwit activated with it! Lets promote this - and not this old shit BU! Everybody join and we get Segwit + Lightning soon :D
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:58:15
Sure, but they also dont run a node for mining, they have special programs for this (as far as I know). And sure, for this they have to start signaling segwit. But since ViaBTC was against segwit - and now supports a segwit client, I guess they changed their minds - and maybe will start so signal segwit within the next weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:53:46

Bitcoin is not a fragile system... It has survived many attacks.. None of them were successfull. Pay a normal fee (around 4-6 ct.) and no problem occures.. I can say this from my own experience.

the account limits are usually described in your account, for example here is it for circle:

Hm, on blockchain.info you can see it now, but not confirmed. it also shows up that it was just received about half an hour ago, if im not wrong? 
So maybe just wait some hours/days!
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:06:49
Yeah, it's still in the mempool at the moment.. You have to wait some days, then it will either get confirmed or dropped from the mempool.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:44:44
I sent a transaction about an hour ago. confirmed within 34 minutes with mycelium default fees (was 4ct): 
So from my point, the whole hype is overrated, wrong use of (not proper) wallets and just fud and manipulation.
**EDIT:** I sent now another test transaction. Again with mycelium, default fee (this time calulated to 7ct): 
**EDIT:** It took 9 minutes to get a confirmation!

ah nice.. but this is mostly to help beginners or? or are there other transactions where this could happen?
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:28:07
only if the chains have the same consensus rules! which is not the case with BU

people are working right at the moment at external copies from bitcoin code repository (see, there are ~7500 forks!). reference implementation is also the "extract of the community dicisions" - so more like the already merged work - than the things which are coming.

I dont understand your answer. You just proofed my answer?
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:48:57
it's another attack to raise fees for everyone, just to pump some altcoins.. from my point of view..
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:04:48
if transactions doesnt cost anything, they will fill up double or triple sized blocks immediately. your suggested solution is no solution.

@_date: 2016-06-25 13:22:55
Bought games, paid, then i clicked "mail receipt" and then an error window appeared. clicked it away (since it was an empty steam browser) - now nothing.. it think i have to wait and it will get resolved by its own..
**EDIT**: Bought some games with bitcoin some time ago and it worked flawlessly.
**EDIT2**: Received an email 20 minutes later which said everything is ok and the games were added to my steam account.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:16:56
for us it works quite ok... the only big problem which we were expecting, was that we set a fixed usd 
price at the beginning.. So when users were paying, the price adjusted and some users had overpaid/underpaid and had to write our support or deposit more. After switching to a fixed btc price (and calculating it by ourselfes) it worked without problems.
And the mycelium gear support was somehow slow, sometimes not really responding (to not urgend tickets, important ones were answered within 48 hours).
Would be also interesting to hear other opinions!
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:06:05
depends how you see it.. some transactions took a bit longer (some up to some hours, but usually within 30 minutes). and the standard fee was around 15-20 ct.
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:46:59
not if bitcoin script language will convert to just csv lists :P
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:29:08
You are missing the point that the userbase is growing bigger and bigger - which led to blocks being full!
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:35:38
Looks really organic to me, no? /s
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:01:38
anti money laundering / know your customers process.. a process which is required by law for bitcoin companies which sell bigger amounts of bitcoin. f.e. if you want to sell or buy a bigger amount of bitcoins, you have to submit your passport, other details to verify that your account is really connected with you.. In general the same things like you need to open a bank account..

Hail to our great developers! :D
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:58:14
best answer which I read the last days..! thanks!
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:08:36
Yeah i know, some time ago fee free transactions worked.. but at the moment there are too many transactions with fee occuring, so the fee free ones get dropped.. You can also see it like you are sending a postcard, without a post mark.. Not very realistic to get it delivered :)
If the transaction gets dropped from the mempools, you should have the same amount in your wallet as before.
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:34:27
Old one, but nice: 
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:36:43
good question.. i think afterwards, but not long afterwards..
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:42:32
Get mycelium for android.. its a great wallet and well maintained. on your desktop I would recommend electrum.
To buy bitcoins, use maybe localbitcoins.com or the local trader feature in your mycelium app.
If you want to save something in cold storage (bigger amounts), buy a trezor. not so cheap, but really rock solid and open source.
Each of this wallets has the feature (or even forces you) to make a backup of your so called "seed". With this seed, you can recover your bitcoins, even if your mobile phone/laptop/trezor gets broken. Just write the seed down and keep it on a save location..
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:02:27
maybe you should look which transactions were occuring on this address before?
the possibility to receive a really random transaction is quite close to 0.0000000000000000000000......000001.
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:28:47

I sent a transaction about an hour ago. confirmed within 34 minutes with mycelium default fees (was 4ct): 
And I sent now another test transaction. Again with mycelium, default fee (this time calulated to 7ct): 
**Edit: ** It took 9 minutes to get a confirmation!

what does this mean?
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:19:38
Yay :D
But what happens if the support goes down again later? is it then deactivated? ( i know its not very realistic that this will happen, but interesting qustion for me)
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:12:54
yeah, or you can post it here.. if it works fine, i will start a pull request on github? If you want to write me over email, just send to office Thanks!

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:12:51
i think the same..
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:59:29
No problem, then just buy some bitcoins with coinbase or circle. Should be no problem.. I think until 1000 USD or something, there is no special aml/kyc procedure which you have to do.. Just enter credit card info and buy :)
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:46:00
Hm i still dont get it.. when is the amount a "large value transfer"?
I think "large" is just related to the fees? and this means, this happens alrady? 
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:14:47
Yes, electrum will collect all your bitcoins from all of your generated receiving addresses - no need for calculating/computing it yourself.
No, you don't have to create a watch only wallet. Watch only wallets are just for the purpose, f.e. for cold storage: you have a big amount of bitcoins offline somewhere (paper wallet/written down seed) and just want to have a look at it. with a watch only wallet you can still observe your big bitcoin amount, but not send it (= and don't have security problems/hacker attacks).
A usecase could look like this: you have 90% of your bitcoins in electrum (on a safe computer, or even offline!) and 10% on your phone (f.e. with mycelium android app). You could add a watch only address on mycelium, so you have 10% for spending it without problems, but you can still watch how your other 90% are doing - without the security risks.

watch this video, its really great and explains it in an easy and funny feshion: 
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:59:50
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:12:12
Yes, I meant that. I was also sending fee free transactions some time ago.. but yeah, at the moment the resources are limited, so there has to be a regulation somehow.. i hope it will get better.. after enough research and testing. quick shots only lead to problems and frustration afterwards.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:30:22
Sure, it was not your intent to loose! so its reasonable to get a refund.. Where is the hardfork client?!
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:53:13
with localbitcoins or mycelium local trader, you dont have to register somewhere, submit your id or other things. you can just meet people in your city and exchange money and bitcoin directly. The price is usually a bit higher than on exchanges (since its a bit more work to meet personally), but on the other hand, you dont have to submit your id or do detailed money laundering verifications on bitcoin exchanges.  But I think you can buy small amounts of bitcoin quite easy on coinbase or circle. Never did this myself to be honest.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:54:39
trezor is really great!
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:33:16
Yeah, for example if your system is compromised with a keylogger/virus/trojan, it could happen that your coins get stolen.
Seed and password can still be unsafe, for example if make a payment and you copy paste the payment address into the "send to-address"-field in electrum, and the trojan/virus could interfere in this moment and insert it's own address! - and redirect your coins to the hacker.
So for bigger amounts (or if you just want to really stay safe) you maybe should by a hardware wallet, like trezor (my recommendation) or ledger (which i dont have any experiences with it).
But if you have a "normal clean" PC and don't keep a bigger amount if bitcoins on it, you should be quite safe.. But yeah, you have to decide this yourself :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:16:09

I think they did a very good job the last years.. But it seems that bitcoin is just too secure and resilient (at the moment) to break things. Somehow this is really funny.. I think Bitcoin is the most valued hacker target ever in history. Never heard of any other product, which has such a high "bug bounty"-program :D

Hm.. I've never had this problem myself, once it took about 2-3 days to confirm.. Maybe you should just wait.. Can you show the transaction id? I'm just wondering that bitpay even offers the option to send without fees, i think f.e. mycelium doesnt let you send without fees..

@_date: 2016-06-19 19:11:48
No, I'm absolutely against a hardfork at the moment, no worry :) Yeah, the network worked quite fine.. It was more the community/sock-puppets which brigaded this sub with postings who tried to influence the public opinion to create a hard fork without testing it properly (and ensuring that this even helps against these spam attacks).

Blockstream you are just the guilty fuck for this horrible working system :D (/s)
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:16:47
A hard fork with a "simple" blocksize increase is not simple. please educate about yourself about the disadvantages of a hardfork, then you will realize that it's not the best solution.

I didnt say that. I think there are a lot of normal people which suffer at the moment. But in general i think that someone spends quite some money to just create such high fee levels.. during the last stress tests/attacks, there were calculations that about 50.000 USD was spent for each attack..
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:55:22
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:31:56
damn forgot already what happens then...
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:21:02
Many people don't educate themself before posting nonsense here (which you obviously can see in your answers) and also don't understand how economics work:
Blocks will be full anyway - independent if the max size is 1,2 or 8 MB - because the more free space a block has - the lower the transaction fee will be. Lower transaction fees (or even 0!) =&gt; more transactions will be made =&gt; until the blocks are full again and tx fees rise again.
So yeah, better inform yourself before trusting anyone here with wrong or missleading answers.


There is no rush. There is just a political campaign to overtake power from miners (to block further scaling solutions like segwit/lightning/mast/schnorr which will come in the next weeks/months and keep the fees high for the miners..).. Nothing more.
@_date: 2016-06-23 06:46:03

Please.. inform yourself... Max. Bitcoin blocksize has already quadrupled with Segwit, segwit2x wants to create 8MB blocks - not 2!
Edit: Yeah downvote me.. **But you can't hide that the segwit2x max. blocksize IS 8MB**
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:50:16
* Current limit: 1MB
* After Segwit Activation (tuesday): 4MB
* After Segwit2X HF (november): 8MB
You went wrong in your thoughts: since the base block size is increased (yeah - **the 100th time: Segwit is a REAL block size increase** ), segwit doubles that even - so 4MB limit starting on tuesday!

thats not true. the max. 8MB block size limit will lead to further centralization if this gets really active and so most people are against it. Look here, no single core developer is for segwit2x: 
Also look at slushs twitter posts, how its already hard at the moment (with 1MB blocks) to stay decentralized:

that depends on your view of the market.. if you want free transactions, then its technically wrong. if you expect fees, then dynamic adjustments are technically ok. in general i think that the current transaction level is created by some investors to pump other altcoins... but yeah, who knows..

Just calculate the needed resources by yourself.. Not so hard.. And you will easily see that bigger blocks are dangerous to the decentralization of bitcoin.. Also compare this with the descreasing node count of ethereum - which has already the problems which big blocks have...
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:53:20
This comes only with the assumption that normal tx and segwit tx will be 50/50 - which is nonsense because segwit transactions are cheaper.
The blocksize is not the only problem, GratefulTony made a long post also in this thread about why this "solution" is no solution. Maybe also check out the list of the core developers and contributors (

3) copy this: 
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="534c", ATTR{idProduct}=="0001", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout", SYMLINK+="trezor%n"

You can still send old transactions, segwit is not obligatory and you are free to send old style transactions as well. Also for miners segwit mining is optional after activation - they can still mine blocks without segwit commitment. It will just be enabled that users can use segwit optionally. You should still consider to use segwit transactions - because they are smaller -&gt; and therefore cheaper.

Watch the video I posted above.. The solution i also not to increase the blocksize, but to further optimize and add second layer scaling solutions like lightning. 
You can compare it to some internet cable: instead of installing 10m diameter thick copper cables for your internet, it makes more sense to add fiber wires :) Smaller, but more throughput.
The "simplest" sounding solution is not the best in this case.

@_date: 2017-08-27 11:04:45
Bitcoins problem is that there are some miners which create spam transactions which get mined afterwards by themselfes (so they dont lose any money due to tx fees) to keep the general tx fee level high. 
The same thing can happen also on 8MB, 16MB, 1GB blocks - because creating, signing and mining these TX doesn't cost them very much. Only 2nd layer solutions will change this - becase it makes a lot of downwared pressure for the normal tx fees.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:38:04

* Storage problems (f.e.  follow thread)
* Has no consensus
* Is rushed
* Implements no replay protection by purpose (which will lead to losses for many untechy people)
* Ignores peer review (f.e. all core developers are against it 
* Codebase is outdated
* It will lead to more centralization (See Cornell study here: 
* Is not community driven but by some (strange) companies
* Other scaling solutions scale much much better, increase decentralization again and has much lower fees (lightning, mast, schnorr)

The problem is that miners can still continue to mine their own spam transactions to keep the fees high - and at the same time drive out competitors due to higher resource usage (compare eth nodes also for example, which already scale much worse than bitcoin). The problem are the miners which are just trying to hold back further development..

@_date: 2017-08-11 20:15:51
I think this shows that rushed hardforks are clearly nonsense and no company should support such developments.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:22:06
every time the same shit.. its getting really boring with this spam attacks.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:24:15
This shows that it can only take another two days to finish! :D
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:45:50
You can really see how bitcoin is dying, due to too small blocks! /s
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:23:25
lol. you are really doing something wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:52:13


Absolutely great guys - you rock!
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:44:06
Should have ask him why there is no development on mycelium gear...
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:58:17
Yes thats how consensus work.. If people like to do things, they do together. If not, then not... So complicated?
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:51:36
Sure, do it! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:42:44


Thanks, failed the test.
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:20:42
Damn, this video really opened my eyes...! THANKS!
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:31:23
So whats your bet to reach within 30 minutes? I say: 812.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:24:12
Best post since we reached 800! (except mine :P)
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:16:22
yippiiiieeeee :D
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:07:21
old, but beste bitcoin meme ever.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:03:30
You are right.. but there are no news??? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:19:03
No, latest shit are long blocks.. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:26:38
lets hope :D
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:32:59
So whats the plan for the next months?

@_date: 2016-11-28 23:36:10
your message is dead on arrival.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:41:58
miners can still create spamtransactions also on 8MB or 32MB blocks and collect the miner fees again themselfs. Bigger blocks don't solve this issue.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:43:23
yeah, thats one of the points which give me hope for this whole mess...
@_date: 2016-12-17 08:19:50
lol.. this whole is a fiasco.
@_date: 2016-12-05 12:43:39
Can you maybe also send me the link?
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:33:58
Get a trezor. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:06:44
or eventually not.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:22:36
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:19:39
Yeah lol.. It really took.. a bit..

Thank you very much Bitcoin Core developers!

Don't be rude... The kids are just excited..
@_date: 2016-11-04 12:13:10
Usually you have to wait for about one day to fully download all existing bitcoin blocks to be up to date and send/receive transactions. With this patch you can send and receive transactions already at the first minute while downloading the blocks in background.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:52:27
This version is cutted and there is a long version available.. But I can't find it anymore.. Someone has a link for it??

Altcoin shilling is thank god not allowed here. Too many scammers just try to create fake drama to pump their shitty coins. It's also funny that OP has zero posts in crypto related subs on reddit and now complains about this... \*fakeeeeee or paid account yay\*

I think this is just a missinterpretion about the market. When I create games for Xbox, I should also not cry about the PS4 users, which wont play my game (if i dont port it). from my point of view.

It's not a consensus currency. Bitcoin works even when 99% of the miners and 100% of other nodes send invalid blocks / data. You don't need external consensus with others, since the consensus is implemented in your own sourcecode.
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:23:04
no. yes.

Thanks, lol still found some bucks.. But high tx fee needed for withdrawal :(
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:44:15
before! You get coins for free before the fork?!!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:45:12
Maybe read up why it's implemented like this, there are multiple reasons and nothing is chosen randomly. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:08:29
lol no.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:38:24
Maybe delete your account and register it again?
Or change your email to a throw away email and register again?
@_date: 2015-08-08 01:19:28
I would just go with the trezor alone... You can restore a seed onto the trezor, but then you entered the seed on a computer, which is not so secure anymore... Better just use the trezor alone.
@_date: 2015-08-07 13:00:38
Trezor relies on BIP 39 and you can/should export your seed as a 24 word sentence.. So also a brainwallet? Or do i get something wrong?

@_date: 2015-08-05 00:34:10
not if its really big news...
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:29:13
I will leave it like this i think.. and maybe rename it before the next fork :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:49:24
nonsense. please read up on lightning which will give us millions of millions of transactions per second with really low fees.

How is this related to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:49:41
Maybe you should sell?
Lol. We are in a bull market, stop with this fud.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:52:38
So basically spoken its just coloured coins with a company which is sec approved to tell others about the ownership?
Thanks for your explination!

You are not trading really much as it seeems? On every single day there are about hundreds of buys and sells in this range.

You are missing the point: 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:51
I think it doesnt matter at this level xD

@_date: 2015-08-07 13:01:54
Thanks for the insightful explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:08:12
ETH is quicker unless your funds are locked in multisig wallet until the next hardfork - or if there is an ICO aution happening. And also quicker for letting your own node sync.. wait. thats not true ooops.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:53:18
Today? Lol you are funny 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:18:34

Or the 300 mio usd which he and roger lost due their unsuccessfull financial attack. lol.

Segwit is already implemented  and exchanges use it already? Just the graphical userinterface is missing in core.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:11:11
So is the surprise already published?
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:53:00
I think I deserve that one.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:04:29
Maybe not fail, but influence the development in their desired way... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:55
meh, go home.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:52:40
Missleading, bitpico also posted they are stopping the fork again.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:49:22
Lol no
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:19:17
You should continue and find out what they want - and then inform us and others :) But please dont send your BTC somewhere xD
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:02:07
yeah, dont sell on the first dip :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:40:19
I bought always at the top, but until now I have been always positive on total :) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:58:26
You fucked up your TX, nothing more. Check your Inputs, they are unconfirmed. Bullshit post, since no normal wallet sends unconfirmed funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:39:42
yeah you are right, it should have been deployed without asking  miners at all.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:29:30
please clarify @_date: 2017-11-02 19:36:11
I think you are right and I hope they get hold responsible for the damage they will cause if they continue like this.

Seems like...  They are pushing to use the block size increased XT-version.. But yesterday someone released an article that XT has some really big privacy/security backholes... I also don't know what to think about this, but it looks like someone wants to split the community and fork bitcoin to use some strange privacy/security settings....  
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:27:54
Yeah I know, i was more referencing to


@_date: 2015-08-08 13:22:59
You can print it on normal paper.. But it also depends what you want to archieve... If you want to have a really long term storage, you should rely on paper which is certified for archiving.. And also take care if your printer ink is working for long term storage (not  acid,...).. But I'm also not an expert in this..

@_date: 2019-12-14 10:10:16
If you talk about mining, the point of miners is to tell the network, which transactions happened - and in which order. Since everyone could tell wrong or malicious bad transaction orders, miners have to pay a price (= do some calculation work, hardware, energy, maintainance..) to have this right. So basically the complex math equations are needed, to ensure that only invested people are posting valid information (beside client side validity checks) - otherwise they wouldn't get the mining reward, which compensates them for their work.

Unforunately not, it was planned in this release, but then some countermeasures against the b2x fork had to be implemented since the btc1 team/jgarzik decided to remove some safety protections which have been implemented in the last core release.

You don't get it: without the long delay attacks it would be much much cheaper to reorg the bitcoin chain. If you pretend this, you also have to include the possibility that the chain would have been reorged maybe much longer before.

I saw the presentation.. but somehow it was too techy for me to understand, maybe also related that english is not my mother language..
@_date: 2019-12-14 09:55:06
See here: 
The video with Richard Heartwin explains it pretty good, why bigger blocks are bad. Bitcoins blocksize is chosen deliberately like this.. Not because they forgot "to make this or that constant" bigger or because it's not updateable.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:09:04
Do it asap.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:01:05
works, but is not developed anymore, just see their website when the last news upate was. sometimes I dont receive the payment confirmation emails, but that's not so important. did not reply to my emails how they will handle a possible bip148 fork and didn't have plans on how to deal with b2x.

It was absolutely not unexpected, journalist should have done their homework.

Nonsense. Bitcoin is valuable because people are trusting it. It's not a scammy shitcoin with insecure design which proves it's vulnerabilities here and then.

This is what I pointed out in my post... The wallet providers are implementing now floating fees, which solves this problem... I said that this stresstests lead to another evolutional step and after floating fees are implemented (trezor f.e. already applied a "higher fee" button), the downside of big backlogs is quite less substancial..

I just was there and took a look at it... Wanted to buy some coins, but didn't work out at the beginning because the LCD display didn't respond.. tried it again after ten minutes and it worked fine, without problems.. Also met another nice bitcoin enthusiast :D One problem is still open: After providing my QR address and putting money inside, it asked me for confirmation - if address etc is really ok... But the only thing I could do is just to press "OK" - there was no cancel button, which was somehow irritating... (I closed my wallet and opened it again, which resulted in another qr code.. so I couldnt verify my address and even coudnt abort the process or scan another QR code... I really wished that I could rescan my QR code at this point!)... Beside that: really awesome that we have a bitcoin ATM in Vienna :) Great work guys!

and is scaling really bad for the network! Google a bit how long it takes to sync your own node and see how the storage is going:  And even with this block management - if there is a bigger ICO, network is frozen also.

@_date: 2015-07-09 14:32:21
Yeah, why? The network didn't crash.. It just took time to process all open transactions..? And if you paid enough fees (and had the right wallet to choose the appropriate fee) it also worked out to send transaction within 1-2 blocks?

There was a bug in the validation of POW, Bitmain is blocking the community ( by preventing SegWit, because SegWit would reduce Bitmains Hashpower by about 30%, because they used an exploit (covert Asicboost) to get more hashpower with the same energy like their competitors. 
Community want's to fix this bug to establish balance between miners, but Bitmain says "please not" - even though they said they are not even using this exploit - there is no reason to NOT fix this bug...

Sure there will be some people who still want to buy bitcoins, f.e. for historic reasons.. but it there would be a big software flaw, which makes bitcoin immediately valueless (free bitcoin generation, easy cracking of private keys,...), there would be so many people which sell all their coins which would lead the price to zero, so you can buy maybe some millions... But they still would be worthless..

Better set uacomment at the moment, and wait for the final release! Don't risk anything at the moment - because also it doesnt do anything right now, beside signaling via version string - which you can also do with normal core binaries.

As far as I know, not fully. Miners could also mine segwit enabled blocks without segwit transactions in it - and use covert Asicboost there - but it would be also way more obvious there.

@_date: 2017-04-08 01:29:47
We only will accept payments from the UASF/SegWit chain. We are not sure if we should keep track of the non-UASF chain, maybe some people still want to be notified when they should dump their non-UASF coins :D Or it's maybe also interesting to get notified about non-UASF chain crash, just to be safe when you are not on a computer or smartphone. Waiting for further feedback to decide this :)

Sorry, wrong url, corrected it! Click again!

You are right, I think non-segwit transactions will be getting less and less used, because segwit transactions are smaller as far as I know and would be cheaper than non segwit transactions.

He is just suggesting a technical change, because he thinks that nothing is changing - but look at the community: UASF, companies lobbying against BU - it's changing. 
And his proposed solution is not a good change for various reasons and he got already some answers which go into the same direction like my answer. 
People deserve respect for good things they do - not just by their history.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:06:45
No binaries available at the moment, you have to compile it yourself - and can prove that Luke-Jr and Iaanwj got the same deterministic build.
If we have enough community support, we will release binaries - before that, you can support UASF by compiling your own node, or setting the uacomment in your bitcoin.conf. See also here for more info:

emergent consensus hands over the block size limit to the decision of the miners alone. 
User activation means that only the nodes trigger an activation of a softfork (in the current context) - no miners involved.

1. Is your launched satelite a "general purpose" satelite which is processing also other services, or is it really only for processing bitcoin block propagation?
2. How much did all these things cost, if it's possible to reveal the amount :D
3. Does the electromagnetic shift which happens right now, affect the control of your satelite?
4. How did you put it into space? :D

I also think that all the other b2x supporting companies can be held accountable by law so let me mention something:

@_date: 2017-10-29 22:25:23
These fees will be collected by the miners.
At the moment there are too many transactions happening, so the fee level goes up, you cann see here a nice diagram that the last 2 days there were much more transactions than the days before:  When there are less transactions, the fee level goes down, even to 1 ct per transaction.
Bitcoin Cash is much more centralized than bitcoin and has a broken difficulty adjustment, which means that sometimes there is not even one block mined within 6 hours (so your money doesnt get into your exchange for 6 hours!):

Eric, get out of this agreement. It's a total mess, for your reputation, your business and all other businesses which operate with Bitcoin. Several other big businesses spoke out against it, the whole developer base and community is also against it.
There is a time where you have to stop doing the wrong things - and realize that the way you (and many others) went is not successfull and will lead to more damage to the bitcoin community **than high fees would have ever done**.
Let's stop this nonsense, be wise and lets get all together on the table   (or at least the sane people like you). The current way will end in a catastrophe - there won't be any winners, independent how it goes out in the end. 
So, please be wise and stop this whole clusterfuck for the sake of bitcoin and it's community (both sides) - this shit is really unfortunate for everyone here.

I would say it's best practice.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:57:10
lol. you forgot the last sentence xD
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:15:26
Yes, but there will always be Miners which mine Segwit transactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:47:12
3000 millions pounds?
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:52:01
Bitcoin has not only technical barriers against attacks, but also social barriers as you can see.

Wow! Nice!

Don't convince them. Just buy more and tell them later "told you so".

Trezor will implement a way to split your coins like for bch, after the final version is out of the btc1 client (if there is a final version ever... )

Can someone explain me this LI5?
Why should I use a wallet with 2 currencies (USD, CNY) if I want to pay in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:21:35
**YES - great idea!!!**

@_date: 2015-04-07 17:48:11
They are not selling bitcoin, they are selling shares as far as I understood... So they can't buy btc on the market and profit from the margin... And you are also only allowed to sell shares, which you owned for more than a year... but this is maybe just my interpretion.. Someone wants to correct me?
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:17:54

Many spam transactions in the ~~memo oil~~ mempool , which are no Segwit transactions, therefore the total percentage decreases at the moment.

Let me pay one page! $0.35 @_date: 2015-04-08 21:17:06
Same for me... also used bitcoin24com so i can be sure its because they sold/had a hacked database!
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:28:50
Never let your node run with an open RPC port. Better setup for example OpenVPN and connect to your node via VPN!
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:41:28


Wrong, miners are still only mining because they can exploit the EDA. Just look at  and tell me how many blocks they mined in the last 5 hours?
Spoiler: 0.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:47:22
Sooo.. If you still own BCC - you know now when to dump them xD
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:27:06

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:34:17
amazon wont accept bitcoin. there. you heard it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:36:51
Sure, but I don't care about how bitcoin community defends itself.
@_date: 2015-04-30 08:11:11
wtf... can someone explain me what happened? Maybe the deposits arrived today, triggered because of the good news the last days?
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:10:56
yeah, same problem here... did you solve the old man reward?
EDIT: Solved...

You don't need to sell, you are safe for the next years - even without further developments of the Bitcoin client. But you can be sure that early enough some changes will come, to ensure that it continues to be uncrackable for the next decades..

@_date: 2015-04-22 19:03:47
EDIT: I didn't notice that the question was about Bitcore, not Bitcoin core...
There are 2 different types of wallets. Multibit offers HD wallets, Bitcoin core just offers normal randomly generated private keys. You cannot automatically see the derived private keys from the HD wallet in bitcoincore.
You could write a script, which imports the generated private keys into bitcoin core, but it would be always limited to the amount you imported...
Btw.. What do you want to achieve?

If it's somehow possible, I guess they will add it - they do it for all bigger forks, also for btcgold like it seem:  But you are right, at the moment it's unclear:

lol, yeah. that was what I meant. xD
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:12:10
The point is - even if 99% of the miners mine an invalid block - your node still won't accept is as valid - completely independent from the hashpower. So hashpower doesn't matter really much - the distribution and usage of nodes is much much more important, and it seems that most people don't understand this.

@_date: 2017-10-26 02:00:50
Eric, don't you see that this agreement is the biggest threat to bitcoin which has ever existed? Why not stop it, unite again and do a HF with more features, more testing and review? You see that so many people are against this HF - why do you still go for it? It will be really catastrophic in November? :(
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:20:12
Address reuse is not recommended... see 
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:01:34

Bitcoin Core is not recommended for unexperienced users.. If you dont want to cope with it, try an SPV client like mycelium or breadwallet..
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:55:18
I understood it also like this...
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:42:20
maybe this?

@_date: 2015-09-26 05:47:32
Thank you really much gavin! 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:26:20
From my point of view this will never work.. Transactions for payment are quite small, so if all transactions are distributed, its still possible for normal users to save the whole blockchain. 
if some scans historic images and saves them in such an altcoin, the blockchain grows way to much, so nobody would offer so much space for this.. What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:35:36
Man this is a really great idea! Do it!
@_date: 2015-09-13 16:48:00
why is there such a strange scaling? yocto and zepto?
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:00:07

As I mentioned in another comment, I received this email on a spam-catching address, like bitcoin24com So for me its clear that they got my address via bitcoin-24.com. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:39:48
It seems that you don't understand WHO secures the network. It's not the miners - it's the nodes which enforce the network constraints. Miners only sort transactions, nothing more.
@_date: 2016-10-26 22:01:10
can someone tldr it for me? english is not my mother language and i dont get completely what this is about?
@_date: 2016-10-28 06:48:09
Yaaaay!!! Great job!!! Thank you!!!
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:29:41
Hail to our great developers! Thank you very much and continue on!
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:32:56
I think they released the information by purpose, they want that the news spread wide before the trading starts.. because they want a "trading explosion" on monday and good PR/news about it.. Imagine that a first trade was done.. and nothing happens anymore because the news didn't spread wide enough.
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:58:29
I think they just want to earn more money... 
@_date: 2016-10-13 11:58:40
So this means non hardened?
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:54:48
It will arrive in two weeks...
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:12:29

Damn. You are totally right. This remix is really great! lol :D
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:52:48
You could also mention that the blocksize increase is also in favor for the big miners, since they can earn more transaction fees with bigger blocks.

 (once again :D)
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:54:20

@_date: 2016-10-27 10:15:18
yeah, i also wondered last time...
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:03:47
So which altcoin? None of them scales better.. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:32:39
You are still missing the point. It's not about a compromise - miners will lose power with segwit. There won't be a compromise in this direction because they are afraid of it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:52:57
this is a really great idea... :D

@_date: 2016-10-13 11:51:29
Do you maybe know if trezor uses the hardened version?
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:02:14
Yeah, nobody needs this technical bullshit, just because people want to "compromise". Compromise between get run by a bus and not get run by a bus is NOT to get run by a bus.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:04:23
Yeah, please use a bank. good bye!
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:04:59
No, because it will never get in effect. This "agreement" is so unprecice defined that nobody will agree on any technical implementation - like before - which just gives jihan more time to earn fees and throw out competitors due to asicboost.
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:43:42
Buy a trezor... Its really a great device...

No it does not. There is no community support for this technical nonsense - at least from people who understand these technical terms.
This "compromise" is breaking the current well tested deployment in favour of deploying code (which is not written nor reviewed nor tested) in 4 months - without support of the community. Their target is just to get segwit into an failed state - and push proposals which give miners even more power, like extblocks.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:48:00
A hardfork is always disruptive and makes problems... But UASF is not a HF.. It's a **U**ser **A**ctivated **SOFT FORK** :)

This doesn't include that the value of the dollar would fall quite drastically, so probably the value of bitcoin would be infinite or something really big in USD... You can't switch to btc and usd stays the same..
**EDIT**: Clearly spoken: It's not that Bitcoin is more worth then.. It just means that the USD collapses and has no worth anymore -&gt; Bitcoin's value itself stays the same.. Just the nomination in USD is drastically increased..
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:17:17
This is nonsense and will only centralize bitcoin even more. BIP148 is the way to go to activate SegWit and move back political power from miners to the users. **UASF NOW!!! BIP148 FTW!**

Chainsplit =/= HF.
A hardfork changes the consensus rules completely. A softfork just tightens the rules, old nodes would just see the new transactions as invalid, but won't ban the other nodes because of it like on a HF.

You can read up many infos here: 
Basically it's a way to get segwit running based by node operators - not by miners (which are currently blocking the rollout for segwit).
Segwit and further developments would make bitcoin transactions much faster and cheaper, so around 80% of the community is absolutely in favor of it.

The best thing what you could do at the moment is to announce your support and educate others about BIP148. The main target is still to get segwit activated - and the best way would still be that miners want to save their face and activate segwit with the normal BIP9 deployment - and BIP148 has not to get in effect. :D So post it out on twitter, ask your favourite exhanges to support BIP148 and help on reddit to clear up missinformation, which is happening sometimes here unfortunately :)
And join the  channel, I can really recommend it :)

It's really funny how naive this people are... I like bitcoin.. But if I would be a head finance director, I wouldn't say bitcoin is the equivalent of gold.. gold has shown (more or less) its robustness over the last thousand years.. bitcoin is existing since not even 10 years.. I would be interested what he says when the first important broken fork occures or other dangerous software bugs show up and a lot of people loose a lot of money because of this... For me its ok, when I say bitcoin is like gold.. I'm a small guy in the bitcoin world... but not for a director who should take care about the money of his clients.. he should know it better that bitcoin is still fresh and the experience with it so not very long..

BIP149 will take really long to deploy, probably 1,5 years because you have to redeploy all 0.13.1 + 0.14 core versions - because they wont activate segwit again.

@_date: 2017-05-19 10:04:45


That's absolutely wrong. BU doesn't have many nodes nor much traction after their multiple outages - so even if the miners would start to mine BU blocks, they would be rejected by the community and marked as invalid. 
Segwit support is already deployed on around 80% of all nodes, so this won't be a problem for SegWit.

People should ~~have to~~ upgrade, because even 0.13.1 and 0.14 nodes will not accept segwit transactions (segwit gets deactivated in these versions, if its not activated with the current BIP9 process) and mark them as invalid.

If we get enough support, the legacy blocks will be either nothing worth - because the blocks are getting marked invalid - or the legacy chain gets reorganized - and their blocks will disappear, which is a big risk for exchanges. The BIP148 chain can replace the legacy chain, but the legacy chain cannot replace the BIP148 chain (BIP148 is a soft fork and tightens the rules for blocks). 
So, if the community is behind BIP148, it's quite safer to support it - instead of ignoring it.

I think the cleanest possible BIP91 client right now is  - segwit2x identification &amp; BIP91, based on the core 0.14.2 branch, no HF.
All in all - they should just go with BIP148... Many nodes, tested and reviewed. Much better than all this nonsense..

I never said that a HF is not possible - I only said that backroom deals like berry silbert is trying to build are nonsense - barry doesnt speak for the community - nor can miners rely on his promise - so I really dont understand what he is trying to guarantee here. 
But you are right, even in the (already long existing) [core roadmap]( there is a point of a possible HF - but no one is guaranteeing it - because no one **can** guarantee it. It's nothing which can one, ten or 100 people decide by their own.

You are correct - this means they are forking off the network. Guess how much bitcoin blocks are worth if none of the users follow - nothing. And miners dont mine just for fun... They also have to pay their bills.

@_date: 2017-05-23 20:53:31
The problem is - this compromise will never work out in the end. I believe that most companies are willing to do it, but there are factors which will prevent if for sure:
-) Bitmain earns so much at the moment by using their covert asciboost implementation, which cannot be used by them if they enable SegWit via SF (it would work for them if SegWit is activated by a HF because of the deployment process - therefore the wish to activate it via HF, so they can continue to use covert asicboost)
-) So they cannot even let this compromise work, because they would lose a lot of money - and might fear more competition
-) They know that a HF won't be deployed within 6 months, so they will signal for SegWit just below the treshold and then say in september "oh no, we cannot do this, because you didnt do xyz..." (like HK agreement), which would lead to a broken segwit - which cant be activated probably within the next 2 years again. In the meantime they can push for solutions like extblocks, which would further increases and centralizes their power.
So... The best way is now to still continue with BIP148 or do some compatible stuff like what James hillard suggested on the dev mailing list (activate Segwit with 80%, without HF).

Y u no facts checked, Segwitx2MB leads to max. 8MB blocks.
@_date: 2016-05-18 07:22:55
Sure.. Thats software :) But in general you should maybe rely on bip32 wallets (electrum, mycelium,...), because you can export your seed and enter it in a new software without problems - as long as they support bip32. And at the moment it looks like it, that bip 32 is something like an industry standard.. So it shouldn't go away soon. But yeah.. Bitcoin is a quite young technology and there will be fast changes which are sometimes hard to handle.. As I said.. Its software - young software :)

No it hasn't the potential to replace bitcoin, even if they are spending a lot of money for fake posts, social media campaigns etc, spreading discrediting information about core developers or companies which support core development.. You just have to look at the amount of (skilled!) developers and what version they are working for (core, BU,... f.e. see the [developer list here]( and their support for Segwit2x, which was mostly driven by the copier of bitcoin -&gt; bitcioin ABC. Just to mention here that many urgent and important bugs were found by **core developers**).
No sane developer is supporting this fork and even if they survive the HF and some weeks - there are no skilled developers working on it and they will fall behind the original bitcoin development quite soon.. 
So also in the long term they will fail to cope up with the general bitcoin development - you just have to look at BU (which development was also driven by the same company) - it got outdated pretty fast and had multiple outages and network errors (more than bitcoin core had combined in its whole lifetime!).
So the only thing which I could recommend is to sell your BCC coins as long it's value is &gt; 0. But for this you would have to send your coins to ViaBTC which is probably not the most trustful exchange out there.
And about closing your position: If you are leveraged long it's maybe a bit risky. If you are just holding, maybe you should try to buy some cheap coins - if price really drops.
But to be honest: I also expected the price will go down days before the BIP91 lock in (which happened some hours ago) - but I was wrong and the price went up for about 30 %. lol.
That's bitcoin :D

You can calculate it really easily by yourself and decide if you think that the suggested proposal is good for keeping bitcoin decentralized:
**Core right now**: 1(MB) * 6 (blocks per hour) * 24 (hours) * 365 (days)= **52 GB per year**
**Segwit:** 4(MB) * 6 (blocks per hour) * 24 (hours) * 365 (days)
= **210 GB per year**
**Segwit + 2xblock sizeHF :** 8(MB) * 6 (blocks per hour) * 24 (hours) * 365 (days) = **420 GB per year =&gt; more than 8x more than now!**
If you calucate it now for the next 2 years, lets compare:
**Current size: 115GB (grown over 10 years now!)**
**Core: 104GB (in just 2 years)**
**Segwit: 420GB (in just 2 years)**
**Segwit2xHF: 840GB (in just 2 years)**
Shows clearly that only rich countries can afford so much diskspace and this will clearly reduce the amount of nodes.. Already segwit is costing a lot..
Edit: corrected some wrong maths lol.. sorry.

@_date: 2017-07-19 12:37:56
Sorry, but you are wrong. is right, if you only set the bip91 bit (but dont orphan blocks), you will build blocks on the next non-bip91 block, which wouldn't lead to a segwit activation.
So you have to run a BIP91 client to orphan other blocks, its not sufficient to only signal BIP91.
UASF / BIP148 has not really a direct connection here, it will also start to orphan non segwit signaling blocks, but starting from august 1st and its activation is not related to hashrate (like BIP91 with 80% trigger level over a 336 block window).

Yes.... but to change the consensus rules you still have to overtake the economical majority (exchanges, wallets,...). Without them, you can run your nodes and try to use other consensus rules, but you will be blocked soon.

The problem is - this compromise will never work out in the end. I believe that most companies are willing to do it, but there are factors which will prevent if for sure:
-) Bitmain earns so much at the moment by using their covert asciboost implementation, which cannot be used by them if they enable SegWit via SF (it would work for them if SegWit is activated by a HF because of the deployment process - therefore the wish to activate it via HF, so they can continue to use covert asicboost)
-) So they cannot even let this compromise work, because they would lose a lot of money - and might fear more competition
-) They know that a HF won't be deployed within 6 months, so they will signal for SegWit just below the treshold and then say in september "oh no, we cannot do this, because you didnt do xyz..." (like HK agreement), which would lead to a broken segwit - which cant be activated probably within the next 2 years again. In the meantime they can push for solutions like extblocks, which would further increases and centralizes their power.
So... The best way is now to still continue with BIP148 or do some compatible stuff like what James Hilliard suggested on the dev mailing list (activate Segwit with 80%, without HF).

People are playing dangerous games by suggesting / trying to force compromises which they can neither promise - nor are technically safe. This whole HF nonsense shows only how many people don't even know what a HF is. Barry cannot compromise a HF. Only nodes can guarantee a successfull HF - not barry silbert, not core developers - not anybody alone =&gt; so it's absolute nonsense to "compromise" to a HF like this.

They sold hashrate and equipment to other people, and started "mass selling" containers... Source:  on slack.bitcoincore.org 
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:18:13
The current BIP148 UASF works only now - because the target is to lead other non upgraded (but segwit supporting) nodes to enable segwit enforcement. There has to be a long enough delay to be robust against several hashrate attacks, so the date august 1st is somehow the best date. If we would start later, it wouldnt be possible anymore to use this deployment scheme and you have to redeploy segwit completely - because core 0.13.1 and 0.14 won't activate segwit anymore after november - because it deactivates the deployment mechanism for Segwit.

You will see, if BIP91 fails a lot of miners and services will see BIP148 as the last resort. There are also already more than 800 nodes which enforce BIP148 and some miners are already mining BIP148 signaling blocks, wallet provider which support BIP148 (see electrum, trezor,..).

Sure, but you are complaining about a new technology which is baked by people which are mostly not paid for the development at all. and still - bitcoin is quite cheaper than western union and the development is already going into the direction to make transactions cheaper, so this complaining is quite misplaced from my point of view..

@_date: 2017-07-18 13:25:17
Yes, as you mentioned - it's normal and is also showing up on normal Core clients, because the BIP91 deployment (which has to be run by miners) is producing blocks with a special version string  -  but this does not affect your wallet - except that we will hopefully get segwit soon :)

It's actually around 16 hours (117 blocks * 8,5 minutes / 60), because the difficulty level is below the hashrate, so one block takes now about 8,5 minutes instead of ten.

Not true. If 100% of the miners start a HF, they will be completely rejected by the network if they dont have the majority of the users, their blocks will be marked as invalid. Please don't spread such misinformation.

Segwit is an update to the bitcoin network, which enables many new exciting developments. See here:

@_date: 2017-07-21 19:27:55
This is only on recovery, not setup... And entering your seed somewhere to recover your backup is necessary on ALL wallets (independent of hardware wallet or software wallet), so your argument is completely missleading and wrong in this case.

@_date: 2017-05-28 19:04:47
sure, but there are three points:
1) main target of UASF is to get enough support as possible. without proper support BIP148 wont work, so it should only be started if there is enough of it. See lukes [medium post](
2) If they attack the minority chain, they would a) reduce also hashpower on the mainnet (which decreases their earnings), b) would only have effect as long as they proceed and c) would decrease the price for the main chain (which would reduce their income even more)
3) Even if BIP148 starts as the minority chain, the non-bip148/legacy could be always completely reorganized into non existance if there at least one block where BIP148 has more than 50% hashpower. this only can happen on the legacy chain - not on the bip148 chain - which is a big risk for miners. So if they attack the minortiy chain, they give also up security of the main chain (and would also increase the amount of hashpower on the BIP148 chain!).
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:32:32
You are hightlighting somehow wrong words :D Better make sentences bold where you want to focus on - highlighting only single words makes no sense and doesnt help to read through in a short timeframe.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:46:42
how did you switch? Did you enter your seed to electrum? Then yes, your private key is now located in 2 wallets (bc.info + electrum). If you do transactions, both balances will change.

It depends on the community, at the moment a HF has no consensus, so if miners chose to hard fork off to another chain/altcoin, most other miners will stay with the community.
But I think the community would follow, if there is a HF which contains a lot of improvements, has a long time to be tested (&gt;1 year, better 2 years) and is well reviewed. The current rollout of a HF proposal like Segwit2x clearly shows that this kind of rollout is absolutey irresponsible and not ready for production, see f.e.

You only need to upgrade if you are already running a BIP148 node. If you are completely new to bitcoin, I would suggest to read more up before you run a (BIP148) node yourself. 
Maybe its better to keep your bitcoins where they are now and read up more about it before you do anything... Here is a link to the BIP148 information:

It's not a matter if someone uses different consensus rules - it's only a matter how many other people are following this different rules. 
You can f.e. just go to your core client, enter "invalidateblock  and you are in a different consensus system... But nothing happens - since you are alone. If you have more than 1000 followers, story might look different.

can you show us the transaction id? they are not lost, at maximum you will get them back in 3 weeks.. but shoulnt take so long usualy.

Go to "tools", "electrum preferences" and then "appearance" =&gt; "base unit". probably you have set it to bits or mBTC.. Switch it to BTC, then you should be able to send the correct amount.

You are absolutely right... I dont know why you get downvoted.

No dump seen...
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:41:08
Thats wrong. It was not a question "if miners like it". It's was just a safety mechanism, to wait for 95% of miners to agree (for the users). Users are widespread in favour of segwit.

Could you also generate this graph with median and not average? would be more precise i think.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:29:55


BIP91 is not activating segwit, it's activating BIP141 depyoyment via Bit1. Combining this with the sentence "BIP148" is not activating anything is nonsense, since BIP148 is doing the same (orphaning blocks to activate BIP141 for normal nodes), just from the user side and started on a flag day.


Nonsense, nothing is turned off here.


Thats the problem of ALL BIPs which rely on bit signaling - the same is with BI91 now and has nothing to do with UASF.


The quality of your post is like from a 6 year old.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:35:45
The good thing is: only miners have to run segwit2x code, to enable segwit. You can just use your old core node and be fine. Segwit2x contains only code for miners (for the process how they enable segwit).
And if you want to ensure that miners really actviate segwit? Run a BIP148 node :)

The threshold is probably there, where you can seperate between hype and real technical constraints.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:43:14
Squashman is leaving out that no HF can be pushed to the users. If only 10% of nodes follow, the hardfork blocks will be marked as invalid by the majority and get orphaned. **No one can force users to a hard fork** and miners would be stupid to start one (because their mined blocks would be worthless).

there is no UAHF... activation mechanism is by a miner cartell, so you can only say Miner Activated Hard Fork...

because ethereum is much worse optimized than bitcoin, it takes much more resources to run a eth node -&gt; which leads to much more centralization. in the end you you wont have anything different than a big mainframe computer - but not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:12:11
I spend a lot of time in and the bitcoin markets slack and kraken is a running gag there because of their broken trading system...

Bip148 is doing exactly this. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:35:16
Hm think coin is already associated with a full bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:51:30
Just to mention: In general it's considered to be best practice to keep your private keys safe (not in an online-wallet-service) because so many online-wallets were hacked in bitcoin's history. So you maybe should create a new electrum wallet and send everything there - so nothing is left on blockchain.info. But please inform yourself more before doing this and also maybe don't do it now due to the coming soft forks/hardforks in the next hours/days.

Will this version also be updated here:  ?
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:41:59
Mm... Are you sure? I dont think so, because BIP148 only accepts segwit blocks so its by definition 100% segwit?

There are alreay several segwit deployment proposals &amp; segwit implementations existing or in planning (see btc1 repo), so I think its really hard to make a good form. The next problem is that many people are not well informed about the technical implementations and only forward (sometimes wrong / incomplete) facts - so this poll would be not accurate. Best idea is just to look at the bitcoin development mailing list, or talk in the slack channel with the people there. 
It also doesnt matters what some people think... The community is needed for consensus changes.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:20:39
A lot of users are not very happy about blockchain.info, since they had many technical issues in the past... Mycelium Gear would be maybe worth to take a look at:  Quite easy to implement, we also use it for our service BitcoinReminder.com..
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:16:59
To use Segwit? Sure!
If you want to help to enforce Segwit? No, then you should inform yourself about how to run a Bip148 node! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:21:38
The "proposal" which you are talking about, has nothing to do with something user activated. It should be named "MAHF" (Miner Activated Hard Fork). All in all: this agreement is shitty and has no backing in the community.

you know that just by typing invalidateblock 000 no nodes follow the miners? and they are forking off without nodes which make their blocks valuable?
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:02:37
nodes dont follow if miners only type invalidateblock? they will just mark this chain as invalid and discard it?

Since hardware wallets are sold out at the moment (most secure imo), you should probably go with a wallet on your mobile phone like mycelium or copay (but I wouldnt store a lot of bitcoins there). Cold storage should be stored maybe with your PC and electrum...

@_date: 2017-06-14 10:22:57
A MAHF is not dangerous, you will only see a bit longer transaction times.. Nothing else. Nodes will just continue to validate blocks like before - but Jihan's blocks will just look like they disappeared from the network.
