If 1 btc=$10,000
Market cap=$210 Billion
Multiplied by 1%= 2.1 Billion
Anyways besides that they took a lot of risk by buying in early by as much as they did. It was more risky when they bought in with a greater chance of failure. They have been rewarded so far.

Just a thought.
Would be great if you could see a history of the askers "tips". Would help people answer questions if they knew the asker was generous. I'm sure that the answerers would be more willing to answer questions and give better answers if they knew that there was a higher likelyhood of getting a tip.
I think this would help organically promote tipping. Tipping should not be enforced, but if answerers see that the asker doesn't usually tip or that they are brand new, the askers should naturally expect not as great of answers.
Seems like a great idea. Would be awesome if it takes off.

Even though it is a binary outcome that doesn't mean its 50/50. It could be 99% chance of failing and 1% chance of suceeding.
Just pointing that out. I just bought another 1 btc personally.

I think this is good news but it may be better to provide the 100 dollars to each student in a staggered format. Instead of 100 lump sum maybe 2 payments of $50, 1 at the beginning of the semester and 1 at the middle or at the start of next semester. Or 4 payments of $25. This would also protect students from getting hit hard by a large drop in price by dollar cost averaging it for them.

That is huge. A few people on Wall Street are trying to get in early

I had an idea about preventing 51% attacks. Not sure all the technical details so could be off base... but from my understanding ghash would appear to be get closer and closer to 51% until it decided to execute the attack. When it executed the attack, it would be mining it's own separate blockchain so it's hashing power would disappear from the visible bitcoin system. (Somebody please correct if that is incorrect)
That dropoff would be very noticeable and a warning could be put out to point of sale systems or maybe just a general alert on blockchain, coinbase, etc that a 51% attack may be occurring. Benevolent unknowing miners on ghash would be able to redirect their mining once they see this. Any large transactions($1 million plus)that are in danger of being reversed would realize that there may be an attack and could wait out making the transfer or transfer in sequential smaller transactions until ghash came back online and dropped back below 51%.

Haha no worries. Thanks for the tip!

Pretty interesting discussion. More surprising is Steve Forbes is the one conducting the interview.

Why would anyone use an inflationary currency with bitcoin around?
If you had to pick between 2 cryptocurrencies, everything else being equal but one is inflationary at the whim of a central bank and the other has a predefined monetary base(21miillion) you would pick the deflationary one for storing value.
Only if the US outlawed bitcoin and imposed UScoin this might work. And even that isn't guaranteed.
