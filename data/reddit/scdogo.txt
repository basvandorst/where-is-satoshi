You keep saying this to people, and it is dangerous advice.  The very IRS page you provided links to [IRS Notice 2014-21]( which in A-6 states:  
"If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain."  
As cryptos are seen as property, a crypto-to-crypto trade would fall under this guidance.  If you buy bitcoin and immediately convert to an altcoin, your barter (because that's what the IRS sees this as) price should match your cost basis, so no taxes, but it you are trading back and forth for gain, you pay taxes on the gains relative to USD on every trade.

Once upon a time when someone new heard of or got interested in crypto/bitcoin, the first suggestion and advice was to read the white paper.  It was expected that everyone in the sphere at least have a basic high level understanding of how everything works.  Nowadays it feels like more like than anything else.

Top chart is the price over time.  Rather than use a line, it is displayed as candles showing what happened in 5 minute (in this case) intervals and is known as a "candlestick chart".  The bar portion of each candle - the body - is bounded by the open and close value for that period.  The line portion - the wick - denotes the high/low value for the period.  The color denotes whether it closed higher or lower than it opened, green for higher, red for lower.  The grey lines on the bottom of the top chart show volume during that period.  
  
The bottom chart shows market depth - the number of buy/sell orders currently on the books - over a price range.  The vertical portions circled are referred to as "walls", specifically sell walls in this case.  They show that there are a lot of BTC currently on the books for sale at 19.9k and 20k.  For the price to go above 20k, people placing market buys will need to chew through those wall, or the people who have orders adding to the walls need to pull them down by canceling.  There can also be walls on the green side referred to as buy walls, lots of people with buy orders at certain price points.  
  
In both directions walls provide resistance to the price going past them, as once buyers/sellers start digging into them others tend to add to them to take maximum profit in case the pressure can't break through.  If there is enough momentum to break through the wall you tend to see a large jump in that direction as there is less resistance just past it and still generally plenty of momentum.

Incorporating in Wyoming isn't odd at all, as it is known as more of a corporate haven, along with Nevada and Delaware.  Low incorporating costs and recurring fees and strong corporate protections.  Wyoming in particular has very low registration and annual fees.

This is the way I see it if adoption really does take off (nobody kid themselves into thinking we have seen jack for mass adoption):
A business may prefer to accept btc over card/cash for reduced fees/expenses.  These come in the way of transaction fees, chargebacks, fraud, and various costs of cash.  
To entice their customers to use btc over traditional currencies they may pass some of these savings on in the form of discounts on goods.  
You as the consumer like to save money, so choose to use btc over cash/card.  
If the business is smart, they could pass on the entirety of the savings they get from using btc on to the buyer, thus maintaining the same margin as before, but beating the market price compared to other payment methods, possibly gaining more market share in the process.

I gave a presentation on bitcoins to a bunch of computer security undergrads back in April and told them during my talk that I would give some coins to anyone interested who saw me after the class.  I had a bunch of paper wallets loaded up with .05BTC (~ 5 USD at the time) and not a single student took me up on the offer.  When I asked a couple of them after the April burst why they didn't take the free money, the most common response was that they knew it would crash and fail and wasn't worth their time.
While it did crash (after more than doubling the value when I offered it, and we all know what happened in the last few months), I was surprised by how little effort they were willing to do to get a gain.  Had I simply given out $5 bills you can bet they would have been all over that.  
Even now they talk about how "lucky" it is that bitcoin has gotten where it has and I'm told at least weekly by someone who took the class that I need to sell before it all falls apart.

Depending on your setup, breakouts may be possible, but in addition certain sophisticated malware will do more interesting things.  For example, if it discovers itself being run in a VM it may perform some completely different operations and logic than it would on a live host system.  This may lead the unwary to think it benign and allow it to be run outside the confines of the VM.

When looking at how much bitcoin is moving, volume in USD is less effective.  On a site like coinmarketcap, however, they are comparing volume between multiple coin types, so having a base unit of comparison is useful (ie 6x more money is moving through the BTC ecosystem than the BCH ecosystem, while the BTC-USD price is currently 9x that of the BCH-USD price).  Several of the charting sites can let you adjust your currency frame of reference (such as the aforementioned cmc) which would show more of what you are looking for.  Note, 144 BTC of 24h volume could be 1 coin bouncing around in every block, with some careful execution and enough fees to make it a priority.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:15:26
In the last 24 hours, transactions with fees &lt;5 sats/byte have been going through.  I would still expect fees to swing up and down for a while until the BCH &lt;-&gt; BTC hash power ping pong settles down, but if you have time to wait, fees are much more manageable.
Now if we can get all the wallets to fix their fee estimators or at least give good info on what is happening in recent blocks so you can make an informed decision . . .

In short, they tend to be more local in scope, and members are shareholders.  This doesn't mean they are always good or better, but they do tend to take a more personalized approach to certain policies and aren't as concerned with increasing the bottom line/stockholder value.

The difference is that you aren't burning the bitcoin, you are spending it.  A more comparable analogy would be if you bought a gallon of gas at $2 and then you traded the gas for a good or service after the price had changed to $3.  You would be expected to claim the capital gains on the $1 increase.
I don't know what the right answer is here, as there really isn't a good category in current law for something like Bitcoin, except for not taxing it at all (not going to happen in US imo).  There will need to be new laws written to cover it, which could go good or bad or neutral for the community.

Most of the people nabbed for unregistered MSBs were buying/selling large amounts places like localbitcoins without registering as MSB (d'uh) or following KYL/AML laws. i.e., sell on localbitcoins 20% above coinbase for cash, restock through coinbase.

I wouldn't say it was safe to say they are lost, though some may be.  I would expect the majority of the higher-value addresses belong to those who were involved early on (think 2009 - Satoshi, AHA, others) who would have other funded addresses to do anything they needed/wanted to and keep the big boys cold.  Large bitcoin ventures will also likely be on the list: DPR, Gox, and AsicMiner for example.

Sure.  Two ways. One: consensus is reached that we need more levels of precision and a hard fork happens (Congratulations, your 1 BTC is now actually 10, and we now have 1/10 sats).
The much more likely two: 2nd layer protocols/networks spin up to where lots of their unit is backed by few of BTCs units, ie 2500 galactic credits are actually 15 satoshis.  Everyone now accepts both BTC and galactic credits.

There are over 500 addresses which individually would make someone a millionaire.  Now take into account that most people use more than one address and there you go.  With the recent price surge there are more bitcoin millionaires than you might imagine.
