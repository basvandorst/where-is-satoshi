Going from 12k to 13k is the same as when it went from 1200 to 1300.

If you are dumb as rocks, then this is your best shot.
All jokes aside, you are right in that borrowing money is a bad idea.  It is also a good idea to diversify your investments.  In that light, you should interpret this article as increase the % of your portfolio that is allocated to BTC according to your risk tolerance.

Yes it looks exponential now, but that is the first part of an S curve which it must eentually be.  At some point it will hit market saturation and taper off.  Just look at the adoption curves of past technologies to see what I mean.

When I adjust price for the mining of new coins and then adjust the price again for the inflation of the dollar, I get exponential growth over linear time.  This chart represents demand, which seems to be exponential at a rate of 10% per month.  If you do the math, since 2012, demand for BTC has never fallen below 10% per month growth.
I don't think this is predictive because an S curve is expected.  So if you think BTC adoption has run its course then expect the growth to taper off, but if you think BTC adoption is just beginning, then expect growth to increase for a period of time before tapering off.  I see BTC going to 10 million before tapering off, but thats my gut opinion and means nothing.

blockchain, not btc, addresses these concerns, but will take some time.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:53:29
Good catch, I hadn't thought of that.  However, if a powerful government felt threatened by BTC, they could certainly fabricate for themselves the hardware they need for about this cost.
All costs together, even if it were billions of dollars, wouldn't be a problem if a powerful enough government actually felt threatened by it.

I don't understand.  If the user base could change the protocol, why couldn't the large entity?
How long would it take for the user base to do this?  Does a fork happen in the meantime?

So be sure when setting up your new wallet that it also doesnt use segwit.  This site may also help.  It saved my ass once!  
EDIT:  lol, i thought u/glurp_glurp_glurp was OP saying it was not a segwit address.  So, yes it does matter as the new wallet you are setting up has to be configured the same as far as segwit is concerned.

I see your point, but I think the entrapment is referred to the buyer sending more than 10k in cash when the sale was supposed to be under 10k (if that becomes relevant in this case).  So then that would induce the seller into performing a crime he was not intending to commit.

He mentioned in the video that he works for the military.

Watch the video.  The feds followed him around for 3 months trying to get this guy.  He is on our side, lives on BTC, has been promoting it for years, and has trained the US military on its use.  He's one of us and needs our support.

In CA, BTC is legal tender.  From my current understanding, the CA law states that only transactions under 10,000 are legal, which is why they agreed to $9,208.62.  But the federal agent sent $14,500 thereby making it illegal.  But this allegation is not for violating the CA statute but rather a federal money laundering crime.

In this hypothetical example, 36 million people are trying to buy more and not selling.  In that case, after each has purchased roughly .5 BTC, there would be no more to buy since they have them all, thus making it impossible.
36 people cant each eat a whole cookie if there are only 21 cookies in the jar.

Please explain how they trade BTC thousands of times a second.
Also, since you ask.  If you look at the Javascript on their dashboard you will see that the trades they claim are happening are random numbers with random delays put in.  If you want to see for yourself, disconnect your internet connection and you will see these "trades" keep going on indefinitely.

There is no charge for the hash oil, thus he has not commited a crime with which to launder money for. Here in the US, we are innocent until proven guilty. They are claiming the selling of BTC is the illegal offense.
The reason this is important for us is that if this man is found guilty, any of us could be arrested for doing something illegal that we have not been found guilty of.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:17:56
It only went to 19k because the financial institutions spent months pumping so that when their futures markets opened they could dump it.  It will happen again.  I expect BTC between 30k and 80k by the end of the year.
Without all this pumping and dumping, the price would be around 7k, which represents baseline (adoption) which has been increasing 9%-19% every month.

time to start over.
The Constitution is **the** document that created this country but people here treat it like a religious manuscript.  Some "believe in it" and some do not.  **It is a fucking legal document, whether you like it or not.**
But, since most people ignore it if it suits them, then its time to get rid of it and start over with a document that is actually binding to the government.

I agree that both paths are way more valid than the one we are currently taking, and I'm open to a good discussion, but a bit off topic here.
But basically, SCOTUS has already ruled that Congress doesnt have to follow the Consitution and can veto parts of it at their leisure.  Then following rulings have given POTUS the same power as Congress.  So with that precedent, its all just theater.
It's all here, but PM me for details if you wish,

Innocent until proven guilty is a very important fundamental right.  A right that is being attacked on many fronts by the US federal government.  They can take your children while you are "innocent" the IRS can fine you until you prove your innocence, and now they can arrest you for selling BTC while legally innocent.

Yes it does.  Except that he plead guilty.  He didn't put up any fight, just laid over for them.  
Maybe it's just me, but I have had enough of this bullying from the federal government and they need to know that I will fight back with every tool that I have.  If they want me, they will have to expend resources to get me.

The government also needs the people's consent.  I don't think a violent fight is necessary if enough people agree and voice their opinion.  But if it is necessary, I have my beans, bullets, and bandaids.  Just waiting for enough others to do the same.

My belief in BTC is greater than my belief in fiat.  I only have fiat because my employer doesnt pay in BTC and many things I want can't be bought with BTC yet.  But I keep most of my savings in BTC.
However, diversification is important, so I do rebalance my portfolio with mutual funds as the value of my btc holdings increases.
