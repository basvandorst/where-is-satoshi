Let's suppose that was true, then it's always the private sector lagging behind the public sector. This way the government gets a discount on everything and the citizens are paying the difference.

Being uncomfortable with the cold/hot ratio is better than being comfortable with not knowing it.  
I'm not promoting Excoin in and of itself. I'm not affiliated with them. They're just the best example of transparency. This way you get to have an informed opinion on how they run their business.  
Bitstamp did not disclose the amount of coins in hot or cold storage. A middle ground is held by Bter which shows their cold wallet adress. Excoin is the only exchange that shows the full breadth of their operations.

This is how Soviet law used to work. Everything that isn't explicitly permitted is by default prohibited. The complete opposite of Western law. 
All countries that used to be under soviet rule still have a residual attitude  like this. It still leads to confusion and miscommunication within European-scale policies and projects.

Exactly. Holding may be great for temporary fiat value but it's doing nothing for Bitcoin's practical value. Buying btc and then buying goods with it from merchants is what will truly grow the value.

We're in a time of increased demand for professional and transparent exchanges. Every compromise, leak or deficiency is a blemish on crypto and weakens trust.

Simply holding doesn't contribute to  the usability of Bitcoin.   
Value isn't like energy. It can be made and it can be destroyed. Just because the total cap of a coin is worth a certain amount of money doesn't mean that the coin in it's entirety can be exchanged for that amount of money.  If tomorrow everyone decides never to buy Bitcoin ever again then the holders are holding no more value. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:20:22
Everyone is winging their job and hoping that everyone around them is competent enough for nobody to notice.  
That's why you get default swaps being bought without being checked. Professionals assume that everyone else was competent enough to check for flaws.  
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:50:15
It will only push the price. Temporarily. For Bitcoin to grow they'll need to be send through the economy. That's when the coin becomes more spendable and that's when it's inherent value increases.  
The market cap of a commodity is only as meaningful as the trading volume that supports it. A high market cap without trading volume is a mirage.

Agreed. It's still not enough and it can be inaccurate. There's a long way to go towards full transparency. It's still a step though, and it's a step that other exchanges aren't taking.

Just because information can be manipulated doesn't mean that exchanges don't have to bother revealing it.  
Banderbill pointed out that the presented data can be fudged if a third party isn't vouching for it.   
With that in place it's the mos transparent way for an exchange to disclose how they operate. It's public and real-time rather than some rough estimate in the FAQ section.

Bitcoin is more volatile as a currency because it has only a fraction of the market cap that other major currencies have. This means that it doesn't take a lot of money to fluctuate the price. That's why you're seeing the price bounce around.

Definitely. However, 'Tegenlicht' (the TV network) is one of the most politically engaged of all the Dutch networks (I'm sure many Bitcoin fans would love it's content) . They mostly want to show the potency of Bitcoin and get new people to make their first wallet.  
Some nerd will probably sweep the money right away. But making it a more difficult game for nerds would also turn off a larger group of people from even trying it.
