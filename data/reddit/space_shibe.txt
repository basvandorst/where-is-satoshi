Just FYI, they've reduced their fees to 0,75% today.

It shows that it's possible to have a sense of humour even when being serious :)
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:30:07
I'll add some to that, if you don't mind.

Let's not fight within our ranks, we're in this grand economical experiment together!

When they'll sell them, it will be because they have found ways to make more powerful miners, so their farms will be just as big and even more efficient - they'll still control a big percentage of the network.

Gee, thanks! :D
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:13:30
Gridcoin does that.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:43:41
Oh, I see.  
But if the username automatically appears because of a cookie, could a phishing site use it?
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:12:26
Peercoin gives the best of both world - PoW's fair distribution, and an increasing amount of contribution by PoS over time.

His karma must be bad though.
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:52:28
But if you login to a phishing site and it doesn't send you the 2fa message to your e-mail or phone before you write your password, that should raise a big red flag.
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:41:11
Such generosity! :D

Thanks for the links!
I've registered and checked history, but it marks your tip as failed. Any idea why?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:16:04
That's my first tip! (Joined reddit today :) )
Much thanks kind shibe!
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:04:46
Yes indeed, but blockchain.info should send you the 2FA message **before** you write your password, as soon as they write your username (which is instantaneously if you have cookies enabled). So if 2fa is enabled, you should wait before you get the 2fa code before you write your password, this makes phishing attacks quite hard to pull off.

I feel like an illegal alien accepting this on but still, much thanks :)
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:41:08
This is amazing. Be sure I'll also donate to others! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:13:53
Those who don't feel this way, are probably those that are in this just for easy profits. I'm quite fine with them not taking us seriously ;)
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:54:46
It's the Juice-media Rap News donation address, you may tip them on my behalf :D
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:11:46
Exactly: they don't like debit cards because the fees are too high for the typical 2$ orders clients make. Transactions with cryptocurrencies solve that problem.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:48:13
These numbers do not mean much, because of the unequal time frame. The 1000 tips with DogeTipBot may have happened today, while it could have taken a week for those of BitcoinTip or ChangeTip to accumulate.  
This do prove that the average tip is bigger when in Bitcoins, but the other infos make the graph misleading.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:11:38
The long-term solution is to gradually eliminate mining in favour of PoS - as in Peercoin.

Their system is better, that's what counts.
