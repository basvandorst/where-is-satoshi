For the company, bitcoin is better because of 1) no fraud and no chargebacks. Fraud and chargebacks are becoming a large issue, with millions of credit cards getting stolen everyday. 2) lower commissions
For the customer it's better because 1) Companies can offer discounts, because they save money as described above 2) No need to share your personal info with the company (companies need it to fight fraud). This can be important in privacy sensitive applications (porn, healthcare etc). 3) most of world's population don't have credit cards.

Yes, there is a $10,000 reporting threshold. Any transaction above that must be reported to the gov. (And not only banks - any merchant, for example car dealer, must report any cash transaction above $10k). But the threshold is set not because gov wants to protect our privacy. It's only because gov can't process too many transactions, it's computer systems are not built for that yet. 
But inevitably this threshold will go down. Soon the case will be made that someone bought a bag of fertilizer for $100 to make a bomb, so the new threshold will be set to $100. Cash will be gradually prohibited, so all information about every transaction will flow to gov computers. It'll make law enforcement so much easier, and very few will complain.

So when calculating bitcoin valuation, we should take into account our tolerance to this kind of risk. Say, we estimate the probability of this event at some point in the future at 10%. This gives us a bitcoin price estimate: $20M/12M * 10= $16/BTC. And keep in mind that probability sharply increases as bitcoin price appreciates.

One step at a time. Nearly all businesses that "accept bitcoin" today, convert them to USD immediately. But, if by chance one of that business suppliers happen to accept bitcoin, they can pay them without converting to fiat, and save some fees. If one of their employees happen to possess a Xapo card, they can pay her in bitcoin. If a Xapo owner stumbles on a bitcoin business, she can pay them directly from her Xapo account.

For example, you want to buy something but don't want to "register" and send your information to the merchant. With credit cards, merchant must know your information because of rampant CC fraud. But you may not want to send that info to the merchant because you are buying pr0n, gambling, or just concerned about your information getting stolen from merchant's computers.
Furthermore, merchant is sure your transaction will never be reversed, and thanks to this, he can give you a discount.
Furthemore, very few people worldwide can open a merchant account and start accepting credit cards. 
Everyone can accept bitcoin, however. So the amount of merchants should grow, and prices of goods and services should go down.

To pay with credit card
* 1) swipe the card
To pay with bitcoin:
* 1) Buy a dedicated laptop
* 2) Remove ethernet chip, bluetooth, wifi and any other means of communication from said laptop
* 3) Install a hardened version of Linux on said laptop
* 4) Acquire Master's level degree in Computer Security 
* 5) Carefully follow the guides to create a 2-of-3 paper wallet 
    One small mistake and all your life savings are gone.
* 6) Rent 3 safe-deposit boxes in separate regions of the world and store your paper wallets there.
* 7) When you want to spend (that step shouldn't happen, why would you want to spend coins that will cost   $1M in near future?), create a transaction on said offline laptop
* 8) Print said transactions using a dedicated printer to a QR code
* 9) Import said QR code into unsafe online computer and send to the merchant.
* 10) Bitcoin price has fallen 10% since you started the process, so merchant asks for more bitcoins. Return to step 7.

Increasing block size is not a viable long term solution. Moore law has its limits. For example, CPU frequencies today are even lower than they were 10 years ago. Today's average processor (ARM) is LESS powerful than an average processor 10 years ago (Pentium IV). Prevalent Ethernet speed of 100MBit/sec is same as 20 years ago. Ping times have barely improved at all, and here we already hit a HARD physical limit - ping times are limited by speed of light.

If you mean it has never been proven mathematically that bitcoin is unbreakable, this is true. But whoever cracks that, basically could steal all the money in the world, so bitcoin is unlikely to become first target ...

the only reason taxes are paid in usd is because btc didn't exist when irs was created. Nothing sacred about usd. Before fiat was invented, gov collected taxes in bushels of grain, cows, gold, peasants etc. Irs will be happy to collect btc, easier to track etc. And government officials would love to take bribes in anonymous currency.

Let's not talk about heroin, cocain etc. I need a drug called capoten to take daily. This drug costs $2 in India for a month's supply. In the US, you must pay $184 for it! $100 minimum to visit a "doctor" to get a prescription, and $84 for a month's supply. Buying that drug directly from India is a punishable offense. Now you understand how pharmaceutical industry benefits? Now you understand how 0.1% make their fortune?

That's BS. I'm sure Walgreens buys those pills in India for $2, and adds 4200% markup. They are able to do so because "healthcare" lobby succeeded to pass all those laws "protecting" me from purchasing drugs directly. Same thing happens in telecom - they lobbied for laws "protecting" us from independent providers and as a result internet is 43 times more expensive here than in Romania (

And they say Microsoft is evil ... did Microsoft ever ban any Windows application (I'm talking about good old EXE applicaitons) ? No. Was any Windows exe developer ever required to ask for permission or approval from Microsoft? No.
Even evil Steve Ballmer couldn't imagine that you can create a prison for applications (Apple app store), and the users and developers would happily give up their liberties for a small bowl of convenience.

Every mail you ever stored in Gmail, every character you ever typed into Chrome, every word you ever searched on G$$gle and everything you do on any page that has G$$gle ads or analytics on it, is stored forever on G$$gle servers, waiting to be scanned by hackers, G$$gle employees, or whatever government we will have in 50 years from now. Just think how scary it is.

People are risk averse, and for a good reason. If $1M you saved for retirement turns into $2M, it would be nice but not a really big difference. If however, it turns to $0M, and you will die in the poor house drenched in your shit and vomit, it's a hell of a difference.

This has nothing to do with safety, this is purely about payments. He provided a button to donate in bitcoins, thus bypassing g$$gle payment mechanism, and limiting g$$gle's ability to spy on you (to pay through g$$gle store you must surrender your credit card etc details to g$$gle. After you do so, your identity is firmly linked to the bitcoins in your wallet).

not so simple.
First, you should declare how much excatly is in all your wallets.
If you mined BTC or traded something for it, this is income and you owe your maximum tax. If you bought it for investment, you should prove that to IRS. Try to get form 1099 from mtgox or bitchina LOL.

This is still uncharted waters. I think it will be treated similar to foreign bank accounts. You must declare every account even if it pays no interest income, and you have $1 in the account.
