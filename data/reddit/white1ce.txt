I didn't make anything using coinbase and still got the letter.

Money transmitter to evade coinbase detections? How about "giving bitcoin to friends so they can check it out" instead? What exactly do people do with bitcoin once they buy it from coinbase? Am I the only one that transfers it out of coinbase, or should I just leave it in my wallet at coinbase?

It was probably more like $600 back then. Again, this was 7 months ago. I buy between 1-3 times a month. If you are asking me what I did 20+ transactions ago, no, I have no clue.

I have no clue, that is the only thing that they told me. When I told them I have no clue what a transaction 7 months ago was for they just sent their generic "you're banned" message. I re-iterate though, I definitely did not buy any sort of drugs online, so either the person I sent those coins bought them or their "evidence" is just bullshit.

I hang on to some and I sell to friends that have gotten into BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-24 05:33:52
Because I didn't do a damn thing. If I sold some BTC to someone to gives it to someone who maybe buys drugs with it, why do I get fucked?

I had no other BTC in my coinbase account at the time, when I buy it, I send it to a different wallet so I can't confirm whether or not I would be able to withdraw from my coinbase wallet. 
It's in one of the pictures, but they ask me about a transaction to some random address from 7 months ago. It seems strange to get confronted about this 7 months after the fact, and how do they even know that that address either was selling cannabis/cannabis seeds or did the person who received the BTC at that address then purchase cannabis from somewhere else?

The last part is the part that I think is fucked up. I know I didn't send it for cannabis (I live in Denver, if I want weed I can walk down the street). So that means that either their "evidence" is just plain wrong OR that the person I sent it to then spent it on drugs which flags me. I hope it's just the fact that their evidence is all fucked up and not the latter.

Sure, I understand, but I have no point in lying to random people on the internet. I live in Denver, if I want weed I can walk down the block.

I transferred directly from coins that I bought on coinbase to that address, no hopping around. I am not sure if his address was a new address or not.

Holy shit, do you work for coinbase? Sending 1.34 btc to someone does not mean constant. Can you recall every single transaction with your debit or credit card for the month of May (7 months ago) with no other identifying factors besides a bunch of random numbers and letters?
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:29:30
I do. It isn't exactly the easiest thing in the world to setup, let alone it takes a lot of time to actually get your BTC. I've been verified for a long time so I could buy $1,000 instant.

It was another person, not a company.

Nothing more I can do, their last e-mail is essentially the middle finger.

I really like Gemini. Never had an issue with them.
