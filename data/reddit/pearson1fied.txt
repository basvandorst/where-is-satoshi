Great idea;)

I mean - that's local business. You pay me via internet and after that you come back for your apple's. Main idea is to promote Bitcoin and sell my apples because i have lot of apples and i don't have enough storage where to store them. Payment processor is Bitpay.

I'm ordinary man:) I don't own business company and so on. I just wanna make some fun and earn some extra BTC. Nothing big at this moment. Maybe later i will sell different things.

@_date: 2014-08-08 10:32:48
It's innovative idea how to sell something. I want give people innovative way how to buy something using Bitcoin. I live in Latvia, Europe and people do not know very much about Bitcoin.

Go find yourself a girlfriend - troll :) 
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:19:47
Ok and Amazon EC2?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:09:10
It's easy to setup! But my vote goes for Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:11:19
I'm using my BTC miners on Slushpool.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:43:24
Nope :/ Ok I created Bitcoin Core node on my PC + created bitcoin.conf file - prune=1000
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:45:42
Guys how can I launch Bitcoin core full node (pruning node) using VPS ? Using Ubuntu??
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:36:49
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:20:15
I already have 1 node... but i'm using pruning mode.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:36:57
I have disk space issue ;/ i have only 120 GB on my old dual core PC.
I have 2 USB Antminers and 2 Gridseed BTC miners.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:00:20
Thank you  - very useful information. 	&amp;
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:19:46
Thanks! Very helpful post. I'm now mining at Slushpool.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:22:36
Okay. But how? Can you show me?? I'm using Windows 10 on my old PC. I have 4GB and 120 GB free space.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:40:59
Ok but how can I signal for Segwit?? I have 2 BTC miners..
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:33:03
Never ever? 
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:23:24
Great news. Good for Greece. Maybe you could also deploy first Bitcoin ATM in Riga, Latvia?
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:11:20
Some people like me we do not have old laptop or old PC tower. That's why VPS is cheaper option.
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:14:09
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:09:52
reinstall your VPS node
and this time use  sudo apt-get install bitcoind. I updated this tutorial.
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:13:32
Hmm because why not? 
@_date: 2015-11-18 19:50:45
Use amazon.co.uk wishlists. I was the same question - see more: 
@_date: 2015-11-12 12:57:19
Oh I see...I use Gmail. Purse.io looks very great service. If I could use it I def will buy some stuff from amazon.co.uk - some items amazon.co.uk sending to Eastern Europe. I mean Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:48:34
Is it available for Eastern europe residents??
