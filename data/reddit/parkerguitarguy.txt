That number is changing, and is in decline.  A couple days ago it was apparently a $9/day profit for a 1080 Ti.  
I agree.  People that go strictly by the numbers on these online profitability calculators are in for a rude surprise.
The more people that get in, the less profit you can expect as competition increases and difficulty factor gets adjusted to the increased hash rate.

I guess the takeaway here is that the taxation guidelines around crypto trades have been around for years, and the expectation to comply has been around for years too, even if you didn’t know about them until recently.  Ignorance of the law doesn’t exempt anyone from it.  Before going into something this unusual, it’s best to contemplate any way it could come back to bite you.  If you want to trade big and don’t think you can produce the capital to pay your dues, you ought not do it.  This sounds harsh, and I dislike these taxation rules as much as the next guy, but you really don’t want heat from the IRS.  Take this tough love advice as an opportunity to avoid the real punches from Big Brother.

It would take an initial supply to create sell pressure.  They would have had to stock up.  Remember that run we had to like $19k that happened within about 20 min?  For the weeks following that, a massive sell wall went up, which would allow one to accumulate further without driving the price up since natural sellers are forced to sell at lower prices.
They would have to deal with the temporary rise in price as they get their hands on a lot of BTC.  Also, they can side-step the buying market some thanks to NiceHash, which incidentally has been very seemingly lucrative for miners over the last few weeks.  Notice the huge GPU shortage and price gouging.
I agree that this kind of manipulation should get somebody like that in a lot of trouble, but good luck proving it.

You are probably right - there might be some regulations that encourage that behavior.  My thoughts are:
NiceHash lost millions of dollars worth of BTC.  I'm betting they had one or a few monolithic wallets, and somebody might have decided that a lot of damage could have been mitigated had the funds been spread out.  One compromised private key wouldn't cost them the entire lot.  If NiceHash is using Coinbase's newly launched Custody for Institution services, they might have made separation of funds a requirement as part of their arrangement.
Also, from the standpoint of taxes, it could get really messy with the newly clarified strict rules around FIFO that Trump's tax plan introduces (this used to be grey).  If all the BTC is in one wallet, you can't truly differentiate one coin from another.  You can on paper, but the IRS may decide that the wallet is one pot of money and somebody owes them several years worth of gains, when a newcomer buys and immediately follows the common advice of transferring off exchange (last in last out).  Keeping separate wallets may be the only protection against that, unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:32:43
I have tested the waters myself and can say that the withdrawal is instantaneous.  You tell NiceHash your email address for your Coinbase account and less than a second later you get emails from NiceHash indicating the withdrawal and another from Coinbase indicating an incoming payment.  My balance is increased before I can even pull up my Coinbase app to check - clearly much faster than the block times.  
It looks to me like Coinbase is basically storing NiceHash coins for them, so that leaves me wondering if Coinbase just updates people's balances as it appears (as you suggest), or if they are actually moving the underlying BTC to varying addresses.  I'm willing to bet they are transferring those totals around to wallets they control on the back end, which would probably explain a lot of that volume.
The NiceHash free withdrawal is a fairly recent addition and their availability/lack thereof in recent weeks could correlate with mem pool issues.

You are probably asking for trouble using filters and taking shortcuts.  You are going to want to track every single trade.  In an audit, the responsibility is entirely on you to show cost basis for each trade.  They won’t prove that for you.  It suits them better to assume $0 cost basis for each trade, which you definitely don’t want.

Hundreds of billions of dollars have been flowing into altcoin markets over the past few weeks driving prices up, and this has caused an increase of profitability in GPU mining.  People are running the numbers and seeing that GPUs can potentially pay for themselves in 4 to 6 months and are buying them by the dozens and even hundreds.  A single 1080Ti can  bring in $8/day ($243/mo or $2920/year).  Having 4 or more rigs would bring in income as if you had another full-time job.  Passive income is a very attractive concept.

I'm with you here.  It would be far from trivial if Bitcoin developers were to attempt to integrate the privacy features upon which XMR is built.  Even if they managed to, the coin would be so alien compared to its original spec that it might lose the confidence that BTC has built over the years.  I just don't see that level of privacy being achieved in the foreseeable future.

Everything you describe is inconvenience that the general public is not going to endure.  If we fast forward to a time when places like Amazon, Kroger, gas stations, etc all take BTC, people are going to expect their coins to be taken anywhere that accepts Bitcoin.  Suppose you are standing in line at Kroger and your payment is rejected because "oh these have been flagged as stolen Mt Gox coins".  Are you going to go buy meat from the gray market guy instead?  What of the time you just spent shopping?  Are you going to walk away and do it all again 10 miles down the road, or are you going to resort to paying with an actually fungible currency?
If you are driving along and the gas light comes on, then you go to prepay with BTC and it gets rejected, are you going to drive around looking for somebody else to accept it?  How is that not an issue even if you do manage to find someone who will take it?  Do you think the general public are going to consistently go out of their way or are they going to conclude that the money is not reliable and go with something that is?
It doesn't matter how many times I think a coin has to be tumbled before considered legit.  What matters is whether they are accepted.  All it takes is one vendor rejecting it on grounds of its history to affect the fungibility of the coin.  Even if it's only 1/10 times that it gets rejected, that still really sucks and people with the option of paying with fiat are going to say "screw this".  If my credit card gets rejected 1 out of every 50 times I swipe it even though it should go through, I'm gonna say fix it or I'm not using this anymore.
I'll ask you the same thing I asked further up the thread: would you swap your clean coins right now for some of the stolen Binance coins that are being tweeted by the Whale Alert?  I wouldn't.  Regardless of your answer, my response alone implies 1 BTC may not equal 1 BTC.  That is issue and not everyone is willing to sweep it under the rug.
Finally, yes if a mining pool owner agrees to help launder money, block chain analysts could one day flag that as known laundered money.

If somebody has 5,000 BTC and sells them all at once at market price, the spot price starts diving down and triggers stop losses.  With stop losses, those BTC are not really up for sale until the price drops enough that it reaches that point where the person would not want to be any further under water.  With stop losses people are often selling their BTC at a loss automatically but they are preventing further loss.
Stop losses can trigger a chain reaction, where they are selling ASAP at market price, causing the price to drop further, and that can trigger other stop losses.  The person dumping 5,000 BTC can then buy up 5,000 of basically panic sold BTC for hundreds of dollars cheaper within the span of a few minutes.  The result: a balance of 5,000 BTC + tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even 6+ figures.
Rinse and repeat until real market demand rejects it back up.  It makes rich people richer pretty fast, and it's also a pretty good test of how overbought BTC is.

It probably doesn't help that NiceHash has returned and offers free withdrawal to a Coinbase account.  Their minimum payout for mining is .001 BTC when using their wallet, which is quite low.  You look at the GPU shortage and can confidently say that hundreds of thousands of people can reach that mark daily and will be contributing to the high volume.

Obviously I cannot back this with hard evidence, but my gut says it's going to require a march past the $20K line to get widespread FOMO started.  Like, a commanding break through whatever resistance there is at $20K, and hold a solid $21000 or so for a couple days or weeks.  It needs to look convincing that reaching previous ATH won't amount to just a quick wick from big money pump and dump.  People would need to get the feeling that $20K is the new floor, and they would have to be pretty convinced that there are huge gains to be had from there.
Honestly, despite the good gains and momentum we have seen over the last few months, it doesn't really look to me like the general population sees the current price as a good buy for big gains.  The read I am getting is that most people looking to get rich quick want 10x gains or more (maybe even 100x), and I'm just not sure most of those folks think it's going up 10x from here.  Perhaps from $4K or $8k, but I think notions of a 6 figure BTC in the next year or 2 are still getting dismissed pretty quickly.
At the least, we need to get past the idea that 2017 was an accident caused by Tether.

True of many, but I'm keeping my privacy coins.  You have seen how those stolen Binance coins are being tracked.  Would you trade your clean coins for tainted BTC that will likely get rejected by exchanges and merchants?  If the answer is no, then there is a fungibility problem.  1 BTC does not always equal 1 BTC, and that's not good.  Fungibility is a necessary attribute of money.  Opt-in coin mixing is not good enough either.  Mandatory privacy is the way forward, and it is unlikely that BTC will implement that anytime soon.

I agree.  Back in May, Brian Kelly said he had some discussions with miners, and they told Kelly they had sold enough to cover operating expenses for about a year and miners then began hoarding.  With reduced sell pressure from miners, we saw a steady climb in price in the following months.
[ 
Filb Filb recently said that he witnessed 12.5 BTC sell orders (consistent with mining rewards) during the bear market, a pause during this last run up, and a return at $13K.  
[ 
So my response to "what's wrong with these people?": I'd emphasize that miners are different than hodlers in that they have to sell some as they go to cover their operational costs.  With that last run up, there was a great opportunity to see future production costs covered, further easing the transition to the block reward halving next year.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:27:23
Digging and learning more is never a bad idea.  Cryptocurrency is really useful tech that isn't going to just go away, and I think it doesn't need to usurp fiat altogether to have a place in this world.  One of the first steps might be to just go with something like Cash App and buy $1, $5, $10 worth - something you really wouldn't lose any sleep over if something happened.  It doesn't have to be hundreds or thousands of dollars worth.
It used to be that you could buy and sell BTC in Cash App, and could transfer BTC out to an external wallet, but you couldn't transfer BTC to Cash App to sell.  Now they are adding the ability to transfer in, so it functions more like a wallet on Coinbase.  You could store it there for a while if you wanted to, and you can take some time researching and playing with the various wallets, learn concepts for cold storage, look at things like the Ledger or Trezor, and decide for yourself how you would store and handle it long term.  General advice is to not leave a lot of coins on an exchange, but I'm not sure I'd be too concerned over a couple of dollars worth while getting my feet wet.
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:19:27
Eek, you're right.  It looked like this right before the last big push to $13.8K.  I'd really rather this thing wait until $20K before going really parabolic.  If this thing goes way up, then crashes, I think it would be better for long term confidence if the next bear market bottom is higher than $20K, just like the last one didn't dip down to $1K.  We are close enough to $20K that I think it would be better to approach it steadily.

Coinjoin is opt-in.  Not good enough.  You go from having one sucker with dirty money to a handful of suckers who opted to have their coins tainted, among a sea of otherwise assumed clean coins.  Unless everyone is doing it, that doesn't really help you much.  You can't really enforce that with Bitcoin in its current state.  I think it would be too jarring to try to change Bitcoin that much, so it makes sense for something like that to coexist as its own solution.
You're still basically saying "make it somebody else's problem".  That's not a long term solution to this problem.  Short term, sure you might find a fledgling exchange that hasn't had authorities bearing down on them yet over KYC/AML, or an uninformed individual to whom you can pass the hot potato.  Long term, how many people and exchanges are going to get burned by this before the general public becomes more aware and vigilant?  Your options are only going to run thinner over time.
We used to have [Shapeshift.io]( as a way of anonymously swapping BTC for privacy coins, without the need for creating an account and jumping through KYC/AML hoops.  Yeah, that didn't last long.

I have heard that a lot of miners are hoarding their newly mined coins, and that they sold enough to cover their operational costs for the next year or so.  If enough of them are doing that, that could iron out a lot of that market shock everybody is banking on for their gains.
I would love a run up as much as any other hodler, but we need to make sure we are ready to accept the outcome where the halving doesn't cause a parabolic upward movement.  These comments are sounding less and less like "it might run up" and a lot more like "it will run up".

It sounds like your logic is: "Why would the average Joe have better cyber security prowess than potentially a team of cyber security professionals that Coinbase might hire?".  I think what they are getting at though is this: 
If coins from tens of thousands of customers are in one party's custody, there is one big bank vault to go after.  Somebody trying to maliciously hack Coinbase is expending the time and effort to go after something that is known to have a huge reward for success.  Part of the hacking process is identifying the specific devices and software and their exact versions that you would like to exploit, and even that takes time.  People have to weigh their time against what they think they might be going after.  There would have to be some sort of risk vs reward assessment.  
I personally wouldn't bother expending days and weeks of my time fingerprinting some target that appears to be somebody's home internet connection, where they may or may not have any coins, and where the spoils might only be a 0.0001 BTC if they do happen to have coins.  If the average Joe properly encrypts all information that could be used to control the funds (wallet files, private keys, recovery seeds, etc) with strong encryption standards and passwords/keys, then it's unreasonably difficult to bother.

I agree that another wave will come eventually.  The rising Bitcoin dominance is really setting the stage for it IMO.  The last bull market was driven by retail investors that wanted 100x or 1000x gains, and they threw their money at small cap alts.  They were looking to get in on the ground floor of the next Bitcoin.  Here we are, draining the market cap on tons of projects and making it once again feasible to boom by those factors.  People are selling out of reaction to the rising Bitcoin dominance; what will the reaction be if we start to see what looks like a reversal of that trend?

I don't have an answer for that (well, actually I guess my answer seems to be to have BTC and privacy coins since that's what I continue to hold).  I still think Bitcoin is fan-freaking-tastic and I am satisfied with my BTC position.  In response to anyone advising me to dump my altcoins, I'm okay with keeping a position in my privacy coins at the expense that my still great gains are not as high as they could be in this particular year.  There is no perfect software, and Bitcoin is no exception.  I think there is a legitimate case for privacy outside of illicit activity, and I think it's fair to say that fungibility is where Bitcoin currently needs work.  I'm objectively stating the current drawbacks of the tech and why I value privacy coins long term even if the market currently disagrees with me.

I am not expecting protocol-level mandatory privacy (and true fungibility) to be integrated into BTC in my lifetime, honestly.  You saw the rift that it caused when the community couldn't decide on whether or not to increase block size.  Currencies like XMR are not really copy-paste of Bitcoin's code - it's practically a re-write.  Trying to get that kind of functionality into Bitcoin would change it drastically from what it is, and right now Bitcoin is relying a lot on the confidence in the product it is right now and has been for years.  That's really too much change, and while there is a lot of animosity toward altcoins, there is some merit in letting certain projects coexist with BTC.

So, in May we have some evidence that miners stopped selling and we watched the price rise from $8K on up to $13K over the next couple months.  Filb Filb suggests that 12.5 BTC sell orders ceased during the run up and resumed at $13K, and we have been seeing downward trend since that peak.
If the price increases we have seen over the last few months are largely due to a reduction in miner sell pressure, then we are already getting much of the big gains from limited supply.

I think down the road, once you are the sucker holding tainted coins, you're going to have a hell of a time finding an exchange that will accept them long enough to shift over to the privacy coin.  It's not a problem until it is.  What happens when you think your coins are safe, then authorities bust some human trafficking, drugs, or child porn operation and it is discovered that your BTC had some involvement in all of that about 5 years before you got a hold of them?  Now they're tainted and you are stuck with them.
For me, I want a continual balance but I also want to use them.  If we ever get rid of these asinine tax laws where you have to report capital gains/losses over every transaction, and perhaps get a relief or something where you don't have to report for transactions under $100 or $500, then I'm planning to use this like actual money.  It's not always about HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:44:09
I expect a lot of re-balanced portfolios.  Alts will do a lot of shifting with a slight dip on BTC temporarily.  People will delay a few more days to avoid those liabilities on 1500% gains this year (defer to next year).  I think Coinbase ruling will change the statistic on how many people report gains.

I picture the fungibility problem really biting people several decades from now, perhaps even a century or more from now, but if we are touting cryptocurrency as the way forward then we kind of have to think about what this really looks like after it's been in play for some time.
To answer your question, unless you mined the coins and they are straight from the mint, I think there is some tiny risk of not being able to cash out but I don't think that blockchain analysis is far along enough that it matters for the next 10 to 20 years for most people's holdings.  If my holdings became life changing but I couldn't transact with it directly, I would just simply hope for the best that exchanges accept it.  To hedge my bet, I just don't put all my money in BTC - some of it went into my privacy coin of choice and there it will remain.  If I turned out to be holding dirty BTC, then that sucks and I'm going to be jumping through hoops trying to get around it, but at least my entire crypto holdings are not troublesome.  My favorite coin has a direct USD pair on Kraken, so there is still a direct on/off ramp.  (I'm trying not to actually name my favorite for fear of coming across as a shill).
I think the only advice I have for a hodler right now concerned about this exact problem is to try to take whatever steps you can to make sure the coins you have were obtained from as reputable a source as possible.  Don't buy them from LocalBitcoins, new exchanges with relaxed rules, etc.  If you have to jump through a bunch of KYC/AML hoops with an exchange before you buy, maybe that's not a bad thing if it's Bitcoin.  Maybe they stand the best chance that they are properly separating coins in wallets on the back end and could potentially provide you with the addresses used so that you can check the history for yourself.

No, I prefer people in positions of power to see exactly what is right in front of them.  This has been unleashed into the world and that cannot be undone now.
People should have a right to choose to put their money to good, ethical use.  Should any government, the United States included, stand in the way of that right through censorship or unethical legislation, people are now given the means to take the high road.  
Cryptocurrency takes away some power that only the government had.  They must now do what they can to embrace and adapt.  Burying heads in the sand is no solution.

I'll be honest, I have not looked at Dandelion in depth, but in my cursory read over the basics it sounds like it's just more of a way of preventing third parties from identifying you at the time of a transaction by correlating the source IP and details of the transaction like your wallet address.
The issues I see with a completely transparent blockchain are still more severe to me and are not addressed by that kind of network obfuscation.  Transactions really need to be private by default on chain.  Things like Coinjoin aren't good enough.  A coin's involvement in illicit activity could be discovered long after the fact and it could be tainted retrospectively while in the hands of somebody else.  I wouldn't want to be the sucker holding coins that no exchange or merchant will accept because of its known association with drugs, human trafficking, or child porn before I got it.  Opt-in mixed transactions only help if everyone does it.  Otherwise it's just a handful of tainted coins among a sea of assumed clean coins.  1 BTC needs to always equal 1 BTC.
Interestingly, Andreas Antonopoulus agrees with me on mandatory privacy:

Somewhere there is some IRS auditor that will insist that it is an accession to wealth and, even though it is undesired accession, you are still liable.  Let's figure out the email addresses of these people and send them an email indicating their gifted RomeoCoins Public/Private keys and add a little encouragement to report their newfound capital gains with $0 cost basis.

Maybe.  On the other hand, a lot of millionaires got where they are today by driving boring used cars instead of buying brand-new fancy cars that lose a ton of value the moment they are driven off the lot, and choosing wise financial decisions over excessive, frivolous chasing of shiny things.  What if those with the same mentality of needing to have a whole round number of Bitcoins are more consistent with the masses that aren't millionaires because they need things in their life?  Perhaps people with the kind of mentality and self-control it takes to amass millions are going to focus less on the round number and more on the actual value.  If .25 BTC holds a steady $1M, then maybe they'll just buy .25 BTC and acknowledge what it is.

@_date: 2017-12-10 20:15:24
I want to know how this sort of thing is reported in this case.  Does he figure out when it was mined, amend that year tax return, and indicate it as normal income given the fair market value of the coin as of the day it was mined?  Good luck trying to say what that would be.  Then I suppose he would use that as cost basis for when/if he does happen to sell.
One could argue he “found it”, but then he could be instantly liable for some percentage of $1m.  Unless he has a few hundred thousand sitting around, that would force him to sell a bunch of it to cover taxes.  That’s pretty shitty if he would rather hold for a while.  The laws are pretty dickish if that’s the case.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:01:31
I guess that’s a big part of my concern.  How does one identify the fair market value of some quantity of coin from a long time ago?  If OP forgot about it, they probably didn’t note the value when it came in.  Also, who is to say what the fair market value is to begin with?  Every exchange will say something different, and it’s not like the stock market where it closes.  Bitcoin and others are traded 24/7.  This stuff never sleeps!
I ask not only for OP, but for anyone who dabbled many years ago and either forgot or decided to wash their hands of it thinking it all to be basically worthless (until many years later when the price goes so high it makes one dizzy).
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:08:00
Honestly I kind of wish the Bitcoin market would ignore Futures.  If a lot of it will be cash settled, then no Bitcoin is moving and changing hands.  Why should all the fat wallets decide the fair market value when in many cases they aren’t even buying and selling Bitcoin.  Only the contracts settled in Bitcoin should have any bearing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:33:10
I support your method.  I'm doing similar things, but I don't have the hardware wallet (shame on me... I'll order one soon).  I'm thinking the AES encryption on 7zip archives should be plenty strong as long as your password is rock solid.

It’s only decidedly undisciplined because we now have the hindsight that it dipped - a fact that was unavailable to the investor at the time.

@_date: 2019-08-25 21:03:08
You can have personal financial sovereignty and choose to uphold your civic responsibility.  For me it's not so much about whether or not they have a means of finding out I owe something.  Coins like XMR make it so they would have no clue, but I choose to pay what is due with my privacy coins because I believe it's the right thing to do and a basic part of being a responsible citizen and contributing member of society.
That said, having to calculate liability per transaction is asinine and will prevent me from transacting with cryptocurrency for now.  That's too much of a pain in the ass and is very shortsighted legislation.  In the US, the Congressional Blockchain Caucus started to float the idea of not requiring capital gains reporting for transactions under a certain amount, but Trump's tax reform threw all that out the window before it could gain any traction.  I would like to see that get proposed again and I think it will at some point, hopefully in my lifetime.

That's a matter of personal taste, I think.  Given that Coinbase is FDIC insured, I'm not sure I'd lose sleep over anything under 2 BTC.  If you don't intend to take advantage of any kind of bonkers swings in price through trading and are not looking to sell anytime soon, I wouldn't advise against pulling it though provided you have a solid strategy for securing those funds.  If you are not going to use strong encryption to protect it, or invest in a hardware wallet from a reputable source, my unpopular opinion is that Coinbase is probably going to be a better custodian.

I think people are looking for this to reach that $13.8K mark again, because if you try to discern a trend from that recent point in time, it would appear downward.  When we hit $19k, it plummeted, then shot back up pretty convincingly, then ultimately went back down and continued to fall.  Fear that this bull run was a small version of 2017 would not be completely unfounded, just like it's not completely unfounded to believe the price will soar from where it currently is.

It's a method of storing and transferring wealth.  Transfer is only half the picture.  I will agree, however, that using it to pay for things right now is a royal pain in the rear.  In my country, tax laws around it are asinine and having to calculate liabilities per transaction really prohibits its everyday use.  I was hoping the folks behind Libra would have had some politicians in their back pocket that could be pressed to amend the rules - maybe something like "any transactions under $500 are not subject to reporting".  That would at least make transactions do-able while keeping speculative gains on the table for their collection.

Because when you say it was a mistake to use it, that implies that the issues we now know thanks to hindsight were known at the time, that Satoshi knew that directed acyclic graphs could be applied in that manner, and that he chose wrong.  
Many revelations are borne of hindsight.  Bitcoin was chugging along just fine for years powered by blockchain with no data to suggest it was inadequate.  It was the best we had.  The use of DAG in cryptocurrency was an answer to a problem when it was found.
There is no perfect software.  You have to start somewhere and build on it.  Years from now, something even better is going to come along and we're just going to be saying "using a DAG was a mistake".  It's not necessarily a mistake, it was our best shot and we have since found ways to improve.

That's a good point.  I would stress that a proper security strategy should be in place though.  If John Doe who left his keys out in the open gets hacked, those precious coins are gone.

I am assuming US tax laws here.  When you bought at $11,700, there was no taxable event for you because there were no realized gains or losses.  When you sold at $12,000, that was a taxable event because it changed hands and you realized capital gains.  When you buy back at $11,500, that is not a taxable event.  When you transfer to your hardware wallet, regardless of what the exchange calls it (they might indicate that as a trade for CYA purposes), it is not a realized gain because it did not actually change hands, so there is nothing to report on that one.
In short, you have one thing to report in that situation - capital gains with a cost basis of $11,700.

My personal opinion... since they are FDIC insured and all, I would be willing to risk 4 figures in a quick grab.  If you're talking 5 figures or more, or you wish to hold on to it for more than a month or 2, I would be wanting to pull it off the exchange and place it in my own custody, making sure that I have strong security and resiliency in place of course.  
If you plan to go with arguably the most powerful feature of crypto, the ability to store your own wealth, be sure you really do your homework on how to properly safeguard your funds and follow through with your plans.  Unlike a bank, nobody is going to do the due diligence for you - that's entirely on you.  But, that's the cost of true personal financial sovereignty.

I would not put a printed note in a safety deposit box, but I would consider using a safety deposit box as a potential storage facility for a properly encrypted electronic backup copy of the keys.  Some sort of storage media with full disk encryption, and for the paranoid, maybe even some open source and reputable file-level encryption (at least AES 256-bit) on top of that in the event that governments have an unknown backdoor into proprietary solutions like Bitlocker To Go.  Decryption keys should obviously not be stored with the device.

I can't help but feel like we are pissing away an opportunity over a couple extra satoshis.  So many people are listening to the TA guys like Tone Vays and agree that a huge additional pullback is needed simply because "patterns".  Also, people want to accumulate by buying back in lower.  If everyone does this though, the price is gonna go down the shitter.  Seriously.  We can't all do this.  We have so much momentum and that ATH is actually within reach - something we couldn't say for over a year.  We are close to a point where the general public might actually give it some thought again, but if this thing goes back down to 4 figures, I think they're just gonna say "forget it, this looks just like 2017.  I missed the run up and the crash is already underway".  
If you are going to buy, stop saying you will and just do it.  Make up your mind - do you think it's going way up or not?  If it's going to climb way up, are you willing to risk kicking off another year bear market for that "maybe 9%"?

To call it a mistake is just like saying Microsoft was mistaken for not just making Windows 10 from the get-go instead of 3.1, 95, 98, ME, 2k, XP, Vista, 7, and 8.  It's like saying it was a mistake for Google to not go straight to Android Pie 9.0 instead of all of those previous concepts.
There were other attempts at digital currencies before Bitcoin stepped into the scene with the blockchain concept.  I would insist it was a necessary stepping stone just like every other evolutionary step in every other growing technology.  It took the milestone of blockchain to get the cryptocurrency ecosystem to the hype that incentivized people to tweak things and build the first alts.  It took the hype around alts to get better alts.  Talent and expenditure of time and resources deserves compensation, and we got that once a lot of money started flowing into the space.  Many more great minds other than Satoshi entered the arena and contributed new breakthroughs using others' ideas as a springboard.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:28:59
I still think this is coming.  I got ridiculed yesterday for saying we'd test $7400, but there were only about $3M in buy orders separating us from that level, and somebody had dumped $50M+ 2 days in a row around lunchtime (also made a killing buying back cheaper).  I don't think it's unfounded.  If you can make millions dumping and buying cheaper twice in a row, why not continue?

You're short on luck, not intellect.  There is no real reason for any of these big swings in either direction.  You had a 50/50 shot at a nice gain but people with deeper pockets decided the spot price was going the other way this time.  Could also be right back below $7700 by the end of the week.

In the US, you have easy on and off ramps - there's Cash App, Coinbase/CBP, and Gemini to name a few - where you can link a bank account and direct debit at any time.  Limits are imposed based on how much KYC you complete.  There are ways to buy instantly at a set price but with crypto on hold for a few days, there are ways to debit or wire funds from a bank account (several days to clear though), and places like Coinbase lets you buy a little with a VISA card.
We cannot answer with certainty your questions about source; fiat doesn't leave an audit trail for the general public like blockchain ledgers.  Coinbase provides custody service for institutional investors - so people in command of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have a means of transferring that money to cash accounts on the exchange.
Finally, trading happens in pairs.  Your sale goes through because somebody was willing to buy X qty at Y price.  They cannot submit a buy order on the exchange if they have not deposited funds.  Also, Coinbase is FDIC insured for USD that you store there.
  
Note: I am not employed by any of these exchanges, I'm just providing info as I understand it.  I am not partial to any one service.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:12:02
It does, but since it's still in its infancy and the price swings a lot each day, we still value goods/services in terms of USD or other fiat.  We then transact an equivalent amount of crypto based on what we believe is the value of that crypto at that time.  Until we get to a point where we are pricing things directly in crypto, are paid in crypto, and buy/sell directly with crypto in general, we rely on spot prices on crypto exchanges to help us agree upon the value of BTC.  Right now, those spot prices could be skewed by 80% for all we know.  Binance doesn't have fiat-crypto pairs, so people that are trading BTC on one of the largest exchanges are deciding that spot price with bogus dollars.

I would steer the technology impaired away from mining.  Plug and play is one thing, but I think it would be very ambitious to try to guarantee stability if this thing is switching algorithms.  New algorithms come up (Grin), existing coins change things with their algorithms to evade ASICs (Monero).  A lot can happen that would turn a once stable system into a nagging, freezing, crashing, or rebooting pain in the rear.  My concern is that it's fine until it isn't.
For somebody truly technology impaired, I would double down on my recommendation to just buy coins directly.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:30:24
So it would seem.  I'm still not convinced the dumping is over.  Buy orders behind this run up do not look much better than they did when it plummeted.  The whale that transferred $213M worth of BTC to Coinbase transferred some out, but I suspect they still have a ton left on the exchange.  They also made a pile of money dumping and buying back cheaper.  We will see how this plays out over the next couple days.

@_date: 2019-10-24 14:56:59
For me, privacy and fungibility are now considered shortcomings because other tech has implemented them better without significant compromise to the ideals that drew me to Bitcoin in the first place.  
In looking at the original Bitcoin white paper, it was explained that banks achieve privacy by limiting the information that is generally available the public.  Bitcoin set out to solve the privacy problem of a public ledger by attempts to keep public keys anonymous.  The bust of the Silk Road showed us that a determined party can demystify that.  We now have dedicated blockchain analysis.  Also consider the whale alert:
 [ 
Not only is the entire world alerted to large movements on the blockchain, we also see where coins from hacked exchanges are going.  Those coins are officially tainted.  Many will refuse to accept those coins - exchanges, merchants, and individuals alike.  That makes those coins technically worth less than untainted coins.  One BTC should always be equal in value to another.  There is a clear fungibility problem, and it will only increase in time.
What happens 50+ years down the road when an investigation into criminal activity is performed, and it is discovered that coins had some involvement in something like drugs, child porn, human trafficking, etc.?  The coins would have long changed hands, but are now known to be involved in nefarious activity and are tainted retrospectively.  You could be the sucker holding coins that many will outright reject as payment, and exchanges may not take them either.
I also find it problematic that blockchain analysis could easily land in the public hand.  All it takes is some government intelligence leak or an otherwise willing provider and the whole world knows who owns what (or at least a great deal about the biggest companies).  Your entire financial history could be instantly discerned by a quick QR code scan.  You could be getting groceries one day, go to pay in crypto, and now the cashier suddenly sees how much you have, how much you get paid, how often you get paid, who pays you, where you spend your money, and that your last transaction was at Victoria's Secret yesterday.  That's nobody else's business.  Without protocol-level enforced privacy features like ring signatures, stealth addresses and transactions, the use of a non-obfuscated public ledger blockchain is akin to posting your monthly itemized bank statements on Facebook.
Bitcoin set out to be anonymous, private, fungible, and many other great things, but it absolutely does fall short in some areas that are already better solved.

I'm looking at the volume on Coinbase Pro and it's lower than it has been over the past week, with the one exception of that one push past $9k and subsequent dump.  If the spot price is moving up faster under less volume, it doesn't really seem like people are rushing in to buy the dip like I want to believe.  This thing could flop back down real fast looking at the buy pressure.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:15:03
I hope you're right.  Those who sold out during the big crash had to sell to somebody.  Somebody caught that knife.  This last pump over the $10K threshold and toward $11K over the weekend came within hours of $100M of USDT being minted.
 [ 
These $1000+ price swings that happen in a matter of 20 minutes don't look so organic to me.  Everybody is going to catch the bug and FOMO in perfect sync over the same half hour?  They'd have to all be logged in, funds already transferred to the exchanges where necessary, and ready to click buy.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:36:24
I'm surprised to see it off to the races this soon, too.  I was expecting somewhere around early spring next year.  This buy pressure really looks a lot like late 2017.  If it keeps this up, it'll get there in weeks or a couple months.  I just hope it doesn't implode right before the halving.  It will be a tougher to get these gains again if we can't make the halving argument to get new people in this space.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:59:22
I was.  I hodl'd through the bear market before that one too.  Still, I had opted to ignore this whole scene for so long.  I'm looking at that 32,825 BTC volume and this steady buy pressure and I'm just like "I've seen this before, but it's been so long".

I know, it's like they harpooned the spot price like Scorpion.  "Get over here!  I'm not done accumulating at this price!"
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:34:14
I think this had more to do with the whale that put 25K BTC on Coinbase, dumped the price, and bought everything back cheaper.  When an actor can single-handedly move the market, they can make a lot of money from panic/stop losses.  What we are seeing is accumulation by somebody with already huge holdings.  
$4-5M in buy orders are nothing when you can dump $100M+ dollars in short order.
Fortunately, they still have a significant long position, so they benefit from long-term increase in spot price like most of us here.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:22:11
TA guys insisted their arbitrary bull market confirmation number was $11,700.  Does this unconfirm it for them?  Like, this was the number where they would say "we are definitely in a bullmarket".  Will a minor pullback be enough to make them turn on a dime on that statement?
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:34:03

@_date: 2019-06-17 15:52:38
I would love to believe this, but a lot of people got burned buying during mania.  I don't think another round of mania would be good for Bitcoin, especially if we fail to cross $20k before the parabola turns the other way.  Too many people like to apply past data to infer there is a trend, and if we start seeing a trend of "this thing cannot go higher than $20k without crashing 70+%", we may not see THE boom in our lifetime.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:42:58
I think there is strong evidence of that.  Like, seriously, this thing was sub-$4000 a couple months ago.  What has really happened that would send droves of people to buy it up like that?  Especially after so many got burned badly, humiliated before their peers, and many of which ultimately sold at a loss.  What could possibly possess them to turn around and do it again?
Some FOMO happens as a result of the big upswing in price, but I think it's mostly that initial burst that catalyzes it.  It's like tether is spending people's money for them ahead of time.  You don't have millions of people rushing in this soon and buying hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto all at the same time in perfect sync.  Tether decides that all that buying happens at one time, and then on the back end people then decide to buy what's already been spent out of reaction to all that "institutional money" that CNN or Forbes contributor told them that is the underlying cause.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:44:11
I would not advise waiting.  Supposing we eventually get a significant retracement, the bottom could be quite a bit higher than the current price for all we know.  This is the first day I'm seeing volume that resembles late 2017, so my gut says this is just getting started.  Forget those losses.  Get in here before you really start kicking yourself.

It's more a direct response to "what if it goes to $0", not necessarily the foremost reason BTC has value.
This is a response to somebody arguing absolutes - all or nothing, which rarely holds up well in debate.  When somebody suggests Bitcoin might go all the way to literally $0, they are saying that at that time, there is no way any quantity of Bitcoin could be of any value to anyone, anywhere in the entire world.
I think that's a pretty extreme proposition, and to my estimate it is about as extreme as saying that the US dollar might actually see the same exact fate.  I don't expect economic collapse in my lifetime that would actually drive the US dollar to complete and utter worthlessness, but at the same time I don't expect BTC to get to that point either.  Just like the US economy, this tech is already part of the global economy, and it's complete reduction to zero value requires the entire world's population to disregard it completely.
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:04:59
I'm still looking mainly at Coinbase Pro since that's where the 25K BTC went the other day ( [ ).  As soon as those coins hit the exchange, the spot price plummeted.  That was just after lunchtime.  About half that quantity left the exchange and half stayed.  The next day, about the same time, another big dump occurred.  We didn't see a dump yesterday, but it happened again today at right around the same time.  We got within $50 of the $7400 support line.
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:25:28

Unfortunately we are kind of party to it whether we overtly support it or not.  There are bots and people who attempt arbitrage all day long, and that keeps the spot price somewhat consistent across the various exchanges.  If we have huge exchanges like Binance that won't support fiat-crypto pairs, and people instead trade with things like USDT, then it has a direct effect on the spot price on exchanges that do let people buy and sell for fiat.  We are subject to it even if we decide never to touch Tether.  
When we look up the price of bitcoin in USD, that number hasn't been pure USD value for quite some time now.  It's really hard to say what it would be if USDT were to suddenly devalue.

I would not bother.  There are still a lot of GTX 1070, 1080, and better out there that could very quickly get put back to production for mining, whether they have been re-purposed or changed hands, should mining profitability increase.  They seem to liken it to a $500 custom built rig (arguing that $400 in man hours combined with that figure makes it a bargain).  A $500 mining rig will become a drop in the ocean, and you can expect the same of this.  Buy $700 worth of BTC right now, avoid the hassle, and get better return.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:15:17
They do, and governments prop them up with what eventually amounts to increased national debt.  It's going to take a powerful government defaulting before people will see that cryptocurrency is a better approach to storage and transfer of wealth than basing it all on the promise of value by insolvent governments.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:43:42
The whale that dumped on us yesterday bought back the same number he sold, but cheaper.  Half went back off the exchange, and based on today it looks like the remaining half on the exchange was used to dump and buy back lower again.  It would be hard to ascertain how successful they were.  I'm concerned bulls are going to run out of disposable income to line this whale's pockets if the dumper keeps doing this every day.  The dump happened around lunchtime yesterday and at about a "late lunch" hour today.  It will be real interesting to see what happens tomorrow at lunchtime.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:44:05
Nah, just don't.  Buy the coins directly and hold them.  I've been down the mining path twice - once near the time of the first GPU shortage when LiteCoin and DogeCoin mining with GPUs were all the rage (right before scrypt ASICs were released), and again in January 2017 through January 2018.  Overall I ended up with profit, but I would have been much better off just buying the coins directly with the money I spent on the rigs.  Also, when I consider all the time I spent troubleshooting little nagging problems, trying to optimize my rigs, researching coins to mine and changing my configurations as necessary - it's not nearly the passive income it is made out to be.  I should have poured all that time into odd jobs for pay and bought more coins with that money.
Edit: a word.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:17:55
Yeah, I think it could look like that on a really crazy day.  Trading is all a percentages game where you have to factor in fees on the exchange.  If an exchange charges a "measly" 0.3% for market maker trades, that goes from being a few bucks at today's rates to $750 for the buy, and another $750 for the sell.  $1250 just to flip 1 BTC.  The profit margin is going to have to exceed that, so if people are trying to make money off of 3% swings in price like they do right now, you're looking at +/- $7500 when things are calm and quiet.  I think most people will not have 1 whole BTC by then though, so there is that.

Unexpected and beautiful haiku.  Thank you for sharing!
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:10:52
Nobody knows.  That said, I think we will reach 20K.  I'm divided beyond that.  Part of me says we will maintain momentum.  It could be that a bunch of people that bought at 20K are just wanting to break even, but I'm skeptical.  Many probably sold at a loss.  18 months is a long time.  If they did hold, are they really going to take zero profit after all that when BTC is showing strong upward movement?  
I am encouraged that there isn't as much gambling with ICOs that are incomplete, cash grabs, or nonsense.

I do hope Bitcoin one day implements some sort of mandatory privacy.  I’m not necessarily trying to plug my favorite coin, but I do think privacy is an issue.  It’s not about hiding money from my government or concealing illicit activity.  For me, I just don’t think the cashier at the grocery store has any business knowing how much I get paid, how often I am paid, who paid me, where I shop, and that I spent $80 last week at Victoria’s Secret on my wife.  As blockchain analysis progresses over time, that information will become public and quickly identifiable.  It will be like posting your monthly bank account statements with itemized expenditures and income on social media.

Exactly this!  Assuming US tax laws, buying is not a taxable event - its fair market value at that time should be used for the cost basis.  Trading crypto for crypto is not considered like kind and it is a taxable event.  Selling/trading for fiat is considered taxable.  If you simply buy some and hold it, not trading it and not selling it, you have not realized any capital gains or losses so there is nothing to report and nothing to pay.  Just hang on to it.  You're better off waiting at least a year so you don't pay extra (see short term vs long term capital gains).
Also note: if the price were to fall below your buy-in price (even significantly), unless you sell it at a loss you cannot report it as loss because they are not realized losses.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:02:08
Don't worry about not having 1 whole BTC.  There's a reason it divides 8 decimal places.  Whatever money you put into it could be subject to 5 - 10x gains for all we know.  That's all you need to worry about.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:55:04
It's going to look like this a lot.  Limit orders mean "This is the price I want, don't just fill it at the current market price.  I'll wait."  Somebody who doesn't need an immediate buy is somebody willing to wait for a potentially better price.  Since they are not going to pay more than they think they should, they aren't going to stack up their orders right there next to the sell wall.
The buy orders are not the complete picture of demand, just like sell orders are not the complete picture of supply.  You'll see surges of selling out of nowhere when we are not even against a wall.  Just because the order isn't on the books patiently waiting to be filled doesn't mean somebody isn't sitting there ready to put in a market order or throw in a quick limit order right next to the spot price.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:46:58

That wouldn't be necessary.  They should be able to take the text "I, [real name], am Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin", and digitally sign that with the private key of one of Satoshi's addresses.  Anyone should be able to decrypt that message with the corresponding public key.

2017 = people buying what they thought was the next Bitcoin because they wanted 100x or 1000x gains like the first adopters.  They were buying coins pre-mined/owned by companies, they bought scams, they bought coins that didn't even work yet or existed only on paper.  They were just betting on symbols in a sea of symbols on CoinMarketCap.  It went from getting an early entrance into the future of money to a gambling shit show, and really made a joke of the whole cryptosphere.
Now = institutions + people starting to buy top coins like BTC

I'll add: if you are wanting to introduce another Lightning node to the network, that might be considered supportive.  You don't need to dump $700 on it though.  Perhaps a Raspiblitz would be a good project that's not more expensive than it needs to be.   [
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:41:01
If exchanges are avoided as ramps in and out, leaks get much harder.  If you mined it and didn't draw any attention to it, nobody has a clue you have it.  If you accept it in exchange for goods/services, somebody has to already know something to come twist your arm for info.

Mm.  That's a bit of double edged sword.  I don't expect alts to totally usurp Bitcoin, and I think people looking for that to happen is what is leaving a bad taste around here.  However, I think there are some innovations going on in that arena that are worth the experimentation, and it benefits Bitcoin that it happens on a totally separate blockchain and ecosystem.  It could be a disaster if there was no outlet to test ideas like on-chain mandatory privacy if we couldn't have it without implementing it on Bitcoin as a hard-fork, forcing everyone to use it.  Bitcoin would have to change what it is before it is tried and proven.  There are projects on the altcoin side that are going to propel this space forward, whether features ultimately get integrated one day in BTC, or they continue to exist and fill a niche that doesn't make sense for BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-10 20:06:14

@_date: 2019-06-19 19:54:36
I do not believe it will have any discernible negative affect on BTC.  It lacks a significant portion of the basic fundamentals that got this whole movement started to begin with.  Not to mention, tax laws continue to make the everyday use of cryptocurrency unduly burdensome.  If anything, Facebook may have the resources to lobby and exert pressure on any politicians they may have in their pocket, and maybe we'll eventually see something like a lifting of reporting requirements for transactions under $x worth.  If Facebook is serious about making their coin viable and actually usable, these asinine capital gains reporting rules are going to need some adjustment.  Something like that is likely to elevate the entire cryptocurrency space.
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:44:20
The risk of getting eaten by other larger whales.  There was very little buying support when that whale dumped, and they bought up the same number of coins they dumped cheaper through stop losses.  They were rewarded handsomely for it that time, but what could happen is somebody with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of buying power comes in the moment they try to dump and buys up everything, then proceed to force the spot price upward by continuing to buy up the sell orders.  The whale that attempted to dump and buy back cheaper would then have to buy back in at higher prices.  The result: loss.
There are clearly a lot of deep pockets buying right now given these large upward moves.  Volume on Coinbase Pro has been really close to the volume when that whale dumped, so they take on more risk now if they tried to do it again.
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:09:23
I think it poses little threat to BTC due to its centralization.  I also think FB and the other entities controlling this coin might be big enough to have some politicians in their pocket, and perhaps they can press for tax rule changes.  Having to calculate tax liabilities per transaction is too burdensome and I will not be using crypto as a currency until that changes.  They should at least lift the requirement for reporting capital gains for transactions valued at less than something like $500 or $1000.  If Facebook hopes their coins are actually used, they need the rule changed as much as everyone else in this space.

I agree.  I'm 99% long (like, not touching my long position for another 10 years+), but I think this short-term parabolic upward movement is premature.  If small fish are trading right now banking on gains from increases in price, they are liable to get burned when whales like this one want to accumulate their already huge position.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:48:15

I'm not sure it's always about a better Bitcoin - there are shortcomings of Bitcoin that are solved by other tech.  That tech can coexist with Bitcoin with each fulfilling its intended purpose.  I'm a huge proponent of mandatory privacy and fungibility.  While there are wallets that mix transactions on BTC blockchain, it requires people to opt in each time, and every Tom, Dick, and Harry could one day discern your entire financial history with publicly available blockchain analysis data.  I don't think the cashier at a store needs to be able to instantly know my bank account balance, how much I get paid, when I get paid, who paid me, and that I spent $50 yesterday at Victoria's Secret.  That's just none of their business.
Some coins make it mandatory by default to mix, but it comes at a cost of scalability and greater technical difficulty integrating into other systems.  If we tried to force Bitcoin to increase its privacy and fungibility to that extent, it could come at some costs where Bitcoin struggles to fit purposes for which it was previously best suited.

I'm not expecting a breach of $10k just yet.  If we get up above $9900 and hang out for a day or two, we might get enough buy resistance to let the bull whales charge at $10k.  Retail investors need to be ready to catch folks trying to short it at $10k.

If you purchase through coinbase pro and use a limit order to buy it, you can expect considerably lower fees - like 0.15%.  Maybe just multiply the current spot price by about 0.997 as your asking price and you should be able to offset the fees and probably stand a reasonable chance of your order getting filled before a quick run up.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:41:23
Yeah, I entered the scene just before scrypt ASICs hit the market and wrecked LTC/Doge mining.

Some lessons have to be learned the hard way I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:14:27
I did something similar a couple weeks ago when it touched 9000 and dipped down to like 7600.  I accumulated some by selling at what I assumed were peaks and buying what I guessed would be bottoms.  Things were going great until I sold thinking it would drop and it kept going on up to around 8200-8300.
I cut my losses and bought back in.  Good thing I did too, because it didn't go back under 8000, it proceeded past 10000 and touched 11000 a couple times.  I dont think it's going back to 7800, and you probably don't want to wait for 9360 either.  Get back in before this thing gets back above 11000.

You tell me your FOMO price and I'll save you the waiting and sell some to you now at that price.
It sounds like you are almost on board, but need to see it rise to a particular price before you are convinced it is safe to start your long position.  The low tech way is to set a price alert with something like Coinbase app, then go on CBP and set a limit order just under the spot price so you can save on fees.  If you are feeling daring and not afraid of a little code, play with Python and write a little program to do it.  There is a library out there already written for Coinbase Pro.  You can just setup a loop that checks the spot price every so often, and when you reach your FOMO price, have it set the limit buy order for you.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:40:25

The US dollar can approach 0 value as well.  It is, after all, only considered valuable due to legal tender laws created by an insolvent government.  The US government is the proverbial financially ignorant 20-somethin' that lives above their means with a nice apartment, a fancy sports car, eats out everyday, maxed out multiple credit cards, and can barely afford the finance charges.
People just think financial meltdown won't happen because somehow it's different when a government racks up insurmountable debt.

I'm keeping my alts where they are.  I think the extra tax penalty for me is going to exceed the difference in gains from consolidating vs. staying put.  Suppose I trade them for Bitcoin now - I would claim those as long term capital gains claim.  Then Bitcoin booms within, say, 10 months to the point where I could pay off my house or something (one could dream, right?).  When I go to sell BTC for fiat, I then have to report those gains as short term.  The difference in taxes paid may be non-trivial.

You won't really be helping the Bitcoin network though.  This thing sounds like a glorified NiceHash rig.

As I see it, opt-in privacy is insufficient.  In that retrospective tainting scenario, unless everyone before you made the decision to mix until the coins made their way to your wallet, there is still a link and you are the sucker holding coins nobody will accept.  You can choose to run through a mixer thereafter, but that also requires others' willingness to do the same.  As this problem gains more visibility and people start getting burned by it, people are going to advise against using mixers.  Unless all these millions of coins that are lying dormant in old wallets all make a concerted effort to cycle through mixers, the tainted coins in circulation are still going to be a vast minority.  People will not opt to taint their clean coins after hearing horror stories.
There is just too much reliance on others for your own sake.  Privacy needs to be mandatory, or at least enabled by default with opt-out (I'm thinking for regulatory compliance, taxes, etc.).
I'll plead the fifth on that last question so as to avoid coming across as a shill.
@_date: 2019-06-07 01:27:11
I think the 25K BTC whale that has been accumulating lately benefits from the spot price eventually increasing because they still have significant BTC holdings.  What you say is plausible, but they risk driving a lot of retail investors (the ones currently lining their pockets) away if they dump it down that far.  I think they certainly can, but I think allowing the masses to believe in some stability would be in their best interest for now.
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:16:11
Same time of day, big dump, within $50 of the $7400 support line.  Whale just waited a day.
@_date: 2019-06-07 01:32:02
Those responsible for dumping and accumulating lately still have significant BTC holdings, so I think they are going to benefit from the price going back up once they have had their fill.  I think it will be back up where it was, but I still think it's extra risky to try to trade right now.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:08:17
Well, close anyway.  I hold Bitcoin and believe in it, but from an anonymity standpoint I believe XMR to be a superior tech.  
To answer OP's question, I absolutely believe it should be considered a right.  The law is supposed to adhere to good morals, but it can fail and can even compel somebody to do evil.  Should I ever be compelled by law to do wrong, I have a moral obligation to break the law.
Let's say I want to feed starving children in Haiti, and we elect some nutjob that puts up a banking blockade preventing transfer of wealth to Haiti because of something stupid like "I believe voodoo is evil and voodoo is rampant in Haiti, so any money sent that way we might be enabling voodoo by financially supporting it."  I don't care about any leader's agenda if I am prevented from doing good works.  I should have the right to take the moral high road.  Personal financial sovereignty should be granted to all because every person should have a right to choose to put their wealth to use in benefit of the common good.
While that might seem like hyperbole, we already saw government censorship of WikiLeaks where a banking blockade was put up, forcing them to use cryptocurrency instead.  While you don't have to agree with everything about WikiLeaks, I think it's important that whistleblowing is permitted.  Companies have policies that intend to protect those who would call out corruption.  Government should be no exception to that.

School divisions shouldn't rush into it and say "we have no budget to hire talent in teaching code and underlying logic and mathematics, so let's just have Mr. Smith the algebra teacher try to learn some basics and regurgitate it to their class."  If we hire somebody with experience writing meaningful code in languages that are relevant today and can actually teach (knowing the material doesn't mean you can teach it), students could absolutely do this.  I think it would be a great investment in the future of humanity.  Too bad a lot of divisions don't have what they need to pull it off.

Um, I think you misunderstood, friend.  That's not what I was saying.  I said that people assume that coding a functional app at age 16 makes one a prodigy or genius.  That's not to say that I think that.  I'm stating that's a general assumption other people are making and it is why there is so much hype around a 16 year old making an app.  The person to which I responded with that observation asked why age matters.  I'm saying it doesn't, but other people think it does because they believe something extraordinary happened.  My quoted text at the end was mockery.

People still assume that coding a functional app at age 16 makes one a prodigy or genius, or that somehow that person has hit some cognitive milestone or level of maturity that a "normal person" couldn't possibly dream of achieving in such short time.

I might not have understood correctly what all the pieces are that you documented.  I thought you had just the 36-character Id and the password and nothing else.  Since you got logged into Blockchain.info with that info, sounds like that was a correct assumption.  Now that I re-read what you wrote, it sounds like maybe you have the public key documented (starts with a 1).  If there is some chance you have another key documented, then you might get lucky that it’s the private key for the other address.  In that case, download the Electrum wallet, choose to import from a private key, and paste that in.
You might also try re-tracing your steps with prior purchases.  If you bought the coins with the intent of spending some, maybe try to locate those transactions and see if the public key from your sending wallet is listed somewhere.  That could at least give you something to search with for your files, emails, or any other hand-written notes you might have.

Funds won't just mysteriously disappear.  Everything is recorded on a public ledger, so if there were ever funds in that account, you'll be able to see it.  You could try checking your transaction history using a balance check tool like:
Try going there, paste your public key (DO NOT use your private key), and see what kind of transaction history there is.  If no records show at the bottom, then nothing was ever done with that Blockchain.info account.

I'm not saying everyone is or can be a prodigy or genius.  I'm saying that being skilled doesn't make you a prodigy or genius.  Lucrative skills can be developed before age 20, especially with proper guidance.  Computers are not some mystical, magical force that only the great and powerful can work with, and neither is writing code.  A lot of people believe computers are just this thing that only young people and people who have innate abilities and knowledge can master.  It's a misconception and we are selling the younger generation short by believing that writing code isn't a skill that can be developed early.

I got Mahogany and love the sound of it.  My grandmother has the original model (spruce I think) and also sounds fantastic and maybe a hair louder.  I opted out of the ES Go pickup and had a luthier install a K&amp;K Pure Mini UST passive pickup and it sounds amazing when amplified too.  It gives it a fuller bottom end and allows for percussive style play if desired.  My personal preference is the Mahogany for the sound and the looks.

Those gains are significant until they aren't.  I went down that road for a while.  Won and won and won, and then a single runaway green candle sidelined me and all of that was ultimately lost.  I waited it out for weeks and ended up buying back in higher.  It never went down there again.  I tried trading again about a month later and was doing pretty good until I went long for $11,900 expecting a return to like $13k and that position has been underwater ever since.
Don't bother trading.

The statute of limitations may be up to 6 years under normal circumstances, but if they find any reason to believe you filed a fraudulent return or willfully evaded taxes, that limitation can be extended indefinitely.  You may fly under the radar for years, but all it takes is one slip somewhere (whether made by you, or some vendor from whom you bought goods reports every little thing) and IRS has you under the microscope.

You seem to be under John McAfee's line of thinking that BTC value is pinned to the cost of producing one.  I disagree with that sentiment.  I am of similar mindset of the Winklevoss twins' statement that if its value is pinned to something, it would be the coin's utility.  If you were the only person in the world with a cell phone (or any kind of phone at all for that matter), it would not have much value because it can't really connect you to anyone.  Once you put a phone in everyone else's hands and everyone is using it, then the cell phone's value is greatly increased.
Likewise, if you put BTC in the hands of only a few and almost nobody accepts it in exchange for goods and services, then the value is quite low.  Fast forward to today where millions of people have it, want it, and will exchange it for other goods and services, the value is then quite a bit higher.  Bitcoin did not increase in price because it became more expensive to mine, it went up because its utility increased and more people want to get more of it.  Basic supply and demand.
Also, if efficiency grows leaps and bounds like it did when we moved from GPUs to ASICs, it's going to be in the hands of a lot of different people quicker than you think.  One person is not going to control 100% of the hashrate, so you are not going to see the scenario you are talking about where one person is getting all 1800 for the day and dumping it around the clock.
Finally, you seem to think the price ought to be down in the double or single digits.  You are unlikely to sway many die hard BTC fans into your line of thinking posting stuff like that here.  Most here do not agree with that, and you aren't the first to come here to say the sky is falling.

Personal financial sovereignty.  No government can censor your transactions (think about the US banking blockade against WikiLeaks) and cannot take your funds by force without the private keys.  You are not putting your money in a bank, where your money is paying the salary of corrupt middle managers who have their subordinates open fraudulent accounts on behalf of customers (Wells Fargo), or tank entire markets like Real Estate by handing out loans of absurd amounts to people who couldn't possibly afford it.
When your money is in the bank, you have no real say as to how the bank uses your money to fetch more money, and you just have to hope the power of law is sufficient to prevent corruption (it doesn't).  When your money is entirely in your control, you have the freedom to choose exactly what your money does and you can take the moral high road (or choose not to).  To place your money in others' custody is to be prevented from making that choice for yourself.
You have a financial instrument over which you have complete custody while maintaining access to a global economy.

I'm waiting for more IRS FUD before I buy back in.  I don't expect any rules to really change significantly.  They are probably just going to re-iterate the same onerous rules that crypto-crypto exchanges are not like-kind (are taxable events), and any transaction, even for something as small as a cup of coffee, is considered a taxable event and you have to calculate your tax liabilities FIFO and report capital gains identifying whether they are short term (&lt; 1 year) or long term (&gt; 1 year).
This has been the expectation for some time and I don't expect anything worse than that.  I also don't expect any changes that would result in less money flowing into the IRS either.

Depends on how quickly you want it.  If you don't mind waiting a week or so for funds to complete the transfer before actually buying, I lean toward Coinbase Pro.

I really think a lot of what we are seeing here is the success of the  movement.  Maybe a lot of people are not storing their coins on the exchanges, and this makes it easier to eat up the order books and violently swing the price in either direction.  It's really a double-edged sword.  You don't want to lose your funds due to the hacking of an exchange, but the spot prices on these exchanges are pretty much dictating the global agreed spot price, whether transacting on or off the exchange.
I'm expecting a steady increase in price.  The on-ramps for the exchanges are slow and wrought with red tape.  My coinbase USD transfer took days to clear, and when I tried to buy the dip yesterday using Cash App, the payment was rejected because my bank flagged it as suspicious.  When I called the number, they asked me to confirm a rejected purchase for $X at "Cash Appartment".  ::Sigh::

The spot price is based largely on supply and demand, along with overall speculative sentiment.

While speculative mining is a thing, I think most miners are in the business of selling their newly minted coins (especially those mining BTC directly).  They have to cover their operational costs.  Some of the institutional miners might be hanging on to some of it, but I expect most new supply is getting sold and has been for quite some time.  If new players come in and acquire it cheaper, then turn around and sell it, it's the same sell pressure - nearly 1800 coins per day being sold.  If you can get $7000 per coin, there is no reason to sell it for $2.  Demand has been consistently strong enough to hold the price where it is given the same emission.  I don't see where cheaper operational costs will sway demand.
