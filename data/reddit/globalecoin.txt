Exchange fees =/= tx fees. 
If the community has come to the realisation that BTC is no longer an affordable method of exchange for goods, but is in fact an asset of some kind, that has a high fee for anyone interested in acquiring, then fine. We shall move on to another crypto with a different blockchain

My first bitcoins i bought at less then a doller, and i bought, sold, spent, traded them all the way up to $1000. The least interesting thing to me about bitcoin has always been the price... the technology and idea was interesting. Now it seems everyone has become greedy and only interested in its value. What happened to the revolution? Hodl? For what? I want to USE my money to buy things.... not sit on speculation. If bitcoin sorts its fees and transactions out, im happy for it to be worth $1 or $1,000,000... but if i cant spend it for less then it costs to use my visa debit card, then it is no better!

Indeed we dont know nearly enough about these financial systems. But I am enjoying your explanations. Perhaps you have some insider knowledge? 
Financial systems do seem to be complicated almost for no reason other than to obfuscate. Perhaps this is just me being cynical towards the financial institutions, but they dont exactly have a great track record in informing the public of their true intents. The Federal Reserve being none other than a private owned 'business' with its own intentions, and many similar organisations worldwide. 
     - "The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it's profits or so dependant on it's favors, that there will be no opposition from that class." — Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863
I agree that a bitcoin economy would be much the same as with fiat at the moment. I mean this is what we are aiming to achieve. A simple transition to a modern currency more suited for the world in which we live. Obviously it would be a bonus if we could create the Eutopian state at the same time, however i very much doubt Bitcoin alone will resolve the human capital challenge and our desire to manipulate other for ones own benefit. 
However bitcoin can help to decentralize these institutions thereby disolving absolute power of those in control of the worlds currencies. This also enables those poorest in society to transact without 'approval' from such institutions freeing up innovation within these communities. Look into Africa for examples of such communities already benfiting from the Mpesa. Bitcoin removes the middle man taking obsurd profits from those with the least to give. Those in the west world may find it difficult to attain (absurd levels of) credit and live 'the American dream', but this tends to be at the expense of someone else very far away. A more realistic future would remove over inflated property values, and make housing more affordable. Again another area in which blockchain technology could proove to be very innovative - see smartcontracts.

To a regular Joe in 1996 the internet was just a bad way to buy a book. It had no 'value' or anything new to add that could not be done already with a phone or pen and paper. Nowdays people use it without even realising it. The basis behind cryprtocurrencies is its timestamping network that confirms everything. The bigger this decentralised network is the more 'resilient' it becomes. It proves something happened at said time by said parties. without needing to trust either of those parties. I'm all for innovation but altcoins don't have the network power that bitcoin has. Therefore in my mind there is only the one cryprtocurrency. Could you imagine if we had different competing versions of the internet still? Only one code/coin will prevail time. Whatever that one is called in 5 years is the cryprtocurrency I'm talking about  (even if that ends up being dogecoin)...

First off i thank you for your very clear explanation of how fractional reserve banking works. Never before has it been so obvious to me how flawed it is "D has no money but owes ***  to the bank"
"&gt;Conclusion: Even though no bank has created money out of nothing the total of IOUs greatly exceeds the total of money in existence. If you disagree please state your definition of "creating money out of nothing".
My definition of "creating money out of nothing" would become a philosophical debate about what money is (and perhaps even the definition of nothing).
Therfore for the purposes of this thread i will remain within the context of the op. I do not claim to follow the op's religion but i see benefit from Islamic financial institutions in the way they deal with debt. An IOU as you previously stated is nothing other than debt. A system based upon debt, is one that requires an almost perpetual cycle of lending. This causes the most suffering for those with low income as they are most likely the ones in need of credit (an IOU from the bank) and at the same time  (as was apparent in the sub prime mortgage crash of 07/08) they are the least likely to be able to afford such credit (debt). 
Now switch to a bitcoin system. With the bitcoin protocol there is no need to give your money to a bank for any reason other than to invest them. Sure today some may say bitcoin wallets are complicated but the idea is that you keep them on you securely and safely. Assuming all other technicalities in this regards are overcome through better development of the protocol then the only reason you need to give them to a bank is to invest. At which point you take the associated risk of losing them all. And should said bank lend to people and make a profit then it's a good viable business that needs no other support then from its own customers and employees. However should said bank take on too much risk and lose bitcoins than who will bail them out by simply printing more money when this is not possible within the bitcoin system? This is currently all the fed does as you pointed out its them who give the original $100 not the public. At which point i conclude what i mean by "money for nothing" - the central banks printing money  (or digitally signing it off on computers) whenever there is a 'run on the banks'.  
I thank you for this interesting debate and hope too that more in the bitcoin community understand this so as to avoid similar bad practice of debt within the bitcoin community  (such as i believe was the case at mt gox).
Conclusion: remove the need for banks and keep 'money' yourself in your own decentralised 'bank'. Transact directly with whom you wish. Invest accordingly with knowledge of what it is your investing in  (ie a moral obligation to not invest in deceitful organisations and businesses like banks!)

The fundamentals of bitcoin is a one way transfer of money. There is no 'charge back mechanism'. Therfore Expedia as per t&amp;c's can only refund the cash equivalent. A problem they need to resolve asap to not negatively effect the bitcoin side of business. I would like to think in the near future this problem will be resolved. I know the problem all to well. Previously having had to deal with the same issue even on a credit card booking the problem is all too familiar when using '3rd party booking agents'. You can't blame the hotel, just perhaps let them know if they take bitcoin you would be happy to book direct in the future!

Ok. So put into practice in a bitcoin bank, it is still not possible for the bank to 'create' bitcoins from nothing. If they lend out bitcoins from their reserve (depositors) they cannot put into their assets both the deposited amount and they amount that they have lent out  (credit). If they were to do so then the original depositor would find their account falls short of funds unless the bank took from another account to replace the missing funds (bitcoins). This would be fraudulent, unless the depositor had agreed to an IOU from the bank (which would class the deposit as an investment). Investment banking is possible with bitcoins at the risk of running at a loss. Creating bitcoins from  nothing is not possible, as the only way to create them is through the process of mining. Currently fractional reserve banks can create money from nothing. Therefore fractional reserve bitcoin banking in the current form is not possible. ... correct me if i an wrong?

Ok to be honest I don't know (I've never been into bitcoin this early on in its life expecting to get the best deal.  It's still a novelty to be able to spend/sell/buy them for me) I think there was a sizeable difference between the buy and sell price though. ...

I totally agree. In fact I am that person.  Only difference is I travel for business. The more places I can use btc the safer my private details are. I have had multiple problems using credit card,  from the high fees to having my card blocked because I failed to tell my bank where I was going. Where I can spend btc I do. I also feel that you have come up with a fantastic idea as the ability to transfer btc to local cash is indeed a problem in most countries. All they need is a few business whom can afford the 'tech' to set up as over the counter bitcoin cash exchanges... besides it won't be long before local markets accept btc... They all have a smartphone nowdays with 3G...

I was in bali a few weeks ago and being a bitcoin enthusiast for some time i wanted to spend some. It was not as easy as i hoped. I have heard alot about making it the 'bitisland' and so checked out coinmaps. Sure a few places came up, but the hotel i went to which says it accepts btc on coinmaps didn't know what bitcoins were! ? I couldn't find any bars... a few restaurants came up but were to far from where i was staying. And the other locations were of little interest to me and my partner... so the only place i used my bitcoins was through expedia for booking every hotel i stayed in  (which was of course not a direct payment with the balinease business). I do hope that more local Indonesians begin to adopt usage of bitcoin as it is only then that they will have a reason to accept payment in btc. Perhaps more awareness is required here - bitcoin.co.id ...

I agree that the current volatility in bitcoin markets and the current distribution of bitcoins is a mute point for anybody looking to replace fiat currency in its current form. Which is why we need to replace it in its entirety. The blockchain is already exploding with possibilities for decentralised systems, from smart contracts to p2p marketplaces all of which eliminate the need to trust a third party. Ie said bank, estate agents - monopolies of corrupt systems which inhibit the majority of the world's population instead only concerned with a small percentage. Look at russia, 10% control 70% of its wealth. Bitcoin however is technology which can allow 100% of the population to transact without that central point of 'failure'.

Agreed, bitcoin is the perfect currency for muslims due to its inherit code forbidding fractional reserve banking, or the creation of 'free' money. By 'free' i mean creation of wealth without any work input. Something not possible to do in bitcoin mining. I agree that the  interpretation of sharia law in regards to banking would benefit 'broken' western financial systems. We have a lot to learn from Arab nations in this regard. But let me ask you,  if your prophet were alive today would he be using bitcoin to fund his caliphate  and would the leaders of a said caliphate be comfortable with a truly decentralised financial system? I 'believe' ('believe' because i have no way of proofing otherwise yet i still feel in my heart that this is right) that bitcoin is bigger than all this. In the context of revolutionary visionaries,  your prophet had a very postive impact on societies ability to distribute wealth. But now we have a new prophet whom should be embraced by religions from all over the world for a truelly global caliphate with its said Prophet going by the name of the Holy Statoshi Nakamoto. I thank you for your interesting discussion in regards to bitcoin and Islam.

Yes I agree. The wait is a bit annoying. Hopefully the technology can adapt this as there is no need to wait for confirmations...
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:40:13
I beg to differ. I think what you are describing is a deposit within a bank,  which may or may not then re-invest your funds and loan them to someone else at interest which will produce a profit and therfore interest on your deposit. This is not something from nothing as the bank needs to find investors and then customers - perfectly acceptable form of business  (adapted for Islamic banks as mentioned by op). Fractional reserve banking is the process of lending out more than the bank has. This is only possible by 'creating' money from nothing (ie paper money or nowdays digital tokens on banks servers). Something which was previously regulated at a said amount, but has since at least the 1950's (and the microchip revolution) spiralled out of control leading towards the modern day banking and financial  crisis. The Holy Statoshi wrote the Bitcoin Source Code with this monumental disaster of centralised banking systems in mind as he embedded into the Genesis block a newspaper headline "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". Therfore through the process of a proof of work, bitcoins are generated. No other way are bitcoins or 'wealth' as it may be, generated. Indonesia and its large muslim population has a lot to offer to the bitcoin community, ironically your central bank already hosts the bitcoin logo on all its buildings. An easy convertion maybe?

It is a difficult comparison to make i admit. Yet the russian ruble is nearly 500 years old, and currently backed by the russian central bank. This is backed up by $17,670mil in gold $6,907mil in SDRs &amp; $15,597bn in other assets. Yet even with all that it still manages to fluctuate by a large amount. Bitcoin is backed by a large community of users and a proof of work protocol. No one controls it. I suppose we should compare  bitcoin to any other similar protocol like the internet itself, which has had many up's and downs and yet still persists today. As someone once said 'the least interesting thing about bitcoin is the price'. Its about wealth distribution on a truelly free and open marketplace.

Circle.com just took all my details (email, phone no sms &amp; name) only to tell me they cannot accept payment options from my country at the moment but will undoubtedly spam me in the future when they do... kraken take debit card? I can't do a bank transfer atm as i don't have my 2fa card reader for my bank with me

Nope.  Please note i want to use a UK/British debit card. Circle.com won't accept these

Says debit card unavailable? Is this because i haven't set up an account yet?

Do they accept uk debit cards?
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:40:51
Again already signed up. Must first deposit via a bank transfer before they accept credit cards. ..
