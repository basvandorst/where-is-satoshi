Thank you for the insult!

Provably fair is a tool that enables you \(the player\) to verify each roll result and make sure you are not being cheated! 
You will get an encrypted **hash of the serverseed**  before you start playing. Since you get it in advance, the site cannot  change it later. However it is encrypted, so you cannot calculate your  own roll results in advance \(only afterwards if you get the unhashed  serverseed.\)
Your browser will generate a random **clientseed**.  However, you could and should adjust this clientseed before you start.  This way you can make sure the site does not know your clientseed in  advance.
Click Provably Fair from menu.

I found the problem. You cant withdraw smaller amount then transaction fee. I try to find out about 0.025. If you made a withdraw 0.025btc then you will receive it. Please be patient. I will let you know soon.

HI, seems like your withdraw with 0.025 has been successful some time ago already.
