You are missing the point. The point of increasing the blocksize was to avoid having full blocks in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:16:48
Even if they did, the mining difficulty would readjust and all would be the same. Only change would be slightly less hashrate on the chain so it would be slightly easier for a 51% attack but still practically impossible.

Yes. Once you spend all the BTC in your payment channel, you will need to make another on-chain transaction to move more funds into your payment channel.

It uses solidity and the Ethereum vitual machine so as far as developing contracts for RSK, you can do it in the same way as you would for developing Ethereum contracts AFAIK. 
As for launching the contract onto RSK, I'm not sure how that is done.

You pay taxes on Bitcoin if you sell or spend it. If I hold Bitcoin and it increases in value, then I spend it, I pay capital gains tax. 
If I hold USD and it decreases in value, then I spend it, I can't file for a loss.

Not true, the US Gov taxes "value" not "money". That way you can't get around income tax by paying your employees in gold or something other than cash. 
Also, my company pays for my grad-school degree. I still have to pay taxes because by providing me with education they are providing me with value and thus I have to pay taxes on that. 
So, the fact that USD goes down in value should be considered a loss of value.

The devs have said. They dont want to add zero knowledge proofs because they are too large. They could have implimented Confidential Transactions a long time ago but didnt because the range proofs were too large. Monero implemented them anyways. Bitcoin can adopt Monero's feature right now but they wont, because the devs dont want to compromise on scalability etc. 
Butcoin will never obsorbe the features of all other coins.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:18:45
Expect the same at Gemini soon
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:59:58


This part is just incorrect. Study the tech some more my friend. Monero has many privacy feature that bitcoin does not have and will never have. Bitcoin will never be as anonymous as Monero, simply because Monero and bitcoin make different tradeoffs. Monero maximized privacy at the expense of scallability while Bitcoin does not to the same extent. 
These bulletproofs might allow Bitcoin to adopt Confidential transactions, but Bitcoin will still be lacking stealth addresses, RingCT, sub-addresses and Koveri. All of which increase Monero's privacy to a level *much* great than that of Bitcoins.

If they didnt do it last time, when fees were costing $60 a transaction, whybdo you think they will do it next time? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:53:45
So if you received $100K worth BCH because of the fork and sold it on day 1 right as soon as you got it, you cost basis would be equal to your sell price (according to you), so you would own zero taxes on that free $100k gain you just made? That doesnt seem right. 
You received the $100k BCH for free, and sold it for a $100k gain. So you should owe taxes on the $100k profit that you made. Right?
Lets let the CPA tell us.

Everyone was hating on coinbase for not adding segwit but they added segwit at about the same time as the core wallet.

Well, its *only* backwards compatible. Its not like the crypto cards let you send BTC transactions.

And you have to be online to receive a payment

Huh? Thats just factually incorrect. 


Bitcoin is way behind Monero. I dont see why bitcoin doesnt use Confidential Transactions yet, especially with the new Bulletproofs enhancements.

There is a difference between removing spam and censorship. In the case of this sub, its clearly censorship. I dare you to make a post to start an honest discussion of the pros and cons of big block vs small blocks. A simple good faith discussion will be censored and get you banned from this sub.

Integrity. 
An agreement was made and it should be kept. The only reason we have Segwit today was because of a compromise between both sides. It would be extremely unadmirable for the pro-segwit side to not hold up their end of the deal after the other side has already held up their end of the deal.

They dropped all charges related to that. People often bring that up when they want to speak negatively of Ross, but he wasn't convicted of that because there want any proof.
He was only convicted of running a website that was basically ebay for drugs.
"On August 21, 2014, Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. **None of the** **procuring murder** **allegations were part of Ulbricht's indictment in New York, although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's sentence.**"
They sentenced him for charges that he was not found guilty of.

You can insert cash and then scan a QR code on the machine and it will convert your cash to BTC and send it to your wallet. 
Or you can send BTC to the machine and it will give you cash.

There is a deterministic algorithm that converts a seed phrase into a private key. Since its deterministic, the same seed will only be converted to the same private key. No need for anyone else to store your private keys in a database somewhere. 
Seed -&gt; algorithm -&gt; Private key
Im not a wallet dev but I suspect this is hoe they do it.

I mean, if this is true then its true for Bitcoin as well, since they work almost exactly the same way.

Segwit is a feature that could possibly be added to bitcoin in the future. A larger block size is also a feature that could possibly be added to bitcoin in the future. Why can we discuss one but not the other in this sub?

More transactions, smaller fees and better privacy. Also, it will be cheaper to use coinjoin (a way to make transactions more private by combining a bunch together in one transaction) than to do a regular transaction. So itll be cheaper to have private transaction than to not have private transactions.

Basically it makes an exponential curve look like a straight line. 
Instead of the Y axis going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. (Linear). It goes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. (Exponential)

People are commenting crypto meme companies. You'll probably have to call various mortgage companies and hope you get a mortgage broker that even understands Bitcoin, let alone count it as a legit asset.
