There is no ID. If it has same genesis block its the longest chain that follows the rules of your client. 
Most forks are temporal in their nature. That is why exchanges should wait 6 blocks before confirming deposits. In case of a accidental hard fork between different versions. Even then executing an attack its very difficult unless miners collude.

there's many ways one thing could complement the other. 
in the simplest way, it could be used to login to onename, any webservice or even wallet. Or the onename private key could be encrypted locally using SQRL. 
You could use onename to choose / select/ store your identity.
in a more complex way, you could use it to store the HD private key of a software wallets by giving your u/ or d/ domain and the app in your phone will sign tx etc. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:34:00
You are wrong u/luke-JR, what you mean is, "With 300kb blocks all blocks will be full"..
So the proposal 2x*(last two weeks block size average) sounds about right. Limit would be 950Kb now. Am i wrong?
 There's no way to predict that if blocks are full fees will be higher. Maybe people will stop using btc altogether.

@_date: 2015-06-08 08:46:39
No because pools will have their own soft limit, that will keep the limit within reason.
If the limit is changed based on the last 2 weeks average or more, an attack is unlikely to be that long.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:27:25
Actually a few coins use the bitcoin blockchain for merged mining .
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:22:19
Not only that, there will be blockexplorers, maybe from bitcoin banks and "blockchain as a service" websites.
They will be most likely free, just like there are Time servers, and you don't need to run an atomic clock in your laptop to have time. And they haven't stole or fake the time yet? I thought so.
Actually, to know the bitcoin price it's a bigger hurdle, if the client could know the bitcoin price we could set the fees to half a cent for all TX and get over with this.

How many times we have to argue the same, only miners are supposed to run full nodes, Satoshi made it clear: "In the future datacenters will be running the full bitcoin node and user will have enough with SPV". 
Now the problems are:
-No official trustless lite clients for the regular user
-Orphan problem for miners producing big blocks is still unsolved.
-Intelligent trustless Blockchain pruning for "power users"
-Division of work betwen miners: once txid maleability problem is solved. It will allow more miners to produce more blocks simultaneously without overlapping tx. Tree Chains:Theoretical.

@_date: 2015-06-23 19:55:05
Not really, you could program bitcoin to start producing new blocks with a new version number every year for example, and that the first such block must be a "pseudogenesis block" that contains the hash of all the previous blocks and a coinbase tx populating all balances from scratch, then, clients that receive this new block should check with the "old" blockchain and if this is legit, continue mining in this "new blockchain" ; after x blocks the old blockchain could be deleted. block number should be keep rising but new clientsonly need to download until the nearest "pseudogenesis block".
Critics would say, but what if someone starts mining again from this new "pseudogenesis block" and then reverses tx? , well, we could mandate that after a "pseudogenesis block" no new tx or new bitcoins are allowed for a day/ x confirmations.

the point is that block size increases with the flow of regular transactions. Free and spam-my transactions won't increase the soft limit.
The hard limit should be always bigger to accommodate an unexpected rise in number of TX: as soon as there are enough fees the miner will deem worthwhile to mine them.

but 20 mb blocks are inevitable if there are a lot of tx, maybe more. 
Users running a full node is no solution they just consume exponential bandwidth and misleads newbies that drop bitcoin after waiting for hours for the blockchain to sync.  
The only solution is improve the bitcoin code to allow it to scale.IBT, DHTs , patricia merkel trees, think about it, a regular user do not need to have all the blockchain, it will be like bittorrent users downloading *all* available torrents!, no they should download only what they need! , the blocks pertaining to the tx they want to verify.

@_date: 2015-08-23 00:15:12
I don't agree. Altcoins have a different genesis block. Forks are when miners issue competing different new blocks. Then the one with more hash rate wins. And, then, for security, everybody must upgrade/ downgrade to that version. I say, for security, because the "multiple blockchain" scenario is not acceptable for exchanges and wallets; only a malicious exchange will let you trade both, a sane one will stop deposits until the uncertainity its resolved. Now, when there is consensus rules involved, the one with loose rules wins as it accept all kinds of blocks and keeps getting mined and validating. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:46:54
Jesus Cristh, can we move on with this blocksize debate? 
**Can't we all agree on this:**
We need the blocksize to be able to scalate for a million daily users.
We need to stop spam ( faucet and &lt;1$ tx)
We need to keep fees low at around 1 cent.
Use the softlimit to target a blocksize and keep the fee market healthy.

you are wrong, is not that exchanges will install 2 different versions of bitcoin, they will not accept TX until the problem is solved. (AKA, they will demand 50, 100+ confirmations). As easy as that, why? because there can only be one and it's the longest one.  
Mininig or accepting TX on the wrong one would be done for a very short period of time because you lose money if you mine in the wrong one. So effectively bitcoin will have a 1mb limit until it reaches consensus. 
If you already have bitcoins in a exchange that accepted the two, will your balance suddenly duplicate and have coins in the 2 chains? NO. That's why this kind of post is just FUD
@_date: 2015-07-15 10:57:16

Wouldn't it be better to have blocks contain the block height? Anyway.

They will love it.

[Xapo]( you deposit btc, buy a card and spend as you please, I think is MasterCard. They have fees for currency exchange and atm withdrawal . Around 3%.but yes, you can pay on the internet on any website.

you should be using btc-e instead of coi*nsa*base
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:10:46
the miners couldn't care less if there are 1 or 1 million transactions a second, they only want bitcoins. Obviously the more tx the more valuable is that bitcoin. 
It has nothing to do with transaction cost, it's just the bitcoin IPO being released on a fair way over time, those interested on btc will mine and get coins, those interested on money will sell and regret when btc is 10,000 in 2030.
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:02:22
yes, the second killer app after money will be data, initially DNS records, [namecoin]( is like the internet running on top of bitcoin, actually it's exactly that. Inception?
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:37:29
would you say there's a "run" to be the first app to be able to send/receive money globally? ABRA, Circle, btcpoint, chipchap, Oklink etc. 
Or there will be one app for each country? It is very interesting all this approaches but i think the best one will be one that uses the existing ATMs.

can you link to the scam threads at bitcointalk , websites of reviews etc.
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:44:56
look, nobody know, in fact it's unlikely people are willing to learn bitcoin just to do remitances, the market is in doing remitances guaranteeing the fiat value. ABRA, OKcoin's oklink "superwallet", btcpoint and others will do this. Is not yet up. But I'm sure there's a *run* to be the first one to do this globally. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 14:06:21
No, current light clients either rely on a third party like block chain. Info nd mycelium or need to download the block headers and then ask for blocks related to your txs.

Eventually the blockchain will live in a distributed hash table and you won't need to store it all as you will use light clients. You will be able to download the latest UTXO thanks to a hash posted in the blocks.

No, bigger things, if the time delay is customizable and the website act as a escrow. A company would be able to buy a container from a chinese company and mark as received and release the coins when it receives it. Just like banks do with their Letter of credits. And charge a lot for that. Once the exporter ships it he hashes the bill of lading and sends it to the other party to be able to receive it. If there's any problem they will have to show the website all the documents, like license of import/export, certificate of origin, insurance, certificate of incorporation etc etc and they can have proof of existence of the documents thanks to the hashes and customs declarations.

Banks don't need gold they need hard currency. In a deflationary scenario banks that got gold under 600$ can sell it to get cash. Even if its non existant gold. Is like mtgox issued btc IOUs.

FIXED, (satoshi, new currency, no one controls it, etc, put people off) :
Electronic money it's a term that's been bandied about computer engineers for years,
But it has eluded them until Bitcoin was launched.
It uses the same advanced security technology that powers the whole internet commerce but doesn't need banks.
Your wallet is a program on your computer. Punch a key and todays transfer it's completed instantly.
Need to send money to a many people immediately or with a very low cost? Have the money delivered to their wallet electronically across the hall or around the world.
Bitcoin is value distribution that’s more timely, accurate, and flexible than traditional methods.
There's no intermediaries to deal with, no need to ask someone else for licenses or accounts, you own your money.
Money transfer even to the unbanked is now possible.
Everyone now have access thanks to Bitcoin's revolutionary open and transparent blockchain technology.
Internet shopping and app payment it's easier.
Tomorrow's automated banking office will clearly include Bitcoin. But a preview of the Office of the future, and the oportunity to invest on it it’s available at Coinbase/Xapo/Circle today.

most coins on exchanges are just buy and sold after a 10% rise. Yes a huge buy order can kill the bots and start a rally, but at 2000 Eur everyone will be dumping like there's no tomorrow. btc is not like a stock, it's issued daily, hourly! that's a few millions per day.
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:31:29
Yes. but keep in mind that regular nodes are largely irrelevant, miners are the one with the power and the will likely connect to other miners. Regular users only need to send a TX to a miner in order to reduce the posibility of the sybil attack. Also moon.
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:31:57
first of all do your due diligence about what coins you get into, but most likely the people that control a huge stack bought them at rock bottom prices or mined them. They will make money no doubt. how? very easy put huge buy order at under 0.00000001 bitcoins and sell overtime at whatever the market price btc bam, you double your money, that's the only use of this kind of coins.   Yes many of this coins have traded under 1 satoshi. they are traded for ltc or doges on comkort.

Let's see ddos and blockchain spam to slow transactions. Altcoin pumps. This usually happens before a crash.
@_date: 2016-05-09 11:28:28
Yes, I have a question. 
If it's not Satoshi,  Who really runs bitcoin ?
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:01:27
wallet.dat in the programs data folder actually.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:39:02
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:15:02
Dude, if you give people magic internet money for free they don't value it: you should give it in exchange for actual banknotes... 
If I gave you 2 titcoins and install the wallet in your phone: would you care? No, and you will delete the wallet fearing its full of malware.
Search more about how to recover it. I remember someone had the same problem before.
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:39:31
Satoshi could be a cat. Plot thickens !!
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:54:33
Yep, but what would stop anyone for copying their code,  and do the same with lower fees from their basement? they will be best served just investing that money on some btc. Then build product that runs on btc.
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:21:55
yep, they will became spy for the banks and IRS .
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:14:44
to the moon !
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:05:26
I wouldn't recommend putting more than 5% of your savings on btc.  But get 1 at least, just in case it catches on! 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:37:34
Now imagine a guy from india trying to answer that...
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:42:05

@_date: 2015-03-17 09:43:16
it IS off, with their maintenance fees they were giving out negative bitcoin so they turned it off. Cannot mine until BTC&gt;350$

We need google to accept bitcoin to stop this bullshit.

Are you talking about mtgox ? It was a exchange that got hacked 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:17:40
Or, you know, namecoin becomes the coin with most hashing power ;)

It's GOX, will the goxing ever end?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:43:17
Actually it won't work as a transactional currency. Just as a 401k retirement account...
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:49:10
realsolid? i think he was going to open motmox.com just for the lulz    0_0
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:13:50
So, it's official? They were hacked? 
In before MTGOX...
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:19:14
will never be used in countries with currency controls or banned by the US, unlike btc.
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:37:54
Maybe he preordered bitcoin miners...

tell him he should use circle to load up on bitcoin and then transfer to your address.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:47:02
Ssss... Don't tell the miners ;) 
@_date: 2015-02-26 09:05:24
Yoo man, so you thought you get 100 bits for free everytime you make an account? 
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:01:26
/s Gotcha! stocks are closed sourced wallet garde that can be devalued at the whim of a CEO, instead of a infinitely divisible open ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:51:05
remember that when you use a card you get less btc because of the fees the bank charge to the merchant.  it's only usefull for small amounts.
you can use brawker. or CEX.io if you are willing to hand out your ID.
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:16:06
Actually no one can do it without changing the hash algorithm. Johan figured he can get twice the revenue from his mining machines. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:56:02
Patent trolls! Btc is open source
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:46:11
This is just bitcoin stress testing the legacy fiat payment systems... 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:10:00
Look mainly it applies for digital devices, property and payments. Real world contracts made immutable etc. Proof of existence of them. Not enforcement. So like, no one can fake them. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:23:58
Meh do they merge mine namecoin?? 
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:40:54
Exchanges like bitstamp don't sell you coins at a fixed price. Its other people selling coins. Now, coinbase sources coins from various exchanges and OTC markets.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:48:25
That's basically what happens in every tech company I worked. . .
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:31:21

It's a Spanish BTM company. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:21:29
You dont lose anything until you sell. Say you buy at 2000. You put a sell order at 4000 and wait. Bam 100% profit eventually. Another thing is that some people think they will be able to make constant profit by trading bitcoin daily. Protip. You won't. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:52:54
Easy. You buy 1$ in dogecoins then you use 40or so dogecoins to buy 1 satoshi. But wait! Now you want to send this satoshi. So u ask a friend for a dogecoin wallet address in his exchange and just send them doges or some other low value token. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:56:05
Just the onramp for the next btc run up! 
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:04:18
No. Only in the US.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:47:47
A computer expert can help you for 20 to 50$ per hour. Make sure to ask someone that is bitcoin enthusiast.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:55:42
Shitcoins have shitty hashrate=less security.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:41:11
Its becoming a speculative investment. Haven't send a tx in a long time. Sad.

He means that when bitcoin hits 1mill $ things will be rounded probably in the hundred of dollars. Like 2500$ for a coffee or a pizza slice... 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:15:37
You know a billion  people earn 1$ per day . me too and I have btc. But I'm hodling.
@_date: 2018-12-23 06:21:02
Well the best use case for Bitcoin is actually international money transfers without those pesky fees to swift. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:09:28
As soon as you sell your coins it will go over 3000....
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:39:05
Maybe they want your passport... 
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:43:31
The thing is . If your "disconnected" part don't have enough miners the tx will never confirm. This is why people should wait for the 6 confirmations .(one hour if you are connected to the real BTC)
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:40:49
The day you can pay them w bitcoin you probably should not . 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:02:24

Over 9000...
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:59:16
Current price is more than the average monthly wage in most countries. Most people live month to month, meaning they don't even have a months savings. Like my parents. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:42:08
The phrase is the wallet. Surprised?
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:18:10
Yeah. So what if you started buying the 10$ per day on 1st November 2013 ?
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:30:57
Of course its fud. Vitalik can't cash out con the Beellon dollars he has on ethereum. It will drive the price to 0. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:38:46
Sounds like the euro to me...
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:28:47
2666 euros
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:13:50
Will happen In 2024!

You have to sue wherever they are or wherever they have bank accounts. However keep in mind that in places like India the police won't do anything unless you pay them. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:03:17
I think at 6000no one could move the price 20% on a day. Now at 3000 it's alive! People want to day trade. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:34:41
Is not a bubble but the fees are too damm high. Its putting off normal people. Only investors that want to trade and don't plan on moving their coins are getting in. Sad. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:45:00
He thinks bitcoin is a company and can be shut down. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:47:28
Its all over gizmodo. They say he was friend with satoshi and is just trying to protect his family and staff.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:34:47
The same happening in Vietnam and many places right now prices 150$ higher. But vol is low. India however is 1 billion people.

Genuinely trying yo improve upon bitcoin marketing model. 
There you go. Fixed.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:15:44
They have 2 objectives. 1 is cheap coins and 2 is have their own fork where they control hashrate and coins (by buying cheap). Sounds like the ethereum split and Barry silbert supporting ETH classic. Just that this time they actually can never be the original chain if they HF to 2mb blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:02:32
And this is why everyone I buying into these ICOs, waiting for a greater fool. Soon they all will be heading for the exit door if there's no one to buy.

Partner with xapo to promote your app if you need micropayments. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:08:52
Bitcoins will always be more valuable because it cost a lit of energy to produce them unlike &lt;insert altcoin&gt; . there is no one actually using any altcoin for payments. Just speculative investment. Fact. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:00:20

@_date: 2017-06-23 13:09:36
Since the run up its happening everywhere. Toons of people opening accounts. Trying to buy bitcoin to do arbitrage. Etc etc. Their staff is overwhelmed. Look I sent money to God and its gone. But because they are no longer in business; Gemini and coinbase are legit.
