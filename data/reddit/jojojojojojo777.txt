i got this short summary of the issue from here: 
As ingenious as the Lightning Network is, it still has a drawback of its own. That is that its logical evolution is something that’s not a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Instead, there will likely be large hubs in the network.
The biggest reason for this is that each time transactions occur across multiple channels, the ‘middleman’ channels need to have large enough funds to cover the transactions. For example, a transaction of 5 BTC could not go through any payment channels that don’t have at least 5 BTC in them.
What you can expect to have is large hubs that all have payment channels with one another. Then, as long as the two parties in a transaction are both connected to one of those hubs, the transaction will be possible without posting to the blockchain.
For some cryptocurrency purists, this increased centralization is reason enough to be against implementation of the Lightning Network. Most people who feel this way are in favor of larger blocks to scale the network, which has its own drawbacks as mentioned earlier.
Ultimately, these large payment hubs are not at all like central banks. They never actually possess or store your money in any way – that is still done by trustless smart contracts. Instead, they are simply a trustless medium for quick and cheap transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:12:54
crucify me if need be, but i still don't see a way around raising the block size at some point in the future. that's an "other solution" that shouldn't be rushed, but shouldn't be completely disregarded forever. maybe when there are 10s of millions of BTC/LN users paying high fees, they would support this hard fork in a way that breeds consensus, and it wouldn't be so risky then.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:23:12
No worries, thanks for asking and that's how you learn!
There is a 1MB block size limit for every block in the blockchain, which effectively limits the number of transactions to a maximum of 7 per second. This block size limit was implemented years after bitcoin began as an anti-spam measure, and during the time of implementation, the typical block size was 300KB or 0.3MB. Once the block size limit started being reached, fees started skyrocketing. The bitcoin cash folks split off into their own coin to have a 8MB block size limit, and the current Bitcoin (BTC) kept the block size limit at 1MB. 
Segwit is a clever way to make transactions more efficient so that more transactions can fit inside 1MB blocks. It makes your transaction smaller, which effectively reduces your fee. But since blocks are always full, fees are still too large to use as a random-access currency. There's a lot of material on the subject out there. 
there have been MANY personal attacks from both sides, and i think it comes down to a major difference of how people use bitcoin.
i think people who use bitcoin as a means of getting rich support BTC, while people who use bitcoin as a means of paying for things support BCH.

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:58:26
I don't think the LN is capable of influencing mining efficiency at all really. The value of bitcoin and the inefficiency of current mining equipment has a much greater impact. 
BUT, it's not an econological disaster. The true ecological disasters have been brought upon us by central banks creating $trillions of malinvestments, not to mention death, dictatorships and destruction.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:05
I get that this may work in theory, but there are too many factors in play to assume that this will actually lower fees. 
* how often will users open and close channels?
* what % of users will use LN?
* when will LN be implemented? will it be when fees are $100?
* when will wallets and merchants implement LN? will this be when fees are $100?
* how often will "bank runs" occur on BTC when a large cohort wants to settle, open/close, their channels?

Bitcoin is a protocol, and the consensus of miners is the only thing that's important. It's how it works, how it was designed to work. Read about it [here](


But this is pure speculation. I would speculate that many of these transactions are by users who do not want to spend high fees, or are using outdated software. My opinion is just as valid as yours here, since neither of us have proof.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:44:13
SegWit does not "effectively double the block size" on its own. Its 100% adoption "effectively doubles the block size."
It's been over 3.5 months, with more than 9 months of preparation time, and block sizes have increased on average 15%. That's nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:56:54
Your thinking is backwards. Right now in BTC, I can't pay for my lunch until I pay enough to be able to pay for my lunch. This ain't free market economics, it's the opposite. The block size limit is a "production quota" *prohibiting* the free market to find equilibrium. Please [watch this video]( to understand what i'm talking about, and why the fee market is anti-free market, it makes transacting bitcoin artificially expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:46

i understand that sweeping paper wallets is preferred, and if the tx fees weren't averaging $28 right now, i'd do that. but since i want to cash out my friend's $200, a $54 fee doesn't seem worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:46:08

bitcoin needs to be useful. sending RM100 and paying RM90 is counter-productive to bitcoin. this needs to be fixed. LN isn't here, not enough people are adopting segwit. the arbitrarily low block sizes are the only reason for such high fees. these hugh fees were supposed to come around the time that a block reward is too low. you rushed the downfall of btc, congrats.

ok yes, but what is incentivizing LN nodes — or the series of LN nodes — to allow your transaction to go through for one satoshi, rather than the current BTC transaction fee minus one satoshi? (assuming everybody in the market is greedy, which is true)
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:59
You didn't hurt some feelings. Your post backfired beautifully and educated even more people about the ridiculous fees [caused by the 1MB block size limit](
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:28:22


Too limited. I believe in a blocksize limit, but not the ridiculously small one implemented at the moment. 


Because the space available is artificially small, and every attempt to alleviate it has been blocked as we know. Usually, in a free market, high prices signal to the market that there is a need for more supply, but to people like you, increasing the block size is worse than the problems we already have, and worse than the problems we will have, but let's just leave it at that.


Everybody should benefit from having their funds securely verifiable in the blockchain. The whole system doesn't work without everybody having access to this. This doesn't mean every small transaction being on-chain, but let's say i want to settle my channels once per week, that's reasonable right?


I refuse to accept that the block space should be limited **to its current cripplingly low size**. There is a difference I plead that you consider here: The limited supply of goods and commodities, such as the 21M BTC limit itself, is not equivalent to the limited supply of transactions. Why is it not the same? Here's why: because users with less than $5 in BTC do not get to participate at all in trade. They do not have the chance to even buy something. This is more equivalent to limiting the number of payments you can make with your credit card. This means you have the supply, you just don't get to act upon it. It's anti-free market, anti-free speech to think there **should** be a limit on trades themselves.
We need fees, but we need to make them as cheap as possible. And I'm not getting any help from any of you, and you will be the downfall of this currency that we've come to love.

pff. western union is beating bitcoin. "max fee $10"

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:59
What i mean by "Barrier of entry" is, during a time of network congestion, opening a channel for $10 when the fee itself is $10. 
I don't see any evidence that LN is helping Litecoin's transaction fees ( but i assume a very low percentage of LTC transactions have anything to do with LN right now, so I can only hope you're right that LN will help the more it's used and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:18
I think you misunderstood me. I meant the "bank run" scenario outside of the LN, on the bitcoin blockchain. What if a huge spike in legitimate LN channel closings occur? Won't that create an even worse backlog of unconfirmed transactions on-chain, each of which representing 10s, 100s, or 1,000s of LN transactions?

I understand the bigger blocks = centralization argument. What I'm fearing is that the LN will lower fees off-chain, but not necessarily on-chain, which will centralize power into the hands of large holders of BTC, where transaction fees aren't as much of an issue compared to low-income people.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:08:48
it's absurdly misleading to call anybody in favor of a moderate blocksize increase an "attacker." we cannot have an adult conversation about this if that's your point of view.

To open a Lightning network channel, you need to make an on-chain payment that is confirmed. To get confirmed, you need to (currently) pay a fee of at least $5. So, it's currently already impossible to open a lightning network channel for $5. It's also impractical to open a lightning network channel for $10 if half of it goes to miner fees.

but we are seeing another kind of centralizing occuring already due to the block size limit. users with more coins are now more able to use their coins than users with lower amounts. at least 55% of addresses are currently unspendable. raising the blocksize to 2mb would not deliver a fatal blow to btc, though sharply rising transaction fees actually might do that.

This is an **assumption** for which there is no evidence, or theory I have seen that supports this. Remember, Lightning Network is a proposed *scaling solution* that should be able to increase the number of participants using Bitcoin. 
We do not know how participants will use BTC+LN. We do not know how often people will settle their payments on-chain. If fees are still too high, we will have users coerced into not settling payments, forever being hooked into a payment channel.

YOU don't understand that nobody should be required to understand this in order to participate.

There are factors in play that you're not factoring in. The market doesn't care about your precious scaling plan. The market will decide this. That's all I'm trying to say. Argue as much as you'd like why myspace is great, facebook may come and pull out the rug from under you.


So any system lacking these features are not stores of value? Do you also know the future? The Weimar Deutschmark was a perfectly fine store of value hours before hyperinflation began. The claiming of something being a "store of value" is as good as your prediction when I'm going to fart next.


Ah, my favorite misunderstanding. The misunderstanding that the value of a coin comes NOT from its limited supply, but an arbitrary limit on the number of transactions per unit of time. High fees, aka "the fee market", results only from a limited supply of transactions. Your own argument works against you...
Are you saying when the Lightning Network comes online, Bitcoin will decrease in value because fees are low? 
Are you saying that if ethereum put a similar blocksize limit relative to the number of transactions occuring on it, it will also have similarly high fees. Would that make it more valuable? Of course not.
I know this is probably hard for you to understand, but people who use money want it to work they expect it to. Your arguments mean nothing, the market means everything.

All my points are based on congested blocks because the title of this post, "against a bigger blocksize", is the reason for this congestion. The congestion, that you in your very next sentence, say isn't an issue because it's not an issue **right now**.

I've heard many people in this forum say that, either directly or indirectly.
The direct ones want it to be expensive because they have a really distorted economic view that transactions should be limited and therefore expensive. They incorrectly apply the "supply-and-demand" model to transactions themselves, rather than only resources. This is such a dangerous point of view for many reasons, but essentially it's a hamper on freedom of speech.
The more indirect ones want it to be expensive by saying things like "make the blocks smaller" (luke-jr) or "the eventual goal is to freeze the blockchain" (adam back)

I'll try to spell it out for you: 


If Bitcoin doesn't scale **in time** with the demand for cryptocurrency, then it can be both expensive and unpopular. Expensive relative to other cryptocurrencies, and unpopular relative to other cryptocurrencies, which is why I said it could happen that "transactions are so expensive that another ledger easily becomes the most valuable ledger in the world." 


You haven't really thought it out. Nobody cares about the plans. They care about the value of their money. Part of that value that you fail to recognize is its liquidity. No matter how many times people here say it, BTC cannot be only a store of value. Store of value is ONE out of THREE pillars to a currency. The means of transaction part of it is just as important as its store of value. If your store if value is immovable or non-transmittable, it will decrease in its value. If you think that people won't recognize that altcoins are cheaper to transmit, then you haven't really thought it out. 


There will be no future for Bitcoin if you fail to recognize that transaction fees have to come down. You're in a race with demand. I wish you the best.

are we saying that we support everything that r/btc is against? there are legitimate concerns about Tether that have not been addressed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:11:54
the same arguments can be used against you.
Limiting the blocksize...
* Promotes centralization: because fees become high due to the constraint on transactions, the off-chain scaling that's required creates a non-bitcoin layer that is more centralized (e.g., costing $50,000 to run a LN node)
* It's risky: because it may decrease adoption, and it makes many bitcoin addresses with low amounts unspendable (up to $10 over the previous weekend)
* Many users are against it: actual users of Bitcoin, not HODLers, no longer experience the benefits that attracted them to Bitcoin, because of high transaction fees and slow confirmation times.
Many are blindly against a hard fork due to the client-side software upgrades required, but there has been such a need for these wallets to be updated ANYWAY in order to allow for segwit adoption (still far behind), and having wallets that appropriately estimate transaction fees (many users complain about their transactions not being confirmed, though those posts tend to get downvoted, ridiculed, and removed here).

nope. while their intentions are good regarding maintaining decentralization, many small-blockers regard bitcoin as a long-term store of value and think that off-chain scaling is the solution to a) keeping the price high and b) using crypto for microtransactions.
i think they are ultimately shooting themselves in the foot, because off-chain scaling will increase demand in off-chain currencies, and will decrease the value of bitcoin to an equilibrium of mining cost (security only).
if you can bundle millions of transactions off-chain into one bitcoin transaction, does that BTC transaction need more than 1 satoshi + the mining fee?

short-sighted. if btc grows at the current rate, blocks will be full again in less than a year

12 hours! Cmon. How many lemonades do these girls have to sell in BTC before that wallet becomes spendable in the next 6 blocks?
