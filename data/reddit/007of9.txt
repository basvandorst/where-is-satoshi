BS BS BS BS!!!!  F$  Got the same note this AM. This pisses me off more than I can say. So what now? I'm gonna take a bath since buying BC at 2011 peak price. Can you close a Bitstamp account and still retain your BC value/wallet? Anybody have Atty. Gen'l connections? Are Bitstamp people just pu$$ys or can we raise effective hell with some sort of class action? Any expert input?

No, not trolling. Absolutely serious. So.. I've made no transactions since my initial purchase. I thought I was fairly well versed on the ins and outs of BC, but now I wonder why I (or anyone) needed an outfit like Bitstamp in the first place.

Thanks Man. About the same time I chose Bitstamp, Mt. Gox had a flurry of issues so at the time I felt pretty confident that I made the best choice. Dealing with Bitstamp was actually painless- I was far more concerned with BOA meddling somehow- it surely wasn't the sort of funds transfer that anyone there typically saw. So- per jabetizo's input, how do you think the bitcoin wallet stacks up with other options? FYI- for any WA residents reading this, local outfit coinme also provides an alternate option. I'm just not sure what factors are important to make a choice.

I've watched a couple analysts using their Fibonacci (and other) techniques to determine that a tulip fad type crash is the only thing on the other side of this crazy run up. On the other hand, the state of affairs with global fiat currency wars and the ponzi scheme that is the US dollar- it also seems logical that no on can predict what happens when millions and millions of scared Chinese and Japanese head to Bitcoin as a safe haven. I still have a favorited link on my computer from 2013 saying Bitcoin could go to $90,000. I'm torn between car shopping and getting out now before it dives back 50-75% like often follows such hysteria.
