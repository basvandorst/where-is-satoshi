It's implemented, and has been for some time: ₿
It's not an "emoji" though, just very regular-looking.

I believe n0mdep's point is that opening (and closing) a channel for LN requires an on-chain transaction, and as the fees rise only the wealthy will be able to use the chain to create new channels

- People can buy things directly with BTC.
- If you hold USD, you're effectively losing money either way.
- Think in terms of BTC, not USD: If I have all my assets in bitcoin, and I want to buy something, I have no choice but to spend some of my bitcoin.
- [Deflation](
People still buy things when there is deflation, they just might be more economical about their spending.

It has similar centralization as the internet. You have a few big ISPs and you can also have local networks. If you want to get to a distant local network, your traffic will end up going through a few ISPs.
However, a key difference is that you can switch ISPs whenever you want if you don't like yours — by closing the channel and making a new one with another person/org.

But Segwit has a clear effect on miners. If payment channel systems like the lightning network take rise, then there will be fewer on-chain transactions, and thus fewer payments to get tips from. Sure, the creation and destruction of payment channels is decent for miners, but it's the interim that sucks — and it's the interim that makes the channels worthwhile.

Distributed hash tables with Chord in 2001 — brilliant invention. If you're into CS and distributed systems, it's a must-know.

Buying things isn't cashing out — it's buying things. Particularly if you don't have any usd. If you don't want to buy things, that's your bsns. This is how deflation (due to limited supply of currency) works.

Whoa, is there a good mobile wallet with the ability for me to connect to my own node? (I've been shelling into my rig on my phone for everything like that)

That's why you review and request changes, or close the PR with a comment if you disagree with it at a higher level.
It's rude not to respond to the community that wants to improve your work :P

You should respond to your pull requests — that bugfix PR looks pretty useful.
