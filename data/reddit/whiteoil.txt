So wait.. is the consensus that this bc miner is legit or no? Dundee you are only adding more confusion. On top of this, why do I even care?

 i'll pay you .01 percent interest per year.

Good idea, don't know if I'm that confident though

I guess this was my holding to secure upside potential. My big move into the market will be markets cool off and we see sustained perma bear sentiment.. Buy low sell high right

Spread across btc, eth and llc. Impressed with Ltc as of late. I bought Ltc the day before it jumped from 28 to 45. Talk about lucky. Actually bought based on some reddit talk on the Ltc pages. Thanks reddit for a few k!!!

I find it hard to believe Aug 1 won't crash all crypto markets. Imho I believe we'll be seeing red across the board, 75 percent plus pops. Mass panic selling. Think great long term prospect but all this new money is gonna run away short term

From a PR standpoint this would be like spitting in the face of an opponent ten times your size. Stay low, keep cool. No need to rub it in their faces. We don't want a state / fecal backlash. Guess I misspelled federal but looks sufficient imo lol
