Roller coaster indeed...
I really wanted it to go back up before I sold...I kept waiting and waiting for it to go up just a little bit more, but decided to take my profits at about $130. By the end of the day it was at $104. I feel really fortunate to have jumped ship when I did, at present value it has saved me about $35,000.

I agree, so I guess what I am asking is: what could the US do that would allow them to effectively ban Bitcoin? As corrupt as the government can be, they still need to convince Americans that they are passing laws for the good of the people.

An all out war on Bitcoin full of disinformation and lies is certainly a possibility, but the fact that so many upstanding and well educated people back Bitcoin makes me think it'd be hard to convince enough people that Bitcoin is dangerous. There were plenty of respectable folks using ecstasy too, but when drugs are involved I think it's a little easier to convince people it's dangerous and should be illegal.

@_date: 2013-04-22 07:12:04
There are options to hedge agains the exchange rates, and once BTC is adopted more readily, the volatility should be less of an issue.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:16:23
It shouldn't take much more than 5 seconds to come up with a couple bad ideas...
A) Until credit card functionality changes, you're not going to be able to purchase any sizable amount with a credit or debit card.
B) If you lock in an exchange rate, people will only take advantage of it when they are on the losing end, and as such you'll have to charge higher fees to cover your losses. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:35:53
There looks to be very few standing orders beyond $150 though. While there may be a lot of people looking to sell at $150, if we break through it, I'd imagine there wont be too much resistance to $175 or maybe even $200. There are probably still quite a few people holding on to coins they bought for $150+, and the crash probably had them shitting their pants. Those who realized they don't have the stomach for this will probably start dumping their positions when they near their initial investment, the stabile growth we've seen the past week could have rekindled some greed though and people may be looking to hold again.

I think reality is starting to set in. Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but it doesn't actually do anything yet. The smart money is busy developing new ways to use Bitcoin. A lot of the early adopters are realizing that mainstream adoption is still a ways off, so they are taking some money of the table. There's just not enough new money entering the exchanges to sustain the higher prices.

Not sure if Mt. Gox charges a flat fee or if it's percentage based, but on a $10,000 transfer request they deposited $9,969.32. Wells Fargo charged an additional $15 Incoming Wire Fee. So the total I paid in fees is $45.68 ($30.68+$15).

I think this is incredible, being able to link BTC directly to your bank account is huge. I want BTC to succeed, so maybe I am a little biased, but I think this is a huge step forward for BitCoin. Cheers to you Germany for paving the way!
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:04:42
You bring up an interesting point. I wonder whether banning something would be considered confiscation, and thus require compensation. In 1933  when gold was seized, people were at least compensated. Similarly, when eminent domain is used, compensation is required. I don't see the US compensating citizens for their Bitcoins though. If they did set a price as compensation prior to the ban and it crashed the global Bitcoin economy, then everyone would just sell their Bitcoin to an American to cash out. If they don't compensate people, I don't see how they can ban Bitcoins since they are not illegal under current US law.

If the ATMs were more prevalent and the price were more stable, I could see it being a useful thing. If you're going on a two-week vacation in another country you don't necessarily want to be carrying around all your cash. If you were able to keep a couple thousand in a BTC wallet and just withdrawal money from various ATMs in a city, it would be like having a temporary foreign bank account.

Let's imagine I bought some BTC with my USD a few hours ago before I boarded my flight to Germany. A few hours pass and I'm now in Germany. I grab my bags and head over to the Bitcoin ATM conveniently placed in the airport, but wait, what is this?! My bitcoins are only worth $80 each now?! ...I just paid $97 a piece a few hours ago. What a ripoff! I should've just brought cash to exchange instead.   
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:53:44
Just as the founders of Google created a fortune out of nothing.
To be honest though, I struggle a bit with the fact that early adopters stand to make a fortune if Bitcoin succeeds, but as an investor I look at Bitcoin as a hybrid currency, wherein it functions more so as a method of payment than a store of value. And so it helps to view those early adopters as investors in a new payment system.

I don't know what the overall opinion of this guy is, but I never had a good feeling about him. He seems very narcissistic and overly paranoid. Moreover, he seems like the kind of guy who thinks he's smarter than he is, and has a hard time admitting his own shortcomings...this is not the kind person you want running anything. It's hard to say exactly why I feel this way, it's just the impression I got from the various interviews and press releases I've seen. For one thing, the bio and picture that seem to accompany every article is very off putting. I've been involved in startups and new markets for awhile now, and I think you develop a sixth sense for the pretenders and the egomaniacs. Anyway, I think a Bitcoin ATM is a great idea, but whether or not it's feasible right now is still up for debate. The fact this guy is no longer involved doesn't affect my outlook on the future of the project one bit.

In cash, there is around $1,000,000,000,000 in circulation. 
For a BitCoin to be worth more than all US currency in circulation, a BTC would currently have to be worth at least $91,000 USD. 
The currency in circulation is less that the actual wealth of Americans though; in other words, there is less printed money than there is money in the bank accounts of citizens and companies. It's just not neccasary for there to be a physical dollar for every dollar that exists.
If a BTC were worth more than the circulating US currency, it would mean that much of the world has adopted BTC, and in turn, it would probably result in many international businesses transacting in BTC. I would imagine the value, or at least the purchasing power, of a BitCoin would be much more stable than it is today.

I agree it would be hard to only make Bitcoin illegal. If it's just data and a means of sending unique pieces of data, how do you differentiate it from other electronic payment systems and credits. In many ways its no different than PayPal, airline miles, virtual gift cards, etc. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:30:35
I posted the total fees I paid in response to chops228. On $10,000 the fees were less than .5%, so really not that bad. 
Once you're verified your limit is still $1,000 a day, but if you email the AML department they will increase your limits to $10,000 a day, $50,000 a month, and the ability to withdraw 1,000 BTC a day.

I could see a third party company finding a niche here. Perhaps a company could issue a BitPay card where you load BitCoins onto it and those funds can only be transferred to another wallet at the end of the day. So this company issues you this card which you can swipe or have a QR code for the merchant to scan and the system will be able to charge you and it will only be able to transfer or pay successfully if the card says there are enough BTC. At the end of the day transactions would settle in your account and you could either leave the balance, transfer it, or add to it. Just a rough idea, but something like that could be useful.

I have a verified account on Mt Gox linked to my Wells Fargo account for ACH transfers. I requested a few $10,000 withdrawals for a few days until I hit the $50,000 monthly limit. The first one took a couple days, but each one after that was deposited into my account the next day. There is a fee charged by Mt Gox, but my bank also charged for an incoming wire, so be aware of that. It doesn't amount to a very high percentage on $10k, but for smaller amounts it can start to add up.

It's a wire transfer, it's not like I deposited $50,000 in cash. Plus the money is still sitting in my account, if I transferred it out the same day it might look suspicious, but it's going to stay put in my bank for the time being. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:31:02
I like the idea of having the option of depositing with a third party like a bank, the idea of keeping a large sum of BTC in an insured account that I could instantly withdraw USD from via an ATM/Branch when it's needed or have BTC transferred to a spending address when I want to send someone BTC would be ideal. My parents aren't going to do all that's required to acquire and spend BTC at this time, but if they could just have a separate account linked to their bank that they could hold BTC in and spend in a similar fashion to a CC, I think they'd go for that.

There's obvious support at $50, I think there will be sell offs with each spike, causing the price to retreat, but I think we'll see a more cautious market after the last run up to $266. The market cap is still relatively small considering the potential of BTC, and with the influx of new money and attention from entrepreneurs and VC firms, I think the price may bounce around between $100 and $150 for a little while, perhaps stepping over the line a few times on either side. I don't think we'll see a huge run up past $200 again until some kind of announcement is made from a company implementing BTC or offering some new way to use them. I think the only way we dip below $100 and stay there is if there is some sort of security breach or threat to the integrity of BTC.

If they're going to accept CC or PP, then they shouldn't set the exchange rate for your order until they have cleared your payment. If you send $5k, then they should hold it for however long they need to in order to mitigate risk, but on the day you get the BTC they should be valued at $5k and you should be free to use them as you please. That seems fair to me.

I think this is a great idea. BitCoin isn't a company, so there is no marketing department, it is therefore up to us to help get the word out about BitCoin. Once merchants understand BitCoin, I think they'd be more than willing to accept BitCoins, especially merchants with high instances of fraud.

BTC would only reach such a valuation in relation to the USD if it were being heavily used as a transactional currency, and as such, there would be little need for being able to exchange into USD. BTC itself would be liquid.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:33:09
Moreover, would it be possible to shift the decimal to the right, effectively increasing the number of BTC by a factor of ten without anyone losing value due to inflation? Is something like this possible so we don't end up with transactions of .0000001? If a bitcoin was split like this to maintain a value of $100 and let run up to $1,000 before moving the decimal again wouldn't it be better in the long run? I feel like keeping a single bitcoin close to $100 would be easiest to manage.
