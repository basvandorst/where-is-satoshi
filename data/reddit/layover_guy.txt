Send me money to buy hardware (that you can buy yourself)
I will bill you for power @ 14 c (market is 7 cents)
I will charge you for upkeeping and maintenance.
Whatever is mined, I might give you 25% of it
Your hardware will be mine after 24 months.
Oh and let’s not call it “cloud Minning”. We will call it “web Minning”
