Bitcoin’s only real purpose in a decade has been to get rich quick tulip mania style, and to facilitate illegal acts. 
Drugs, child porn, murder, prostitution. sex slavery, human trafficking have all been bought and sold with Bitcoin.

No, the competition is stacked too deep, BTC has maybe 50% market share.

I can buy literally anything with the USD that’s the point. 
BTC is worthless as a currency outside of the black market and deep web.

Jesus where the hell do you live?

Because sticking your head in the sand and screaming HODL makes them feel better.

Or you get a job with health insurance

Normies getting BTFO, only the steel handed shall weather the storm.

You bought at a bad time let’s be honest.  BTC could sink to the floor of $0 in 2018 or it could hit $100,000 no one knows. 
We could be in for another multi year bear market where BTC trades sideways.
You only “lose” if you sell at a loss, but the HODL people need to accept there are better coins around which can do everything BTC was intended to do, but without the drawbacks.

Wouldn’t be using reddit without gold

Finite amount of coins in existence 
Unknown numbers of them have been lost to what you’ve described, but also HDD crashes, carelessness and forgetfulness. 
The lost ones stay lost

I might buy more if it drops to $5k

Holy shit, this sort of blatant manipulation is going to
get the Feds involved.
Normies will get robbed blind, panic sell and go crying to the Government.

Ouch

Bitcoin is worthless, Apple and gold are not.

Yes, a banking system which requires the globe’s energy production to function. 
And i’d say BTC has a shitload of risk, having 2% inflation year to year with USD is much preferred.
