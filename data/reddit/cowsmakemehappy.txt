Serious question - is Bitcoin useful to people on the ground during a crisis (short term)? Will Greeks be able to do anything differently by putting the euros they are able to move out of banks into Bitcoin?
Also, if internet in a country is cut (Syria) doesn't Bitcoin fail to help the people?

absolutely, not only is this a privacy red flag, this is just terrible business. anyone with an account at HSBC should leave now.

Cyprus is not America. I will have bigger problems than losing $250,000 if the American government decides to opt out of its FDIC insurance contract.

defaulted on bonds through inflation. that makes no sense at all. if a gov't issues bonds in its own currency and pays back in its own currency, it has not defaulted. no one is guaranteeing you a real return.

Agreed. Warrens knowledge does not extend to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:21:30
Great point. I'm a tech savvy 20 something and dealing with BTC and real life merchants seems like too much trouble. I'd rather just use coinbase and buy stuff online.
Can't imagine how much the learning curve needs to come down for average joe to understand and want to use bitcoin regularly.

Agree with everything though "Holding dollar IOUs in a bank ... biased to the risks your bank is exposed to." FDIC insurance protects you from these risks up to $250,000, so if you want no risk open a new account any time you hit $250,000.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:53:33
Sounds good. Where would you suggest I put litecoins? I was using coinbase when I had bitcoin and it was a great interface but unfortunately they don't accept altcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:12:08
Can you post some links?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:47:22
you think btc-e is not a good place to keep money? I dont have a lot, just a few litecoins in there. would love more info plz.

If 27,600 was your life savings I don't know what you were planning to live on after year 1.

Wasn't that the whole point of Bitcoin? Not having to rely on 3rd parties or place your trust in a centralized agency (commercial bank or Federal reserve)?

How does one short all fiat currency? Is there an app for that?

Can someone explain what this means? How is this different than running the original 6-8 GB software that was popular in 2014?

No different than stocks.

What are the charges the gov't should bring? Tim Geithner's book basically said the inability to answer that question is why no one went to jail. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:03:07
you should have your price locked in. that's how my coinbase transaction worked. (fingers crossed i get approved today!)
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:44:01
Economics question: why would anyone sensibly spend bitcoin if its value will always increase? The only answer I can think of is that someone acts irrationally or values other things over money (like seeing bitcoin's adoption rate increase brings more utility than the increase in wealth it could bring you).  Pretty hard to answer IMO
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:34:53
Got it. So if I buy 3 bitcoins on coinbase, I could transfer them to my personal computer and shut down my account if i was worried about the company going out of business, right? Then it would just be up to me to protect them bitcoins on my computer?
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:58:52
Hmm. I guess that's a good point.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:13:48
Thanks for the guide. I just left you a tip.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:43:55
But no currency deflates like Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:44:37
Sweet. Thanks for the info man. The goal is to hold onto a few coins and see what the market does. Econ/Finance major so the whole bitcoin thing is very interesting to me, and obviously wouldn't mind riding the train if it goes up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:28:18
I dont intend to cash out anytime soon - I also think the economics of Bitcoin provide amazing ROI for investors. Im confused on the logic of your last sentence, though. Any currency can be traded for any other currency in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:11:21
I agree POS systems can be much better, and I think online wallet security is going to have to change. The whole bitcoin system is based on the 'no trust needed' argument, but that stops when you start using online wallets.

Two reasons: I can spend dollars anywhere I go today, which I can't do with bitcoin. I also know how to spend dollars, whereas I dont know how to spend bitcoin. I watched the Subway transaction and it looked complicated. I think some sort of technology (phone app?) needs to make transactions much simpler.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:37:33
can you tell me what you wrote this for? you tipped the guy who posted the article $3.64 via bitcoin and you're calling out the robot to confirm your transaction? how did you know this guys address to send to?
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:19:12
interesting, just doing a "coinbase" search in r/bitcoin brings up a lot of stories about rejected payments and poor customer service.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:16:52
Word. Just saw this in another thread that even if you convert to goods your supposed to pay taxes on it. So much for this thread!

Haven't used the coinbase app, but I have used the website. Thanks for pointing that out.
