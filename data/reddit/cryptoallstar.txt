Playing both sides only helps the exchanges by paying out tons of fees to play this 2 sided game. There are no odds. It’s basically a strategy to come out of without major losses.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:25:40
It will go back up to ATH in 2020. Just chill
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:08:59
And you think that will happen overnight? Step by step.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:15:41
China is corrupt as fuck.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:29:16
I line the name Tales From The Crypto better.
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:53:49
Too bad he isn’t alive now to see his genius predictions come true.
@_date: 2019-11-23 19:11:26
Me too when it was $40. I thought it was a decent gift at the time.
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:22:42
Hardware wallet is much better. I prefer Ledger over Trevor.
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:19:45
You definitely made the right decision.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:17:08
The BTC price is always changing. Even different on different changes. So the answer is YES.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:47:43
Funny.  You should do stand up.
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:43:22
I’m selling my house if it goes to $4k.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:13:44
Avoid using Bitcoin and turkey in the same sentence.
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:51:47
Sure. Bring the beer though.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:00:47
We want 1 trillion.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:22:42
Scammers are all over crypto. Watch out for them.
@_date: 2019-11-23 19:10:29
No no and no. It’s going down but it’s surely going back up to ATH.
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:44:53
Just buy and Hodl Hodl.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:49:35
Many more will see the light.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:01:21
Ok. Then 3 years.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:27:50
That would be a loss for Bakkt though. She can’t do both jobs.
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:16:52
Congrats for owning half a bitcoin. When I was in college I blew my money on beer and girls.
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:34:30
Where is Bitcoin half price sale?
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:06:27
Amen to that.  Bear market should be over early 2020 for sure.
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:54:04
Binance has withdrawals up to 2 Bitcoins a day without KYC. Enough for 99 percent of the users.
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:22:44
It’s hard not to ignore the market price and trends for many people. Although most smart people know what is making the price go down and up. Predicting the price short term is not possible for most people so I understand the moderators point.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:14:53
Future network improvements are in the way as well.
@_date: 2019-11-16 01:20:39
And it’s not even Thanksgiving yet.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:16:04
It looks like one of my dreams.
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:32:31
Happy anniversary all you scammer scumbags. May you all rot in hell.
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:24:51
Profitability will be effected after the halving. Good luck with making it work.
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:45:26
$7,000 is a good entrance point. You will 10x within 2 years.
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:52:04
No just an optimist.
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:48:31
Crypto debit cards are a huge success. This is how many people will use their crypto in the future.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:26:33
Nothing to worry about. I can think of 500 reasons for this move. Bitcoin is down now but up again in a week or two.
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:28:27
True. In 8000 more years BTC will still be here. Paper not.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:34:59
Can you buy weed with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:31:00
Don’t do it. Opening up a can of worms.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:32:05
VPN or P2P is the answer.
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:49:15
Peer-to-peer is pretty pretty risky.
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:58:08
I don’t follow him. I like crypt0 and a few others. But he’s not on my short list of youtubers I follow. Just be careful who you listen to in YouTube and Twitter.
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:14:53
Every time I hear hodl hodl I feel like yodeling.
@_date: 2019-11-30 06:53:52
Twin Ledgers. Congrats!
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:10:21
Supply and demand.  Less supply and more demand means prices will go up.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:26:29
I meant buy at the right price. Almost there.
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:33:17
Better late than never.
@_date: 2019-11-16 01:19:31
I would take a half moon.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:06:00
HODL or buy.  Don’t sell.
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:10:12
Isn’t Bitcoin suppose to go down on Black Friday.
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:51:54
It will be a very merry Christmas
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:30:23
I’m on the fast track. I don’t want to wait 50 years. 10 is what I’d like to see.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:08:53
One day we will see $696,969.69
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:59:29
Peter Schiff is way off the mark with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-23 19:12:42
HODL until you are 65.  It will help with your retirement.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:46:39
For sure. Millions without bank accounts.
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:25:11
When was the last time it was down?
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:45:05
Same old shit. Just chill and wait until 2020.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:39:20
Any adoption is good adoption.
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:29:45
Microsoft beats Apple on this one.
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:25:57
Is that chart inverted? My shit is going down.
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:12:20
Mass adoption in Germany incoming.
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:31:17
Soon everyone will know it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:43:17
Keep printing money. Powell will be dead before it’s paid back.
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:59:43
I’m not moving from the USA because of taxes. It’s worth it to live here.
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:46:23
I’m not selling. You all can be my guest and sell.  But I’m not.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:55:39
Bakkt just getting started. Buckle your seatbelts. ����
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:54:29
I’d rather have green candle.
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:17:36
You can apply for several debit cards that use bitcoin in the USA. Wouldn’t surprise me if it works.
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:47:23
Keep up the good work. We need as many programmers in blockchain as possible to advance the technology.
@_date: 2019-11-16 20:42:10
Definitely better than getting paid in USD.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:34:08
The more blood the better. In other words try to time the bottom.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:02:30
I like Louis Vuitton for every day but Ledger for long term.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:50:14
You mean selling. Believe me. Divorcing will cost you money.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:31:56
I’ve heard about hacks being possible with the super fast computers coming in a few years. I view it as pure FUD.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:45:32
That’s the spirit!
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:42:43
Harvard and Yale will one day accept Bitcoin for tuition.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:07:09
Bakkt is just getting started. I expect many more records to be broken.
@_date: 2019-11-21 04:01:10
Miners are getting it done before the halving.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:00:49
I expect crypto to overtake gold within 3 years.
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:25:52
That’s what the big guys want. You are too much of a purist.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:41:25
Use solar power. It’s got a 90% cleaner carbon footprint than gas.
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:45:37
If I had $310 million would I care about a larger fee?  Of course. How do you think he made the $310 million.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:00:42
The key is not when to buy but not to sell.
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:55:19
Black Friday sale only 4 days from now.
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:21:12
Easiest way for me is send fiat to Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:59:39
Better up than down.  Keep going up.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:31:31
It would be great if we could mine on a Raspberry Pi. Yeah I know it’s a dream.
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:43:51
Banks are in for a rude awakening soon. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:02:15
Go up already.
@_date: 2019-11-12 06:44:13
Mass adoption incoming.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:24:56
Don’t invest all your money all at once. Take some time and study the business. Don’t rely on one person to tell you how things are.
@_date: 2019-11-19 01:36:47
A National Bank of China will be opening soon with bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:06:11
This is terrible. I don’t keep much of my crypto on an exchange. Sorry for the exchange and the investors who might have lost money.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:36:20
Better pay 20 years worth of bank fees in advance on your safety deposit box.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:24:31
Don’t tell the bank the loan is for bitcoin. They get salty.
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:30:27
Custody will lead to mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:09:08
One is that Bitcoin is a physical coin.
@_date: 2019-11-20 14:12:44
European countries like England need tax dollars to bolster their coffers. This goes back to mid evil days.  Not surprised if and when it happens.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:29:50
Try Bank of America or a credit union.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:20:47
Nice to see Bitcoin being commercialized through retail sales throughout Europe.
@_date: 2019-11-27 03:14:15
Nice discount. Might mean they are coming out with a new model in a month or two.
@_date: 2019-11-23 19:07:08
I bet some people think that is a real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-30 06:52:12
He spent all his Bitcoin to buy it. Not the smartest thing to do.
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:39:08
Unless you are trading crypto keep it in a hard wallet like Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:59:46
And I thought .05% interest was bad.
@_date: 2019-11-28 15:04:39
Stock market is high. Bitcoin is low. No brainer. Sell stocks.  Buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:39:34
Stay safe and anonymous.
@_date: 2019-11-20 14:18:56
Custody services from Fidelity and other big institutions is needed for more big institutional investors to jump in and help with mass adoption. This is a huge step forward in that regard.
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:13:30
It’s coming. Buy now or regret later.
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:16:55
We have lost keys and lost hard drives.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:16:56
Best to be diversified. Don’t go all in on anything.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:20:04
Even a 1% success rate of a Institutional investment of $100 trillion ($1 trillion) in the next 3-6 months would be fantastic!
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:14:47
Faster transactions.  Finally!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:16:00
Those are minted specifically as a collectible. Whereas some coins and bills were spendable when they were printed/minted.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:08:01
The more free shit the scammier it is.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:24:41
Mark owns like 1000 businesses. I find that hard to believe.
@_date: 2019-12-01 04:42:48
Will check it out.  Thanks for developing it.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:01:15
Scammer exchanges are the worst. Good job!
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:17:57
Too early in the game for me to trust Bitcoin custodians however it is good for institutional investors.
@_date: 2019-12-01 04:44:35
Never had a problem with Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:18:29
I only have to wait 10 more years. Ok but I’ll take profits along the way.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:14:40
That’s a rotten thing to do.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:09:11
Deposit some fiat and buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:34:52
That’s true. Just an example. I could think of more examples. People make mistakes sending crypto. Who wouldn’t be nervous sending that much.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:00:14
Zero-fee. Take a hint Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:06:25
Hopefully many future smart investors and developers.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:29:53
Hindsight is 20-20. We all would do things differently if we knew Bitcoin was going to be worth thousands. But we can’t go back. Right pizza boy?
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:39:25
Will you have it on Amazon ?  If so provide a link.
@_date: 2019-12-02 07:47:48
It means don’t buy. Like don’t talk. Bite down hard.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:15:52
He’s not being objective. Probably sells stocks or metals.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:04:03
Bitcoin is the one.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:19:33
We rish.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:01:03
Thanks for the info. Not for me though.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:21:15
Good.  No Great. No Da bomb.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:05:01
Rule 1. Go up up up.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:17:35
Most people and countries have too much debt myself included. Need to fix that soon with a moon.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:30:22
I thought Bitcoin was round.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:03:55
You forgot a couple zeros. $150,000.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:09:43
Thanks for the warning.
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:30:51
You are a genius.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:08:43
And next decade as well.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:01:53
Great stuff guys. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:06:45
I’ll bring her checkbook.

Sorry if I offended you. I don’t doubt that your book is good. But in truth I get the vast majority of my information off the internet.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:53:11
Prices were a steal back then. Where is my time machine.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:16:57
Fucking nice. You should sell them commercially. If you do post a link later.

You learn from your mistakes. It’s never too late.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:48:34
Owns or has custody over?  Let’s get the facts right.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:40:26
Bitcoin and etherium
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:29:57
It’s already big.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:15:34
Something big is about to happen. Moon!
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:06:09
All the information is on the internet for free.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:20:45
I’m a desktop guy when it comes to hardware wallets. Old school.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:00:21
I’d still move $1-10 million at a time. Fee is low enough.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:28:53
Put that in your pocket and people will think you are happy to see them.
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:35:29
You would be helping the network and earn a little. You’ll earn more on the lightning network.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:50:51
John McAfee believes it is already there.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:30:20
I’ll drink to that.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:26:56
Bitcoin hands down.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:02:55
Retard is not a politically correct word. Stupid, dumb, and idiotic would be a better way to describe Coinbase. .
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:32:49
Do the math. It will be $100,000 in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:05:04
The big whale miners will get the lions share of it.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:31:39
Bitcoin Lolli getting some big boys to join in. Great job!
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:28:11
Send fiat to Coinbase or another fiat on-ramp and trade it for as much Bitcoin as possible.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:16:50
This is not the kind of press that helps Bitcoin. Can we focus on the positives
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:01:32
And probably to different wallets. That’s what the twins did, I.e. split it up.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:06:43
I’ll keep my crypto. This truck is fugly.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:26:37
I’ll donate the Trezor to charity if I win the car.
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:32:56
Bitcoin only. No problem. Let me use my Apple Pay to buy it.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:10:40
Book your travel with Travala using several kinds of
Crypto. It’s da bomb.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:05:11
Not that I’m aware of.  It’s one of the better exchanges.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:56:57
Of course. For thousands. How many times have you moved $313 million?
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:49:30
There’s value and then there is collectible value for rarity. 2 different measurements of value. Bitcoin will be scarce but that doesn’t constitute collectible value.
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:46:09
BTC is a HODL coin.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:26:23
History will look back kindly on Bitcoin and the Bitcoin early investors and adopters.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:23:50
For sure. HODL for a few years at least.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:05:59
It proves laws of physics.
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:12:40
Smart move.
@_date: 2019-12-09 01:40:41
Golds time is up. Move over for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:00:06
That video is from 2011. He’s a hell of a lot more diversified now.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:05:15
Sounds cool.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:18:39
Don’t send anything without copy and paste.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:10:06
2 years.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:13:27
And the winner is .... read the article.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:14:28
Probably no one is  going to be around in this sub going  to prove you right or wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:29:49
I thought Bitcoin was round.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:50:14
There are hundreds of miners. The whale miners won’t sell as much as other miners who are in it for a small profit.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:27:17
I’d be nervous as shit moving that kind of money. Imagine accidentally cutting off the last digit with your pinky finger by mistake and not seeing it on the verification.
@_date: 2019-12-08 00:13:43
100% scam.
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:03:04
Who wouldn’t want Bitcoin for Christmas.
@_date: 2019-12-05 04:51:33
That’s a shit ton of Bitcoin.
