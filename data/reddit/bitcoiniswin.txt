How can I sell my alt coin and trade it for the real btc?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:36
I buy $10 every day.  About the same time every day.  been doing it since June.  Not a terrible thing.  As for fees, the exchange charges .0025 on the $USD amount, so don't know what you mean about fees.

The fees can be deducted from your basis, I would imagine.  For me, as far as I'm concerned, my private keys were lost, and so there goes unrealized capital gains.  Nothing to report, unless you can report the loss.

Just move 100% of your assets into crypto.  Oh wait, nvm, we still can't transact everything with bitcoin, without converting it back to fiat first. When that day comes, I guess they'll get it as you spend it, like a sales tax.

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:14:54
Correct.  The exchange doesn't charge anything to send them it to my wallet.  I only pay a fee when/if I transfer somewhere from the wallet.  For now it's just HODL and accumulate, so no worries.

Went online to pay my property tax bill.  On $5000, they wanted to charge $218 too.  I said hell no.  I'll get out a check and send it through snail mail.  I guess they like having a bunch of paperwork come into their office that someone will have to sort, open, and key into a system, instead of just accepting the credit card without charging the user.

I can tell which way we're headed by comparing bitstamp to gemini.  At least for the last few days.  I'm bout ready to sell on Gemini to buy back on bitstamp.  Or buy on bitstamp to sell on Gemini.  Quick $30-$50 per bitcoin profit these days.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:28:03
yeah, they move all the time.  If they didn't we'd be at $10,000 in &lt; 2,500 coins.  But I don't know why they do that - but I'm not a trader.
Edit: I'm not selling, until such time I can pay for everything with bitcoin.  Then I will move all my fiat to bitcoin.  In a dollar cost average fashion of course, just bigger chunks.

Lot's of colleges let you test out of their classes.  Can still get your piece of paper that says you're able to put up with bullshit for four years straight.  Best if you don't have to put up with it for four year though.  Just like the other day when Spectrum communications asked "what would it take for you to come work for us?".  My answer was "work remotlely".  They were like well, besides that, how much money?  I stopped short of telling them to fuck off with their antiquated ways.  I have a nice job working from where ever the hell I can get an internet connection, so those asshats can go circle jerk in the conference room if they want.  I don't need to be there for it.  I don't have a piece of paper that says I know how to do my job either, and don't need it.  Not to mention how many fucktards I've seen with some four year degree, can't find their ass with both hands.

That means we're getting in on the ground floor.  I dreamed of the internet becoming what it is today, back in the early 90s.  It surpassed my wildest expectations.  Everyone thought I was a kook back then, the way I went on an on about it.

@_date: 2017-08-08 16:46:16
This is going to generate many follow-up questions, which I wouldn't have time to elaborate on, but here's a quick list off the top of my head.
Probably too much for the everyday person but:
VPN to the internet.
Encrypted e-mail.
Use disposable e-mail addresses, never your real one.  This also helps when you get spam, you can identify which site leaked your e-mail address.
Call blocker on mobile, that blocks all calls and texts, unless you whitelist them, meaning you allowed it. (wish they had this for e-mail).
Hide your social media profiles from the public, only allowing friends to see your posts.  Social engineering is the most commonly used attack vector!*** emphasis on this ***  Hide your City, state, schools, birthday, all that shit from Facebook, and even friends.  If they don't know, they,  don't need to know.  Don't share it with those sites that go external to do this and that as well.  You search for me on Facebook, you won't find me, unless I've contacted you and added you as a friend.  Only friends can see my posts.  Only people I know and trust are added.  (ok, well I don't trust anyone - but if I know someone - I trust them enough for Facebook.)
Use absolutely different and random very strong password for every web site.  This presents it's own problem of remembering them, but I have my own system.  You'll have to figure out what works for you.
Encrypt, then backup your hard drive.  Only necessary to encrypt and backup your personal data, not all of it.  Put Windows and all of your programs on the default c:\ drive, and your data on another drive.  Makes this easier.
Use virtual machines, with snapshots (requires more HDD/processor)  Also need to understand disk management.  Need to manage backups then, because the underlying VM drives will be constantly changing.
Use different browser profiles (look up Firefox profiles).  This helps cut down targeted ads too.  
Don't click links to sensitive web sites, type the URL directly to access rather than a link.
* Run Win-Patrol.*  Probably the best thing.  Anything new tries to run, or system settings changed, it let's you know and let's you decide to allow it.
The normal firewall and virus scanners and malware/spyware scanners, of course.
Contact mobile company and make sure they will not let you port your number unless you personally visit their store to present ID.
Physical access to your computer = root access.  Secure it's location.
I reference c:\ drive above as it refers to most people, but run Linux if you know what you're doing a little bit.  It is inherently more secure.
Don't provide your SSN to anyone, and businesses just because they ask for it.  Everywhere you go they'll ask for it, but 99% of the time it is not required.  You'll have a lot of fight on this one, but look into it.  It is not required, as much as they'd like to have it.
When you set up challeng/response questions, don't use real answers.  What really matters is if you remember the right word, not the right answer.  For example, "What is your first pet's name"  Don't use Fido, if that was his name, use Red, or some other word that is not the right answer.  This goes back to a system of remembering, but it's worth the extra work.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:53:36
Yeah, the 100 minimum is because they offer free shipping.  Doesn't have to be all bitcoins commeorabelia, get the 10 oz silver bar at zero over spot.  That's a good deal.  Can always sell it back if you don't want the silver.

But I don't understand, why I would want to do it.  Point being - I have the know how for the software part of it, and could work out the hardware part.  So since I can, where in the world should I go set this up to make money with it, or other non-monetary benefits.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:24:13
If you want something you can spend during the zombie apocalypse (assuming EMP and no bitcoin either), silver would be better to have.  Buying gold in small amounts (less that 1oz) has incredibly high markup.  Then again, cigarettes and ammo would be better to exchange in that scenario.

On an exchange, the bitcoin can be divided to a higher degree than the corresponding fiat, so sometimes the exchange doesn't round out to match perfectly with the fiat equivalent.  I was trying to figure out why there were pennies missing here and there.  I guess the exchange is keeping them, or they come out in the wash.  I thought of planning my trades to work out in my favor, but then decided my time is worth more than the .01 fiat currency.

I'm an IT Engineer at a very large bank.  It has not had an unscheduled outage in the two years I've worked there.  Worked at Fidelity Investments seven years.  Not once did the customers notice in the event there were a glitch on the trading floor.  In SEVEN YEARS.  Yes, Gemini owes me a fucking trading platform to access my assets.  That is the one and only reason to go through the fucking bullshit to get verified and get funds into an exchange.  If this happened at a real financial institution, heads would fucking roll, I can promise you that.  Gemini must be two guys running a server in the back room.

"If Bitcoin needs to scale, a second layer is necessary to preserve the security of the first layer which proved his resilency since many years now. I really think this is the good approach.

Not too late.  
1. Don't try to time your trades, just use Dollar Cost Averaging. 
2. Always hodl, never panic sell (or panic buy).  Rule  makes it easy to abide rule 
3. Not your keys, not your coins.  Don't leave lot's of coins, or cash, on the exchanges other than as needed to make transactions.

I already wish my credit card had a chip for bitcoin in it instead of fiat.  Eventually I guess.  Haha - Just remembered complaining because the chip takes so much longer than just swiping it, but it more secure.

Gold and silver, because you get a discount.  But I always buy more bitcoin back than I take out to buy gold and silver, just diversifying a bit.  Plus they give me 15 minutes to complete the transaction.  A lot can happen with the bitcoin price in 15 minutes if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:54:15
didn't happen this time.  Oh well.  lol.  Probably will drop momentarily back down in to mid 4300s again before making the next push.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:09:12
Then there was the conversion of credit cards from the magnetic swipe reader, to the chip reader.  Now you have to stand there about 15 times longer to do the same transaction.  Nope.  No one doing it.

I bought them immediately after bank transfer.  But have to wait five days for the transfer to clear before they will release funds, whether bitcoin or fiat, back to you.  Makes sense.  I wouldn't let someone leave with money until it cleared the bank either.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:04:59
Yes.  We need somehow to get them off their gold hodling and into bitcoin hodling.  But it is for sure too damn complicated for that generation.  Basing that on everyone I know from that generation.  They still can barely do the internet without fucking up their computer.  The ones I know personally.  Not making a broad generalization.

@_date: 2017-08-31 12:38:11
I'm guessing but as long as they have verification from the bank that the money is released to Gemini, would be the only reason they have to hold it.  You can transfer on weekends as well.  I tranfer a small bit every day for my dollar cost averaging.  Just watch that it isn't tied to a savings account.  After six transactions in a monty the bank started charging me $15 every time, and then converted it to a checking account.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:25:36
Whooossshhh.  Get ready for consolidation phase?  lol.  This would be my buy signal, but I'm dollar cost averaging.  Now if I'd sold at $44-- something, I'd be getting back in, minus transaction fees.  For a win.

@_date: 2017-08-25 11:22:16
That sux man.  But how long did it take to get confirmed?  They need to have an "are you sure" if a transaction is, say for instance, over a certain % of normal.

I'd love if they pump the hell out of them to $2750 a coin before I can split the shit and dump it.

Was just in the shower thinking... so if I deposit USD into a banking account and leave it for some time, then take it back out, how do I determine the cost basis on the USD for gains or losses on the value on it?  Since they print more money every day, it would always be a loss, so can I deduct my losses on the value of my currency?  This:

I asked 2 people one day when I was drunk at the pool in Chicago.  One from Mexico, one from India.  Both had heard of it, but didn't have any.  Once I explained it, they started writing it all down in their phones how to get started.  I guess I explained it pretty well for being drunk lol.  Only reason I asked is because they were from other countries so I wanted to gain a perspective from other parts of the world.  Trying to convince an American of the problems with trusting government (or Fed) with their money, it falls on deaf ears.

It's like the internet before AOL.  It started in 1985.  I didn't find out about it til the early 90s.  Now people have a pretty good idea what the internet is.  It's fairly ubiquitous now in most developed parts of the world.
Truly another ground floor opportunity to get in now.
Funny part is, most have no clue that their fiat currency can only exist by printing more money and extending more debt.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:50
My guess is there's no tax on the crap coin while it's still on the chain.  You haven't received it yet, so don't need to pay taxes on it yet.  Save it for a day when you need to sell it to offset your capital gains from the real coin.

I understand about hedge funds.  I've made money in the rare cases I've found a stock before they were big enough to be picked up by the big money.
But I still don't get the idea of market cap, when what we're dealing with is more of a currency (when it becomes fungible).
...multiplying a company's shares outstanding by the current market price of one share.  What are the shares being referred to in the case of bitcoin?
As an aside, we're seeing 150-200 coins go through in a minute or two in the 3300s range.  That sounds like hedge fund money, or someone has a big chunk of change to play around with.  I think they're going back and forth, accumulating small percentages on a large scale.  I don't' mind coming along for the ride.  A rising tide lifts all boats.

I agree - TA is bullshit, but if enough people do it, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.  That is the *only* reason it works in the first place.

Our high school was the first on in our state to offer computer classes on Apple II back in the early 80s.  That was a good decade and more before the internet became "a thing".  Hope it doesn't take that long, but if it does, consider yourself an early adopter.  To me - we're in the early 90s version of the internet with bitcoin.

Not me - I'll report everything I have to.  Just saying it's going to be hard to figure out the basis when shopping with it instead of sending back to the exchange for fiat, since they won't be sending a 1099 or anything to help us out.  
Been keeping track in a spreadsheet.  Been through this before day trading during the dot com days.  Fucking 20,000 transactions to reconcile to figure out if they were long, short term gains/losses.  And the online brokerages didn't do it for you back in those days either.
Had shit ton on losses to write off after the crash.  Guess I'll never see that money back at the rate of $3k a year or whatever it was.
Awful generous of them to let me carry it over $3000 a year.  Fuck them lol  loss.

I was going to buy gold for the reasons you speak of.  Then I found out it was cheaper to buy the gold with bitcoin.  I was like, wtf is bitcoin.  So then I bought the bitcoin, and just hodled it.

Don't know.  bitcoin is a disruptor for one.  But comparing to a stock, ie market cap, doesn't work for me.  A stock is when you invest in a company.  I think more of bitcoin being a currency.  Not familiar with trading currencies, but that would seem to be the proper metric to use, whatever it is.  Unless they're just trying to demonstrate how much of the world's fiat is tied up in bitcoin.

Not an algorithm per se, but stumbled across something doing my calculus homework that gave me an aha moment, and based on that can find sha256 hashed versions of my input that start with zeroes.  So to hone that down instead of brute forcing them would sure be worth figuring out how to do.

They were on an exchange during the split - and the exchange doesn't support it.  That could be one way.  Or split them, but then lost the wallet.  What are some other ways?  I'm sure I didn't get them.  I only have bitcoin, no BTC of mine was ever on any exchange anywhere.  I could follow the money if I exchange them for fiat somewhere, but that is not possible.

Amen.  When I started out working decades ago, I came up with an investing plan to make a million dollars and retire, and live off the interest.  Come to find out, inflation, gonna need a lot more than that to do what I want to do.  At least I can put some in bitcoin and detach it from the eroding buying power of fiat until I'm ready to use it.  Hopefully by then, I won't even have to convert it back to fiat.  It will be just like using bits moving between bitcoin accounts, instead of converting it to move through fiat channels, even though I haven't spent 1% of my fiat paper money in a decade or more.  Everything has been just bits flowing throw a network to make transactions.  Don't know why people can't understand that their "money" doesn't exist anymore than bitcoin does.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:42:19
Well, I'm following the guide about how to do it, but looks like to keep my private keys safe I need to set up an ABC Wallet and import them to there, then send them.  Then send the BTC somewhere else.  The guide explains how to do with online stuff and hardware wallets etc, but I don't have any of that, and don't want to open any more accounts to move them around.  I just want to send them to shapeshift to get them converted to BTC , then back out as BTC to my real wallet.  Someone from the other reddit offered to buy them direct, but I think I still need to get them to an ABC wallet first even if I wanted to do that.

That just means everyone's buying, no one selling.  So they have to go get some out of cold storage.  It takes 48 hours to go to the vault and get them, put them on a truck, and then a plane, then another and then another truck, to ship them to the delivery location.

That's what I did with mine.  I think I don't have to claim capital gains on them until I convert them back to fiat, on an exchange.  But since I'm hodling, I don't think I have to.  The trick will be keeping track of it for tax purposes, since I don't plan to convert them back to fiat, but to spend them to buy stuff eventually.  Got some complicated tax situations coming I reckon.

Was going to get a discount buying gold and silver because they give a discount for paying with bitcoin.  Ended up having 1/100th in gold compared to what's in bitcoin now lol.  As an aside - wanted to pick up a couple of the commemorative coins at  yesterday, but tried to use a credit card and was denied by the credit card issuer due to suspicious activity.  Loaded up the cart again to buy with bitcoin, and they were out of stock already.  That was yesterday.  I haven't checked on e-bay yet, but I bet someone bought up all 2500 of them to re-sell on e-bay.  Got some of these on the way though 
Edit: just noticed, you wanted to know how you can get into it, not how everyone else did.  Yeah - get your private keys and secure them as mentioned.  And dollar cost average.  I like to buy a little bit every day while I have my coffee and dick around on reddit.  Buy same amount, up or down, at regular intervals.  Don't try to time the market.  I've lost way more than transaction fees trying to do that.

This should be a sticky, and/or included in getting started.  That being said, bitcoin is still too complicated for over 99% of the population.  Nice to be in on the ground floor though.

same thing happens to me.  But I use dollar cost averaging.   Split up your buy in to many smaller purchases at regular intervals.  But still, everytime I make my buy, it goes down lower within the hour.  Lost way more in transaction fees getting panicked out before I got the steel balls to just hodl.

I read the guide, but doesn't speak to the desktop core wallet.  Sorry if I missed this somewhere else.
How do you we accomplish step 1 with Desktop Core 0.14.2 (Win)?
As a precaution, I've already copied the entire bitoin core wallet folder to another hard drive (not sure if that makes a shit, but won't hurt).
So if I'm understanding step 1 correctly, I need to set up another instance of Bitcoin Core, while importing the private key, and then send the BTC (and shitcoins ride for free) from my old wallet to the new one before I proceed to step 2?
Seems like there is an easier way since I already have the core and blockchain downloaded and copied, but if that is the way, I'm fine with it.  It's about clear as mud as what the few options in the core do.
My IT spidey senses tell me I don't have to download and configure everything again, but what the hell do I know, only been in the game a few months.

I don't think they do here in the U.S.  But they do have your address, government ID, bank account info etc.  But I don't think they report, so you have to keep records on your own. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:37:26
I guess people that have no idea what bitcoin is treat it like a stock.  I guess that's why TA works in spite of the fact that it is not.  That means we are still in at the ground floor.

But my original point - if your're one of the four billion people that don't have access to or can't afford the equipment to access the internet, not sure having satellites will change that?
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:24:11
Ah, that's cool, exactly what I was talking about.  But then I see the comments and understand the problem being where people who really don't understand come up wanting to get the value of bitcoin out of them (instead of the silver value) and get all bent out of shape because it's value only worth it's silver content.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:45:48
Yes, I meant arbitrage.  Never knew the words had totally different meanings.

Where in Chicago?  Did you actually send directly to their wallet address, or did it have to be converted to fiat first?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:53:15
I agree.  Fuck them.  Like I don't know how to Google something if I want to buy it.  Don't need fucking ad's shoved down my throat.  Anyway, they're fucking stupid and irrelevant, along with the rest of print media.  Who cares what they have to say.  Paper money can go the way of paper news media for all I care.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:52:50

Also, you can pay for them with bitcoin.  But HODL.

It won't take 3 more years to get to 100k.  So this chart is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:19:54
It was doing something.  It was losing value to inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:40:26
$10,000 is not moon.  That's not even a 30% increase from here.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:22:10
It's .25% or .0025 if it were Gemeni.  So a $20 buy would be $0.05 transaction fee.

Same here.  I finally gave up.  Mine was $500.
Sucks to lose almost your whole investment if it was just $100.  Gonna get an NSF from the bank too.  Might want to call them and very nicely beg for mercy.  Sometimes they reverse it.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:18:45
I have a meeting with our financial advisor in  a month.  I'll advise him that I took all the money out that has been laying around getting zero % interest after inflation, and will put be putting it in bitcoin.  I'm sure I'm not the only one by now, but if they don't know what bitcoin is when I get there, I will be taking the well performing investments elsewhere too.  The big bucks are tied up in tax deferred crap. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:10:51
Dang, was hoping for more free coins to sell.
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:56:59
Can't buy stuff with BCH.  It's not accepted anywhere.  Hence, bitcoin is win.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:59:33
haha - that's funny right there.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:13:30
It did - back in the tech trading days.  Used it in the Motley Fool forums.  (it used to be good stuff there).  We never used the acronym HODL, but we said "hold on for dear life" many times.  Iomega, ebay, cisco, aol, yahoo, Amazon.  Many ten baggers before the crash.  (the 1990s version of Moon).
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:51:29
Exchange fees are .0025.  The amount doesn't matter, it's still the same percentage.  You might be confusing the exchange fee with the bitcoin fee.

Nothing has changed the fundamentals recently.  Actually fundamentals became stronger with Segwit, and BCH fading off into nothingness.  Only speculators and panickers (aka weak hands) that have too much invested getting in and out on JP Morgan news.  IMO.

More people want to buy at the current price than there are people willing to sell at the current price is more accurate.  So therefore, there are more people willing to pay a higher price, than there are people willing to hodl at the lower price.  Also, Bitcoiniswin!

You haven't lost anything unless you sell.  Where did you hope to sell?  At $2,990?  I thought you were trying to buy the dip - in which case you may well be losing money.  Who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:56:52
I know right?  Because we already paid taxes on the money when we earned it in the first place.  Agreed.  Tax the f out of everything.  Damn thieving thieves.  I think not too long ago, people got tired of being taxed to death and started a revolution and threw off their oppressors.  This is the digital revolution.

Indica?  Or Sativa?  The both have their purpose.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:04:31
My impression is all they have is an automated bot.  I've never gotten a personalized reply from anyone there, for the few times I tried to contact them directly.  Pretty much you're on your own to figure it out, whatever your issue is, has been my experience.  That being said, they were the one and only out of three exchanges I tried that were able to verify me and get my deposit onto their exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:40:41
It's what's wrong (one of the things) with bitcoin.  Too difficult for most people still.  I have no doubt in time it will be resolved.  Just like before there was HTTP, there was TCP/IP (and a bunch of other alt protocols).  Great time to be a hodler.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:10:36
I'm ready to dump mine too.  Don't need a bunch of alt coins, just the real one.  That free money from China coin was sweet.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:43:55

Best way to dollar cost average.  I've been slowly moving my money from a 0% savings account (after you factor in inflation) into bitcoin.

Isn't bitcoin legal tender in Japan?
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:49:42
Regarding Gemini as an exchange - I like them.  All of them are overwhelmed and take forever (or never) to respond.  It did piss me off extremely when they were down for a couple days and didn't bother to send an e-mail to their customers though.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:32:42
If everyone paid off their debt, the central banks and governments will go broke.  They can't print more money without the debt that it was founded on.

.25% each way is the exchange fee right?
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:07:08
Just like the ancient Egyptians.  It traverses with you to the afterlife.  Actually, more possible for energy to traverse than matter, like gold and silver.  If you know your private key or passphrase in the afterlife - REDEMPTION!

It was 80% of the high a few months ago.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:37:20
Damn I'd like to know how this happened.  I'm in the business of making businesses invulnerable to this kind of thing, and it terrifies me that I somehow didn't get it right.
The information accessed primarily includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers.

Good argument for sales tax.  They'll get it that way.  Sounds reasonable to me.  I'd like to have a system where I get taxed on what I spend, not what I earn.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:32:43
Well, there's gonna be another big dip when they get the class action for not informing their customers.  Damn shame their customers have to find out through a third party (ie here on Reddit).  Fuck companies that don't e-mail you when your shit may have been compromised.
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:27:48
Incompetent people making really good money used to really piss me off.  I decided to join them lol.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:46:16
The exchange sold it to them.  Just moving numbers around in the computer.

i go in and ban for one year any nodes that are not at least 15.0 something.  If everyone did this, the other nodes might die off faster.  I probably have no idea, but maybe it's something.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:07:27
If it cost more than a dollar to print a dollar, they can just print more dollars to make up any deficit.  Kind of how it works anyway.  Except now just changing numbers in a computer.  Why not do away the the paper money altogether and just change numbers in a computer - based on some system with a distributed and transparent ledger of some sort.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:11:46
I couldn't use it instead of a wire transfer to buy my bitcoin though.

Wait til they send a 1099-misc or whatever, so you know how much to report.

So is this the big run up in bitcion we're seeing last 24 hours?  Everyone from Gemini converting to the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:27:37
Good.  Looks like China coin is dying - comparatively.  Let them eat fork.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:13:44
Why, because going up over 60% the last three months, even after the current dip, is reason to burn the place down?  Dollar cost averaging is win.

I think it's going to 3350.  Chinese have to get all their money out.  Once that's done, we can resume our normally scheduled launch.  Once the commie government quits fucking with them.  Don't they know they can't control bitcoin - only the exchanges.  Let them eat their China coin lol.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:53:00
They should get into the business of exchanging.  I doubt they have a legal way to invest in bitcoin otherwise.

Yes.  Was saving up to buy a nice truck short term, three to six months, but then turned into a year while I was on a consulting gig.  Then business took off.  Can't use the money from the business, but can use the stuff I'd saved up that was in my own account.  The business needs a truck, so I don't need it now.

Yes.  Of course.  How would you not?

So do we think this will be happening over five days?  
"BCH requests are not sent onto the blockchain immediately. The first time we will process all submitted BCH withdrawal requests will be Wednesday, October 11 at 1pm EDT. After that point, requests will be honored within 5 business days from the time of your request.

Should have rotated it 60 degrees to the right - or would have been your left.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:32:35
So everything gets converted to fiat by the merchant?  When you say you bought everything with bitcoin, to me that means you sent btc from your wallet directly to theirs.  Still cool you can convert it multiple ways, but would just be easy enough to load up a credit card and use that then.

There are also people with big $$$$ playing/manipulating the market causing the big swings.  But the overall current is hodlers adding to their position.  
There will be a day when the manipulators will dump a huge chunk, trying to scare out the weak hands.  This is how they make their money.  From those that bite and sell during the downswing.

it's down at times, but up mostly.  I'm dubious though - of the linear growth in the number of places that accept it.

But don't let fiat crash and burn yet.  I only have what I can afford to lose invested in bitcoin.  Fiat is still a significant (&lt;98%) of my assets.

They don't let you put $1000 in unless you wire it.  Bank withdrawal is $500/day max.  Kind of nice of them to let you trade with their money while your money clears the bank if you ask me.  Also makes sense that they wouldn't let you withdraw it until yours clears the bank.  Also - note that if you are withdrawing from a savings account, after six withdrawals in a month, the bank will start charging you $35 for each transaction, then will convert it to a checking account.  Found out the hard way.

They can keep their proprietary coin.  I guess all crypto currencies have value, assigned by the owners (people who buy and sell it), instead of some centralized actors just saying "believe me, it's great".  May as well be fiat if it's not open.

phone starts up.  Then a few seconds later after it gets started up, it reboots.  I know I can probably factory reset it and stuff, but before I do too much screwing around, I wanted to see if I'm going to lose access to authy.  I tried to get in real fast and get me a code, so I'd have access for at least 24 hours, but it restarts almost as soon as I unlock.  Stupid update to Samsung Enhanced features (S8 Edge) caused this.  Soon as I allowed it, this crap happens.  I've been denying it forever, but eventually got nagged to death and gave in.  I don't even use that stupid shit and wish they wouldn't force it on us.  Looks like if I keep the same number I probably won't have too much hassle with Authy.

It's the re-ordering of the transactions that is theft.  By putting they largest ones first, as they do, they can charge you additional fees for the smaller transactions, that would not have failed, had they not re-ordered them.  Get it now?  Pretty much what the original one said, but maybe you need to read it again.  Yeah, write a bad check, pay a ridiculously high fee, but let it be on the transactions in order.  Then again, whenever The Fed prints up more money, they are writing a check from an account with a negative balance, and they've been getting away with it since they day they started.

Gemini has done ok so far.  But to get your fiat into the exchange requires a wire transfer, or they let you direct draft up to $500 a day.  So I don't know about getting a $100k in there.  If it were me, I'd just do dollar cost averaging for $500 a day, since it swings wildly.  On the other hand, it's a slightly better gamble than to put it on red or black at the roulette wheel.  Meaning, it wasn't designed to take your money, but it could still happen.  P.S.  Let me know when he's gonna drop that $100k in, I need to buy some the day before.

@_date: 2017-07-19 12:04:54
They changed my savings account to a checking account for making too many withdrawals in a month.  The withdrawals were $500 transactions to the bitcoin exchange.  But before they did that, they charged me a $15 fee for each withdrawal after the first six.  I guess it was in my terms and conditions in the toilet paper brochure with the microfiche sized print they give you when you open your account.  I should have sprung for the microfiche reader and read those 20 pages line by line, and tried to understand what it all means, before the flimsy paper and lightly printed ink faded out.  No problem, they fixed it all when I threatened to move all my accounts from them, including my business accounts.  If you have enough money, they give a little shit, but will still try to fuck you if you and if you don't have enough money with them, tough shit for you.

Based on that, is this video (and countless others) just some people going on about "the end is near"?  not being a smart ass, just trying to get more information.
Also, I'm not that much of a pious American that i don't believe our currency will be the only one in history of mankind to survive.

Replying to my own post, but that was just on one exchange and bitcoin.  Maybe arbitrage, pulling a bunch out, selling them on another exchange, while you get the cash to do it over again and back on the other exchange, the trickling up has occurred.  And it's not 24/7, so I imagine someone doing it while they're awake.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:42:37
Interestingly, I looked up what that means.  I will run the through it with that in mind, but fiat money so far has never survived.  I've been debating for a long time whether to pay off the balance of my mortgage, or refinancing to a shorter term.  Instead, I also consider re-financing into a 30 year loan, taking out the maximum loan-to-value, because of inflation, it would be like paying with monopoly money at the end.  No wonder the HARP program they want to get everyone into 15 and 20 year loans.  I've coined a phrase "he who dies with the most debt wins".  With the rest being small, regular, off paper transactions buying un-trackable instruments, such as bullion and cryptocurrency to build up a store of wealth that doesn't get taxed (stolen from you by the government) when you die, or more importantly, when fiat implodes, or some other government BS where they try to steal it to pay for their incompetence.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:57:06
I've heard this from friends.  They think I'm a kook.  lol.  So be it.  I'll just keep trickling in the same amount, at the same intervals, indefinitely, until the point I start using it to buy things with it, instead of the monopoly money.

I say it will be at $3000 by tomorrow.  Why?  because a have a crystal ball lol.  But, my balls are not made of crystal.  I did crack for five minutes today to try and jump out, but got back in five minutes later at $20 USD higher.  Need to keep the exchanges rich on stupid shit right?  I know they love the trade fees.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:05:28
Gemini takes five days for the funds to arrive, but they let you trade as soon as you make the transaction.  You will have to wait the five days if you want to withdraw though.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:43:32
Who all is switching to an alt coin during that time, such as etherium, etc?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:05:13
Like even between bitstamp and Gemini is about $25/btc right now.  But I haven't run the calculations about how big of a trade you'd have to make before the fees would eat you up, and also the timing.  When my contract ends on my current job, I'm going to look into it.  I can see where it would take a great deal of time to research and test methods.  And also, bound to lose some money working it out.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:16:50
I'll give you that, but fiat money is based on debt, and is destined to fail.  There is no mathematical model that proves otherwise.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:56:46
Just buy $5, $50, $500, $5000 a day/week/month.  Whatever your range of comfort is.  It's called dollar cost averaging, and protects you from wild swings.  As long as you still believe in the reason you wanted bitcoin anyway, there is no reason to sell, only reasons to buy as it goes down.
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:34:04
my bank started charging me $15 per $500 withdrawal because I made too many in one month.  I plan to pay them a visit and pull ALL of my money from them.  Damn thieves doing all they can, but I don't care if they burn.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:15:14
Saved me a bunch of transaction fees.  I was trying do dump during that ride down.  Now we're back to where I was trying to dump at.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:46:34
My crystal ball says yes. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:37:19
Here we go, up again.  lol.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:55:47
oh don't worry, I was almost retired back in 2000, I know about margin, and no way would ever use it to buy bitcoin.  I was asking if that is a thing, and would explain a downward spiral, just like going up squeezes out the shorts.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:01:14
The desperately need it down so they can back up the truck to buy more.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:03:23
.00000001 bitcoins are currently less than one cent USD.  If they can't figure out the number doesn't matter, it might not be for them.

I was more concerned with handing out my bank logon and password.

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:59:11
lol, just goes to show how fucking retarded they are lol.  Government morons still ignorant AF.  Banks will tell them what to do, I'm sure they're wondering what to do with all their fake money everyone is exchanging to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:18:25
I can answer this.  You did watch the video I posted in the link right?
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:00:09
yep.  then when is when that currency is on it's last legs, everyone will want something else, and we'll have it.  To hell with going with a backpack full of bills to buy a sandwich like they do in Venezuela.  And then they just weigh it instead of counting it.  Feel bad for them.
Personally, I'll be glad I can take my bitcoin and go somewhere else on top of it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:27:51
Do you know how much that is in %?  That's what's important.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:36:15
Not more than I realize.  Check the volume on weekends, vs weekdays.  Easy to see.  Little guys don't have a reason or resources to play all markets and exchanges simultaneously.  What attackmycrack said, up= fundamentals, down = manipulation.  Higher highs and lower lows over the long haul.  HODL&gt;
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:57:21
When there is a big price drop, go to the website of each one and choose one that isn't down.  lol
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:37:23
Thanks.  That was the answer to the question that I should have originally asked :-)
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:16:56
Have you noticed that support moves further down the line as it is approached?  lol.  Using charts as tea leaves for investment decisions.  Whatever works for you though.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:17:45
Indeed, I got approved for T1 in less than a day.  I just want to offload my shitcoins asap, so needed somewhere to do it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:33:18
This is cool. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:45:12
But the servers are sitting there running anyway?  ASICs are going away soon (for bitcoin), then bitman goes off the chain with their own hash power.  This is hypothetical, no way I'd put this on my companies servers, but I'd have no problem hacking some servers in China and North Korea and running on their shit.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:16:55
Just trying to login, trade, etc, taking minutes.  Tried to cash out at 2822 when that big drop started.  By the time it's over now were down to $2770.  Now trying to cancel the order, will probably get filled while the price spikes up again :-(
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:05:49
I think it's like trying to exit a burning building, where they only have one exit door, that only opens inward.  Probably they can't ramp up fast enough to support the sudden demand, but being unregulated industry, nothing would surprise me.  Let the free market decide instead of regulating them though, they will get their commupins either way if they don't fix it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:26:21
IPs can be spoofed, can they not?  Edit, spoofing would not meet your objective.  
What you could do, however, is get a trial Azure account, create a proxy server, and let that be your intermediary.  I use this as a proxy all the time, but there are probably easier ways if you just need to do it once.  
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:56:41
I meant, how to you pay for something that only has a value of $ 0.000003 USD.  I guess I was arrogant and ignoring the other fiat currencies around the world that might actually have that low of a value.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:49:24
Now this, double down, lolol.  
This they say while we're up 2.5% for the day.  I'd take that all day every day.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:36:17
Crap, I haven't checked it for a couple minutes, almost missed something.  Damn work is suffering from staring at that chart all day, and then seeing what I missed in the forums, then checking the chart, then reading the forums....
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:23:07
What if you are a systems admin at a very large organization, and they're all just using 1-5% processor, and have access to thousands and thousands of servers?  Just set up a miner on each one?  Or does it have to use an actual GPU?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:58:45
yeah, I see the problem.  Next time they need to send $4 billion to a terrorist state, they can do it in bitcoin and no one will know.  I say let them buy as much as they want, just rises the tide for all boats.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:24:30
hmmm, me too.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:54:09
Also, thank you for the insight.  I'm not closed minded to just make up my mind on something and not consider others' feedback.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:34:47
If bitmain or whoever gets their way and goes off on their own and takes their chain off into oblivion, the hashpower they take with them mike make it profitable for mining the real bitcoin again?  of course I'm a noob, so could be completely out in left field.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:06:36
Get EUR, buy bitcoin.  They can probably put the EUR right into your bank account.  Then with a few taps on the keyboard and clicks of the mouse, you can turn them into bitcoins.  But I like where you're going, I'd love to see fiat money go away (which it always does on it's own anyway eventually) in favor of something that isn't based on the Federal Reserve of the U.S writing checks from a bank account with zero dollars in it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:45:15
Amen, I do make my own generally.  I was more interested in the experience.  I don't even like Starbucks that much, but I'd visit them occasionally just because I could pay in bitcoin.  In the last two weeks I've become obsessed about ending my reliance on fiat (why didn't they just use the word fake) 
money as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:46:30
Welcome to the morning sell off.  Every day, I wake up and check.  Take a shower, come out, selloff.  Then it slowly tweaks back up to mid afternoon, when there's another sell off.  Been thinking of day trading the swings, but am just a HODLler.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:34:12
Instead of buying smokes or beer, I gamble that money on bitcoin.  Better to gamble with just money, instead of gambling on health.  If you don't have any vices, this might not work for you.
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:30:19
Good job.  I am 100 times more likely to visit an establishment where i can pay with bitcoin, rather than local fiat.  Wish it were ubiquitous.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:31:13
I'll check it out, and also Gyft.  For clarification though, would one be transferring actual BTC to the merchant, or the fiat equivalent?  If it's the latter, not much benefit of going through the extra hassle?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:32:10
I see a few here in the Chicago, but there's never anyone getting shined.

@_date: 2017-06-27 17:39:18
Don't know if jmbullion.com ships to UK, but if they do, you can get discount paying with bitcoin over paying with traditional methods.  The reason I was going to buy metals was to get some position out of fiat.  Then I noticed it cheaper to pay on their site with bitcoin than credit card.  Then I bought the bitcoin and decided to just go with that, instead of the metals.  Still might take them up on their 10oz silver offer at spot, with free shipping though.  That's a pretty damn good deal.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:06:08
Also, every other page, there's at least something about Coinbase sux.

They need five days for the deposit to clear.  Not sure if because it's the same amount every day, but I don't see how that could be.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:36:42
What about micro(u) instead of milli(m).  Then a .00000001 when we have a million dollar bitcoin would be equivalent to .01 USD.  Here's to dreaming.

Look up the average lifespan of fiat money.  Also, let me know if you've found any that survived longer than the lifespan of those that created it, say 100 years.  Then also, look at what happens when it implodes.  Then look at how bitcoin is the perfect currency (outside of an EMP)
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:57:27
Just thought it most curious that it looks like a couple cats sitting there.  And how symmetrical they are.  Agreed, it is not a stock at all.  If it were, regulations would not allow it to be manipulated like it is.  I don't believe in TA, I think the reason TA works is that if enough people are doing it, it becomes a self fulfilling prophesy.  Anyway, the the fundamentals are strong with this one.  
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:14:07


How about getting money out? I've been transferring in every day, but it's been over ten days, and they still say I can't transfer it out. I tried doing a few cents just to check.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:25:21
all but 2, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:17:23
Now we know why the drop - margin calls.  Followed by more margin calls.  Once people give up on chasing margin calls down the rabbit hole, we'll be on our way again.  Then there will be the shorts, which we will grab by the shorts and twist.  Didn't even know you could short and margin bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:56:03
I just looked at the faq on their site.  They don't mention.  So if anyone knows, it's someone at Gemini, and they haven't made it public knowledge.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:05:08
so there are some examples of fiat money that have survived and thrived?  Cool.  Would like to broaden my horizons and learn about it.  Examples please.  Respectfully yours,
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:37:02
I'd heard of bitcoin through the years, but never really looked at getting into it, thought it was just some geeky thing (even though I'm a geek).  Went to buy some gold/silver, and they wanted to charge me a % for credit card, but not bitcoin.  So I says, self, I'm going to get me some bitcoin so I don't have to pay they credit card fee.  Then self gets bitcoin, and decides not to get the gold, and HODLs.  Long story short, I would pay with bitcoin before I'd pay with $, all else being equal.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:26:20
Took them a few days to hook mine up.  Super high volume, everyone crowding the door trying to get in.

Just put all your gamling money into bitcoins.  That's what it is.  A big gamble.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:14:52
The point was, that everyone is not panicking out of bitcoin to buy other alt coins.  The fundamental reason for investing in bitcoins has not changed.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:38:29
This is pretty cool, but I don't know if there is something better, being a noob and all.  Buy pot - or do you need pot coins for that?
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:33:20
My theory is to load up in little bumps, so as not to spike the price, and then dump in a big chunk.  Some kind of manipulation.  Trying to figure out how it's done.

They wanted a picture of my ID, and for me to enter the username and password of my bank account on their web site.  HOLY WTF way to get into the game.  But I did it anyway.

I bought bitcoin in order to buy gold with from an online merchant.  They charge a transaction fee to buy gold with a credit card, but not with BTC.  But then, I decided I'd rather have the BTC than the gold.  lol.

I shall run some test scenarios, but yeah, I don't blame anyone for not spreading the word if they know how to do it.  When enough people are doing it, the prices will be much closer on the various markets.

That's what they keep saying.  Why tell people it actually works, or that we can shoot them down with lasers when they exit the atmosphere?  Why would you tell them any of this works.  Let them find out, for the few minutes they have left, that these things actually work and do exist.  If Obama didn't dismantle it all.
