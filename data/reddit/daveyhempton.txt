I support BTC, buy stuff using cryptos, and I support the block chain technology. I have even worked on multiple projects related to them. However, when something loses 80% of their value because of some shady market manipulations you have to warn people. I would love for BTC to not fluctuate like it does as I believe in the original vision. It should not be a get rich quick scheme and HODLers are not helping its case.

I never said it's cryptos fault. It's their fault because FOMO but you can't deny that market manipulations wasn't a key factor. I am pro-crypto but a currency should not be so prone to influences. We as a community need to buy and sell stuff using cryptos and not trade/HODL them and dream of getting rich overnight. That's how you fix this issue

I am not a big fan of his but the point remains regardless of the logo. BTC did go down from 20000 to 3700 and the graph is actually correct. If comedians don't Make fun of something which lost 80% of its value in less than a year, then who else would.

It dropped like 96%, but this is not about comparison. The point is that cryptos are volatile and people should know the risks associated with them. A lot of people lost their life savings because of FOMO and that bull run in 2017 did more harm than good to cryptos believe it or not because people tried to use it as an investment and "get rich" scheme rather than as a currency which is what it is. Now because of the volatility, it's hard to use it as a currency, however, it has been less volatile comparatively in the past 6 months up until the latest bear run than ever.
