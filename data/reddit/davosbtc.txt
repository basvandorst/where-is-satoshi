To be the secure, robust system we need Bitcoin to be it must remain an open-source, distributed network. As open source software, anyone who is able can craft software that handles the core protocol in whatever way they can imagine - so long as it does not violate the fundamentals of that core protocol.
As a distributed system, there is no central point that can be appealed to for the prevention of such developments as may be seen to be enhancing of anonymity. Any development that is of benefit to someone capable of developing that facility will therefore be inevitable. Any development that is financially valuable, even if not of value to the developer, will likewise be inevitable.
Any technology that allows a drug cartel or terrorist organization to obfuscate or perhaps entirely hide their finances from Governments also enables dissidents in totalitarian states to do the same. There are some States - indeed, in the opinion of many (including myself), all States - that have as their fundamental operating principle the idea that the State quite literally owns the people who live within its arbitrary borders (and all of their assets) with even more authority than any such arbitrarily domiciled individual can claim to own any part of their own property (as the State can enforce their ownership with violence and prevents the individual from doing the same - especially against the State).
The technology that enables an agent of violence to protect their assets is the same technology that enables the slave to do so.
It is unlikely, at this point, that Bitcoin core will do more to enable anonymity - indeed, it is wholly conceivable that it will do more to disable such action. This is unfortunate, but perhaps desirable. 
The core will continue to trend more toward the pro-Statist agenda - and will, in so-doing, encourage newer and better anonymity technology developments from the outside.
The only things the core developers can do to eliminate the ability of outsiders to develop anonymity technologies would at the same time destroy the features of Bitcoin that lend it its value over the traditional financial systems. 
For that reason they will not make the most extreme of those alterations - and any indication that they will would result in massive flight from the protocol to others which promote the freedom and security that give Bitcoin (as it stands) its value... thus destroying the value of Bitcoin (which represents a large part of the personal wealth of those who would be responsible for such changes).
The reason bitcoin is doing well is, as you've said, because of investment from legacy financial sources, with legacy financial methods, under legacy financial regulations (at least in exchange rate terms). 
The same features of Bitcoin that are valued by those making such investments are those features that enable the development of auxiliary "Dark" features. The fact of the existence of programmable money is of obvious financial benefit to those in the clear, but is of no less benefit (indeed, is of significantly more benefit) to those in the dark.

Its like the Electric Car. The original cars were electric. It met basic needs better than horses and it had a lot of revolutionary features (transition from barter to commodity currency) but it was replaced by technology (internal combustion:fiat) that worked better in a modern world. But there are a lot of negative side effects of the replacement technology (availability / cost of fuel, pollution : debt, inflation, government supported cartels). Now some really smart people realize that we can combine a few modern technologies and build a better system. A few years ago the tech was new and not at all ready for prime time. But the tech is being refined, the necessary infrastructure built. It's still very early, mostly still just enthusiasts and techies, but if you think internal combustion has another 50 - let alone 100 years left, you're not paying attention.  (on my phone)

This has to do with how currency codes are actually created. XBT is [X]{BT} where X represents a non-standard exchange currencies or commodities for forex markets (such as Gold = XAU, Silver = XAG, IMF Special Drawing Rights = XDR). 
For nation-specific currencies it works the other way [BT]{C} - which would (for our purposes) be ["bit"]{coin} in the same way that [US]{D} = [**U**nited **S**tates]{Dollar} or [GB]{P} = [**G**reat **B**ritain]{Pound} ... except we *cannot* use [BT] - because it is already assigned to Bhutan.

The risk profile of an investment you cannot exit is, obviously, extremely high. Without liquidity an investor (in Bitcoin or a new business in the bitcoin sphere) would be forced by that risk profile to risk less. The liquidity on the fiat/bitcoin exchange, and the health of that exchange (globally, not in reference to a single platform) is absolutely essential to the real investments in the space.
Perhaps VCs would be investing millions of dollars in Coinbase and Bitpay and Circle and the myriad new things they are funding in the bitcoin space if there were no liquidity on the fiat/bitcoin trade... but I doubt it. 
Moreover, you see a number of new businesses that are being funded with bitcoin - but without fiat/bitcoin market health what exactly are they supposed to do with those bitcoin? If there is not a healthy market for exchange between bitcoin and a currency a landlord or utility will accept (not to mention the men with guns who, especially this time of year, are out in force reminding everyone how much not going to jail costs...) then who can accept a job that pays in bitcoin?
It is impossible to overestimate how important to all business development in the space the global fiat/bitcoin trade is - and so its a good thing we have traders out there maintaining even the shallowest of liquidity pools.
We certainly need more people developing and funding new projects in this space. These projects are what make the space what it is. But the currency markets are what make the space real, and not just a game.

My only issue with your statement is that you claim it requires misleading the majority to convince them that stealing other people's money is in their best interest.
In a purely abstract sense, if there is zero risk to you in doing so it is obviously in your best interest to steal anything and everything you can. The only thing that balances this out in representative democracies is the ability of the minority to influence the politicians and bureaucrats through corruption - which is equally bad.
I can't think, at the moment, of any definition of State that doesn't resolve to violence of [x] against [y] (which leads, inherently, to retaliatory and preventative violence of [y] against [x]) as its modus operandi.

For gifts such as these (not from family) they would be taxed, I believe, as income. One would hope that Break paid the tax as well though, otherwise (given her probable financial situation) I imagine she'd need to sell the car or something.
As far as bitcoin goes - it makes no difference in this case. She would owe taxes on receipt of the bitcoin as income in the same way she would owe taxes on the car. 
The realization event you're referring to has to do with capital gains taxable events. If the price of bitcoin were to change between the time she received a bitcoin tip (which she would have to report as income by itself) and when she sold the bitcoin, she would owe tax on any capital gains.

Do you have Amazon Prime? Prime Patry is one way to do it.
Another would be to use the normal Amazon Grocery site. Pair it up with  as opposed to snapcard or gyft and you would probably save an additional 15-30% on top of what you would normally pay.
With either of these, you're going to be skipping fresh foods though - which are important. But if I were eating into my BTC principal I would be doing so as cheaply as possible.

The commodity value of gold is a fraction of the market price. The market values the monetary use, not the commodity use. It is true that if there were no monetary use of gold it would still have a price - however this is also true of bitcoin.

Indeed. 
One thing about this deal is that it gives the BitPay merchant acquisition team a barrel full of fish who are at least known to have the necessary equipment already installed to handle the transactions.
One hard thing about converting a brick and mortar retailer is that not many of them are using android tablets at POS - so they either need to buy one or they need to make some other annoying accommodation. 
So yes, the deal is a good one if for no other reason than letting BitPay know who to target for further sales calls.
The bitcoin user can (for the most part) be expected to know what they're doing. All we really need is for the installed POS to show us a QR code that we can scan and then to tell the clerk or server in bright money-green letters that all's well and the bill is paid and they don't need to think about it anymore and they can disregard the wizard who will be leaving shortly.
And of course most clerks and servers are by no means idiots, and many of them will be curious and ask about the whole thing - but for merchant adoption to actually work the whole process needs to be free-as-in-beer to set up and apple-level-idiot-proof to use... if not actually available on iOS.

The main problem, IMO, is that adopting bitcoin as a merchant is only free-as-in-beer if the merchant is already using a compatible POS (tablet, etc).

Basically a certain POS system will be technically capable of accepting bitcoin payments. The retailers would still need to sign up with bitpay to actually process these transactions. In this sense it's akin to how Shopify sellers can elect to accept bitcoin transactions. 
The 6000 merchants stat actually underestimates the potential penetration, as some of these merchants are nationwide and international chain stores and restaurants with as many as 1600 locations under a single merchant. 
But, again, the merchant would still have to elect to enable the service. 
The real superdeal would be one where a merchant solution (such as Square register) adds it as a payment option directly integrated with their current system and unlocks hundreds or thousands of merchants at once who don't need to actually do anything to enable the option.

They did make the point, too, that Black Friday was down for all merchants - although I think if you were to look at the Wednesday - Wednesday week book-ending Thanksgiving/BlackFriday year on year you'd probably see growth.
That is to say that BitPay is answering the question "How much did you sell" with "Black Friday was down 11% from last year for everyone", which is another way of saying "we sold less, but so did everyone else"... except everyone else didn't sell less, Black Friday was just less of a contributor to the week's probably positive sales than it has been in recent years.

Demurrage will likely never work for a novel cryptocurrency (see: freicoin). People need to have a reason to adopt the coin in the first place - and a promise that it will be worth less in the future isn't the best way to go about that.
It's ironic that the same people who vilify deflationary currency still somehow manage to believe in 'the wealth effect.' Perhaps because that is an observably true phenomenon.
As people feel and are richer, they spend less as a percentage of their wealth but significantly more nominally.
A deflationary currency is a currency with the wealth effect built into it.
Obviously no monetary policy can make fiscally irresponsible people behave responsibly, but it *can* make even moderately prudent financial planning a new source of wealth.

I think it would be interesting if or Coinbase took a page out of the Google Local book and expanded the Bitcoin economy by hiring independent contractors (namely the community) to do merchant acquisition on commission. 
10% (or even less) of BitPay's fees collected from merchants would be more than enough to get people out there generating leads and new sign-ups.
Not that I'm trying to tell them how to run their business of course - but they aren't alone in their space and the business that really takes advantage of the community like this will reap the benefits.

You'll get a lot more value for your bitcoin if you buy groceries with the BTC and cook for yourself.

If you don't have one of those convenient to you, you'd still be getting a better deal buying provisions via Amazon. When you've got nothing but BTC to subsist on, one imagines you want to be as stingy as you can be and stretch the money as far as you can.

The problem that is being expressed, I believe, is that while The Foundation may be paying Gavin and some other devs - the rest of the things The Foundation is doing are basically evil (in the opinion of some/many).
The advocates of alternate methods of paying the devs who contribute are basically saying "we want a way to support the devs that doesn't also support the rest of the actions of The Foundation". Anyone wanting to support the Foundation's other missions would, of course, still be free to do so.

Assuming the latter...
Seeing as the Genesis Block was mined in January of 2009, the percentage increase since 2008 is infinite. 
The first well documented real conversion price for BTC was on May 21st, 2010 when some pizza ($25 value) was purchased for 10,000 BTC.
Using an exchange rate of $0.0025 per 1 BTC we can then calculate...
* An overall growth rate of 40,000,000% (at $1000/BTC)
* An *average* growth rate of 31,080% **per day** (from 21 May 2010 until today, 28 November 2013)

I find it hard to believe that he can actually place the amount of coins he's holding in such a way as to yield sufficient return - it may be that he is backing the deposits with his own shares (creating a sort of distributed margin account on a very tidy asicminer position) for liquidity - perhaps to reinvest (as he says) in direct collateralized loans - and perhaps to invest in other positions as well.

You only pay capital gains tax in the year the gain is realized. The tax rate is also different if you realized the gain within 1 year of the original acquisition and if you realize the gain more than 1 year after the original acquisition.
So if you bought 10 BTC for $110 today, and sold it on April 1st 2014 for $510, you'd owe short-term capital gains (&lt;1year) on the $400 in gains when you file your 2014 taxes (whatever rate you pay in income tax).
If you waited until April 3rd, 2014 and sold your BTC for $500, you'd owe long-term capital gains (&gt;1year) on the $390 in gains you realized when you file your 2014 taxes, which is paid at a lower rate than your standard income tax determined by your tax bracket.

* You can buy a 7970 on NewEgg for about $400. This will yield a hashrate of about 650 MH/s. 
* If you had this already that would yield a gross BTC return (assuming you used a pool) of about 0.042 BTC per day. At $90 per BTC that is about $3.75 per day.
* This will last for another couple weeks until the next batch of AVALONs have shipped... and ASICMINER has begun to deploy their next batch... and quite possibly BFL has started to ship some units - so you'll probably drop quite a bit, probably down closer to or below $1 per day.
* Assuming you pay $0.12/kWh, and that the TDP(W) of your 7970 not including the wattage of the rest of your computer is about 250W - you'll be paying approximately $0.72 per day in extra electricity.
* Assuming your amortize the cost of the card ($400) over the course of 2 years, the daily cost of the card is $0.5479 per day.
* The estimated operational cost of mining on the 7970 at full efficiency 24/7/730 (2yr) is $926.00 (2years of electricity + fixed cost of the card) and *would* yield $2737 of EBITA -- about $1811 before taxes and about $1267 after taxes ( IRS Tier) if the BTC price didn't change and the network hashrate didn't change - or about $52 a month in profit.
* As the hashrate WILL change you cannot possibly hope to earn more than this with a GPU unless the value of BTC increases at an average rate of more than the average rate of increase in network hashing power.

Depending on your level of skill you could spend the coins now - but it would require circumventing built-in protections in your client. Clients don't allow you to spend unconfirmed coins by default as there is always the possibility the transaction will be rejected.

Friends will think bit crazy but trustworthy when you bring it up - and this will lead to not crazy and trustworthy when they see it on TV - because they trust you more than the tv.

I use multiple strategies. I have a Chinese wall between my 'accumulation' account(s) - which I do scripted dollar cost averaging (purchasing a set USD amount of bitcoin every 15 minutes, all day, every day) - and 'trading' accounts where I work the spread and swings, occasionally with some margin.
I have a third set of accounts which I use to invest in bitcoin-denominated securities (ASICMINER, SDICE, ETC) as well as a USD portfolio that's waiting anxiously for the JOBS ACT to come into effect so I can get in on interesting BTC-related startups.
Once Coinlab takes over the US Operations of GOX I'm strongly considering a near-full jump-in, keeping only a hard-landing fallback position in USD and experiment with a full-time BTC-only (or near enough as is possible) lifestyle.

BTC users will adjust to use BTC as how they measure value once it is more stable or once they are paid in it or once they decide to. It's an enviable position to be in - from such a person's perspective everything gets cheaper over time... And never more so in the past or future (in all liklihood) than now.

@_date: 2013-05-29 14:06:05
The client where the transaction originates is connected to some number of peer nodes. When the client announces the transaction it is heard by the nodes who verify and broadcast it out to the other nodes who they are connected to. Some of these nodes are miners.
Miners queue the tx based on the included tx fee as well as other priority factors (size of tx, amount, age, etc) - continually pruning their own queue as transactions are included in blocks mined by other miners.
When a miner finds a block it will include the transactions in its queue that have not already been included in other blocks and which pass its own requirements test (ie, a miner could decide not to include transactions that don't include a fee).
Back to your original question, I think... the only way for a mining pool to do what you suggest would be if the pool itself was the ONLY node the originating client was connected to in the first place - and then not further broadcasting the transaction (listen-only mining nodes).
Miners may well do this, although it is only with their own transactions that they could have any reasonable chance of this actually working.
Extremely powerful pools and operators would be benefited (perhaps, and only marginally) by being able to avoid tx fees entirely on any size transaction (and pool transactions can be very data-heavy) by ensuring that their own sending addresses are whitelisted and that any of their own transactions will be included in their next block regardless of fees.

To follow this up.
The only real way to make subscriptions work is to have a 'bank wallet' that is able to facilitate your subscriptions. A wallet where an entity other than yourself has access to the private key. If you were to subscribe and confirm to your bank that you'd subscribed and agreed to recurring payments, the bank could make the recurring payment on your behalf (and hopefully email you when it did).
In this case you (the user) are forfeiting certain elements of privacy and control that Bitcoin affords us. I wouldn't want to use any sort of bank to hold much of my coin - but I might consider using it as I would any online wallet (such as the bitcointip wallet) - small amounts I deposit, maintain access to, and use either directly or hypothetically indirectly (as in subscriptions).

TBH I imagine VISA/MC/PP/Banks/Etc will probably survive. They have strong (albeit dishonest) relationships with huge swaths of people and will probably be ready to adopt BTC before the masses are. 
The way I see it is that they'll offer secure webwallets, green addresses, payment processing, etc. before even a significant minority of people are using BTC. This won't be universal obviously - many banks / credit unions will come late and miss the party entirely - but I'd be willing to concede the liklihood that we'll see a CitiWallet before we see $100,000/Coin... PayPal offering merchant accounts for BTC transactions (and personal webwallets) before we see $50,000 per coin... that sort of thing. MG and WU look to be onboarding well before even that... it looks to me as though they could make a business case **now** but will wait for more adoption and then gut LocalBitcoins/BitInstant/etc on cash buys... and will probably be the largest customers of BitcoinATM or make their own version of it.
I doubt BitcoinATM will ever be as ubiquitous as WU or MG locations.
And CC processors actually don't make **that** much off of each sale - they're just the network. It is the banks that underwrite the accounts that make the majority from fees... CapitalOne / Barclays / HSBC being prime examples that come to mind... visa/mc/amex/etc actually take a pretty small sub1% fee, but a fixed fee is always a lot compared to flat micro-fees on the chain.
It is the central banks that will be most affected, as they are the least competent and least flexible entities in the world - let alone the least competent and flexible members of the global legacy banking system. Banks themselves are private enterprise and will adjust - some faster than others - but the biggest brands in banking will almost certainly survive...
And that's a good thing, IMO. We need established, trusted financial players to join the party before the masses will adopt. We need the infrastructure to reach a point where before bitcoin usurps fiat the banking system had integrated bitcoin in such a way that account holders will barely notice that it happened (most people didn't have their gold confiscated when the US confiscated the gold - because most people didn't have gold).

This is the same concept as bartering. The thing is, whenever you trade an asset of any class for another asset of any class, as far as the IRS is concerned it is the same as if you'd sold the asset and used the USD to buy whatever it is you were trading for.
If you bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in January that same bitcoin would be worth well north of $60k now. You could use it to buy a nice car. If the car has a market price of $60k and you buy it with $60k worth of Bitcoin - as far as the IRS is concerned you sold your BTC for $60k and bought a car with it (even if you never had any $ in your account in this transaction).
In this case you'd owe capital gains tax on the $50,000 in capital gains you'd earned on the BTC.

BitcoinATM is a leading edge product that will have a large impact on this space - not just in its own roll-out but also in terms of igniting competitor products.
How many BTCATMs does the world actually need for serious usability?
There are 644 cities in the world with over 100,000 people living in them ([reference]( - or - which are their nation's capital. If the cost of 1 BitcoinATM is $10,000 (making it about twice as expensive as a standard ATM of the same class, it would cost "only" $6.4million to equip every such city in the world with at least one BitcoinATM.
Some cities are sufficiently large to handle more than one. Let us say that for every full increment of 250,000 residents we need 1x BitcoinATM at the moment. This expands our total need to 1375 BitcoinATMs to cover every major population center in the world ($13.75million with my hopefully very high estimate on ATM unit cost).
Imagine what this simple distribution would do for remittances, let alone just about any other necessity for exchange.

Post this question to and @_date: 2013-03-10 08:36:55
Again it would depend on the jurisdiction. In the US there are some states which are "origination" states, and others which are "destination" states. In an origination state the sales tax is only collected where the sale originates (meaning wherever the seller is). In a destination state the tax is collected where the sale ends up (meaning wherever the buyer is). In theory this means that if the seller is in an origination state and the buyer is in a destination state then sales tax is actually due in both places.
The clearest difference is that destination states tend to include a form in annual tax forms wherein a citizen can (effectively voluntarily) pay estimated or documented sales taxes owed but unpaid.
This is why in film and television one of the things people always seem to be messing around with when doing their taxes are boxes of receipts. Who keeps all of their receipts? The answer is people who don't want to pay a penny more in taxes than they are absolutely required to.
If you don't have receipts that add up to the actuarial estimate on how much you should have remitted in sales and other taxes at your income level you may well be left with a tax bill. 
Lesson: don't get audited. 
One use I can definitely think of for the Bitcoin Foundation would be offering professional certification for accountants and lawyers so that bitcoin users can make informed decisions and work with people who know what they're talking about.
Income is basically anything you receive in compensation for work done. Money is actually time, basically. You give me money you got for your time in exchange for my time and I can use it to compensate someone else for their time.
Very few things appreciate in value over time - but everything that does is subject to capital gains. When you buy something it costs X. If you sell it later for X+n where 'n' is a positive number then you owe capital gains taxes on it (unless you have a re-sellers license for the thing in your jurisdiction). Most tax systems differentiate between long and short term capital gains - meaning usually they charge less tax if you owned the thing for more than a year before you sold it. 
Short term capital gains is basically just another way of saying 'income', and usually is charged at the income tax rate. Long term capital gains is 'investment' and is usually charged at a lesser rate more in line with taxes on dividends.
For the Mt. Gox question I think Gox would try to argue that they are a marketplace (a la Ebay) and not a seller - which means in theory only the participants should be responsible for taxes. However, the fact that sales are basically anonymous and all items sold are fungible would suggest to me that Gox isn't just a marketplace but an intermediary market maker (which isn't legally where I'd want to be if I were them) - meaning that it buys all bitcoin from the sellers and resells them to the buyers.
In that sense whenever you sell bitcoin on Gox you can act as though the buyer was in Japan (until the buyer is Coinlab in which case the buyer will be in Seattle) - and when you buy bitcoin you can act as though the seller were in Japan/Seattle.
Washington State is a 'destination' state, meaning that if CoinLab were to charge sales tax they would only have to do it for sales to persons in Washinton state - everyone else would be responsible for their own taxes. Ideally of course bitcoin would receive some sort of tax exemption from sales tax - but that would require legal recognition first.
I think this discussion is purely academic though. If you're dealing with more than about $200k in annual income through various means you should have an accountant and a lawyer anyway - and if you're dealing with less than that its almost assured that you're actually below the reporting threshold on any of these taxes anyway.
And you don't owe capital gains taxes until you sell the thing or use it to buy something else. Until then its 'unrealized capital gains'.
Anyway - I just woke up at its 430am and may have rambled a bit.

To elaborate/clarify - when someone uses a credit card they can call their credit card company and do a "charge back" - you can't do that with bitcoin - which is why nobody will do it. Maybe if you had a very valuable reputation to lose if you committed fraud someone might do it on  with the thought that they'd be taking the same risk as a loan... But not until you stand more to lose from the fraud than the bitcoin seller does. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:05:35
It's an interesting possibility, and one of the few use-cases I can imagine in bitcoin-land where the chargeback/fraud risk in credit card processing is mitigated (as you, as a business, were already subject to chargeback/fraud risk as it was) - so if your payment processor was hit with a chargeback they'd just debit your account in the same way they do already. Its the sort of thing that can't really work if Bitcoin is the product being delivered but probably could work in a three-party transaction either with the merchant solution provider or your bank itself supporting the btc element on your end.

The issue here is that businesses don't pay their suppliers in BTC. If their suppliers and landlord and utilities and employees all accepted BTC, they might not have to keep much if anything in fiat - but we're a long way from there. 
The margins might allow them to keep maybe 5-30% of gross revenues in BTC - depending on their industry - but they carry with them a lot of risk on that front. If they are a regulated public company it won't happen until probably sometime after never or when their nation has abandoned fiat for BTC (whichever comes first).
The discounts that retailers CAN offer are almost exclusively related to the percentages they are currently paying for interchange fees (1.5-5% depending on debit/credit and network) - which on large ticket items shouldn't be ignored.
2% of the gross on an item that you have a 10% profit margin on is 20% of your profit.
A 2% discount on a book isn't much obviously, unless you're actually paying a lot more than 2% because you're selling low-ticket items and your processor has a minimum transaction fee (think paypal).
Anyone currently accepting paypal saves on the base nominal transaction fee as well as the % fee. You lose almost all of those savings when using a payment processor like bitpay or coinbase - but their fees will probably go down as well as they become more profitable.
 sells products at a 0% markup over wholesale and earns a slight margin on the exchange rate (although most of the margin in the exchange rate is BitPay's) - but BCS is a test-case, not yet a real endeavor.
The economics of running a business are a little tighter than you imagine - and the FX risk is a little more threatening than you imagine at present - and likely will continue to be until full adoption (which is so long from now - if it is to be ever - that is is meaningless).
The fact is that experimental bitcoin stores (like bitcoinstore.com) may lead to higher adoption once the market is large enough to actually support them in the first place - but any business not FULLY in the BTC economy can't really afford the FX risk of holding cash reserves in bitcoin and when the price is fluctuating by 10-20% a week (up AND down) one normal weekend swing could throw them from profitable to unprofitable with no promise of return.

Indeed. Part of the point I suppose is that this is entirely in excess of any and all other contributors of value (including basically any value BTC has right now) - all new economic activity that uses Bitcoin would be entirely additive. 
WolframAlpha does not know the money supply in Kenya, so using [tradingeconomics]( we get 1532.37 Billion Kenyan Shillings or about [US$18billion]( 
Based on a GDP of [US$33Billion]( we find that in Kenya the current velocity of money is about 1.8 - so lets say two. Inject THAT into the equation and what you get is:
* [**US$240.15**]( at 21million coins
* [**US$446.29**]( at 11.3million coins.
For those just joining us (lol): these are the values that a bitcoin would have to have if ALL bitcoin were exclusively used by Kenya, and only occupied the same amount of the Kenyan economy as is currently occupied by [M-PESA]( a high-fee digital currency system used by Kenyans to conduct 30% of all trade within the country... with their mobile phones.

The best machine you can pay for is a BFL MiniRig SC - 1,500 GH/s for $29,899. Of course, they've never shipped one... buy you can pay for one.
Assuming, of course, that BFL never ships anything but your BFL MiniRig SC - your 1,500GH/s will represent approximately 0.6757% of the total mining network if everyone else makes their numbers and no GPUs drop out. In any reasonable other case you will make less than that.
* 0.6757% of the total network is approximately 24.3252 BTC per day.
Assuming that there is no increase or decrease in volume on MtGox - you could easily sell 24.3252 BTC with zero real slippage from the market price.
You could actually do nearly twice that.

By 'electricity is free' do you mean your parents pay for it or your university does - because if your parents pay for it you will discover that it is in fact NOT free.
Network speed models for late April (the soonest conceivable time they might ship) and beyond don't include BFL at all, or are wildly speculative to the point of being useless.
I can tell you this much.
If BFL didn't ship ANY units except your little single - your 30GH/s would represent at most 0.01% of the total network or about 0.36 BTC per day.
At the current rate of $81 per BTC it would take you 22 Days to pay off the miner - so lets just say there is no way in hell that you're doing it faster than that.
HERE's the rub. A BFL you order right now won't get to you until at least June - although there's still a decent over/under spread on you ever getting it (personally I think you will... but probably not until next Fall if you ordered now). If you're getting it, so are all of the people who ordered before you. ASICMINER will continue to deploy and Avalon will continue to deliver before you get yours as well. Hell, they'll probably both be into their 2nd generation before you get yours.
What I'm saying is at this point I wouldn't recommend it - but as long as the BTCUSD price keeps going up and if your electricity cost is really zero... and it is a real thing in the first place... it will probably pay for itself before it burns itself out.

With the exception of cash transactions, all transactions (in person or otherwise) are "online" transactions. 
You don't have to wait for the confirmation either - provided it was properly announced or sent from a green address - but it's a good idea for larger purchases (more than a few bucks). The technical difficulty behind a successful double spend makes it not especially worth it for a cup of coffee or a sandwich.
If a retailer is using 'bitpay for retail' then 0-confirmation transactions should be fine.

In principle there's nothing about TOR that would prevent a DDoS - in fact such an attack would probably be more successful on TOR as it'd be much easier to disable the nodes between the website and the deepweb than it would be to disable the site itself (if it is as well protected as Gox is).
DDoS is a very difficult nut to crack. Gox is a target because such attacks are demonstrably effective in forcing the market price of Bitcoin down for a short period of time - and ANY change in price known to a party before it happens is basically free money.
Anyway - TOR is not a protection against DDoS.

Likely not. I think it's more likely that if you buy on coinbase you'll pay whatever price Coinbase paid for the coins whenever they bought them (plus their fee) or the market price plus their fee (whichever makes them more money).
As to what's better... Coinbase's only real benefit is the US bank account at the moment. Gox is a better service. But by the end of the month the Coinlab transition should have completed and we'll not be losing the days to the international wire transfer - or paying the fees to whatever service we currently use to fund gox accounts - anymore.

There's no reason to limit yourself to one or the other. Accept bitcoin in payment - absolutely. Offer to pay your sellers in whole or in part in bitcoin - absolutely.

Obviously there are things we like to price in sub-$0.01 increments, and one great feature of bitcoin has and will be its ability to account for VERY small transactions. That being said, very small transactions are already being encouraged off of the blockchain, and so there's no reason why such transactions can't continue off-chain indefinitely.
[There are good reasons not to extend the decimal place *much* further if it doesn't need to be done](

Of course. Margin loans can improve your earnings but can also magnify your losses.
If you borrow $2000 and buy bitcoin and it goes up 5% your earnings are the 5% less whatever you paid in interest on your loan. If bitcoin goes down 5% your losses are the 5% plus whatever interest you paid on the loan. If you sell at a loss you'll cover some, but not all of your debt.
I wouldn't advise margin trading in bitcoin for anyone that doesn't have the full cash reserve to back up the loan.
It is for this reason that most brokers won't let you borrow more than 20% of the NAV of your portfolio - they need the security to margin-call you. Bitcoin is phenomenally volatile and I don't know that we have these levels of security in our margin platforms (yet).

illicit goods and activities are one thing that bitcoin does well, benefiting from the pseudo-anonymous nature of the protocol and the ability to make it almost perfectly anonymous without going too far out of your way.
Another area that bitcoin is very well suited for is 'non-returnable' transactions - especially digital goods. Once you've purchased information of almost any kind there is no realistic mechanism for the seller to take it back - while with traditional systems there is a way for you to get your money back. The same benefit bitcoin offers to scammers is the one that would be very useful indeed to people who sell real information.
Bitcoin is very useful for very large transactions - it allows a very secure mechanism for such transfers, especially if time is of the essence and you can't afford to wait for the banks to process everything.
Bitcoin is hypothetically also very useful for EXTREMELY small transactions. While transactions valued at the mickey or satoshi aren't useful for open transactions, within a moderately closed wall environment they could be phenomenally useful. We don't really have anything in our economy that is priced at the satoshi level ( a satoshi is worth $3.3*10^-10 ) What COULD be priced at such levels? Who knows? Surely some sort of data could be usefully priced at those very small levels.
I don't actually believe its even possible for an economy to run strictly on bitcoin... maybe it is, but it's a very hard sell. At "full" issuance (there is no actual cap: bitcoin will always be mined - but the halving will eventually bring it down to an impossibly small amount per block) the currency should create a deflationary system in which everyone who uses bitcoin as their primary currency denominator will experience everything they buy at the consumer / services level cost fewer bitcoins over time. This is TERRIBLE for lending, and equities - and really any obligation that is priced nominally. For that reason even if the secondary currency ISN'T fiat (it could be a cryptocurrency that doesn't have a cap - for example... possibly an idea for an intentional fork down the road) there will need to be a second currency (at least one) in which debt can be usefully measured.

The answer to the question posed in your second paragraph is yes, the government would ban something even if it meant handicapping it's citizens in that market. They do it all the time. 
As to the idea of applying these laws to virtual fiat (such as in game currencies) I think what the thing is *for* may actually matter (not just how it's used). Cigarettes are used as currency in prisons (but that's not what they are *for*) - does that make tobacco companies money transmitters? What about tobacco farmers? Gold miners themselves are an even more obvious parallel. I think, back to the point of game companies, the issuers of virtual fiat make its trade for offline goods and services against the TOS so they can be seem as making best efforts to prevent the use of their virtual fiat as real money. 
When guidance first came out, on interpretation was that perhaps the miners are fine - however due to the 'creation' language Satoshi him/her/themselves would be a money transmitter.

As has been widely discussed, an over centralization would result in a crisis of confidence for this among other reasons. This would either result in a hard fork of the main accepted chain or transition to an altcoin. Which is why it won't happen.

Whatever you do don't file a chargeback - that's just unnecessary and has led me to tag you 'chargeback risk' even though you said you were just considering it.
That said, BFL will refund your order and you'll be doing everyone after you in line a favor. If you must, take the money out and put it back into BTC. With a January order you're probably far enough back in line that you are talking about a 1-year ROI at least, if not longer as the manufacturers get their collective acts together and start building and shipping with faster turnarounds.
My suggestion to any BFL pre-order is to either hold your pre-order until they start shipping and then sell it (or sell the rig when you get it) or to just get the refund and buy/hold BTC.

ASICMINER is a 'shareholder group' of Bitfountain, which is a legal/registered business in Shenzen, China and subject to financial and regulatory auditing by its beneficial owners (investors holding more than 5000 shares in this case - which, at 1.25% of outstanding shares, actually makes the threshold considerably lower than would be required by US securities law (for the benefit of other readers, beneficial ownership in the US is &gt;5%).
My point was that there's no obvious way to tell whether or not a business is 'legitimate' by your definition just based on how it raises funds or on what market it is listed.
I agree that Enron would be an example of an illegitimate business, but nobody knew or could know that until after it became undeniable. Enron was listed on a US exchange and apparently (albeit falsely) in compliance with all laws.
There is, of course, more risk in the bitcoin-securities space as there are no investor protections or an established legal framework (not to mention the fact that if the business were US-based both they and their investors would be in violation of the law).
It's more or less obvious that none of the 'investment funds' available on these markets are run by CFAs or otherwise licensed or accredited professionals... and not a one of them can put together a GAAP income statement / balance sheet / cash flow statement - but I'm not at all bothered by this as I'm in favor of people having the legal agency to make their own decisions and take their own risks... but that's more philosophical.
Coinbase isn't so much 'attempting to be legitimate' in my view, as the word 'legitimate' doesn't really add the right sense of what they're doing. Coinbase is attempting to offer a financial service to US residence from within the US, and as such is likewise attempting to comply with the regulations so as to prevent jackboots from stealing their money and their liberty.

When we have domestic banking access to the exchanges via Coinlab/SVB I'll be able to functionally sweep all USD deposits in my account (less my rent, perhaps, but I'll probably just keep 3-4 months of rent in a savings account - as I do already) and then withdraw from BTC once a month when I need to cut a check, as it were.
I can already do practically all of my shopping with BTC - as I do most of that online anyway. In some ways it would be more like living full time as a foreign tourist, where I know my bank account is denominated in **my** local currency but I'm buying in the foreign currency. I can just put basically everything I don't buy online on my credit card and then pay that off once a month when I'm doing my rent.
Obviously we don't have a US Debit Card linked up yet, but seeing as we have banking support imminent I can't imagine Coinlab and SVB don't have a thought on that in the near future - although I'd prefer to control my withdrawals so I might consider my current debit card as my spend account and just keep a set amount of USD in that as well and pull a little BTC out when I need to top it off.

Your local gas station charges you in fractions of a penny yet there is no such 0.001 coin. The current atomic unit of bitcoin is 1 satoshi and within closed systems this remains useful. That doesn't mean it's useful to the network to allow such small transactions on the blockchain. 
0.00000001 transactions are still possible. 0.01000001 with 0.01 returned as change is a possible transaction if you're willing to wait a long time for confirmation. More likely dust transactions only have real value internal to a service that doesn't require the blockchain to process transactions.

* Andy Bechtolsheim invested $100,000 in Google in 1998. This investment was worth $1.7 billion in 2010 indicating he held approximately 3.2Million shares for which he paid an average price of about $0.032 per share.
* Based on this his initial purchase would be worth $2.5billion today.
* This represents a 15-year ROI of ~25000% or ~1,666% per year (someone correct my math)
* Since January, BTC has risen almost 800%
* Annualized this is a implied growth rate (not an actual or predicted growth rate, just implied by the last three months) of 9600% per year.

If you have some technical expertise you can create a double-spend by sending all of the BTC in the source address to another address you control (the technical difficulty in doing this will depend somewhat on the wallet client you are using) - and by adding a fee to this second transaction so that it confirms first (and therefore wins).
When the original transaction confirms (which it will, eventually - we're not quite at the point where a transaction without a fee will sit in limbo forever) it will be seen as a double-spend and rejected by the network.
I've seen a few of these questions this week, which makes me think that either people are intentionally not using fees (they're cheap, use them) or are trying to get the collective to unwittingly confirm for them what they think is a loophole nobody's seen yet in the network's security - which the collective can't do because while double-spending is possible given some very complicated circumstances it's well defended against both by the protocol and by the accepted practice of waiting for confirmations in transactions.
If, on the other hand, you are the recipient of the tx you've brought up and you already delivered whatever the sender was paying you for... you may well have been cheated and should have been practicing better risk management. Check the balance and transaction history of the sending address to see if they've taken advantage of your naivete and double spent your money in a confirmed transaction. Wait until the tx is formally rejected by the network before reporting them as a scammer, though.

At the moment it is technically, nominally inflationary (even if its purchasing power would indicate it's wildly deflationary) - however if the purchasing power were static we'd experience approximately 0.03% of inflation over the next year.
At full issuance (when the block reward drops below the lowest used decimal - which doesn't necessarily have to be what we currently use) BTC will be deflationary in most circumstances UNLESS we were undergoing a global recession of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the deflationary aspects of simple population growth. (This assumes not just full issuance of Bitcoin but also full adoption by the global economy... which I think is not inconceivable as the state of affairs if bitcoin survives the next 120-ish years to the end of the block reward).
Bitcoin may be nominally stable in how much of it there is - but the cost in labor and technology and whatnot to produce the things you can buy with it are NOT stable - they get cheaper over time meaning we can afford more things or better things over time which is economic growth and is why what you can buy for bitcoin will never be 'stable', 'fixed' or 'static'.

What I find interesting is how often *they* (as it were) will tout the 'wealth effect' (of increased asset prices) as the key to unlocking consumer spending (people always spend more when they're richer... or when they feel richer) and yet are somehow opposed to a deflationary (in real purchasing power) currency which cannot but create a wealth effect at the broadest possible level.

It is manifestly impossible for 1.23456789 BTC to have the exact same purchasing power over any appreciable period of time. At a certain point it may have sufficient liquidity that fixed prices could work - but we're not at that stage of the grand experiment.
Pricing is easily done, however, by pegging the price to something else (just as gas/petrol is priced, for example). You could peg it to a currency or gold or you might find a different way to do it. The key is that purchasing power does change over time. Stores in the fiat economy need to change their prices every so often to account for the change in purchasing power. Obviously this is a slower process when you're talking about a market as deep as the dollar or euro or yen - but the changes *do* happen, and *are* needed to make the system work.
Bitcoin is in a state of rapid price discovery - the reason you don't want to set a fixed price in bitcoin yet is that nobody is really sure what it's worth (we're figuring that out). This is why you peg the BTC price to something we do (more or less) know the worth of, which we can then convert to BTC and which allows us to pay with BTC and for vendors to accept it as payment.

Quite simply the only thing that needs to happen for this to be the case is for a credit card issuing Bank (not the payment network, the bank that issues the card) to allow its customers to pay off their credit card bill in Bitcoin.
Once this happens, nearly all transactions will be possible with Bitcoin - indeed you'll be allowed to wait to decide which currency you pay with (usd/euro/whatever you used to use to pay off your credit card - or bitcoin) until after the fact. You can buy a TV priced in USD today, and if the time comes to pay your credit card bill bitcoin has gone up in value relative to the dollar you may elect to use that instead as an easy way to take some profits.

The USD value of bitcoin has no direct bearing on the value of BTC denominated securities - although it does have an indirect impact. It's reasonable to assume that people won't gamble more than they already do as a percentage of the purchasing power of their BTC. This would suggest that as bitcoin becomes more valuable the average bet on satoshi dice will go down in nominal BTC terms - although some or all or more than all of that difference may then be made up by new players. 
The elements that impact stocks traded in nominal BTC are their BTC earnings, and their growth of nominal btc earnings. 
The only thing an entity needs to do to provide shareholder return is to provide positive return on equity in the denominated currency. (ignoring confidence issues). 
Investing in btc denominated securities is like adding a multiplier to the risk you take investing in btc in the first place. Don't get me wrong, though, I do it.

The primary difference between investing and speculating is an understanding of the fundamentals. If you believe in the fundamentals than you can be wrong, but that doesn't mean you were gambling, it just means you were investing poorly. Speculating is what you're doing when you put money behind something that doesn't have fundamentals you believe in but carries with it other properties that you believe you may be able to derive advantage from.
Gambling is what you do when the fundamentals say outright that putting money behind the proposition would be a bad idea and the technical metrics bear that out.

The purchasing power of bitcoin is whatever someone is willing to give you for it. Right now we generally monitor the relative purchasing power of 1BTC relative to the number of USD someone is willing to trade for one - but how we monitor the purchasing power of BTC is subject to change should other tests prove more useful.

using days destroyed it would be easier than I think you appreciate. if velocity is weighted against some function of the last time the coins themselves were moved it would make it quite a bit harder indeed to game the system.
You'd need to move 2x as many coins you received today to meet the same number of days destroyed as coins moved yesterday. the deminishing returns would be extreme - you could even use a smaller increment of time - such as 1x the average block time goal for the altcoin.
it's still pointless because its a bad system in the first place (as evidenced as it being only half as bad as the shit system behind our real economy) - but, that said, its still an IDEA for a monetary system that could use a blockchain yet be sufficiently, philosophically different from bitcoin as to actually require a different implementation/coin.

I actually disagree with that. If the value of gold is it's usefulness as a currency then as more and more commerce moves online gold itself becomes less and less useful (and therefore less and less valuable). 
I don't see how anything can have use as a store of value and nothing else - so in parallel with its diminishing usefulness over time as a currency must also be a diminishing usefulness as a store of value.
To hazard a prognostication, should a day ever come when Bitcoin is functionally the primary currency in use in the world gold will have little more than its decorative and industrial value left to it - which would put it at maybe 50% of its present market value (which in turn is about a 50% markup over its per-ounce mining cost).

There was actually a completely shit article - but the only one that touched on this point - on the CLEAR party in the UK. If I find it I'll edit and link it. Basically the idea is that in the UK (and it's not that different in the US) to accept a donation a political campaign / committee / party / PAC / Super-PAC / etc you need to be able to know who the money came from and to prove that it didn't come from non-domestic sources. It is against the law, for example, for a political action committee to accept $500M in donations from the People's Republic of China - or any non-US entity. In fact, ANY money above the reporting threshold is required by law to be connected to a person/persons and for their nationality to be ascertained. 
Of course, if China wanted to they could just donate a hundred billion dollars to a US non-profit organization that ISN'T required to report that information which in turn could donate that money to a political action committee... but they can do that with USD, who cares if they can do that with BTC as well?
Any amount of money collected over the threshold - not just from individual donors but in aggregate - that cannot be assigned to an individual provably qualified to donate to a US political campaign must be returned to the individual. Ironically, in the case of bitcoin, this is easy - just send it back to the address it came from - no trying to figure out what to do with an envelope full of benjamins.
I definitely sympathize with the perception that people are easily led by the ear by advertisements - and there is demonstrable proof that people ARE influenced by advertising (and by extension propaganda which is just another word for advertising)... but if you think you're exempt from that just remember that EVERYBODY ELSE thinks that too - and they're all wrong.

People will only receive the same respect they give to others (to revisit my earlier point). I do not deserve your respect for MY right to individual liberty if I do not grant you that same respect.

I think, actually, that the way to make the actual need that this addresses work would be if someone would issue actual credit accounts explicitly for buying bitcoin - where a user's limit is based on their real credit - which is what they're risking by failure to pay.
Provide the security that people currently use legitimate chargebacks for with 2-factor authentication instead.
Then they have no reasonable claim because you've provided more than reasonable security - and your risk isn't chargebacks its just failure to pay - and you have the same cudgel that their other credit card issuers have to hold them to paying you back... not to mention if its legitimate debt you can sell it to recoup a portion (maybe 10% or so) of the money the deadbeats fail to pay...
Just a thought.

At the moment it doesn't look as though you'd need to - I haven't, if that's any consolation. If you were investing other people's money (if you had outside seed capital) you'd probably be breaking SEC registration requirements (unless you have a CFA or Series 7 and 66 qualifications) but that's a licensing (not a tax) issue.
The sense I get is that individual transactions aren't where the MSB issue comes in (unless you're a miner or Satoshi himself, depending on the various legal readings on the guidance) - so you wouldn't be an MSB, the exchange would be.
The MSB issue is for entities that are either acting as an exchange or facilitating access to an exchange (functionally acting as a broker, such as localbitcoins dealers, otc dealers, etc). 
There's still a lot of ground to cover between guidance and rule-making and legislation, and this is one of the reasons why we have The Bitcoin Foundation - so that we have a voice in how this all plays out.

(my thoughts, quite possibly non sequitor)
It's a fortunate thing that not everybody is piling on the bandwagon all at once. If all of the exuberance of this moment were for the monetary theory of the protocol and the incredible usefulness of the payment system/currency I think we'd be on much firmer ground if at a somewhat lower exchange rate.
That being said... this influx into the community, while obviously driven a bit too strongly by the fever dream of instant wealth, is also bringing the fundamentals of Bitcoin to more and more people. How many hundreds or thousands of new speculators are perhaps thinking about monetary theory or cryptography for the first time? Surely many. The sheer number of people asking questions such as "what backs bitcoin" doesn't indicate they don't know anything about bitcoin - it indicates they don't know anything about modern monetary theory period.
Bitcoin prices could crash down to the teens and this community and the network as a whole would be better off than it was the last time they traded at that price.

I dislike analogies like this, but if I were to take this trip with you I'd say bitcoin right now is more like Six Degrees than anything.

The question I suppose is: "what is the minimum quantity of gold" and then to compare that to 1 satoshi.
171,300 tonnes above ground
(171,000,000,000 grams)
868167716.80293 Moles
6.022 x 10^23 atoms per mole
 = 
522,810,599,058,724,446,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of gold above ground 
(because writing out gigantic numbers is fun))
Obviously this is too much to compare to 1 satoshi. If we therefore were somehow to peg the minimum possible unit of bitcoin to the minimum possible unit of gold to create an atomic unit of bitcoin it would need to be 1/248957428123202117 of 1 current satoshi.
However, decimals being what they are, we'd need to round up (which would be useful anyway seeing as there is far more gold out there than what's above ground in human hands).
So lets call the (temporary) new atomic value of bitcoin 1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000 of one present satoshi. 
This means that 1 current bitcoin is actually 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (100 septillion) atomic units (rather than 100million) and the total number of all atomic units in such a bitcoinverse would be 2,100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atomic bitcoin (2.1 decillion) or **[2,100,000 Hella-"Nakamoto"]( as I've just decided to call that atomic unit.

Imagine for a minute that instead of USD or EUR or AUD or RMB or BTC everyone in the world used Ripple. Everyone had their own fiat currency. Anyone can lend anyone money, of course... yet everybody for whatever reason refuses out of hand to take on any debt not denominated in their own personal fiat currency.
"Oh," says Sam, "I would very much like that car - how much is it?"
"Twenty-thousand Davebucks," says Dave.
"What's that in Ripples," wonders Sam (aloud).
"Nineteen-thousand, nine-hundred and eighty two," Sam replies after checking the app on his phone.
"Well that's about twelve thousand Samoleons," ponder Sam, with some annoyance. 
"Well, you can finance it if you like."
"You'll lend me the Samoleons?"
"Wonderful," says Sam. "You've got a deal!"
And the transaction is done. Over the next five years Sam dutifully pays back Dave in Samoleons which Dave converts to Davebucks via Ripples. But, after a while, Dave starts to realize that he's getting fewer and fewer Davebucks... how can it be!?!
Sam, you see, isn't a moron (other than insofar as he participates in this insane economic model in the first place). Whenever Sam gets paid in McDonari (converted to Samoleons via Ripples) he pays back just the principal on his loan and pays the interest in newly minted Samoleons. Every so often, he needs to repay another loan - and his mortgage (why would ANYONE rent in this environment?) - and buy food... and every so often he doesn't quite have the income in McDonari to cover his costs - so he just prints a few extra Samoleons. Inflating his currency against the common avenue of exchange (Ripples).
Ultimately Sam gets his car for a bargain, and Dave gets hosed.
Sam is any nation that issues its own currency. Dave is anyone who buys the debt of that nation. Why would nations, given the option to price their own debt in currency they can do whatever they want with, do anything else? Answer: because ultimately we won't give them a choice.

* For actually buying and selling bitcoin for cash, if you do more than $1000 of business on any given day you are probably a 'Money Services Business'. This is true if you're an exchange or even if you're just 'facilitating' access to the exchange.
* There is no sales tax on currency and likewise there is none on bitcoin, however being a licensed MSB has its own costs.
* If you pay people in bitcoin they are liable for the USD value of the bitcoin at the time they are paid it in income tax, and you are liable for the payroll tax on that. 
* If you buy coins at one price and sell them at a higher price you are also liable for capital gains tax - which for a short term holding like that is the same as your income tax.

What would a 'destroyed' blockchain/network even look like?
If the attacking entity has sufficient hashing power they can dictate the rules of what is accepted in the main accepted chain. They cannot, however, dictate what blockchain people are actually using.
Cryptocurrency is already a hydra, and that is without any real outside aggression. Any entity who attempted a network takeover would find themselves ultimately as the only kid playing in that particular sandbox.
Bitcoin may replace PayPal and Square - or those companies may simply adapt and become value-adds to the network. But the timeline on replacing the legacy network is so long, IMO, that the incumbents have minimal interest in thinking that far ahead.
If the US Government (or some other interested party) were to dump a billion dollars into ASICs, they'd be able to attack the network. The network is ultimately made up of people who would figure out they were under attack. The people under attack already recognize the threat, and certainly would in the event it actually came to pass. They would adjust. We would adjust. Very likely it would cause some disruption in transactions that took place during the attack and some people would lose money - which they'd blame on the government attack. People should be aware that there is this possibility and understand that nothing is so perfectly secure that it cannot be damaged. 
The thing about true P2P distributed protocols, however, is that while you can damage them it may not even be possible to destroy them. They are a gathering of minds, not something carved in stone. Like any ideology the only way to destroy the network is to change the minds of the people who make up the network.
The billions of dollars the government would need to engage in total war with the network would be wasted - because the network would fragment away from them. Some would go to the altcoins - some would go to one (or hopefully more than one) hydra-heads that break away from the main accepted bitcoin chain at the point of the attack.
You can attack a network, but if there is an ideology BEHIND that network - a reason the network exists in the first place - your attacking the network will only strengthen that ideology.
It is futile to attack an ideology physically.
There are, of course, non-ideological users of Bitcoin (just as there are many people who use USD who do not believe in the ideology behind it). These users will of course stand to lose everything they invested in the network... but if they understand what happened to their money they may well find themselves newly converted.
Bitcoin's network security is high. It really would take a massively expensive attack to damage it. However, it isn't a fight they can actually win because it is ideological. Attacking the network isn't enough - they'd actually have to start attacking people - and even that has been proved relatively impossible. The only way to defeat ideology is by changing minds - and that isn't going to happen.

Pointing out laws exist doesn't imply agreement that the laws make sense.
RentalStarter by definition needs to operate offline, and claims to be a business registered in Ohio. If, at any point, their local tax or business regulation authorities decided to they could shut down the business. 
It is not only illegal to solicit funds publicly - it is illegal to invest funds solicited illegally. That just means that every coin invested in RentalStarter (then converted to USD) and any assets purchased with those funds by RentalStarter are going to be subject to seizure.
I'm not saying they are good laws - they're shit laws. I'm just saying I'm not going to invest in a company that is in clear and present violation of their own local laws - again, not because I believe in the laws... but because I like my money.

You can protect your coins from hackers or you can protect them from burglars. 
And paper wallets **are** meant to hold large amounts of BTC. You're just not meant to walk around town with them (any more than you'd walk around with the same amount of cash).
Printing a paper wallet on archival quality material and storing it appropriately (in a safe or vault etc) is absolutely the right play when storing large amounts of BTC. 
There is a difference between a cold paper wallet and a hot paper wallet (one meant for spending) - but this difference has to do with how the wallet is handled not with the design of the wallet itself. Think of it as the difference between a $10 bill and a $10,000 bill. You store the $10,000 bill somewhere safe - you put the $10 bill in your wallet and walk around with it.

First, it doesn't always take ten minutes - sometimes it takes one and sometimes it takes an hour or more. 
The reason has to do with a balance Satoshi was seeking between convenience and security - the longer it takes to mine a block on average the more secure the network  it is, but the more inconvenient as well. 
The key is to minimize orphan blocks. You don't want quick blocks because you want the miners to have received the most recent highest block when they finish a block themselves.
If the shorter the time to the block is the fewer miners will have heard the previous block which limits which miners can add to the block chain. In theory a 1 second block would be possible - but it would be very unlikely that anyone but the miner of the previous block could mine it.

There are always people throwing this idea around, but more than likely it's being developed in stealth if it is being actively developed at all. The issue is that the non-BTC side of the account would require whoever developed one to BE or BECOME a fully licensed and regulated depository bank.
I would expect this to be in the 5 year plan for Coinlab as they've already got the banking partner - and Europe may see it sooner with bitcoin-central.
Because of the nature of banking laws you can't just 'start-up' a bank, which is why the developments will come from non-banking BTC companies that have partnered with banks.
It will happen, but I suspect that if Satoshi had filed the necessary paperwork to get the process started immediately after mining the genesis block we still wouldn't be there yet.

It's a pretty straightforward condition. 
* Mt. Gox temporarily suspends withdrawals creating negative sentiment
* Other USD exchanges trade down because of negative sentiment. 
* Gox temporarily trades up as traders gtfo
* Traders cash back out on alt . exchanges, further depressing prices. 
* arbitrage traders begin to slowly close the gap between exchanges as resumption of usd withdrawals nears, limited by transfer limits and time delays 
* gap closes
This would have happened inside of a day (or not at all) if gox had ltc support at the time. 
Expect a modest rise in prices once the market prices meet up and the arbitrage trade ends - as the traders who have been moving usd **to** gox will be taking additional advantage of the low prices to capture more btc. 
If this had been anything other than what it was it would have either been a much smaller dip or a much larger crash

Suggestion: More teams
A five way series would make it possible to play multiple sides and would make the outcome less obvious ahead of time. 
Suggestion: Weighting by bid order as a percentage of total bids to the side
Have the weighting change over time. First 10% of bids has a weight of 10, second 10%, 9, etc. This way the very first bid will always have the best bonus - but a side that receives fewer bids (as a number of tx - not necessarily as an amount of btc bet) will have a chance to catch back up (keep the endgame exciting).
Suggestion: Rolling Games
Instead of one game every 24 hours or whatever, what if it was 1 24-hour game starting every 12 hours (or less)? Keep the action a bit hotter that way.
Suggestion: Last Call
If the losing team gets a bid in the last 5 minutes, reset the timer to 5 minutes. Or two minutes. Or whatever.
Suggestion: Team Names / League
Totally arbitrary - but what if you had team names. Teams could even be sponsored by advertisers.
If there are 24 hours to a game, and 1 game a day, and 2 teams per game... then if you had 6 teams with 2 face-offs each you'd have a 'series' of 30 games.
Players get the winnings per the rules of the game - but what if x% of the amount lost by the losing team was split between the team owners (not sponsors) and the 'team cup'. 
Teams would get 1pt for every btc they won from each game, so at the end of the season the series prize pool could be distributed to the top 1/2/3 teams.
Team owners could be decided for the next season during the end of the current season. Make it a 10-player ownership roster. Auction format. You could sell them on bitmit or code it yourself. Half of the funds from the sale could go to the house (you) and half to the seasonal team prize pool.
It would give players with an investment in a team an ongoing reason to continue playing.

A few of the major players in bitcoin payment processing aren't especially helpful when it comes to publishing commercial data. Bitpay reported $5.4million in March 2013 - which was helpful. It's unclear what percentage of retail trade bitpay handles though. The silk road also handles a few million in transactions a month (USD equivalent). 
Between MtGox merchant app, the trade on bitmit, coindl (among other specialty sites), direct sales... it's a mess of data.
Based strictly on the bitpay/sr figures that we do get (the latter of which should be taken with a hefty spoonful of salt) I'd hazard a guess and put straight retail sales at somewhere between $10m and $50m a month at the moment. I think $10m is a safe lower-bound for guessing.
This would indicate that we're leveraging a $1B monetary supply for a $120M economy. It would be helpful to every economist watching the btceconomy if we had more data and didn't have to take wild leaps. A reasonably accurate GDP figure would be a very useful thing indeed to have some sort of a number for.

The model of procuring BTC ahead of time and selling it to order at market rates only works as long as the price goes up. The fact that he couldn't (or has elected not to) pay off the BTCJAM loan with earnings from sales and decided instead to pay it off with equity also strikes me as curious.
When investing in crypto-securities you're taking a lot of added risk for which one should expect a lot of reward. Financial reporting from crypto-securities is also a mess, but a lot of the people out there do seem to be operating in good faith and some are quite profitable.

The primary beneficiary of inflating a currency are borrowers. Goldman Sachs is disadvantaged by extreme monetary easing such as what we have at present because it neigh-eliminates the return on US Government Bonds (and any government bonds in countries that are actively easing).
As a lender (which is what all banks are) and investor (which is what most banks, and especially investment banks are) inflation is generally bad. Nominal return (making nominally more $ this year than last year) only matters relative to the nominal return provided by competitors. 
An investor (and by extension an investment bank) cares more about 'real return' (nominal return minus inflation). If I offer you a loan for $10,000 at 2% interest with everything to be paid back at the end of a year... nominally I will come out 2% ahead... but REALLY I will barely come out ahead at all (and more likely lose real value) as the $10,200 you pay me at the end of the year has the purchasing power of less than $10k from when I made the loan.

Reddit is fine. There is just no good answer to your question. The market is somewhat efficient. When the spread is wide enough people do pay the fees to send dollars there to buy bitcoin to spend on a more liquid exchange. The cost of getting dollars to btce is where the spread comes from. If you add the costs to the price the fact that arbitrage does take place becomes evident.

It does smooth out a bit - but realistically we're not talking about an extremely deep market here. The actual trading volumes are large, but only by Bitcoin's own historical standards. There aren't nearly enough traders or HFT bots in the market - which is why the spreads are so insanely huge.
Consumer BTC tx / market orders are still a massive chunk of the volume relative to where it ultimately will be - but at any given time the bid/ask spread is on the order of 1000+ bps which is simply insane.
The market is extremely illiquid - although its much MORE liquid than it used to be and is getting more-so every day. As the market grows and we have more traders with stronger reserves we will have smoother fluctuation.
Like GPU mining, there isn't an indefinite horizon to this level of profitability in the spreads - but your assumption is based on a perfectly liquid market which bitcoin isn't by any stretch of the imagination.

Using the main Qt client you can just hold the coins in that address indefinitely until all or part of the balance is used to send coins to someone else. The person who sent you those coins sees an address they sent coins to with the balance of the coins they sent. They don't know which other addresses are yours or what balance the have. At best they could id one or two other addresses if they are used by your Qt client in a transaction involving the address they sent money to - but first why would they bother - and second it is trivial to re unify all of your coins into an untraceable single address using a mixing service l.

You want estimates, eh?
**Right Now**
* ASICMINER (current): 6.4 TH/s
* AVALON Batch  2 units, 130 GH/s
* Everyone Else (probably includes Chinese Avalon Batch 1 Orders): 49.22 TH/s
= Network Speed: 55.75 TH/s
**Probably Before You Get Your BFL**
* All that earlier stuff: 55.75 TH/s
* AVALON Batch  300 units, ~19.5 TH/s cumulative
* AVALON Batch  600 units, ~39 TH/s cumulative
* ASICMINER Batch  Complete: + 8.6 TH/s
= Network Speed by May: (at least) 122.7 TH/s (ignoring BFL)
So, if you received your order June 1st - and were the only person to have received your BFL order - your 60 GH/s would represent 0.04891% of the total network. 
Assuming the difficulty has adjusted to all of these things before you get your BFL - which it will have...
= Est. ~1.77 BTC per day (0.04918% of 3600 BTC / day)
I could update this if someone could point me to BFL reporting on however many units they're actually building - if they've reported such a thing. 
I'm also discounting AVALON Batch 3 which will probably ship well before any BFL March Pre-Order.

The blockchain can support the entire backbone of all finance and much of digital property / ownership law in the Earth's gravity well **or** it can directly support micropayments.
For micropayments to work smoothly "banks" or other service providers would use the blockchain as a settlement mechanism - but at $1M per coin a satoshi is worth $0.01, the entire network is worth $21 trillion,  and the network still represents less than half of the current global money supply (assuming we're talking about what bitcoin is **for**, not necessarily what it is most likely to **be**). 
While $0.01 is normally a reasonably good cut-off point for most purchases, what if I want to pay for the 30 seconds of wifi I use on opengarden or whatever as I walk past a starbucks - with off-chain microtransactions I can be debited some microscopic amount of money worth far less than a satoshi... or I can pay a few satoshi. If the entity offering wifi to passer's by wants to charge a fair rate for the (say) $200 a month equivalent they spend on the internet connection offering wicked fast speeds to anyone in range, then that 30 seconds has a fair market value of about 0.2 cents equivalent.
I don't want to authorize a $0.002 equivalent payment to the 200 different cafes and opengarden enabled wifi routers I passed by on my way to the office who made sure that I got to stream HD TV to my phone without using my 5G data plan... and perhaps that competition means that when I **do** step out of the network and am using my cellular connection I'm only paying an actually fair market rate for the cellular data I **do** end up using...
Anyway, bitcoin is meant to be spent - but it is not **just** meant to be spent. As a real money it is meant to be a store of value as well as a medium of exchange. 
To be honest I could care less if it ever becomes a unit of account - although I'd rather we use gold for our accounting units than fiat currency - so long as nobody ever feels obliged to convert it to something else. (note: this is not the same thing as a gold standard - I just wish the XBT/XAU rate were the one all of our BTC prices were based on.)
@_date: 2013-03-09 02:37:29
Actually the WoW gold thing is the right legal approach. It's what securities sites like MPEX and BTCTC use to cover their asses as best as possible. The idea is that, were you ever to go to court, you would be able to force the court to either throw out the case or make illegal every video game 'currency' ever made. They can't have it both ways.
Here's the rub - you actually have to report capital gains you earned on video game currency (betcha didn't know that). Any bitcoin (or wow gold, or anything of any value whatsoever) that you receive under any circumstance is income if it has value - which all of the above do - is subject to both income tax (if you were given it either as gambling winnings or compensation) or capital gains (if you paid for it with USD or some OTHER thing that had value).

I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at. The price of 1 bitcoin is irrelevant. If you take one currency and exchange it with someone for another currency, what you're doing is trading one for the other.
Instead of using full coins, what if we used bitcents. One bitcent is worth about $1.30 at the moment - which makes it about 1 Euro (actually 0.9750 euros).
This also means that 100 uBitcoins (microbitcoins) has slightly more value than 1 Japanese Yen (approx 80uBTC to the yen at the moment).
Trading your Euros for Dollars or Yen is no different than trading them for Bitcoin or Gold.
Could you think about what question it is you mean to ask and rephrase it? What is it you mean by 'trade your dollars for bitcoin'? What is it you mean by 'when will bitcoin be more valuable than the dollar?'
Do you perhaps mean, when will the Bitcoin Economy be larger than the USD Economy? I'm not sure that is relevant, but if it's what you mean it is something people have speculated about.

It really depends on the type of loan. A federally guaranteed student loan has an annual interest rate of maybe 4-7% (depending on how old OP is). If you account for inflation this is just a real interest rate of 1-4% depending on which model you use and what you were actually paying to begin with on which the minimum payment can't legally be more than a certain percentage of your take home pay. There is almost no good reason whatsoever to pay more than the minimum monthly amount due on a student loan. You'd be much better off saving what money you might have spent in excess of the minimum for a down payment on a house.

If you're providing a depository / interest service, you need some level of insurance or assurance. In the case of coinlenders and other such operators, the operator's personal funds would be the reserve/insurance.
If I have x-BTC and start a bank and you deposit y-btc... I loan out your y-BTC. If you request your y-BTC back I pay you back out of my x-BTC. If I don't have enough in x my entire system collapses. There is no way around this unless the x-value is on deposit with a third party (insurance company). 
The smart way to do this as a lender would be to treat it as a margin loan. Never borrow from your depositors what you don't have ~5x of in reserve (this is a reasonable ratio of security to available margin a brokerage will offer clients).
**Edit:** As a follow-on, never invest more in a loan with someone in Bitcoinia if they don't stand to lose more from cheating you (in reputation, etc) than they stand to gain by stealing your coins.

We need to remember that it isn't the state that is attacking bitcoin, it is bitcoin that is attacking the state. We are the aggressors here - even if we are coming at it from a position of long-oppression. We are introducing a virtual and viral monetary system that can defeat their monetary system on merit... and which has the technical capacity to be sufficiently resilient that they cannot win.
The governments will give up their monopoly on money long before they give up their monopoly on coercive force... the giving up of which is tantamount to their demise. The State isn't much more at all than a monopoly on coercive force... everything else are just the various tangential benefits you get to have when you already have a monopoly on coercive force.
I acknowledge that you said 'near anonymity' and not 'anonymity' - its a distinction worth making. Bitcoin is at best pseudonymous, and bears with it the capacity for transactions from address to address to be sufficiently confused as to be anonymous. 
I honestly am not sure I can recommend bitcoin to people who live in countries where defendants are not presumed innocent. As long as one doesn't have to prove a negative, one should always be able to maintain reasonable and sufficient doubt in the eyes of the law as to the nature of their bitcoin transactions.
What my previous post really relies on though is the fact that one of two things will happen - either bitcoin will usurp the global monetary system or it will not. For it to usurp the global monetary system it needs to be able to accommodate the stupid and the lazy, which means banks of some stripe or another. There needs to be an idiot-proof bitcoin service that is at least as secure from outside theft as bank accounts are now... I cannot see a way around it.

Well, not quite. If you send the BTC from your balance again, this time with a fee, it will confirm sooner than the original transaction. If there isn't enough BTC on the sending address(es) for the original transaction when it is confirmed it will be a double spend, will be recorded as such, and won't be debited against your balance (the blockchain will recognize those coins as belonging to your address(es)). If there IS enough BTC on the addresses when the original transaction confirms it will not be a double-spend and both transactions will be debited from your balance and you'll need to ask the person you sent them both to for one of them back - at which point it is entirely in their court as to whether or not they'll refund you.

Point 1: You don't need to be especially savvy to commit credit card fraud. A double spend is technically difficult to pull off and doesn't have a very high chance of success even for the skilled. As long as (bitcoin fraud rate &lt; credit card fraud) rate it will be preferable. Meaning forever. 
Point 2: You know how when you buy something with your debit or credit card the transaction appears as "pending" in your account for a few hours or days (if the purchase was on a Friday or weekend day)? That's because it actually takes the legacy banking system a LOT longer to clear/settle transactions than it does with bitcoin. 
For a merchant bitcoin is excellent for cash control. They don't need to wait days (or perhaps weeks) to receive the money. They have it within minutes (if they accept unmediated payments) or next say (if they use a payment processor like bitpay).

As BTC purchasing power increases people are less willing to gamble the same nominal amount. When a 0.01 BTC bet was the equivalent of a $0.10 bet, it was nothing.

Coinbase doesn't hold customer USD. They have a limited amount of their own USD on hand for spending on a day-to-day basis.
Coinbase does not receive your USD instantly when you buy coins - they have to wait 3-4 business days just like everyone else using the legacy system.

First, if you wanted to buy something right now that is denominated in yen (and pay usd), the USD price of that thing would be different today than it was yesterday. This is just the inherent nature of floating currencies. 
The currency people will base their pricing on is almost certainly going to be determined by the currency they are paid in - the currency they pay their rent or mortgage in - etc. 
As a deflationary currency there would (ideally) never be a point at which it is a good idea to use permanently fixed pricing (no dollar menus) - because the currency will (again, ideally) always increase in purchasing power over time. Just as you wouldn't post a price that wasn't either updated live or otherwise  easily updated you wouldn't pay a fixed btc amount for salaries - and you'd want any decision to take on debt denominated in btc to be a considered one. 
I think it's good that there are a couple significant psychological hurdles that prevent immediate universal adoption - it slows the process down. People need time to get used to the ideas behind bitcoin. They need to see it working for the early adopters.

Actually you don't. The things you buy cost that much more to begin with to account for the fees your credit card company charges the merchant. You only get it back relative to people who pay with debit or cash.
There's nothing inherent in deflationary monetary economics that makes credit especially worse than it already is (in theory). I wouldn't recommend it, of course, until we've reached some level of stability in relative value (probably not for a good long while yet) if only because a nominal debt in a deflationary currency *is* bad if you're being paid in an inflationary currency.
If you're paying off your credit cards each month then you are not actually using it as a credit card, but a charge card - which makes *MUCH* more sense - and is really just a hop and a skip to a debit card anyway.
I think, rather than having a BTC denominated credit or charge card, I'd probably rather just have the option to pay my USD denominated debt in bitcoin without the extra step of exchanging it myself - at least until things are a bit steadier.

Margin loans are paid back in full when the loan is closed. This means that if I borrow 1BTC from you at an APR of 3.65% (see what I did there) and I hold the margin position for 100 days, when I close the position you will get 1.01 BTC back (1+(0.0365/365)*100). This is why margin lenders on bitfinex include a 'maximum duration' in their offerings, meaning the position must be closed within that window. Borrowers typically list their requests with a 'minimum duration' - this is to filter which offers will fill their order.
Of course if your borrower faceplants on their trade - their losses approach their collateral - bitfinex will issue a margin call and force-close their position.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:36:33
As it stands they're basically non-convertible - thankfully non-callable - preferred shares without a set dividend which effectively makes them a loan for which you should have zero expectation of predictable return.
I hate to say it, but after taking another look... there is a thing we have a word for... where you borrow money from people and then borrow more money to pay back the people you originally borrowed money from... and only one person gets rich when that's the deal.

If the loan is denominated in USD, how does forcing someone to pay in BTC benefit you if the dollar were to collapse?
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:25:55
That's adorable.
The demand for usage of bitcoin is still 99% for drugs and gambling. However, this doesn't account for anything but a small portion of the current BTCUSD price. Just like with gold, the vast majority of the price is in its speculative value. Unlike with gold, there's a huge amount of headroom for the use-demand to move into...
In fact, if the speculative value of bitcoin gets high enough, we'll unlock a lot of the use value. There simply isn't enough capital value in BTC yet for it to be useful for very large institutional transactions.
Nobody is going to invest $100million in bitcoin network infrastructure until there's some real money behind it - and that level of infrastructure is needed for BTC to grow into the useful currency position you (and I) would like to see it occupy.
I don't want, nor do I believe it is possible, for BTC to be 'useful' when 1BTC = $40 or $50. No, BTC isn't going to start to achieve its real usefulness (other than in penny-ante gambling and small time illicit retail) until 1BTC equals much much more than that.
The long term investment value and the usefulness of Bitcoin are inter-dependent. The speculative growth will lead the way - and hedge funds and institutional investors and investment banks are going to be much more preferable partners to have in the bitcoin economy than the primary players we have right now. They will make the markets more liquid - for starters - and will hopefully put enough money behind their BTC investments to raise price above the limits of independent market participants to influence and create a more stable price with more rational deflation.
Of course, like you probably, I'd love to have a gigantic multiple of the bitcoins I DO have before this goes off - and to that end we're both fortunate because 1 small hedge fund in Malta isn't going to be enough... but it is an early sign of the end of the beginning, to be sure.

The answer to all of those questions, insofar as Gox goes, is yes. Also on Bitinstant, Coinbase and ASICMINER.

Mostly yes on Avalon.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:56:13
If you've read about ASIC companies such as Avalon and Butterfly Labs - ASICMINER is another one of those. They use a slightly different manufacturing technique to produce less powerful modules but which are cost competitive at the GH/s level. They're also not selling their miners (yet) - but are instead mining with the first 15TH worth of miners they produce and distributing the BTC to their investors every week.
Shares of ASICMINER are not traded directly on any exchange but are administered by the company itself. Shareholders of ASICMINER have then gone and relisted their holdings on BTCT and Bitfunder and take a commission on the dividends as they're paid out ("pass-through").
Once ASICMINER has paid back the original IPO price of the stock (0.1BTC per share) in dividends the dividend will be cut in half with the revenue from mining used to re-invest in the company, expand their private mining operations, and market their miners to the public.
It's the only ASIC builder that you can get a piece of (1 share = 1/400,000th of the company) and that piece will be a piece of both the mining the company does itself as well as the profits from future retail sales of the miners to the public.
It's the only way to invest BTC into an ASIC today and start geting ROI this week. WHAT your ROI ultimately is, is a risk you take with anything in BTC-land.

Primary research in that field seems like a likely candidate for the production of patents and other intellectual property. While the bitcoin community is demonstrably generous when it comes to charity, it is even MORE demonstrably possessed of an extremely high risk appetite in investments. 
Supporting fundamental rights in privacy and freedoms to communicate and disseminate information is one thing; feeding the homeless is another. Funding primary research is neither of those - but that isn't at all to say you're in the wrong place, just perhaps asking the wrong question.

In a pin based debit transaction the onus is on the card granting institution. This means that of the pin was presented and confirmed by the bank that issued the card it is THEIR loss if payment is charged back - so long as the seller can prove fulfillment of their end of the transaction. 
Provided the banks would accept a bitcoin payment to an address provably owned by the cardholder as verification there is no reason why online pin based debit transactions for bitcoin cannot be developed.

How would this be harder than getting every client-node in the network to upgrade to accommodate more granularity? A decimal point move only requires miner consensus whereas an increase of granularity requires every individual's client node to be updated - and it would be inconsistent with the project for such updates to be pushed.
Also, the change in relative prices would only affect users who are operating without a value-peg. For automatically updated prices pegged either to a base currency or to some other acceptable index of purchasing power (such as a variant CPI) their prices would update automatically. In the future where this is a real issue is it even conceivable that someone with the technical capacity to accept bitcoin wouldn't enable their prices to be adjusted on a live basis? Who would use a system where the price in BTC isn't either pegged to purchasing power or verified by themselves or at least an employee prior to confirmation of the sale?
In EITHER case it would be a significant change that would be announced ahead of time to give people the time to prepare and to make a very easy shift.
I don't think the disruption is negligible on either side - but it seems to me preferable to maintain the capacity for extreme micro-accounting - not to mention people like whole numbers and it is somewhat easier to send 1.23456789 BTC than it is to send 0.00000000123456789 bitcoin.

Mostly I was just trying to illustrate that whichever side you think is better, it does us no good to agree on what is best if what is best isn't a thing at all.
I really couldn't say what nominal growth would be in a deflationary model - obviously there'd be some reduction in investment as there would be no nominally safer investment than just saving. That isn't to say investment would stop entirely by any means, but it would change.
The issue I find well-addressed by the bitcoin/deflationary model has to do with the parasitic costs of bad debt both by government and individuals. If we had a crypto-currency that inflated at a consensus-adjustable rate - perhaps ideally distributed via both interest and mining (say 10% of the block reward and all fees are paid to the miner, 90% of the block reward is distributed to all addresses of record with any balance in proportion to the balance at the address - or something)...
Anyway, I think its an interesting question. I also think that there are a number of competing inflationary currency models and that having a deflationary currency in the mix is good for everyone. I like it when technology fills the gap between philosophy and reality. Time will simply tell.

There is a difference between a speculative bubble and a paradigm shift. This isn't, of course, to say that you can't build a speculative bubble ON a paradigm shift (The Mississippi Company, Railway Mania, .com, etc) but it does mean that you're dealing with vastly different and not well understood fundamentals that make the difference between the two harder to discern.
Is bitcoin in a bubble or are people exuberantly testing the waters of a new, paradigmatic technology? When you can differentiate between the companies built on a new technology or discovery (electricity, the Americas, steam power, the internet) then some of those companies may receive the benefit of exuberance that wanted to flow into the paradigm itself - but couldn't because there was no practical way to invest in 'the internet' or 'America' - and if the company is flawed then it may bubble and burst.
With bitcoin there is no such difference. The exuberance for the currency and the exuberance for the protocol/technology beneath it build off of each other - but it is not a stock. The technical models are flawed for lack of an appropriate comparison.
Bitcoin is a principle, a theory... a concept like 'the internet' or 'bittorrent' or 'peer to peer' or 'hawala' that, unlike the others (which you can only participate in) you can literally own a piece of. Yes you can buy mining equipment just as you could start a railroad company or telephone company or airplane manufacturer... but you couldn't own a piece of 'steam power' or 'telephony' or 'flight' any more than you could own a piece of 'the internet'. Bitcoin is at once economic theory, an economy, and money. And money you can own.

Not to mention they've probably sold many/most of those coins back into the economy. They need to pay rent in Tokyo.
EDIT: To rephrase. It makes sense. Most all transactions in BTC are almost immediately resold on MTGOX (think bitpay transactions). The stat by definition (40M BTC aggregate volume) shows that every bitcoin issued so far has passed through Gox an average of 3x... this is just the velocity of bitcoin passing through its primary router. If Gox survives another hundred years its more than conceivable (practically inevitable) that they will have collected a multiple of all bitcoins that will ever be mined in fees.
For a bit of context: the average trading volume at the NYSE is around $1.5T per month, meaning that single exchange handles more USD transactions in a year than are in circulation (USD M3 is estimated to be about $10T). While obviously their share of that is small relative to the total (and long-term I should hope Gox will reduce its service fee), it's not like Gox is hiding all of their BTC under their futon - they're a real business in Japan, its reasonable to expect that most if not all gox fees are translated to fiat in short order.

We can double the tx / minute rate three more times (8x current rate) before we hit the block size limit. At recent growth rates we could get there in a year. 
Expanding the block size limit will require a hard fork - which is probably desirable anyway as there are a number of other desirable changes that also require such a move. 
The developers are well aware of scalability concerns. 
Bitcoin isn't a static thing. It is in constant and ongoing development. It is beta software. Almost any technical threat is, so long as we're aware of it ahead of time, not especially concerning. It is the technical threats nobody has thought of or discovered yet that are the real risk. (disregarding exogenous nontechnical threats)

A few thoughts.
* It would be irrational for Z to lend money at usurious / impossible to repay rates. Z would factor reasonable expectations of repayment into the amount they are willing to lend and the rate they can charge. There is no utility to a loan in default.
* x's productivity would correspondingly grow with their population. An increase in productivity will either yield more units of productivity or cheaper ones (on a per unit basis) or both. This makes x's output cheaper relative to the output of y and z.
* The present value of BTC incorporates both what productivity/utility/etc was expended to acquire it as well as a discounted (but nevertheless accounted for) expectation of what the value of BTC will be in the future.

The time for that has passed. ASICs are not capable of performing any task other than hashing. As the ASICs replace more and more of the network hashrate, they *are* freeing up FPGA and GPU processing which hypothetically could be used by the device owners to do protein folding or whatever... but that is their property and their decision.
The processing power comparison you're using is only useful insofar as it explains roughly how much of the bitcoin network the top 500 supercomputers would represent if they were dedicated to bitcoin mining - this equation no longer works in the reverse direction as ASICs designed to hash SHA256 are not capable of performing floating point operations.
To rephrase, the Bitcoin network FLOPS comparison explains how much traditional computing power would be required to match the dedicated computing power of the bitcoin network. It is a statement of bitcoin network security: ie, even if the government or some hostile entity took control of the top 500 supercomputers in the world and pointed them at the bitcoin network they'd only make up about 12% of the network hashrate.

Inherent in bitcoin is the ability to conduct certain economic transactions without either party needing to trust each other. This ability exists with cash transactions AFK where the only risk is that the bills are counterfeit, a risk not present in bitcoin. 
If you use a light client (such as electrum) or a Web wallet (such as coinbase or blockchain) you are not able to act without a necessity for trust (as you need to trust the wallet provider). 
Beyond that, operating a full node adds redundancy and therefore security (and therefore value) to the network. It increases the surety that a given transaction will be heard by whichever miner finds the next block. All of these things make the network (and therefore your coins) more valuable and more secure. 
There is no part of the bitcoin network that relies on or even implies a need for altruism.

And, I apologize if I'm arguing semantics here. It's certainly true that if Bitfountain were a US-Based company their offering as it was published/presented would be in violation of US law. It's equally true that if BTCTalk were based in the US then Bitfountain would be in violation of laws restricting the offering of shares to US citizens by international companies. As it stands, I'm not sure there's a case to be made that Bitfountain is in violation of any law, or even the spirit of any law, that they have any reasonable expectation of being required to follow - and in my opinion that strikes me as 'best efforts.'
Any US citizen reselling ASICMINER shares on any platform (and likely anyone located in the US at the time of the sale) would be in violation of Regulation S. 
The BTCT pass-through is sponsored by a legal entity in Belize, on a market hosted in Panama and owned by that same Belize entity.
The BF pass-through is sponsored by a natural person who is a citizen of Sweden and is distributed on a market domiciled and (as far as I know) hosted in Australia.
I'll definitely grant that it's entirely possible that some or all of these people are in violation of one or more areas of US Securities law. I think establishing jurisdiction would be hard and prosecuting the case harder. 
More to the point of the discussion, though, is that all of the evidence I've seen indicates that many of these offerings are made either ignorant of or agoristically ignoring of these laws... but in my mind the legal risk is just one people can price into everything, and with the exception of outright scams (which are present everywhere regardless of the in situ laws) it seems to me that many/most of the sponsors, managers, and other entities are performing with a belief in their fiduciary duties and have evidenced themselves to be more transparent than is even required of public companies under US laws.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, which at the moment is 50,400 BTC or 0.46% of the total amount of bitcoin mined to date. Each new block represents a slightly lower amount of the total bitcoin ever mined than the one before it. This is all obvious.
If miners doubled their hashpower the second after the difficulty adjusted, it would take them half as long as their hashing power over the previous difficulty period implied it SHOULD have taken them. 
So you'd have to double the size of the network instantly to drop the time to next difficulty adjustment down to 1 week. After that one week, you'd need to double it again just to stay at 1-week.
It becomes very quickly impossible to keep this up... it's prohibitively expensive already.
There is no practical way for miners to move the halving date or over-accelerate the production of new coins appreciably.

SatoshiDice is the only business on your list that publishes their finances. BitPay processed $5.4million in sales in March which based on their fee schedule suggests they earned $53,000 and change before paying salaries and the lease on their offices and servers and whatnot.
SDice hasn't released March numbers yet (AFAIK) but in February they had net profits of over 13,400 BTC. 
edit: Gox has a [30-day trailing volume of 2,174,457.68238464 BTC]( - so they should've earned at most about 26,000BTC (thanks) ~~13,046 BTC based on the lowest fee tier (0.6%)... ie: less than SDICE.~~

I'd have loved to have had this discussion with Rothbard. I'd certainly have lost, but what fun. 
Being able to hold two conflicting opinions at once is a trait of something or other which I happen to possess - so I'll say I agree with Rothbard. 
My original thought was really to explore the idea that there are a very limited number of states of being that are not by their nature accepting of rule by others - it is not to advocate violent revolution, but it *is* to consider the possibility that if you are not actively engaged (perhaps at threat to your own life) in active struggle (even futile struggle) against those who claim to rule you, you are granting them some level of authority to do exactly that.
That quote, of course, leaves me little option other than to make an attempt to argue my point in the context of the Holocaust. This would certainly create sentences that might, taken out of context or with a limited ability or interest to understand my point, completely derail the conversation. 
Obviously the Jews did not commit suicide in the Holocaust, nor is it reasonable to imagine they condoned their own internment and genocide (I like the distinction another redditor suggested between to consent and to condone... although in his post he was mistaking the two as being the same). 
If we make a slap bet, I am consenting to the possible future where you unexpectedly hit me in the face as hard you can. I am not condoning that action.
The distinction is that we are not the government, Rothbard is correct. This does not preclude us from being responsible for the Government's actions by consenting to its rule over us through inaction.

Capital gains are not strictly limited to capital:fiat conversion events. If I buy a TV from someone for BTC it is legally the same thing as if I had sold the coins for USD and paid the person who sold me the TV with that. Of course with BTC it would be much harder for the IRS to sort it all out - which is why the onus for sorting it out is on the taxpayer and when you get audited you either have a lot of receipts and good books for them to sort through and show that you really did pay all the taxes you owed - or you have to prove a negative - which is just another way of saying you have to pay the taxes on any income or capital gains that you can't show you already paid taxes on.

Not even remotely. Don't chase losses. If all trades are for 'x' then the most one can lose on any trade is 'x'. As long as you take your gains without getting greedy, and cut your losses before they get to big, and win more than you lose - you'll be ahead.
Every once in a while the market will drop a gift in your lap (like last night's BF/BTCT spread on ASICMINER) and if you're awake and paying attention you can print money.
Rephrase. Imagine you cut your losses as soon as they break 3% on the trade - you take profits in the same fashion - and you perform each trade with the same base-amount. If you're right more often than you're wrong you're profiting. If your base amount / trade count is high enough you're making an income.
I tend to avoid single-market trading though. Usually when I buy/sell I'm doing both very quickly because the spread already has my profit margin built in to it across markets (arbitrage).
Market timing is pseudoscience. Arbitrage is math.

Its a simple equation:
4.5GH/s @ 4.5W
* Wattage = 0.108 kWh / day - @  $0.15/kwh - $0.0162
* 1YearAmortization of $150 = $0.4107 / day
* Daily cost of operation = $0.4269
* @ $102/BTC = 0.0041853 BTC per day
* 0.0041853 = 0.0001163% of daily minting (ie network)
A Jalapeno will therefore be profitable so long as 4.5GH/s = more than 0.0001163% of the total network - until the network reaches a total hashrate of **3.871PH/s** (petahashes/second)

You are correct - although if we were at full adoption and full issuance (2140 or later) then deflation would be limited more or less to productivity growth (~3-4%), which means that if your wages DIDN'T go down you'd be getting a relatively small raise in purchasing power.
By that point people will have had ~125 years to get used to the idea. People paid in bitcoin will have experienced their wage-adjustments reducing in magnitude over time as we approach full utility. 
The novelty of bitcoin forces people new to the system to attempt to imagine things happening suddenly - as to them it is. This is not actually how it plays out. It is a process of adoption. More people experiment with it (it is experimental, after all) and learn... it remains new for many, and over time the many become fewer as the few who understood it earlier become many.
These are not real issues for the here and now - although there is no harm in discussing them. Such discussion will enable us to build a better sense of what's to come and be better prepared to educate as the bitcoin economy evolves.

Indeed. The issue really isn't Germany's gold repatriation in isolation. The FED could do exactly as you say if that were true (300 tonnes of gold = ~$13bn), it has more to do with the hypothetical 'run' on the FED that could ensue from other countries demanding their gold.
If the FED were using their own reserve ratio requirements (10% for amounts greater than $80m)^[[1]]( then it would only actually be holding 670 tonnes to back the 6700 tonnes it reports that it holds^[[2]]( - meaning a true run could pressure the FED to print upwards of $265 billion - and that's assuming zero slippage from the current market price.

Well, by definition, if it is unconfirmed it did **not** hit the blockchain. There is a difference between propagation and confirmation. As long as the transaction has been announced properly it is sitting in hundreds of virtual queues held by miners for transactions to confirm when they mine a block. Not all miners accept zero-fee transactions, which is why you need to wait for a miner that DOES to mine a block that includes your transaction (1st confirmation). Once that happens each new block built on top of the one that includes your tx will serve as an additional confirmation, adding security.

That's not a great analogy.
This was more like: imagine you went to a Bitcoin meetup. A guy at the bitcoin meetup has a thousand copies of the same paper wallet (for some unknown reason). After he leaves you see that he left a copy on the table... and then you see that he actually was (for the case of this argument obviously accidentally) dropping them all over the place as he walked out the door.
What do you do? Just assume that nobody is going to pick it up? Or assume that some other honorable person will pick it up? Or do you pick it up and take the coins and then tell him as soon as you are able?
You cannot control what other people do, but you **can** control what you do - and that private key was broadcast on live television and then made available VOD on their website shortly thereafter.

Businesses won't replace the denominator in their pricing structure until Bitcoin has taken over a sufficient chunk of the economy (mass adoption, leading to full adoption). If we've achieved that level adoption and there is still a block reward, bitcoin's relative purchasing power will actually be suffering from some small inflation. If we were to reach that point AFTER the block reward has fallen below 0 satoshi then the purchasing power of bitcoin will deflate at roughly the level of real growth in the economy (there won't be any speculation built into the price of bitcoin at that point as there wouldn't be anything other than bitcoin to be speculating WITH; bitcoin would have become the base currency).
At that point what you're talking about is deflation in purchasing power, which if it were to match global economic growth it probably wouldn't be that big of a deal anymore than retailers have to update their prices right now to work within an inflation-driven economy.

Gox and all exchanges are a periphery business - they are where the fiat economy touches the bitcoin economy - as such they need to play by the rules of the fiat economy. Opening an account on Gox or any exchange shouldn't be seen as being any different from opening an account with a bank - because that's what you're doing.

To perform a triangle trade from say A-usd to b-bitcoin to c-argentinian peso to A-usd there needs to be a good way to get pesos into dollars. 
There isn't (which has a lot to do with why bitcoin is doing well in a country where everyone wants anything that isn't their national fiat). 
The triangle needs to be closed for the market rate to settle. It's also plausible that Argentinans are using the trade to get dollars (as from their side the ability to get money back into pesos would not be much of a feature) 
It's entirely possible that such trading is having some impact on the usd exchange rate

Zerocoin is not an altcoin. It is a plugin for bitcoin (and other crypto eventually). 
Diversification is good. Bitcoin is the vanguard of an entire asset class... More like history's first joint stock company or bond than the latest iteration of 'money'. 
There is plenty of room in the asset class and you can easily observe the cream of alts rising. We need more altcoins, but we need them to be more differentiated. Adding a multiplier to the number of coins is irrelevant. Shortening the time to block is irrelevant.
Literally the **only** reason litecoin is succeeding is that it is the bitcoin of scrypt-based cryptos. It isn't silver to Bitcoin's gold. It is the gold standard of scrypt-based cryptos. 
The hashing algo isn't the only way to differentiate. Personally I think the next crypto to succeed will do so because of a different economic philosophy... Which might take a while as new cryptos are effectively only marketed to current crypto users - many or most of whom were attracted to the model typified by bitcoin. 
We may have altcoins, but there's yet to be a successful crypto that doesn't look to satoshi for monetary philosophy as well as tech. 
Edit: I'm personally in the camp on people who think satoshi was right about basically everything - but assuming everyone is going to agree with you is a terrible way to make money

The mtgox situation is that it isn't really worth taking advantage of the price difference unless you're dealing with enough btc to make the wire fees and lost time value worth it. 
The time value requires you to be able to calculate market volatility which has been flattening recently. If, however, you're treating bitcoin as a fiat denominated investment it is possible to turn a profit with a relatively small amount. 
To be honest I'm surprised there isn't more prop money thinning the spread.

@_date: 2013-12-20 02:35:29

Because of the depth of the market.
Right now $1m buys you 12k BTC... but $10M only buys you 30k BTC and there aren't even $100M worth of bitcoin for sale across all of the markets... at least not anywhere near these prices.
Why is that? Is there a USD value that would dislodge more BTC? Of course there is - but how much to unlock 100K BTC? It could be $1B. How much to unlock 1M BTC? I'm thinking closer to $1Trillion. 
10M BTC? Perhaps there's enough money in the world... but why sell all of your bitcoin at a valuation of $1Trillion when you can sell half... and that rule still applies at a valuation of $10Trillion and $100Trillion ad infinitum.
The world cannot buy the whole of bitcoin. Our system can absorb theirs - theirs cannot absorb ours. Ours is infinitely divisible - meaning I can sell half of my bitcoin every time the price goes up 2x or 10x and I can do that forever.

There are already tens of thousands of coins lost to the ghost of Satoshi (not least of which, the first 50). The 8 decimal places we currently use is not ENTIRELY arbitrary, but it *is* adjustable. And, just as we could add decimal places, we could just as easily move the decimal point if that were somehow necessary.
It would actually be possible for 20,999,999.99999999 BTC to be lost to the universe forever through death or whatever (imagine if SatoshiDice fed 100% of its profits into a coffin address instead of to investors) - so long as there were any bitcoin at all, one satoshi or a fraction of one satoshi, they could be infinitely divided to maintain liquidity.

If fees never go up from now until then, the block reward will drop below 50% of miner's revenue as a function of block revenue at the 7th Halving Day (~2030s). I can't imagine a scenario in which bitcoin still exists in 2030 or isn't worth quite a bit more than it is right now - but let's just pretend for a minute.
If the revenue for mining drops below the costs of mining - people will drop out of mining. This would lower the difficulty and would increase the return for the more efficient miners (for example GPU miner's operating out of their college dorm room where they don't pay electricity like in days of not-so-old).

Graham would disagree somewhat with this level of specificity in defining "investing" if not Browne's entire construct. Intelligent investing (versus speculation) would be making your investments informed and intentional while maintaining a margin of safety. 
Bitcoin is a difficult thing to call an 'investment' under any definition, however - as we lack significant data from which to derive and analyze fundamentals. I'm pleased that BitPay continues to release how much they're processing. If Coinbase did the same we'd have a very decent snapshot of a significant percentage of online spending (albeit not nearly sufficient). SilkRoad reports on monthly payments processed are naturally suspect in any case - but are still useful.
Every new bit of data we can get on the market is useful in helping us get closer to real market fundamentals - but we're not there yet.
In any case, I prefer the Graham definition (which is also the Buffett definition). The idea that when you're investing in companies - you're buying a piece of the company - vs speculation where you're making a (hopefully informed) bet on the price of a company. Bitcoin is likely to reflect more macro-fundamentals than micro-fundamentals, as it is global and a currency.

Need is the wrong word. The Bitcoin economy will, however, benefit from the liquidity that securitization can provide.
Bitcoin is multiple things, none of which are fully realized yet. It has the potential to be a massively disruptive payment system (inherent in the protocol). It has the potential to be a disruptive currency (inherent in the unit of account). It has the potential to be a disruptive store of value (inherent in the limited supply).
ETFs and other forms of securitization are simply service products that will benefit Bitcoin so long as there are competing currencies by adding liquidity in alternate currencies. Bitcoin is benefited by liquidity (as it serves to stabilize purchasing power).

No need to do any of that. Here's an idea though, keep investing the part of your income you want to invest in bitcoin in bitcoin... THEN, whenever you have a planned purchase, look into paying for it in bitcoin - then take the fiat you would have used to pay for it otherwise (it being a planned purchase) and put THAT into bitcoin as well - and then buy it with bitcoin.
You support the bitcoin economy simply by holding bitcoin. Well done you. You can support it more (and add value to the bitcoin you hold as an investment) by ALSO using it as a payment system.

Sure, but why should they care? All new debt is ultimately old debt. Average historical inflation is a bit over 3% I think, so if they were simply to manage that then the real amount they'd pay for a $10,000 20-year treasury note is actually only about $7,603.43 in 2013 USD - for which they got about $9800 at the auction (figuring a 2% yield which is about right at the moment).
This completely ignores the fact that the Federal Reserve is basically the entire market at the moment. I'm not saying it's not theft. It quite obviously **IS** theft. For the government to achieve that 25% savings over the next 20 years it needs to devalue the dollar by almost 50% - which is to say that it needs to rob us of half of our dollars just to realize a 25% savings on its own debt. 
It's a ponzi scheme of course, but the way the government gets away with it is by being both Ponzi and Punter and just passing on the losses to everyone else. For this reason the fiat ponzi scheme can and will last not until the government is bankrupt (just like in monopoly it never will be) but until the citizens revoke its right to conduct monetary and fiscal policy (and functionally, therefore, everything else that it does).

All of the other answers are correct. To make arbitrage work you need to maintain a sufficient balance of both fiat and bitcoin on multiple exchanges to take advantage of spreads.

Dark Pools exist to facilitate large transactions in 'the dark' - that is, not on the public tradebook - IE explicitly to AVOID the volatility that attempting to make very large transactions would inevitably cause in the public market.
If Player A wants to buy $10M in bitcoin they have to either do it incrementally and very slowly - or build an enormous wall that would confuse the open market. The same goes for Player B who wants to sell 100,000 coins. The dark pool allows them to come to a mutually agreeable price for their transactions and not have to worry about how these very large transactions will confuse the market.
HFT is something else entirely and exists to sort out areas of market inefficiency such as large bid/ask spreads - which provides liquidity at the public market. 
Dark pool markets require extreme order sizes that would almost certainly move the market somewhat at their smallest increment. TradeHill's darkpool doesn't price units of BTC in USD - it prices units of $1000 USD in BTC.

A Qt wallet probably will never offer instant payments beyond what is already possible. For these to work you need an underwriter. All you need for instant payments is trust. The bitcoin protocol is designed to support zero trust dealings. If you have trust (either in an underwriter via a green address or other guarantee, or just because the person sending you bitcoin is known to you) there is no need to wait for confirmation.

Looks about right. At $75/BTC the block reward is $1875, which is where you get the miner's profit over fixed (amortized cost of equipment) and unfixed (electricity, rent, etc.) costs.
Not to mention the fact that many people don't pay anywhere near $0.15/kWh.
The residential base rate where I live is $0.099/kWh and because we have an open electricity market you can get it down to $0.068/kWh. Industrial kWh is much lower than all of these, and you'd qualify with a sufficiently large mining operation.

Bitcoin already has banks - just not FDIC insured ones.
Coinlenders.com is a good example. Pays interest on deposits, loans out and invests from deposit book. Insured by the operator - so a way to look at any deposit is as if you were giving the operator a loan (which is what you're doing whenever you put money into a fiat bank too).
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:59:03
Something like that - like Crowdfunding. I don't think people seeking interest should be allowed to do it under some pretense of zero risk - which is the lie of savings deposits. 
The system should be open and people seeking a return should be required to bear the risk; however the system should also make it as easy as possible to understand the risk.
When doing nothing is already going to provide a return in net purchasing power we don't need banks for savings - people who want loans can submit themselves to identity and credit verification and the publish that alongside their loan request and let the market determine the rate. 
Personally I think loans in general are badly structured. It would be better for such things to be structured as bonds where the borrower qualifies for funding based on a monthly payment amount and term and the market decides how much that actually gets the borrower.

51% =~1800 BTC/day * 1% = 18btc per day. 
Not including the hundreds of thousands if not millions of $ worth of BTC your scheme would cost to get from 0 to 51% it would cost you 18btc per day minimum to maintain that system at 51%.
If the pool op doesn't voluntarily self-limit below 51% the miners in the pool will. You may have a scam but they have an investment in the value of their coins.

There are a lot of things bitcoin simply cannot do until it has sufficient capitalization. I know this isn't an especially popular avenue of discussion but take it for an example. If I am a Drug Cartel, I have occasion every so often to need to need a series of gigantic bricks of $100 bills moved around the world - preferably in my direction. Bitcoin cannot currently accommodate a $100 Million transaction within its function as a payment system let alone be a useful store of value as an investment or as the cash reserve of a Fortune 1,000 company - or any appreciable fraction thereof.
However, once the network has sufficient market capitalization it will have unlocked uses - not only nefarious ones - that will enable it to be more broadly adopted and to become useful in more and more areas.
This is completely disregarding the idea of Bitcoin as simply the minimum viable product of the blockchain itself as a platform, which is capable of supporting much - much more.
People making 'guesses' that 1 BTC may eventually have the exchange value of thousands or even thousands of thousands of USD are obviously way ahead of themselves - but what they're referencing isn't just pure speculative flight of fancy. 
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology. Possibly a massively disruptive one. Possibly more disruptive to economics and the state itself than anything since we started using money in the first place - and to be slightly less hyperbolic, since the evolution of the fiat-monetary system.
When we talk about technologies being disruptive, they are disruptive for exactly the reason people discount them - because they represent a fundamental shift in how human society and civilization function.
The options for bitcoin aren't QUITE binary. It could still be useful as a payment processing system and exist as a service within the financial system we are all familiar with. It could be discarded and a bitcoin could become worthless (I actually think this is unlikely unless it were to be replaced with something far superior to it, but it is a possibility). 
I suspect that if it found success as a payment system it could at the very least occupy the space currently occupied by PayPal as well as MoneyGram/WesternUnion... it could also become the backbone of the Hawala network for example... in which case it would retain sufficient value as to be used as it is used in the illegal markets...
I actually don't see how it could stay there and just do that as it is incredibly useful and becomes more and more useful as it gets bigger... but I even so I think some level of stasis as some global valuation roughly equivalent to the global capitalization of a significant percentage of remittances send around the world... a significant percentage of all slightly-above-retail level illicit business... a significant percentage of most any international money transfers... We're talking about an entity cautiously worth billions of dollars already.
But I actually think in the long run the fact that it has such a good value proposition in a multitude of economic areas means that it will grow in those areas and as the network capitalization grows it will be able to consume more and more of the economy which WILL convert to it ultimately because it provides so many benefits that the alternatives do not.
All that said I acknowledge that bitcoin could find stasis at some relatively small value (in the $100s or low $1000s) relative to the USD - but I think it only slightly more likely than bitcoin collapsing to 0 completely... and if it does not collapse to zero it will retain all of those benefits and I think the ways it grows to encompass more and more of the economy and displace more and more industries and state monopolies are more clear and evident than the ways in which it might become worthless.
Is it obvious that I've been falling asleep this whole time?

It's an interesting question you may or may not want the answer to. In 1929 the stock market crashed, and hard. Many, many people had huge amounts of their life savings annihilated - some lost everything... not just in the stock markets but in the subsequent bank failures.
This led to a series of 'reforms' that brought the US the "FDIC" (Federal Deposit Insurance ~~Ponzi Scheme~~ Corporation) and the "SEC" (Securities and Exchanges Commission). The FDIC was designed to insure deposits against the obvious problems with fractional reserve banking - and in so doing drove up fees and did serious damage to interest on deposits.
The SEC was designed to make sure that nobody could ever be subject to risk in the equities markets ever again and ~~everyone became millionaires over night~~ the depression dragged on for a decade.
The idea behind 'accredited investors' isn't so much elitist as it is classist. The idea is that the non-wealthy are not intelligent enough to manage their own money (otherwise they'd be wealthy, q.e.d.) - although that's just how it actually plays out. In its intent it was baby-with-the-bathwater (nanny)statism that was attempting to 'protect' those without significant means from throwing their life savings behind pets.com or whatever...
But, as with any statist regulation that ignores the commonality and right to liberty (and to make ones own mistakes)... Let me start again... 
But, as with all statist regulations, the only way to 'protect' the 'working class' is to reduce their agency to make sure they can't make any mistakes... and in so doing make sure they can't get ahead either.

I'm not sure I follow. Do your friends already know bitcoin? Will it need to be explained to them in the first half of the interview? 
My first question, if they already know bitcoin, would be to ask what they think it would take for bitcoin to be used. MPesa was effectively pushed out to 80% of Kenya overnight when safaricom launched it. 
Most Kenyans use feature phones - at least for now. 
Assuming again that they know bitcoin, my question would be - rationally speaking, if bitcoin could be interfaced with in EXACTLY the same way as MPesa - would the fact that it's bitcoin and not MPesa be sufficient for adoption? What if they could keep a btc balance and accept MPesa and pay someone else btc and have them receive MPesa if they didn't have a bitcoin wallet? 
What are the biggest friction points mpesa? Would any of them be solved immediately just by using bitcoin? What other friction points experienced with mpesa would a bitcoin service provider be wise to avoid? Are there any aspects of the mpesa system that everyone who uses the system knows would make it better - but which would be unprofitable or anti-profitable or which for some other reason safaricom hasn't implemented?

There are a number of countries that do not levy personal income taxes. This does not entirely overlap the larger list of countries that levy no capital gains taxes.
If you are an American citizen you owe taxes whether you're resident in the USA or not - so you can't just move to a tax haven to avoid taxes, you have to renounce your citizenship (and prove you're doing so not exclusively for tax reasons). I'm unaware of other countries that have the same sort of laws so if you're not from the US you can go to a tax haven as an expat.
The question as to why everyone doesn't do that has as much to do with why people don't move to other countries voluntarily for a variety of reasons. Why doesn't everyone who believes in social democracy just move to Sweden?

Following up on what commented. 
At the heart of fractional reserve banking is a guarantee - and that guarantee is a lie. Before deposit insurance every bank was either a Ponzi scheme or just naive. Since the advent of fiat currency and central banks the lie is intentional - they guarantee your money but actively work to make it worth less - ensuring they can repay it at the promised rate but dissembling the fact that they've stolen the difference between the values at the time of deposit and withdrawal. 
The way to make it work in bitcoin requires a change of mindset where the depositor becomes an investor. Recognizing deposits for what they really are (loans at risk of default and investments at risk of failure) is how it will (and already does) work in the bitcoin economy. Exchange in your mind the guarantee of secret theft for the possibility of open loss.

It is conceivable that the corporate veil of Mutum Sigillum could be pierced and then the action might be taken directly against Tux (if that is how the action were taken). It actually would be an entirely different case if they pierced the veil and determined that Sigillum was a holding of Gox and not Tux - as this would make it an exchange and not a money transmitter... although it would also mean that Gox was in violation of other laws (just not the laws Sigillum is presently accused of being in violation of).
It's also possible (provided Tux used a decent law firm and wasn't the only shareholder of Sigillum) that the veil could hold, in which case only Sigillum would be affected - and it is not even clear to what extent it would be affected. They can hold the funds for a while in seizure, but depending on the judicial outcome it's plausible they'd just pay a hefty fine, have to complete the appropriate registrations, and then would get the money back.
Seeing as Sigillum doesn't charge for its services (at least I've never paid any fees)... in fact in my experience they even eat the $0.25 Dwolla transfer fee... it might make it possible to argue that Sigillum is an incorrectly registered US branch office of Gox (which it is), in which case it's not really guilty of not correctly registering as a money transmitter (although it may be guilty of some sort of fraud).

Ironically, bitcoin cannot become useful for real adoption in commerce until it has sufficient capitalization and is sufficiently liquid in that capitalization. In that sense, we need to have speculators get the valuation up high enough that it becomes useful for more businesses to adopt it. 
We're closing in on a billion dollars in total capitalization - which is a lot of money to be sure... but not yet nearly enough to allow market conversion to BTC of any appreciable size to even really begin - what we have now are a number of early adopters helping to establish and prove the concept as businesses and as consumers.

One of the funny things about technical analysis is that it is somewhat self-fulfilling. When all of the traders are looking at the same chart and have the same basic concept of what markets 'should' do under certain circumstance - lo and behold, it's what markets try to do.
I try to hedge here a little bit because, after all, there is *some* fundamental value to BTC both as a store of value and a transmitter of value... so one needs to look past (or through) the technical trades.
Fortunately it all evens out in the end. Technical trading is about the candles and the indicators while fundamental trading is about the direction of the mean (and the whys behind that direction)

When a bitcoin transaction is made, 100% of the coins in the sending address(es) are sent. The portion of the coins sent to the intended recipient are sent to that address - and the change is sent to another address connected to the wallet of the original sender.

Nothing prevents anyone from giving loans denominated in Bitcoin. The present value expansion makes repaying such loans difficult. The primary use for a bitcoin denominated loan, at present, is to short BTC on the exchanges.
Once Bitcoin reaches some level of stability in purchasing power/value it will become just as reasonable to hold and take debt denominated in bitcoin as it is in fiat - although the APR rates will be different (current rates factor in inflation, while btc denominated interest rates might need to factor in deflation - depending on when we reach that stability).

In principle I suppose - but as anyone sending a transaction probably has an interest in it being confirmed as quickly as possible they would prefer to announce it broadly to ensure it is in as many mining queues as possible so that it will make it into the next block. 
Gox could (who knows, perhaps they do) contract with the major pools to ensure their address space is white listed for the highest probability of next block inclusion.

We already pay those fees - although we don't think about it because they're not presented as fees. The stupid low interest you get on your demand deposits is a lot less than what your bank is getting from the FRB on deposits and their bond portfolio (let alone the leveraged gambles on derivatives they make). As they don't pass these gains along to you as a depositor (with the exception of a pittance of "interest" which is not just a small fraction of what they make but a small fraction even of inflation) what they gain is effectively the fee you pay to use their service... let alone any nominal fees such as maintenance fees... atm fees... etc... and the 2-5% they charge to retailers whenever you use your debit/credit card - which, let us admit, is how MOST of us spend MOST of our money.
The fact remains, however, that banks are trusted... in much the same way abusive parents are by their abused children... respected / feared / whatever. It is hero's work to break that relationship, but I think we (as a community) would be well served to co-opt it before we destroy it. Let the banks in - let them help us convert the economy to sound financial and monetary policy... THEN we can point out to everyone that everything their bank is doing they can do themselves.

In principal the fixed/operating costs of 2 miners is 2x the cost of 1. You can expand your net earnings but not your profit margin. Hashes are entirely fungible. If the present network hashrate = *p*, 1 hash/s = (1h/s)/*p* of the total mining network at any given time. If the present network hashrate expands by *n*-hashes/s the productivity of 1 hash/s correspondingly decreases to (1h/s)/(*p*+*n*).
*Difficulty* is a throttling mechanism - and I assume this isn't for your benefit but for anyone else who happens to be reading this - that determines what percentage of all conceivable hashes can be used to sign valid blocks so as to keep the rate of new blocks at approximately 1/10minutes. In this sense regardless of what mining computer you use it will still produce the same number of valid hashes over an equitable number of total hashes. 
Obviously an old card is statistically less likely to produce a valid hash over a fixed period of time - however if you have one device type that produces *h* hashes/second, and a second device type that produces 1000*h* hashes/second - then 1000 devices of the first type will find valid hashes at the exact same rate as 1 device of the second type over the same period of time. 
Obviously you'd make more nominal profit - I'm only commenting that your profit margin doesn't increase relative to operation costs when you move from 1x device of a certain type to *n* devices of the same type unless you're realizing efficiencies - for example expanding your farm from a 'commercial' scale to an 'industrial' scale and therefore qualifying for cheaper industrial electricity costs.
**Edit**: I didn't mention, obviously, that where ASICs benefit and *do* realize additional efficiency over other miner-types is in their MH/J (megahashes/joule) ratio which means the fixed cost of *n* hashes **is** cheaper on an ASIC. My point is that adding another device of the same type to a network of homogeneous devices will increase nominal gains but will not increase profit margin.

Just woke up so didn't RTFT.
When a lender gives a loan (regardless of whether the loan is denominated in bitcoin, bullion, or bread) they are taking two risks. So long as a loan is outstanding, the lender doesn't have the money and cannot do anything with it. This is an 'opportunity risk'. 
The second is that the party who has taken the loan will fail to repay the loan ('default risk'). 
At the minimum a lender must factor these two risks into their calculation. If 5% of loans are defaulted on, and the lender must forgo other investment opportunities worth 3% of their outstanding loans over a given period of time... then a loan must have **at least** an interest rate of 8.69% (1/0.92) for that same period for the lender to be compensated for their risk.
This isn't greed - it's simply what the lender would need to charge to break even over the given time period.
The lender should then also be compensated not only for their risk but for their service. Lending / credit / etc are all important aspects of a functional economy. Whether it is an business who needs to manage their payroll or purchasing, or a new business that needs to capitalize their infrastructure before they can produce whatever value-added product or service they seek to sell... some sort of financing (equity, loans, etc) are almost always necessary.
The provision of this capital is an essential service. In Bitcoinia we must then provide to those willing to offer such a service more benefit than they would get just by holding on to their bitcoin over the same period of time. Even if this profit is only 1% over that time period it still would require (given the above hypotheticals) an return on investment of at least 9.69% to cover both risks and rewards.
There is nothing usurious about this. If bitcoin were deflating at a predictable rate of 5% per year, and the USD were inflating at a predictable rate of 3% per year, then this would translate to a 17.69% interest rate in USD if the given period of time were 1 year - which is about what credit card companies charge.
Bitcoin is not meant to get us away from interest rates - these are essential... nor is it mean to get us away from some sort of 'financial sector'. It is meant to give us control over when and how we participate in those sectors - to force participants who wish to offer such services to compete and to offer rewards consummate with the risks. It frees us from forced banking and taxation by inflation and the madness of modern monetary policy. It allows us to store and spend **our** money as **we** see fit.
It is entirely capitalist. It is greedy. It just doesn't want to be taxed involuntarily.

Technically speaking, there is no such thing as "a Bitcoin". Bitcoin is the name of the protocol. The protocol itself only recognizes full integers of what the community has named 'Satoshi'. 
1BTC isn't a thing. It is 100,000,000 Satoshi. We've just added a decimal to make it useful and given that a name.
25 ubit is actually 2500 Satoshi.
Edit: to use an analogy you might be familiar with.... Talking about "A Bitcoin" relative to the Bitcoin monetary system is akin to talking about "A Benjamin" relative to the USD monetary system. A 'Benjamin' is just $100, or 10,000 cents just as a bitcoin is 100 bitcents and 1000 millibits and a million microbits and a hundred million satoshi.

* First, consider what percentage of your current income isn't dedicated to primary expenses (food, housing, auto, insurance, clothing, hookers, etc.)
* If your company offers a retirement savings account akin to a 401K or IRA and provide matching to your deposits, contribute the maximum amount they'll match (or don't).
* If you have any installment debt (student loans, auto loans, mortgage loans, etc) that you aren't already paying more than the minimum on dedicate some percentage of what you're saving right now to paying more than the minimum on those - and **[snowball them](
* As yourself why you've bought - and are considering buying more - Bitcoin. Are you a believer in the tech and its promise? Or, are you looking at it as an investment denominated in fiat? If the former, look for ways to use bitcoin besides just holding it. Lending it, buying things, investing in crypto-securities (crypto-currency denominated securities), etc. If the latter, or some hybrid of the two, don't invest a eurocent more than you can afford to lose and pretend as though you'd just set fire to anything you DO spend on Bitcoin. 
If you're not going to be a currency trader (which it sounds like you're not going to be) pretend as though it is literally and forever impossible to turn your BTC back into fiat.

If you exclude yourself from the US/EU AML system you're also functionally excluding yourself from ACH (Automated Clearing House, ie bank wire system) - so how exactly would you get fiat IN to such an exchange?
What you'd actually need to do to make this work is have the exchange only handle virtual currencies in/out. You could then, as the exchange, create a portal to a public exchange and allow your users the ability to trade for fiat 'virtually' through a second level order book. 
This would only serve as a speculative market.

Well, if the casino is capturing value from outside of the bitcoin economy - which they may well do in the form of American (and other) gamblers purchasing bitcoin to allow them to gamble online; and, once captured that value remains within the bitcoin economy - it is a net positive to the economy as a whole (in the same sense that tourist dollars flow into a casino and fund the local economy - at the risk of financial strain to the local population should they also participate in the casino).
However, an online casino doesn't do much in the way of provide jobs to others in the bitcoin economy (other than the small team that builds the casino). If it were a publicly traded company (such as SatoshiDice) then it might serve to distribute some of the wealth it captures back into the economy - but I'd be very skeptical that anyone every bought bitcoin just so they could play satoshi dice. Much better would be if SealsWithClubs was public as they may actually capture external value.
I've been mostly addressing the directed question of what 'happens to the [Bitcoin] economy' when a gambling site is used. As with all questions, of course, the answer is that 'it depends.' Sites offering traditional casino games are probably more likely to capture outside wealth - and perhaps serve as an additional entry point for people who were not likely bitcoin adopters to become bitcoin adopters (which **is** beneficial to the economy).
The only thing that is really 'beneficial' to any economy is growth through value-addition. Value addition comes to the economy (to any economy) either from investment or labor. In our case when someone who never owned any bitcoin buys some bitcoin and therefore enters our economy, this is a small addition (albeit not a very **sticky** one) of value to the economy. Better still is when investors use their bitcoins (or other currencies) to invest in bitcoin companies - as these build value addition to the economy (less so mining companies, but there's still some of that as mining is one of our economy's more effective marketing tools).
The value of the economy isn't well measured by the 'market capitalization' of the currency. Ideally, the economy should be many times the money supply... at the moment I suspect it is inverted (which doesn't necessitate a crash but could lead to one).
Much better are the people who receive or convert some (or all) of their paycheck into bitcoin - as they are withdrawing some portion of their value-addition to their local economy and transmitting it to the bitcoin economy in the same way that new bitcoin users contribute (but in a stickier way).
What we need, of course, is for some level of value addition to exist exclusively within the bitcoin economy. There are very few actors doing this at the moment. 
To add value exclusively within the bitcoin economy you must either acquire the base material or service with bitcoin / improve it / and sell it for bitcoin... or you must buy the  base material or service with another currency / improve it / sell it for bitcoin / and keep the profit in bitcoin.
Anyway - when tourists gamble in bitcoin casinos, that's good for the economy. When participants in the bitcoin economy gamble in bitcoin casinos it is at **best** a wash.

Even for that to work the feature would need to be antagonistic or antithetical to the basic philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin - and still be excessively desirable. 
This is because even if a vastly superior technological advance were made in an altcoin, unless it is also simultaneously something the core dev team couldn't philosophically get behind it would be implemented in the Bitcoin protocol sometime after the altcoin had done its proof of concept work and long before the altcoin had made any serious inroads into Bitcoin's base of adoption.

The lower bound (satoshi) is a soft limit. We can add additional places beyond the decimal if there were cause to. At the moment 1 satoshi has the purchasing power of 1/100,000th of 1 US cent - there is no practical need for a smaller atomic unit. If the development team and the miners agreed that there *was* cause for a smaller unit it could be further divided.

In principal the fact that you'd know how much gold you could trade your digits for would always be the same is an ok thing - but then you'd have to trust the entity holding all of the gold... and pay the costs associated with the holding of all that gold and keeping it safe... 
And the one thing that history has born out repeatedly is that nobody that holds a backing item against some scrip or other ever holds nearly enough of it to pay all of the holders of the scrip.
Also - if its a crypto-currency - what happens when the goldbits are lost because someone forgot their key or died or something? Whose gold is it now? Everyone's? How can you tell the difference between virtual scrip that's lost and scrip that's just in multi-generational savings?
Problems abound. If you want gold - go buy some gold. I'm sure most people here do.

It depends on the number of nodes both parties are connected to and how fast the transaction can propagate through the network. For a sufficiently well announced transaction you can have a very reliable transaction at 0 confirmations - this is how live point of sale transactions work (say, if you're buying coffee or something at your local coffeehouse).
The number of confirmations is strictly an added security mechanism that adds confidence that the transaction will be in the permanent record.
The real time to transaction is milliseconds between when the tx is announced and when it has been repeated to a sufficient number of nodes. Confirmation is a bit different and takes a bit longer.

An executor - be it a lawyer or trusted family person - is necessary when dealing with estates *now* - so nothing insofar as that goes would change really.

I suspect wealth destruction by death will be an intermediate problem - one that people with the wherewithal to do such planning can plan to avoid.
I also anticipate that there will be a significant percentage of the population at full adoption that doesn't *want* the level of direct control and responsibility that is inherent in personal wallet management - in which case they're likely to still use banks (albeit with accounts denominated in bitcoin) who will take on the responsibility for security and provision of access... in which case management of funds on death would proceed exactly as it does now.

The difficulty rise is a symptom of the mining arms race. Another symptom will end up being an increasing cost paid to develop new and better hardware. As the cost of maintaining a network share increases and miners decline to sell at an unprofitable exchange price this will result in upward pressure. 
Given that the number of new coins per period remains the same, coins will be sold for $x and those dollars will be invested into chips - mining in this sense is just a way of buying coins at a (hopefully) cheaper fiat price. Rinse and repeat. 
If there should come a time when it is not economically viable to invest in new hardware, no new investments will be made until it is and the network will weaken and the difficulty go down as older machines fail and aren't replaced - until the economics make sense again and new investment takes place.

The CFTC is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Them 'regulating' Bitcoin amounts to them certifying it as a tradeable asset.
This isn't just NOT bad news, it is fantastic news. This would enable ETFs, ETNs... the CFTC cannot regulate the protocol, however they **can** create regulations that determine how Bitcoin is traded on US Markets... Effectively, this might be considered an early harbinger to the CME becoming a Bitcoin exchange... with options on the CBOE and ETFs on the NYSE... and every other financial market in the world.
This will enable a great deal in the Bitcoin economy. It will allow merchants and payment service providers the ability to better hedge their risk. It will enable liquidity. It will enable massive new tiers of business to adopt the currency.
Again, neither the CFTC nor any regulator can impact the protocol (unless they decide to contribute code found valuable to the community)... they CAN impact how Bitcoin can be used legally in their jurisdiction (if at all), and of all the regulators that COULD decide to make Bitcoin their own I'd much rather it was the CFTC than the Treasury. The CFTC has no conflict of interest with Bitcoin.

The lowest fee/tier is still 0.25% for &gt;500.000 BTC/month, correct? Are there accounts maintaining that level of transaction volume? And, if so, are the HFTraders among them? 
Offering volume discounts is good for liquidity providers - but have you considered perhaps a flat fee of *x* plus the standard percentage? If the flat fee were something small like 0.000075 BTC it would add 0.75% on top of any fees for a 0.01 BTC transaction - more than doubling any fees paid by micro-trading algos but not especially relevant to retail traders.

It may be faster to pay your partner via bank wire if your partner doesn't want bitcoin... Almost certainly not cheaper though. 
Coinbase will limit how much bitcoin you can buy although I'd suggest linking and buying one to start the 30 day timer and get yourself level 2 account status with id verification so that you can buy instantly next month. 
You should also get the ball rolling on bank/ID verification on dwolla and campbx - and if you have a need to make a buy soon I'd suggest you draw up a USPS money order and mail it to campbx to fund quickly. 
Remember that buying bitcoins with dollars is a novel financial service and just like you link your credit cards and PayPal and direct deposit to your bank account and do ID verification for each of those - you need to do it for bitcoin...

The network effect strongly indicates that it would take a significantly superior competitor to replace bitcoin. Not just that, but bitcoin is open source - so if there were a new idea out there that was obviously better they'd have to not just beat bitcoin to releasing it but would have to get enough people to convert before it was integrated into the bitcoin protocol - and the possibility that it CAN be integrated into the bitcoin protocol with sufficient consensus would indicate that people wouldn't switch.
If only a portion of the network integrated the new feature(s), we might have a fork - which leads to the possibility if not the probability that if something WERE to replace bitcoin it would be a forked version of bitcoin - in which case we'd all have the same amount of money on that network as we did on this one at the time of the fork. 
MtGox's slowness is nothing new, but the the network has a larger population now so it's issues are felt by more people. The CoinLab move will speed things up considerably for North American customers - and if it's successful you can bet a similar partnership will come along for Europe.
There are a number of reasons why a gold or other commodity backed crypto-currency is redundant and not a great idea. There's nothing wrong with gold by any means - but the one thing you really gain with it over bitcoin or dollars or any other digital currency is that it is a physical thing you can bury in your back yard and dig up in 50 years and it will still be the same thing in the same amount it was when you buried it. If you securitize it and make some piece of paper a representation of physical gold... why is that better? You don't have a piece of gold - you have a few digits you can trade for a piece of gold.
Bitcoin are digits you can trade for gold already.

The longer any correction takes to occur the more time it gives the utility to catch up. More valuable bitcoin means more value can be accommodated by the network more fluidly meaning as value increases more and more utility is unlocked - meaning the higher we go, the better the fundamentals get.

Your odds of the winning the lottery are neigh infinitely better than stumbling on an address with even a pittance let alone real money in it. Therefore, for the immoral such as yourself, the lottery is just as nefarious and with much better odds.

One of the main things that stands in the way of a strong US exchange presence is the granular and expensive state-by-state licensing requirements.

In markets the larger user-base becomes self-reinforcing. More users and money equals more liquidity which is the only thing that really matters. Even if another exchange had lower fees you'd lose more to slippage than the difference in fees very quickly- so the cost of moving to a new exchange is prohibitively high so people don't do it unless there's a truly compelling reason.

Primary shares are administered by ASICMINER / friedcat and are attached to a verified bitcoin address... basically its your bitcoin address that owns the shares, not you - you just hopefully own the address which is also where dividends are paid.
To buy primary shares I suggest **[the Unified ASICMINER Orderbook]( although independent direct auctions are also held on occasion in the bct auction subforum.
**Edit:** This process typically requires at least a day or more to fill an order, and escrow is HIGHLY recommended - which adds time to the process. The sale isn't finalized until ASICMINER completes the share reassignment, which could take a while given the fact that this is not their primary business (ASICs/Mining is). The benefit of buying on BCTC or Bitfunder is that you have automated escrow through their system (as well as options trading, now) and the efficiency of the market makes up for its relative (lack of) depth.
You can also buy the shares on BTCT.co and automatically re-invest your dividends (DRIP) - or you can buy them there and have them 'pushed'. In such a case, on BTCT at least, you'd 'give' your shares to burnside (the pt administrator as well as the primary owner of the site itself) and he'd in turn have the same number of shares re-assigned to you in the primary shareholder registry. Terra does the same thing on BitFunder (at this point I think operating pass throughs could be his full time job if it isn't already).

It really depends on what constitutes Bitcoin's value. It's possible that we're not far enough along in the timeline to constrain mining to industrial players. Litecoin is minable by a broader spectrum of users, so if the mining incentive or opportunity reduction in bitcoin is depressing the exchange value it would stand to reason that sich issues are not affecting litecoin in the same way.

Many funds might consider opening a small position in bitcoin but cannot as the bitcoin markets are out of bounds to their published strategy. Just as gold serves a hedge against the collapse of society, bitcoin and other cryptos serve as a hedge against the rise of crypto currencies. Bitcoin is also a way to play the technological leapfrogging of the developing world with an instrument that remains balanced against international markets. More likely, though, is that it would provide an open market opportunity to take a flier on a disruptive new technology. 
Funds would flow into the etf which would have to purchase additional coins by swapping new shares with a dealer (This strikes me as a very likely business for coinlab to make) to balance the price. This will ripple out to the direct btc markets as a fundamental new source of fiat liquidity. 
The only mechanism for bitcoin liquidity is to expand the purchasing power of smaller denominations which will likewise increase the liquidity of larger denominations in balance. 
The winklevoss etf may well be a failure, but I'd be surprised if more etf applications aren't filed in the next few months - and eventually one will make it through.

For one bottle isn't the shipping barely worth it? At least put pre-orders out by the case. While you probably want to lock your prices to the Euro value (if for no other reason than ensuring that they deflate correctly) you should also consider making the btc-cost of the beer markedly cheaper - say €4 worth of bitcoin per 300ml bottle suggested retail (24bottle case maybe €50 wholesale) while you charge maybe €5 per bottle (€100 / case).
This would put your halfkeg (29.3L) at €300 for par price/volume but you'd discount that as well at retail (say €200 per unit not including the deposit on the keg itself) for a wholesale of maybe €150. Keep these at the BTC prices, add 25% for straight fiat purchases.
Adjust prices accordingly to rationalize to your intended market, I meant this to be illustrative of what your proposed pricing structure would suggest at volume.

A hostile mining attack of sufficient size would disrupt things. If it was even desirable for government to attempt it I think the confidence breach would be very damaging for a period of time.

I see a lot of recommendations for updates to Bitcoin, but nothing indicating a necessity for a new altcoin. The economic benefit of currency choice is only a benefit if the altcoin is markedly / fundamentally different than Bitcoin. Otherwise it will be redundant or confusing to the market. 
Inherent within crypto currencies is the idea of hardcoded monetary policy. Rather than something which attempts to compete on the same basic policies we might instead want coins that represent alternative policies. Things like an unfixed money supply, or one that grows at a fixed rate. I wouldn't personally find such a coin all that desirable, but it's an example.

You only have to declare realized gains. This means that you only make money when you convert the coins back into your tax currency. As long as it stays in BTC it is just an asset like any other.
Technically speaking if you made any money at all you probably need to file taxes - regardless of how you made the money - so you owe income tax on the $500. If you'd accepted payment in the form of $500-worth of bitcoin, you'd still owe income tax on the $500.
For short term capital gains in the USA (if you held the BTC for less than a year before selling it) you'd pay capital gains tax at your income tax level. If you hold it for more than a year you pay at the long term capital gains tax level which is lower (in fact if you pay less than 20% income tax it's basically zero).

In a Democracy, each citizen is equally responsible/culpable for the decisions of their Government. Voting for the opposition does not absolve one of the consent they granted to be governed under that system in the first place - and it is that consent that carries with it culpability.
Every pro-life voter, every anti-death penalty voter, every anti-war voter, every Libertarian, and everyone participant in the GDP - is equally and personally responsible for every action of their government. If the choices of your government are not to your liking, you vote for those who will make choices you **do** agree with. To abstain is to submit - it is a vote in favor of whomever the rest of the population chooses. 
If your choice loses their election, by not emigrating or revolting (peacefully if it suits you and/or violently if that doesn't work), you are tacitly agreeing to be governed by the system and are therefore as equally responsible as those who elected your government.
Even outside of Democracy, the subjects of despots are just as responsible - as **not** revolting, either peacefully or violently, is just as much a choice as revolution.
**Subversion** is another choice, of course - one that has proven more effective than voting and less deadly than revolting - but is not inherently absolving of that shared responsibility. 
Only the true prisoner, the slave, the child, and the otherwise incapable are absolved.
As a user of (or even just a supporter of) Bitcoin, you are implicitly and explicitly subverting the legacy systems of economics and government. That is just as much a political choice as doing nothing, although I agree it is a more active choice.
In fact, you needn't even be an active supporter. Everyone running a full node is a passive party to this subversion.
I am just as responsible for my local fiat currency - by the consent to be governed I am implicitly granting in my choice of residence and my choice not to revolt (even if such individual revolution would be futile, it would likely result in my imprisonment which would create the condition of my absolution from the choices of my government) - as I am for the subversion of that currency through my participation in Bitcoin... 
One does not negate the other.

As a forum for a discussion that is, implicitly, an act of subversion - it is (in my opinion) the responsibility of the Moderators to publicize links to information that may help those who find themselves here understand the broader scope of the philosophies and subversions most in tune with that which we advocate and discuss here.

Money is fungible. If you maintain liquidity in both fiat and btc at all times on the exchanges you're watching then you don't have to move anything. 
In this fashion you 'settle' with yourself over time and have net plus fiat **and** net plus bitcoin after every pair trade. (by keeping half the profit in each form). 
The interesting thing about the current environment is that the only factor that matters is the rate of change. Gox has the liquidity, which means it leads the other exchanges up *and* down. 
One basic pair trade would be to buy gox/floor as the market declines and to sell it as the market rises. The spread isn't always worth it (if the market is slow) and sometimes lag means your information is out of date so you might avoid trading blind like that. 
Still not investment advice. 
There are significant risks to arbitrage. You stand to lose less than you might if you had all your money on one exchange and it got hacked or had an idiot running it who fell bass ackward into a Ponzi scheme - but the odds that *one*of the exchanges falls victim is higher.

Current debt instruments charge interest to offset inflation. A debt instrument in a deflationary system would only need to charge interest to ensure nominal returns. A lender currently operating in USD and collecting *x* in interest on loans would only need to charge (*x*-*i*-*d*) in interest (where *i* = inflation rate and *d* = deflation rate) to maintain the same level of gain in purchasing power. So long as interest remains a positive number (ensuring return on principal) the lender will realize a positive total return.

At full issue/full adoption (your assumption) the purchasing power of bitcoin should increase (ie deflation) at a rate roughly equal to productivity growth. 
Major technological change will occasionally create massive spikes in global productivity, but as huge a system as the global economy **is** the law of large numbers would suggest that such spikes wouldn't be felt by everyone at the same time (adoption rolls out at different rates in different places leading to a smoothing of the effects of major new efficiencies).
Let's imagine that from now until the soonest possible moment the conditions of your proposal **could** be true (ie ~2140 CE) global economic growth is slightly better year on year than it was over the past 20 years (giving us three bull cycles and two significant recessions). 
* Over the 20 years from 1990-2010 the average annual inflation-adjusted year-on-year growth rate in the Gross World Product was 3.60%
* Let's imagine we do better than that from now until 2140 and call it 5% annual real growth
So now we're in 2140 and all (nearly) 21,000,000 bitcoin have been mined and the global economy is outputting **[490x]( the productivity that it is **currently** outputting.
That's the economy you're talking about - if anyone has ANY idea what that would look like - write a book. I don't. But now that we have our assumed starting point let's get to the economics of the future...
Imagine the base rate of local-economic growth as the 'prime rate'. Basically it's the future-equivalent of the CPI (hopefully much better sourced). You're a financial company and you offer GuyA a loan for 350,000 satoshi so he can buy a house. The deflation is already the base interest rate - so anything anyone wants to charge over that is their lender's premium. A nominal mortgage for 350,000 satoshi might have a 0.01% nominal APR.
If the global economy is growing at 5% per year then this is a 'real' interest rate of 5.01% APR - which is well within the range of what people pay NOW.
Your credit card company might charge you 10% APR - that makes it 15% REAL APR - again, not unheard of in credit card land.
I completely fail to see why static currency / deflationary economics would have any effect on the credit market.

The way to do this, at this point at least, would be to:
1. have her parents set-up a MtGox account and for her to set up a coinbase account; 
1. parents fund mtgoxJPY acct; buy btc; send btc to her coinbase wallet
1. she sells for coinbaseUSD which is deposited into her bank account
If all of the accounts are not already set up, this will take a while; 
also: it would take as much as a couple days to fund the goxJPY account and another few days to receive the deposit from coinbase on her end.
If they had a local robocoin kiosk, and so did she, they could buy the btc at the atm directly to her address which she could then withdraw in USD at her local atm. (fiat&lt;-&gt;btc kiosk ubiquity is really how you solve the international money transmission / remittance question - although all of this can already be accomplished with localbitcoins, but i'd not recommend your gf try to get her parents to go that route). 
As they don't have the kiosks, the odds are that what they'd save in money (and they probably WOULD save money given the % that would be lost to international wire fees) they'd lose in the fact that the whole process would take 5-7 business days even if all of the accounts were already set up and verified and probably 2-3 weeks if not (i've no idea what the verification requirements/turnaround is on mtgox for Japanese customers).

As with all investments in bitcoin-land I've always stuck with the "never invest what you can't afford to lose entirely" route. If you feel as though the risk of loss is higher than the possible benefit then you probably should get your refund. 
My understanding is that BFL is currently delayed in chip-testing. I don't personally mine (directly) and have no pre-orders. If the economics still make sense once one or more manufacturers are caught up and there's something more than pure wild speculation in the difficulty and BTC/(GH/s) as well as other important factors (power consumption / etc) I would look into it. 
I can't really tell you what to do with your money, that's just where I stand for myself on BFL.

Purchasing power definitely matters. Especially to someone who took $140 of purchasing power and watched it turn into $14. My point was more that real users will stay and even *if* there were to be a massive reduction in purchasing power in bitcoin (ie a crash) - the community would find itself stronger than it was before the run up. Either bitcoin won't crash and the economy that uses it will grow to catch up, or it will crash and be in a better position to start moving back up with better economic justification. 
For some, and I'd count myself here, either option works just fine for my long term goals for bitcoin. For others though, the crash would cause massive disillusionment. This is why I applaud those not just jumping in with closed eyes. I believe you'll eventually be a user - but it's not necessary (and possibly not even desirable) for that eventually to be now.

The buyer of something is (almost) never the one responsible for sales tax - it is the seller that remits the sales tax (**edit:** actually I should clarify - if sales tax was not collected on something you bought, depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, you might technically be required to pay the tax on it when you file your annual taxes). It's hard to say as to whether or not bitcoin would be covered under sales tax.

Overpriced means a price sufficiently high that you cannot sell all of your supply. AM sold out of the first retail batches, therefore the price wasn't too high.
The pricing structure is meant to minimize the loss of potential revenue that would have been earned had AM just plugged the chips into the farm instead. If you can sell all of your supply for MORE than you expect the chips to earn in their lifetime, all the better.
I hope that the reduced cost has more to do with shipping a higher supply level than benevolence to the buyers.

Nobody will **ever** pay people in fixed amounts of Bitcoin. To be fair, nobody should be paying anyone in fixed amounts of Dollars either. 
Bitcoin-only payroll would likely need to be pegged to a CPI indicator. At the moment the CPI indicator we're using in Bitcoinia is the USD - but if we could establish enough sellers of standard CPI basket goods in BTC we could generate a BTCPI that would enable us to divorce standard valuation from the USD.
The real issue is that bitcoin is a global currency - so in some ways it will suffer from similar geographic issues as the Euro does as a multi-state currency. The cost of milk is naturally going to be different in Mali and Minnesota, for example, as different costs in production / transport / storage are involved... as are the costs of living and labor. The cost of petrol will always be different in Truro and Tehran.
Bitcoin will be dynamic in value, not only in terms of fluctuations of the local price index but will also be subject to differentiation in value between localities.
Bitcoin **is** a global currency - and even if it isn't to be **the** global currency it will still be subject to these issues.

In your edit scenario, you will get 1 BTC because that's all you bid on. You'll only win that bid if nobody has bid higher than you or before you at $65 - and the market would fill the order at the offer price not the ask price. The bid/ask price is only used if it isn't filled immediately.
If I were to bid $1000 for 1BTC my order would immediately fill at the lowest ask price. If I were to bid $30 for 1 BTC my order wouldn't fill unless all higher ask orders had filled and until all other $30 bid orders placed before I placed my order had filled.
Ask is the exact inverse. If I were to ask $1000 for 1BTc my order would not fill until all lower ask orders had filled and all earlier $1000/1BTC orders had filled. If I were to ask $30 my order would fill immediately at the price of the highest asking order. 
Asking less than the highest bid, or bidding higher than the lowest ask are both effectively market limit orders. If instead of bidding $1000 for 1 BTC I were to bid $1000 per 1BTC up to 500 BTC my order would fill all asks up to $1000 or 500 BTC (whichever came first). In this case 500BTC would come long before $1000 per 1BTC

I think a lot of what makes altcoins valuable is what made Bitcoin initially valuable.
1. You put work into mining the coin
1. You value a thing you put work into creating
1. Other people also mine coins and therefore value them
1. Because some people value a thing, it has a value - therefore other people can use it for value - even if they don't value the underlying proposition they can value that others value it.
Obviously fewer people value any of the altcoins, therefore their value is less - and will in all likelihood always be less; however, the fact that consumers have effectively been priced/tech'd out of mining bitcoin means that a large and growing number of people may value the altcoins for the same reason people initially vauled bitcoin (because they mined them).
Why people initially put work into mining bitcoin has to do with their technical knowledge and philosophies (they mined it because they valued the proposition), and valued them because they'd mined them - however now people put work into mining altcoins, at least initially, because they also value bitcoin.
Where only a few people had the technical capacity and interest to both understand and value the technical aspects and philosophical motivations of bitcoin in 2009/2010 - and therefore there were a small number of miners... many many people can understand and value the community and economic aspect of what bitcoin has become. 
I don't think altcoins are simply people playing "me-too!", nor do I think altcoins lend much in the way of technical or economic benefit... however, some people think both of these things and therefore mine altcoins, thefore giving altcoins value, therefore making altcoin mining valuable.

Who knows? A permanently inflationary currency would probably be more easily adopted by an economy already based on debt (for example) - although I think such an altcoin would probably be able to exist along-side bitcoin (the 'dollar' to Bitcoin's gold) 
But a fixed rate of inflation is actually worse than an unfixed rate OR a fixed supply monetary system. Better would probably be to use a floating rate of inflation that seeks to match a certain desirable velocity of the currency (which the protocol should be able to calculate) 
Edit: as I hopefully alluded to in GP, that wouldn't be my choice. Bitcoin's monetary policy is almost perfect in my estimation. That said, I can't assume the world will agree with me.

The same way they currently collect taxes.
* Income tax withholding is primarily handled by payroll service providers / employers
* Sales taxes are remitted by retailers 
* Bitcoin does little good in hiding taxable real estate
You can lie about your income if you file your taxes yourself, but in the event of an audit they'd probably just ask your employer.
Ultimately tax avoidance is difficult for all but the self employed.
This is already where the IRS has the hardest time with verifying income / taxes. About 10.5% of the employed US population is self employed in one way or another^[[1]]( . Although at least a third of that are people who own their own incorporated businesses (Self Employed, incorporated) - which means they have additional financial reporting requirements (and subsequently more difficulty in hiding their income).
The remaining ~6% or so of american workers who are unincorporated, self employed workers are an (obviously) non-trivial number of tax payers for whom taxation would be made somewhat more difficult.
Of course, this is already the hardest population to tax. The main process in taxation is historical. If you reported X in income last year and you report 0.5X in income this year - an audit is likely.
Forensic accounting won't be as easy as it is right now under a Bitcoin monetary regime - but it is still very possible.
This is completely ignoring the fact that the tax situation as it currently exists in the US is FUBAR.
Consumption-based tax, perhaps something like the Fair Tax^TM , would be a much easier program for the State to use in a Bitcoin-based monetary system - as businesses are easier to identify / audit / etc and it is the job of the seller to remit consumption taxes (it is nearly impossible to avoid paying consumption taxes).

An attack isn't an attack until the miner is inserting hostile information. In that sense it's effectively the same thing as a code error fork. We don't need to roll back all the way. We need to rebuild the chain from where honest miners began processing dishonest information - which they will have continued to do anyway. 
A rollback of just a couple hours is what would happen - and just like last time we'd be able to overcome it. It would work similarly to a valid doublespend attack. The merchants who accepted illegitimate trades would be out (provided they actually shipped in the handful of hours of the fork). Sellers in general should probably be insured against this remote possibility.

Except you didn't need to sell your BTC and then need to get your USD back off the exchange or from whomever you sold it to or pay exchange fees - and perhaps you spent your BTC at a retailer that offers a discount for spending with BTC...
And if they don't offer a discount perhaps they can be convinced to - they've taken the first step, the next can now follow - and if they're accepting bitcoin and using a payment processor they may well have a relatively simply option of only converting a portion of the sale back to local currency... and as more transactions take place and if the price strengthens they'll be inclined to do so...
You're also getting people in companies to talk about bitcoin. How many employees at the company had to sit in a meeting where it was decided to accept bitcoin? How many watercooler conversations is that? How many new subscriptions to this sub and new wallets is that?
These are mostly tech / ecommerce companies we're talking about - so there're probably coders out there. They've probably heard about bitcoin on HN or elsewhere - but they may have dismissed it. Now their company accepts it. How many new contributors is that to the git? How many new commits?

I've tried this a couple ways and I find myself lecturing which I don't feel the need to do.
Say you have a company and you want to move your company into the bitcoin economy. Awesome. How does one do that? One converts their USD to bitcoin - pays their employees in bitcoin - etc. Maybe they pay their employees in bitcoin and if their employees don't want bitcoin they can have their bitcoin sent to a bitpay account instead of a bitcoin wallet. Fine... if you're a corner drug store with a total net worth of $250,000.
What if you're a company worth more than the whole bitcoin network is? How does moving into BTC change things when simply by adopting it you double or triple the size of the market? Much easier to wait until the market can accommodate you - because either it will or it won't and there's no point risking anything until you know that it does.
This doesn't just apply to huge businesses - to move a small business into BTC even partially would provide some level of disruption to the network at this size.

I actually had a whole follow up post that I think got eaten by the ether or me just forgetting it to do actual work - but I was thinking the same thing. The underground economy relies at present on USD$100 bills almost exclusively, there's no reason why it shouldn't take up bitcoin - except that there isn't enough capital for it to be useful. It would be impossible to pay some drug cartel $100m for a ship-full of drugs without eating way more than is acceptable to slippage.... i don't think it's been established that half of the current issuance is even floating, there're statistical / academic reports that put lost/dead coins in the millions.
But what works for the drug cartels and the dictators also works for the hedge funds and the banks. Bitcoin's usefulness in the urban third-world shouldn't be underestimated either - it's valid wherever cellphones are - and some of those places have a real economy and no real currency...
There are countless vectors into which bitcoin can grow, white black and gray - and it will grow... but it needs liquidity to get into those cracks and carve them into channels where it can really be used - and we're not there. 
Its early days yet.

Complying with annoying laws is annoying, yes. There are ways around it so it's really a matter of figuring out if your tax liability is more than it would cost you to pay the appropriate legal and accounting people to get away from it.
If you're both buying and selling on the same exchange it's very possible that you're running a serious audit risk.
What we SHOULD have is a swap pool people can sign up for to lend out or sell their trading losses, if they have any, in excess of what they can write off to participants who have to report significant capital gains. Alas, for someone to have booked any losses at all in the BTC market this year they'd need to be the sort of idiot one doesn't deal with if one can avoid it.

Annualized dividends (current div * number of divs per year) as a percentage the share price is referred to as a "dividend yield". APR refers to interest rates (on debts, typically, although bond coupon/price is also usually referred to as a yield).

Equal share, maybe (although we'll have almost another billion people by 2020). 
I take issue with 'fair share' though. A person's 'fair share' of bitcoin is the amount of bitcoin they have earned in exchange for value in goods or other currencies or work.
If I were a retailer, and were to take part in this system, I might offer a certain percentage of the amount I was saving in fees as a refund to buyers who paid me for my goods/services in bitcoin - and to put a time-delay on that... as giving someone the equivalent of $3200 in purchasing power as a refund on a purchase they made for $30 in equivalent purchasing power would be amusing.

At these prices there is still more than sufficient margin even with higher-than-average prices per kWh; even with GPU miners (time limited on that). 
Depending on your source of renewable energy remember first that it requires a huge, fixed, upfront cost associated with the installation of solar or wind generation - basically you're prepaying for some or all of your electricity for the next 30 years.
Programs like SolarCity might be logical addendum and if a miner lives in a serviced area of SC or a similar company it may well make sense (basically you're just leasing your roof to them) and underwriting some of their installation costs.
It's an idea people have thrown around for a while and is one of the reasons mining operations are frequently sited in places with underwritten electricity.
The upfront costs are extreme. You'd either need enough up-front cost to pay for the whole system (it's a lot - we're talking 6-USD-figures) not including the parallel cost of acquiring the mining equipment necessary to make it cost effective as well. If you financed the whole operation, you'd need to make sure that your miners were capable of producing sufficient return to pay for themselves in aggregate as well as the fixed costs of the power plants...
There isn't nearly enough surety in the next 30 years of bitcoin for people to make this sort of investment for a gain measured in fractional margin improvements.

If I get to choose between buying stuff from a guy who annoys the hell out of me (as Roger does) or some nice-seeming guys who don't (such as the betspend.net people) then I choose the nice seeming guys. 
And that's if I'm spending bitcoin to buy things, which is manifestly the exact same thing as if I had just sold the bitcoins and used the money to buy the thing (because that's what they have to do)... so why would I pay someone that extra x% exchange fee when I could get a better rate myself? 
To support the bitcoin economy? No. That's just paying someone to sell my bitcoin for me, for which I get a thing I could have bought myself without the premium on either the trade itself or the item itself or the shipping or all three...
Much of Roger's stuff is cheaper - so if I'm actually buying something because I want it and not just to support his project and the exact thing I want is cheaper on his site than on Newegg or Amazon or somewhere else... then I'd probably do that, because money &gt; me finding someone annoying.

I don't actually imagine the USD is going anywhere. If for nothing else than continuing to require it for taxes it will still have utility (albeit a utility derived from the state's threat of force... which is semantically the equivalent of saying 'extortion').  But it will have utility that bitcoin CANNOT supercede and therefore it won't go away.
There are also taxes the government can collect that you cannot hide in bitcoin. Land taxes. Poll taxes.... then of course there are payroll taxes (as businesses are much easier to tax than individuals because they exist in the public eye). 
The question is really to what extent bitcoin supercedes USD and other fiat as a primary means of exchange. It can replace them in the market, but it cannot eliminate them because of their monopoly on force.

The amount of money you can make is exclusively related to the percentage of the total network hashrate your mining setup represents. There is a relative limit of approximately 3600 BTC that are minted every day. This fluctuates to the high side (3600-4800) as new deliveries are made from ASIC manufacturers, but is relatively constant.
The current hashrate is somewhere between 55000 and 75000 GH/s. It will more than double (nearly triple) by the end of April. If BFL ships, make that a near-triple - up to 5x current by June.
The point is that as new units ship (they don't even have to be better ones, just more of the same ones) your share of the market goes down. If you had a Jalapeno **today** you might earn 2.5BTC. The amount you see on mining return calculators is the absolute most you will ever earn from that device. It's all downhill from there - and in all likelihood, the slope is a steep one.

I tend to think of this idea of 'consent' as being directed not at politicians or even the political ideas - but on the political science of the structure (not necessarily the substance) of one's government. We consent to be ruled by a system. Although we may not condone the substance of a party in power, by not-revolting or emigrating we are consenting that (at least) the system itself provides the essential structure we ~~want~~ agree to live under.
If the choice is to live under the system or die, then that is a very unfortunate choice - but that doesn't mean the choice doesn't exist.

Nominal inflation I simply used to indicate that the monetary supply is increasing (at a rate of about 3600BTC per day). At a certain point it is likely that the rate at which coins are lost will exceed the rate at which they are issued - and that is a certainty once the block reward ends.
Inflation/Deflation in purchasing power refers to the change in what you can buy with the same nominal amount of something, or inversely, the change in how much it costs to buy the exact same things. If it costs me nominally more to buy the same thing in the future than it does now, then between points A and B there has been 'inflation' in whatever it is I'm assessing (in this case Bitcoin). If it costs me nominally less to buy the same thing in the future than it does now, then there has been deflation in what I'm buying.
As time progresses technology and education improve the production side of the economy. Things get better or they get cheaper - and over time both - relative to their labor and material cost to produce. If the base currency is also static then this savings would be reflected in the cost of an item getting cheaper over time (deflation). Another way to look at it is if I buy a new computer every year for exactly $1500, then I experience deflation in the price of computers (as my $1500 gets me a better computer). This is because the growth/efficiency in computing is so high that it replicates deflation even when the economy writ large indicates inflation.
If we had perfect knowledge of how much better/cheaper the things were going to get in the future - we could issue enough money over that time to ensure that everything stayed the same (nominal inflation with static purchasing power). If we didn't WANT things to get cheaper we could issue even more money into the economy and create inflation (things getting more expensive). This is especially good for us if we want our economy to be built on debt.

I think it more likely that if an altcoin were developed that contained obviously superior design elements those design elements would be integrated into the bitcoin main chain before the competitor was able to secure significant market share.
If the elements were not compatible *philosophically* with bitcoin I think we'd be talking about something else entirely... and in that case it's possible that we'd have multiple competing currencies that floated against each other. People could elect their currency based upon which model of economic philosophy they preferred. One might be better for debt, the other for savings... it's entirely conceivable (and perhaps preferable) that multiple crypto-currencies be developed and that they co-exist.

What percentage of taxes go to maintain the expanded bureaucracy's maintenance of the ever expanding bureaucracy? 
There are more economically efficient ways to run practically every service performed by government, most of which can be sorted with full privatization and an open market. Those areas that can't be sorted that way can be hybridized (think leasing and licensing of toll roads, spectrum, and charter schools - all as imperfect examples - with most of the imperfection coming from political exigency in the drafting of the relevant legislation). 
How much tax do we actually need to be paying to get the things we can agree we want to do cooperatively? Urban charter schools are (at least in my city) more than twice as efficient as district schools in terms of the money spent on teachers and students versus that spent on "administrators" and non facilities "staff". 
Ideas such as the FairTax^TM are a clue as to how we can get away with funding truly desirable services while getting away from punitive taxation of income. 
Just like gas/petrol taxes, tolls and congestion taxes, property taxes, and so forth. They key of course is to draw down the Federal Government to deal exclusively with those things it is FOR such as National Defense, international diplomacy and trade, and interstate commerce. 
Hell, in a fully bitcoin economy a much reduced government could simply act as a mining group and (when you account for the fact that nothing would prevent other nations from doing the same - all in competition with more efficient private enterprise) cover a pretty decent amount of their costs from tx fees. 
This is, of course, cloud cookoo land. The point is that in the next century legacy states will need to adapt or die - because bitcoin is to their monopoly as BitTorrent was to the monopoly of old media. Without the (hypothetical) theft issues... In fact, it eliminates the theft already inherent in the system.

I suspect it wouldn't be any less secure than [Bitcoin Wallet]( You text the phone number of the person you want to send BTC to and the amount to the service - it transfers the money to that persons account (a la bitcointip) and texts them the receipt. Your phone number is a unique alias in the same way your reddit username is. 
You've obviously given up a lot of the security of the bitcoin network - but you do that anyway if you're using a mobile wallet. For added security you could perhaps set a limit on the amount of btc to keep in your hot wallet so that if your phone were stolen you'd only lose the equivalent of your cash on hand.

It's only why Governments want inflation. Gold isn't worthless - it, like everything else, is worth whatever anyone will give you for it. If you're building an SSD you need a bit so its worth something for its elemental properties...
Bitcoin isn't worthless either. It's worth exactly what someone will give you for it as well (this is actually what anything is worth with the primary exception of food and water and clothing). In a one-person universe it wouldn't have any value - but in any situation in which you're NOT the only person in the universe BTC (and more importantly IMO the blockchain) has use and value (service value).

There's a difference between 'rich' nations that run their government and economy on debt and poor countries which are incapable of borrowing at the market, have next to no economy, and are (hyperbolically) enslaved to the IMF/WB. 
I'm all for globalization - and bitcoin would serve well as a great equalizer. It will only take one country to make the change. 
As to the issue of giving up sovereignty over the currency... How many nations have done exactly that and replaced their national fiat with the euro or usd? 
Edit: To answer my own question. 3 independent nations other than the USA and it's territories use USD as the official currency. Another 16 use it unofficially as the real currency. There are 17 members of the EMU, and another 4 independent nations use the Euro as their unofficial primary currency.

It depends on what proof you'd accept.
* Coinbase is a YCombinator and VC funded startup which includes Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as one of its initial investors. [link](
* MtGox, while originally "Magic the Gathering Online Exchange" before it switched to trading BTC in 2010 was sold to [Tibanne LTD in Tokyo]( some years ago. 
* ASICMINER is a shareholder group of Bitfountain, which is a registered corporation in China. Members of the ASICMINER shareholder group hold seats on the Bitfountain Board of Directors.
* It is illegal to market or sell equity in businesses to the public (in the United States) without the appropriate registration as an exchange from the SEC (although this may change somewhat once SEC rulemaking on the JOBS Act is finally finished). Therefore BitFunder is almost certainly engaged in illegal activity (as it is based in the US) and could be subject to shutdown at any time.
* Personally I recommend BTCT.co as the trading platform of choice, as per their legal basis (it is a registered corporation based in Belize) they have a very reasonable expectation of operating legally and being allowed to continue to operate -- and if they are shut down all of the information (account balances, shareholder information, etc) is available for everything to be transferred elsewhere.

It's all about client use. If BFL had wanted they could have hired Intel or Samsung or any other major IC company to design SHA256 hashing ASICs. They hired someone else, and then got a third company to do the chip fabrication. 
It would be entirely possible for someone with enough capital to go to the ASIC dept at Intel or Samsung and have mining chips designed and then fabricated - plus they'd get a lot of the other benefits on the logistics side. The upfront cost and minimum order would be high - but the opportunity exists.
The reason Intel doesn't already market such chips is simply because we don't represent a sufficient market.

A 51% attack would result in near immediate (&lt;1 day) exile of the attacker and the disregarding of their blocks. The honest miners would disregard the attackers blocks. It would be handled much the same way as the last fork. Honest transactions would still be processed but dishonest ones ignored. 
If the blockchain were being operated exclusively by an AI with the rules as they stand, it would be possible - but that's not how the network actually works.

The opportunities exist in places where volatility of the local fiat is even harsher than what we see in bitcoin - where inflation has gone 'hyper', where capital controls make the local fiat actively detrimental on a day-to-day basis for people and business.
Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America, Southeast and Central Asia... basically everywhere that isn't in the OECD. There are many more countries and people living under a condition of monetary uncertainty. 
Everyone who has bitcoin is, as we often say, their own bank. This is especially useful seeing as more than half of the world's population isn't currently banked at all. 
([here's an infographic on the world's unbanked](
There are places like Kenya where more than 60% of the population and more than 80% of households have cellular phones and yet more than 70% of the population likewise has no access to the formal banking system - where 30% of the country's GDP is processed through phone-to-phone (SMS) payments of what are effectively transferable pre-paid mobile phone minutes (M-Pesa) with all of the fees inherent in that.

* The bitcointip bot is an automated program that scans certain subreddits (and the comments of users who've donated to it) looking for the proper sytanx in a comment. 
* Users of the tipbot have either funded their bitcointip account with bitcoins or have had it funded through tips they've received.
* When the bot sees the correct syntax, provided the user who did the tipping has enough BTC in the wallet they setup with the bot, the bot will reserve the amount of BTC tipped for the user who was tipped - and PM them the information on how to accept the tip.
* If the user accepts the tip it will be deposited into a wallet the bot creates for them - which they can then withdraw from or use to tip other users.
**Edit**: Step 5, if the comment was made in other subreddits the users go 'wtfm8' and hilarity ensues bringing more people into the bitcoin fold and earning the tipper the sort of karma only money can buy.

Pricing a contract in nominal BTC is probably going to cause trouble one way or the other. If the price were to continue to grow the deflation could price the contract out of the payers ability to pay. If it were to collapse the payee would receive a fraction of the relative value they anticipated from the transaction. In any case, fair warning.
As far as wording goes - BTC/Bitcoin is not a formally recognized ISO standard currency (yet) and therefore you'll probably need to define it in the contract or an appendix to the contract. I'd suggest using the FinCEN definition of a virtual currency and then specifying that virtual currency as 'bitcoin' - and also to define what would constitute bitcoin fulfilment - perhaps something like a '6-times confirmed transaction from a specified address in the contract to another as reported by blockchain.info or its successors or something.'

As miners drop out the difficulty of mining becomes easier, so those miners who stay get more rewards - bringing them back to profitability. At the end of the day it actually can go to zero (there were miners back when bitcoin wasn't worth anything at all) - at least insofar as your question is concerned.
edit1: And no, the system is fully distributed and the only communication the miners need to have is to listen to the network for announced transactions (which every node does even if they're not mining) and to announce blocks when they've solved them. Given the sort of data that actually needs to be transmitted there is nothing preventing miner's from performing their function from behind TOR.

A casino, in principle, is a re-distributor of wealth without addition of value - it creates no wealth. In the case of a brick-and-mortar casino this can have devastating effect on the local community as the owners of the casino aren't usually also the residents of the location of the casino. This is why many international cities that have a strong casino industry also forbid their locals from gambling there.
Bitcoin has no legal status, although a very straightforward definition of what it is was how FinCEN elected to define "virtual currency" - which means it very likely will find itself recognized as such in law sometime soon - in which case operating an online casino in the united states that only uses bitcoin would be illegal - but all things are legal (at least in the US) that aren't forbidden by law.
I should follow this up by mentioning that if you register a non us domain and use non-US hosting (and preferably a foreign holding company) then any online casino won't fall under US jurisdiction.

Bitcoin is designed to serve as a currency, but it is also designed to serve as a store of value. (What else are we to infer from the deflationary intent / gold model.) 
For a money designed to fill both of those needs one would expect it to behave differently than both. 
I think we need a few more months of data from payment processors before we can start to guesstimate the run rate on spending. 
We also need to factor in the zero output hypothesis recently (that, as all or almost all goods sold for bitcoin are effectively priced in other currencies is it not fair to say that all or nearly all economic activity in Bitcoinia is through import?)

We didn't stop using gold just because it was rare. There are plenty of transactions we make that gold's value density would be well suited for (computers, cars, houses, furniture, etc). We stopped using it because it's either hard or expensive or both to secure and generally speaking digital payments are more convenient. 
Although really we stopped using gold because for quite a while we weren't allowed to and social expectations and understanding of what money was and how it was used changed. 
We have a very short windows of experience where bitcoin was both hyper deflationary and somewhat usable as a currency - and you know what? People spent more. 
Economists love to talk about the 'wealth effect' that comes from appreciating assets and lower interest rates. Permanent deflation, predictable economic growth (population cycles being easier to foresee than credit cycles) , and the necessity of nearly zero interest rates all that would entail would suggest the possibility of a permanent wealth effect.

Wild and interesting indeed. There are a number of major events that could speed adoption at retail (if Square were to add a BTC option, for example).
Also the 'chicken or egg' issue is relatively apt - only insofar as biological evolution is a process and there was never a non-chicken that laid an egg that hatched a chicken. We're going through a (completely different) process as well in terms of adoption for payers and adoption for payees. It's thrown out of whack a bit by the sudden increase in payers testing out bitcoin but that doesn't mean a whole lot necessarily.
Perhaps we'll drop back to $30 or $50 and stay there for another year and a half before we run-up again and hit $500 before dropping back to $100. Maybe loss-aversion will prevent us from falling critically and payee adoption will catch up to present value. The fact that bitcoin is useful as a payment system *and* a store of value (built in deflation means that stored value was always going to be an aspect of a Bitcoin success story, despite what is often said about it's "intent" as a payment system) would indicate that people accepting Bitcoin don't actually have to catch up to the market capitalization because the Market Cap [isn't M1, it is M3](

The reason traditional Crowdfunding doesn't work in bitcoin is that the value proposition isn't there. On the other hand EQUITY Crowdfunding is thriving in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is primarily because kickstarter - esque Crowdfunding is not an area where bitcoin adds very much (unless you've built the whole system on the blockchain and are using smart contracts - which none of them are doing. 
Just building another kickstarter and accepting only bitcoin does not a viable or needed product make. On the other hand the crypto securities markets are hosting hundreds of millions of dollars (equivalent) in market capitalization across listed companies - and that's ignoring asicminer which Crowdfunded itself in an ipo that was, if it had been conducted in the USA or in fiat, illegal on its face - and today that company is pushing a market cap of nearly $200million.

One of the things a Cryptocurrency denominated global economy would bring us is the ability to choose the currency we use based on fixed monetary policies. 
If in 2150 you want to take out a loan, perhaps you'll take one denominated in a currencyfew that has a fixed rate of inflation. 
Bitcoin is the perfect currency for savings accounts. As such it would be a perfect currency for global reserves as well as for settlements between financial institutions / governments and the like, and international trade. 
Inflation may have some uses in the future economy, but right now it is a weapon the state uses against its people. Even if a Cryptocurrency offered a fixed inflation rate it would still be robbing the governments of the world of their primary use for inflation (namely, the ability to inflate away their debts).

While that's true, we'll have minted 75% of all BTC at the time of the next halving day (late 2016). At the 3rd halving day we'll be at 87.5% (late 2020).
So yes, it will be late 2040 (34th halving) when the block reward drops below zero satoshi, but we'll have minted 99% of all bitcoin to be mined by the 6th halving day when the block reward drops below 1BTC/block (mid/late 2032).

Paper currency is no longer the currency base. Banks don't deal with each other in paper money. They do not deal with the Federal Reserve with paper money. When the Fed "prints money" all it is doing is charging its purchases (primarily of bonds) to an account that has an infinite balance. It also requires banks to keep a certain percentage of their funds on deposit (fractional reserve) with the Fed, against which it pays interests (also out of the infinite account).
This is where fiat comes from. The treasury distributes the funds to the various other agencies of the government through bank transfer (still digital) who pay their employees/vendors/hookers/etc either by direct deposit into a bank account (still digital) or by check (which is just the paper version of a bank transfer)... when the check gets to the employee's bank account, it needs to 'clear' - all that means is that the banks THEN do the digital transfer.
Paper Money is just like a check made out to cash where the FRB is the issuing bank (as opposed to whichever bank issued a check). When the paper money gets to a bank, most of the time, they send it back to the FRB who credits their account digitally and then burns the bills.
With bitcoin, every transaction is one of two types. It is either an interbank digital transaction (where the bank of me sends money to the bank of you) or it is like giving someone else your bank account (in the form of a physical wallet or even a digital wallet - as btcquick does it).
It's all still digital -- all the real money at least. Precious metals are the only real physical money... and the value in precious metals is too dense to be especially useful. 
As an aside: $1 in silver is about 0.035ozt, or about half the weight of a US Dime... and given that a dime is about 90% copper and that copper has about 60% of the mass of silver per volume - a $1 coin made of nothing but silver would be a coin less than 1/3rd the size of a dime. 
Anyway - the value of precious metals is too dense, so we use bearer instruments (bill that reads: pay to person x this amount of silver/gold/blow/etc). If what you want is a store of value, then precious metals are one way to do it... but if what you want is a currency, then precious metals aren't especially good because as a currency they act as all other digital currencies and have the added failure point of you needing to trust whomever it is whose job it is to hold all of the gold/silver/blow... which history has shown nobody (banks, governments, whoever has tried it) is especially deserving of.

It's not the case that all growth comes at the expense of someone else, obviously. Yes, the money Samsung and AT&amp;T have for my phone/contract came at the expense of my money - but the thing also makes me more productive - and having smartphones in as many hands as possible creates a net positive benefit to the system (creating new wealth). This is productivity growth.
However, under Keynesian inflation, we inflate our currency to mitigate the wealth created by productivity growth as received by individuals and transfer it to the government by way of inflation (in addition to the tax on top of productivity growth that is any inflation in excess of it... ignoring ENTIRELY any actual **nominal** taxes).

You'd use the SMS API in the same way used the reddit API. 
You'd have a standardized format like
    send 100ubtc to [phonenumber or username]
Which you'd text to the bot, which in turn would parse the request and manage the webwallet. Users could always go to their local internet cafe to manage their wallet directly too.
This system would massively promote the virality of the product just as the tipbot did - as it will automatically create a wallet for anyone. It could SMS them the basic instructions.
Hell, in Kenya or Tanzania you could hook the bot up with M-Pesa and allow exchange via SMS as well.
I'm aware there're obvious security issues with this, it was meant to be illustrative of the semi-obvious. You'd need a way to validate the request to send money (which is done on reddit through the need for a password to login to your account). This security would be just as important to make sure that you maintained control over your funds even if your phone were lost/destroyed/stolen - but you can't exactly send a plaintext password over SMS - it would need to be some other thing - perhaps a challenge/response. I'm not sure how they overcome this issue with M-PESA (if they even bother to).

Havelock - unsure, I don't know enough about its corporate status or Canadian securities law
BTCT.co - probably not illegal (yet). It is registered in a country where Bitcoin still has no legal status.
BitFunder - definitely illegal (in fact it is not just illegal for them to operate the exchange, it is technically illegal for US citizens to buy or sell securities on it). This is what you get for setting up a financial services business in the USA.
MPEX - MPEX/MPOE is an 'unregistered corporation' which is based in Romania.
Bitcoin is still very much the wild west... and bitcoin securities are beyond thunderdome. 
I'm not entirely sure where you get that everyone is 'confident in legitimacy.' Investors have extended some amount of trust toward the exchange and securities operators. In some cases they have been very nicely rewarded for that trust. In other cases they have gotten very badly burned.
There is, as you say, nothing preventing a company from fooling investors and disappearing with the capital (and as we all know a 'regulated market' completely fixes this problem &lt;/s&gt;).
At the end of the day all investments are still about trust. Investing with BTC is not for the timid.

Capital controls are like prohibition: They don't work, they just make it more profitable to be a seller of whatever is being controlled. Frankly I think there are only a couple jurisdictions where banning bitcoin would be a (marginal) negative (us, eu). 
Banning bitcoin anywhere else would probably be a POSITIVE for the global bitcoin economy. Bitcoin dealing is a much easier and less risky business to get into than drugs and other contraband - so making it illegal would simply mean no bitcoin businesses in that region would bother anymore with the time and expense of following the law and mark up their prices to cover their risk as well.

BTCGuild's market share is its share of how much hashing power it controls relative to all other contributors. BTCGuild is a network (pool) of many different miners who combine their efforts to realize a different payout structure. If ASICMINER, for example, were to leave BTCGuild they would continue to mine blocks - however the coins they earned at that point would become erratic. They'd only get paid when they actually mined a block. The purpose of a pool is to distribute payouts more evenly over time - which allows miners to have a more stable revenue stream from mining and enables them to make plans and finance additional purchases (as well as pay their rent, electricity bills, etc).
The threat of having a 51% mining pool is that that pool would statistically being mining 6+ consecutive blocks with some frequency. This would allow them to inject double-spends, create forks, and generally disrupt and damage the trust in the protocol - not that they would, but the fact that they *could* is sufficient to damage trust.
The only mechanism for a mining pool's market share to be reduced is for some portion of their current hashing power be reallocated under the control of a different entity (pool) - or for sufficient new hashing power to be added to alternate pools.
The amount of Bitcoin a mining pool is earning is irrelevant to the issue at hand - which is structural and threatens the basis of trust we have in the protocol itself. For this reason I expect BTCGuild will probably self-throttle as it is not in their interest to damage the trust in the network.

But by keeping your money outside of the banking system (at present) you are functionally forgoing the digital economy. As far as gold goes... have you ever actually tried to pay for anything (say groceries) with a couple grams of gold? Maybe your cashier will take it and pay for your shopping but I would bet money that the cashier would be fired or at least censured if they took the gold and put it in the cash register.
In the modern world our 'participation in banking' isn't nearly as voluntary as you seem to suggest it is. Well, maybe it is, but the added cost of shopping in a brick and mortar retailer is functionally a tax on people who are un-banked.
Bitcoin is not limited to being a solution to this issue, but it *is* a problem that bitcoin addresses.
As an aside - imagine that instead of a reasonably wealthy member of a rich Western nation you are living in Zimbabwe. There isn't even a banking system for you to participate in really. Cash is functionally worthless. Your only real possession is your mobile phone - and the only currency that has any value in your town is transferable mobile phone credits.

At the moment it is a very esoteric asset. There is no formal law that recognizes it as a distinct class of asset - although the FinCEN rule-making guidance indicates that when it *is* formally recognized it will be as a 'virtual currency' and as such distinct from 'real currency'. Such rule-making guidance is likely to be very sticky in terms of the naming of things.
This puts it in much the same class as any other non-physical asset (derivatives, etc). When you buy such a thing for one amount and sell it for another you're subject to capital gains taxes (or losses), but you're not subject to sales tax as it were.

Not much to add again. It wasn't entirely clear to me how you'd weighted the bids at first glance. If it is weighted based on time since the start of the match than there's less support for players who check in on the match later to do anything than support whichever side had the weight to begin with. If the weight was based on the number of tx received by the side since the start of the round then a player would naturally get more weight out of their play if they put it on whichever side had fewer transactions.


Yeah, I think 1 at a time for POC is fine.


For whatever reason I was thinking about it in the sense of 'win by 2' in racquet sports. It also prevents someone from just dumping in the last seconds of the round to secure a victory - it gives players invested on the other side(s) enough time to respond.
You could always cap the number of times the clock can be extended.


I was thinking something somewhat more advanced than the initial game as presented. You want something that will bring people back - keep them involved. Not that it needs to be some insane system, but I was thinking of it as a way to make the game deeper if there were any want for that. 
Imagine you had x teams with names chosen by sponsors. Each time a new round starts two of the teams are chosen at random to play each other. This gives the advertisers a 2/x chance of being the 'co-sponsor' of the game of the day.
My thinking on the deeper game gets 11pm hazy after that. I was thinking about it in terms of a sort of artificial autosport team system. Players could 'invest' in teams by buying an owners seat for some period of time. Every time that team won some percentage of the winnings (say whatever the house was already getting... so instead of a 1% rake there's a 2% rake but half of it is going to the team 'owners'... for which you were compensated when they paid to become owners in the first place.)
The owners would have a vested interest in their team winning, so if their team is on the draw for the day, they'll be more likely to bid more. With identifiable teams, players have something around which they can base some affinity. They don't just play your game - they play for 'blue' vs 'red' or whatever the teams are. 
As I said, long day and just blue skying.

This is bitcoin land so the only honest answer to your question is "absolutely". If you think people are earning a 400% return without **real** risk, you're in need of a sober moment. 
Personally I'd much prefer the currency risk on straight btc that I can have control over. I dabble in crypto stocks as well because the btc was already at high exchange risk so why not take some and try for a bit of nominal btc growth. This is why if I were using Bitfinex I'd only be lending btc for shorts - not USD.

I don't know. I think the odds are probably better that the person opening my safety deposit box will be my heirs than a bank robber. Making the private keys 2-factor and simply splitting them up between storage locations (with a legend enabling anyone in possession of both sides to easily reassemble it) is a good idea - that way if a bank robber DID break into your bank they'd still only get half of the codes. Of course that would just destroy the money unless you had multiple backups of each piece of the key.

The main benefit to attempting to sort out your cost basis for coins is to take advantage of lower tax rates on long term capital gains. It really depends. One could probably build a small accounting firm (let alone a practice) off of bitcoin users and their taxes.

I'm not sure what you mean by safe. Bitcoin itself isn't safe. There is always risk in any investment, and with any third party. If you invest BTC you have 3 risks. 
* (1) That the 'company' you invested **in** collapses or just steals the money. 
* (2) That the platform you invested **on** collapses or just steals the money. 
* (3) That bitcoin **itself** or at least its relative purchasing power collapse.
This is not a game for the timid. Just make sure you do your due diligence - which you should be doing before making any investment. Never invest any amount of money (regardless of the asset type) if you feel uncomfortable doing so or can easily afford the loss of your investment.
Bitcoin is a VERY high risk investment, with a VERY high potential reward. Anything you do investment-wise *with* bitcoin adds to the risk - so you need to decide for yourself if the potential rewards are fair compensation for that additional risk.

BTC, mBTC, uBTC, SAT, mSAT, uSAT...
I understand that it can work that way. I'm only suggesting that it strikes me as potentially preferable to do it with a decimal move. There is no mathematical difference between the two options - everyone maintains exactly the same purchasing power either way.
I don't actually know if there's a limit to the roughness of the system... I know that it can go to a minimum granularity of 99,999,999.00000001 - would the database support a hypothetical 199,999,999.00000001? I don't know. If it would.. if it can support additional places to the left of the decimal and is only limited to the right of the decimal than 'moving the decimal' seems technically superior to extending the level of granularity to the sub-satoshi.
This method also allows us to keep the satoshi where it is (insofar as it is the 'smallest unit of account') and to allow it the same meaning of 1/100,000,000 of 1BTC.
On a technical level I would imagine it isn't any more difficult - and quite possibly less difficult to just multiply everything by 10 than it is to add a level of granularity. This isn't likely to be a pressing issue anytime soon.

No worries. I do a fair bit of my redditing on my phone at the bar after work, so I know that feel.
Bitcoin is a secure, direct, pseudonymous payment system by design and intent. This, at least as much as its potential as a store of value, is at the heart of the subjective value of it as a currency (gold's subjective value is primarily in its physical value density (edit: and rarity) - the USD's subjective value is as the only currency the US government will use to pay its employees and as the only currency it will accept in payment of taxes and public debts).
All of these, transfer of wealth, store of wealth, payment of taxes/denomination of debts... are valuable things provided you want to buy some things with money, save money for later, or not be put in prison (respectively).
None of these things can directly be used for anything on the base level of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]( which, while not a law of the universe, is a reasonable approximation of something that provides objective value. 
Storage of value might, conceivably, fulfill the 'safety of property' need... but how much value is assigned to gold is just as arbitrary as that assigned to bitcoin.
In any case, Bitcoin has some value in that it frees the user from: extortionate fees in the movement or storage of their wealth and collection of payment by merchants; taxation-by-inflation; pointless and costly delays between the time you request or send your money and the time it is received. 
As far as **volatility** goes, this is to be expected. Just because the media decided to start informing and misinforming everyone about Bitcoin doesn't mean that Bitcoin was somehow a fully functional product. It is software that is in development. Still in beta. 
I believe the community is more or less welcoming of people interested in joining this beta testing group, and relatively good at making sure people know what they're getting in to. Whether people listen to the warnings is entirely up to them.
All currency is just a transfer medium... a uniform medium of exchange. That's what it means. Bitcoin isn't especially stable in how much one can be exchanged for at present, but that's one of the many things that will evolve over time.... unless the project fails of course. That's always possible.

You get bitcoin in the exact same way you get any currency that isn't your local currency. You sell a good or a service for it - or you convert your local currency into it.

I'd be careful with how I use 'literally'. For anyone to get legislation passed they'd need to pay for what they want to be passed to be written and then donate to congresspeople and candidates to hopefully have some people who agree with them elected.
Democracy is the stickiest of wickets. Quid pro quo happens, but it's less common (or necessary) than you think. To get what you want passed you need to find people who agree with you and invest in their campaigns - which is no guarantee they will be elected - at which point who is responsible for that person being elected? You? Or the electorate?
The electorate either votes for who they want to win or they vote without conscious thought. How can it be otherwise? Personal responsibility is a core component of bitcoin (we are, each of us, responsible for the security of our money - in exchange for which we have the freedom of our money). This is fundamentally an individualist position. A politically philosophical extension of this individualism is the respect for all individuals' right to make their own decisions as you would have that right yourself - how can you have your right to individuality if everyone else in your society doesn't have the same right? To put it another way, where does anyone get off claiming they have the capacity/right to their own liberty but some unspecified collection of 'other people' are too ignorant to deserve the same right? 
People must be allowed to make their own decisions - and to make their own mistakes - and be allowed the respect necessary to that end. Any 'right' or amount of personal decision-making you'd deny someone else you rightfully deserve to be denied yourself - and will be.
The responsibility in a representative democracy for what laws are passed falls on the politicians who voted for those laws and by extension the people who voted for them - nobody else.

You'd pay punitive markup rates if someone was even willing to sell you BTC for a credit card payment.

You earn BTC in the same way you earn your local currency - by selling a product or service for it.

My other comment is my answer to your last question. 
Assuming you've already gone the we use coins dot org route, there are a lot of other great walk throughs around - but I'm on my phone so I can't be bothered to look them up. 
There are no coins. There is only a giant ledger. The ledger has pages (blocks). To certify the page someone needs to sign it (miner). New bitcoin are introduced to the system whenever this happens (mining) in the account of the miner as a reward for certifying the page of the ledger.

# 3. A borrower borrows BTC (most likely to sell, this is known as 'shorting') or borrows USD (most likely to buy, creating a margin-long position)
# 4. The borrower closes their margin position by either buying back BTC on the exchange to cover a short position or by selling BTC on the exchange to close a long position.

It's not a terrible question. If, hypothetically, you'd saved enough in your life that you could live on 3-4% of your savings at your desired level of comfort - then you wouldn't need to work anymore (not that this is an entirely foreign concept in inflationary systems either).
As TheAndy500 said, productivity and work will still enable you to improve your quality of life.
The productivity lost to inflation isn't lost to the universe. You don't get the benefit of that lost of purchasing power, but whichever government issues your currency **does** in the form of reducing the relative value of their nominal debt. This is why many will often refer to inflation as a 'tax.'

In my earlier post I go on to make something of an argument as to why basically everyone - regardless of their system of government - is mutually responsible for the actions of their government. 
* The revolutionary in active revolt is in a state of non-consent.
* The individual in prison is in a state of non-consent.
* The child is in a state of non-consent.
* The infirm *may* be in a state of non-consent.
The true, active Agorist is likely in a state of non-consent as well, which I should have included. Willful disregard for the law of the State in such ways as it precludes you taking moral (or at least non-immoral) action, as you see it, is non-consent although if you refuse on principle to pay your taxes and in the same breath vote for Gary Johnson you are at best somewhat confused...
Just because you might die doesn't really absolve you from the fact that violent revolution is in fact always an option that you elect not to take. Don't take this as necessarily advocating any particular violent revolution - or even violent revolution in favor over peaceful revolution... that's not the point. The point is that it **is** an option. 
When that guy flew his airplane into the IRS, that was an act of individual, willful, violent revolution. I'm not saying he was right - I'm saying he was taking a deliberate action and choosing non-consent.
At the end of it all, my point is that very few people (if any) are in a state of happy and safe non-consent. That doesn't mean consent isn't being granted by everyone else.

It's an interesting issue (capital gains). Because you're converting a capital asset (virtual currency) into a non-capital asset (computer/tv/etc) I believe you're correct in you not owing capital gains - although it would depend on jurisdiction (if we were ever right to begin with). However, in theory this is a total capital loss (from an accounting perspective) as you'd be obliged to depreciate the non-capital asset over the next two years... if you were bothered to do so.

There's a difference between buying treasury debt and MBS with printed money and buying gold on the market with printed money. There is a cap to how much the fed has to pay for MBS, and treasury debt is basically just the gov't loaning itself money.
On the other hand, gold is an open market. 6030 tons (the hypothetical amount they'd have to buy at 10% reserve and 100% requested) represents about 4% of all of the gold ever mined in history. 
How much of that gold is actually floating on the market? The slippage that would result from this sort of purchasing is truly astronomical.
This wouldn't just be buying and selling paper gold. This would be buying gold for physical delivery - and only about 10% of gold traded on the markets is actually traded for delivery^[[1]](
This would be a truly magnificent spectacle to behold, especially if you actually OWN any gold.
Sometimes in this subreddit people will ask why the government doesn't just buy all of the bitcoin and shut it down (it's only a billion dollars).
The answer to that, as you probably know, is that it **isn't only a billion dollars**. A billion dollars is just the price implied by the market price, but it is based on the tiny faction of the whole which is traded at any given time.
The first few thousand ounces might be acquired at the spot price. The next few thousand within a reasonable proximity of the spot price... but what about the next few thousand, and the next, and the next?

(so, I started on this reply and it sorta got away from me as I just sorta 'thought out loud')
As the market matures localbitcoins traders and others (perhaps even places like gold and coin shops) may begin to feature OTC trading at tighter margins. One of the reasons there is a high markup on otc trades is the volatility...
I have bitcoin, you have cash. I don't really want cash but I'll sell you my bitcoin for cash if I think I can take that cash and turn it back into bitcoin at a profit. It takes me a while to turn my cash into bitcoin because I want to pay the market rate - but bitcoin is really volatile - I need to charge you enough for my bitcoin so that I have a reasonable amount of surety that by the time I get my cash back to my exchange the price won't have risen so far that I've lost out.
This is why the markup on digitally delivered USD for OTC bitcoin is less than in-person hard cash delivery of USD (among other reasons, including the value of the seller's time).
~~The presence of a bitcoin ATM, while of course neat, is actually just as disadvantageous to the operator of such a device as cash would be - probably moreso - they can't just take the cash from the deal and walk it into the bank immediately to hopefully get immediate credit for it... they have to go to the machine and take the money out (probably only one or maybe twice a day) and then deliver all of the cash for that day at once - wait for the USD to get to their exchange account - and then buy more bitcoin at whatever the price is at that point. The only way to make money here (even with fees) is to somehow have someone wire you a cash advance against the cash balance of the ATM - someone who doesn't care about the BTC and only wants the USD profit.~~
~~Money is fungible, of course, so if you held sufficient cash to handle whatever your maximum weekly bitcoin transaction from the machine(s) is in your exchange account and then automatically traded it in parallel with the ATM purchase, I suppose that'd work. You'd need to account for the time it takes you to go around emptying out all of the ATMs.~~ (edit: paragraph struck because I was thinking down a dead end, it gets better I think)
Ideally you'd place a bitcoin ATM in a coin shop (or every coinshop). The coinshop owner would be the one with the key and would get charged say $0.95 on the dollar for every dollar the bitcoin machine took in - but he gets the cash. The bitcoin buyer would pay a premium as well, of say 5-10% on the purchase - but the fees wouldn't really need to be disclosed.
When they put their cash in the ATM it communicates with the server and requests a market order from the exchange account which places the order (cash already in the machine) for 80 or 90% of the cash. It gets the market price, uses that to quote the real price the ATM user is paying.
* Guy puts $100 in machine
* Machine places market order for $90 at a BTCUSD rate of $45 per coin
* Market order fills 
* Machine tells Guy that his $100 will buy 2BTC ($50 per coin)
* Guy can accept or decline
* If he accepts the machine sends the BTC to the address he provides via the machine's QR code scanner.
* If he declines the machine reverses the order on the exchange (if the price is equal or better to the previous price - otherwise it holds the BTC and incorporates the average balance of the BTC it is currently holding into the next purchase from any machine in the system) and spits back his $100
* Every day the guy who owns the store that has the machine unlocks it and takes out the cash, and probably every day (or perhaps at the same time as confirmed transactions) the ATM network auto-bills the coin-store-guy's bank account for 95% of the deposited amount. 
* The coin store guy puts the cash in his next bank-drop and can book the 5% per transaction from his machine as profit.

The speculative explosion would be unprecedented and unparalleled. Fortunately for anyone who held bitcoin before the Proxima Centauri shot (as moon shot doesn't quite capture what would happen) the fundamentals of bitcoin would also suddenly be very solid - although paltry compared to the speculative price. 
Every country and person that adopted bitcoin would find their personal purchasing power oscillating between "insane" and "heretofore unknown by kings or men". The oscillations wouldn't stop until total adoption - although the swings would become somewhat tighter as fewer nations were left to adopt it. 
Of course, imagine what this would do to the currencies of nations that didn't adopt. It would decimate them - hyperinflation would be too soft a word. Imagine being the citizens of the last nation to convert - left holding the bag. Violent revolution and war, possibly nuclear war, seems inevitable in this thought experiment.

In any case the protocol and satoshi client code have been the subject of ongoing review and development by the core development team and contributors.

I think treating it as a currency is the 'more serious' way to approach it. Just understand that the USD price isn't actually the denominator (it doesn't go up or down relative to the USD). It is the actual purchasing power of 1BTC that increases or decreases relative to a number of other currencies (at different rates) - the USD is just a convenient and generally (albeit poorly) understood measure of purchasing power.

As a general rule, before asking a question related to buying or selling BTC replace the word bitcoin with "money" and then ask the question again to yourself. If the explanation seems self evident you have your answer.

Bitcoin has beneficial utility in a lot of different areas. I would suggest asking yourself what is it you currently do with money to make purchases / accept purchases / store value / transfer money to others / etc - and then look at how using bitcoin for that same purpose would save you the various fees you may be paying / provide you with better access to your money / etc. 
The bitcoin protocol is a money-transfer system with it's own currency and monetary policy. If you disagree or are indifferent about the monetary policy side - it is still a phenomenally cheaper and time-effective mechanism of sending money to someone else than anything currently available on the market. Bitcoin never takes a bank holiday. It never closes - these are things that you pay for in time if not in direct fees.
Bitcoin has a fixed amount of currency - meaning that it *may* act as a long-term store of value.
If you have a more specific use-case question perhaps we can address that.

* $5 = 0.083388926 Grams of Gold
* Gold's molecular weight is 196.96 g/mol 
* 1 mol is 6.022 × 10^23 atoms (Avogadro's Number) 
* 0.083388926grams= 423.4 micromoles (0.0004234 mol) [0.083388926g/ 196.96g/mol]
Thus, 0.0004234 mol is (0.0004234 mol x 6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol) = 2.55*10^20 atoms of gold.
For $5 you could buy 255,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of gold. Well done you.
