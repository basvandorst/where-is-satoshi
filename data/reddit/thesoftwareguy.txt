Because a commodity is only worth what people are willing to pay. If nobody wants to pay $100 for 1BTC, then it can't be worth that much. If they're willing to pay more, then the price goes up. That's supply and demand. Exchanges don't get to dictate a price.

 redirects to  anyway, which does have an SSL certificate, indicating that the company probably owns both domains, but only has a certificate for the latter.
Edit: spelling.

Yeah, your description of people's faces when they're hopelessly playing slot machines sounds like most of the pubs I've been to.


Sound advice :)
@_date: 2013-07-09 12:47:37
True :)
@_date: 2013-07-09 10:11:27
Common indeed. Don't worry, I still love Bitcoin :)

Developers don't wait for perfection before pushing new technology. Bitcoin is already good enough for the general public. As the Blockchain grows, scalability solutions will become a priority. Currently, there are more important things to work on. 
Also, as *accountt1234* said, some solutions have already been thought of, such as using thin clients which don't download the Blockchain, and pruning to compress its size.

Ah sorry, I didn't see that before. I'll donate some now :)

Many people (like me) don't become cautious just by hearing other people's horror stories. I got lucky when I started, so I was overconfident because I didn't know what it felt like to lose money. I'm not begging for coins at all, I was just sharing a story on a forum. And I'm not attacking SD either, they've done nothing wrong. I didn't say their system was corrupt. 
And yes I know there's no point to the "life story" type of posts...as I said, I just wanted to share if for no other reason than to get it off my chest.

You should upload a README with instructions on how your code is structured, what it currently can and can't do, a todolist, and some installation instructions. Then it'll be easier for developers to understand and contribute to your project.

If I didn't know what Bitcoins were, and I read that phrase, I think I would just be confused as to what the advertisement was about. I would suggest something more descriptive to grab people's attention, such as
* "Bitcoin - a currency made for the digital age"
* "Bitcoin - Decentralized. Secure. Anonymous. Instant."
* "Bitcoin - in cryptography we trust"
or something like that.
Edit: formatting.

It's impossible to answer that question accurately. My opinion is that months or years into the future, Bitcoin will be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. Most people on this subreddit would probably say the same, because anyone who really believes in Bitcoin will talk about its revolutionary implications compared to a fiat-based system. However this type of long-term investment is probably not what you're looking for if you're worrying about the buy-in price. If you're interested in day-trading, I suggest you invest in shares of a company than get destroyed by Bitcoin's volatility.

Sounds good. Are these ads being funded with your own money? You should put up an address for people on this subreddit to donate to, since the more money we can spend on ads, the more subscribers we'll get on this subreddit. I imagine plenty of people will donate, since it's for our own benefit to increase Bitcoin's popularity.

Just bought the whole album, it's pretty good.
And good on you for convincing him to sell through Bitcoin :)
