Bitcoin users affected because you need to convert to USD to buy anything meaningful...

Yay, a doctor practicing fake medicine now accepts fake money
@_date: 2013-09-27 01:40:49
Why do you say that? Reddit has stated that they spend more to account for BTC sales than they actually receive revenue

How many school shootings per year in the USA compared to Australia with strict gun controls?
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:02:37
You're a moron

" A 2006 study[1] shows a drop in mass killings after firearms licensing laws were enacted."
That is literally from the first paragraph of the page you linked. Thanks for proving my point for me?

It's not day 0, its day 1732.
Digital currencies are certainly interesting and I think they will have their place. Bitcoin however is not quite there yet, and its had almost half a decade. 
As it stands I don't see an advantage to paying with bitcoin. Fiat is quicker and easier every time. Micro transactions would be a huge use for bitcoin, but bitcoin can only process 60,000 transactions per day. This is in line with my earlier point, bitcoin needs work.
Then there's the idiots hoarding bitcoins and promoting it as a commodity. "Yeah hold your coins until bitcoin reaches $1 million!!!." A commodity should not be a currency and vice versa.

Half the population is below the median intelligence. It seems obvious which half you belong to.
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:11:10
And did it clear investment costs?
@_date: 2013-09-30 08:16:03
People who aren't spending real money for internet mathcoins are unaffected 
@_date: 2013-10-01 05:58:41
Meaningful wasn't the best word to use. I mean rent, food, utility bills, gas, etc. Things that matter. Can you get these with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:46:03
I've never received a counterfeit bill from an ATM, bank or retailer. Though we don't have silly paper money here...

You literally can't make a point, or even finish a sentence, without going on an off-topic rant about the government.

Donating means free, without charge, etc. Aka, not what you're doing

Maybe while you're on Wikipedia, you can look up the page for "Think,"
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:18:19
Lol that's not how graphs work

I dunno I'm pretty random *holds up Le Sp0rk*

Bitcoin is a DEflationary currency. You think someone in the bitcoin sub would know that. Fly away troll 
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:28:48
This is the future of panty-sniffing
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:28:07
That's cause reddit is an echo chamber, and any time a story about bitcoins gains traction in a main sub, a thread gets posted here and the bitcoin crew jumps in going Whoa What Just Happened
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:26:54
Fiat users: unaffected

 Would anyone like to hear my Dentist's thoughts on Bitcoins scalability? Irrelevant crap.. Sigh
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:45:10
Maybe they just wanted to buy food/rent/bills/gas/literally anything at all
@_date: 2013-09-27 04:29:57
Finally! +0.5 BTC to such a worthy cause
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:02:40
Feedback is automatic and compulsory. The seller is not asking for your feedback and doesn't give a shit. Its purely there to prevent scammers.
@_date: 2013-10-10 04:28:40
LOL as if an agent would say yes you silly manchild.
@_date: 2013-10-02 04:11:36
Don't do it. Scammers everywhere 
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:15:45
LOL nobody accepts bitcoin dumbass how is this notable at all
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:21:38
Did you check between your couch coushins 
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:21:05
LOL someone is going thru withdrawals. Pipe down, junkie
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:51:07
Don't listen to this guy. He is probably a miner trying to keep you out of the game so he can make more money. Miners have a heavily vested interest in discouraging people from mining as it reduces their diminishing profits even further. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:08:46
Try again. Nobody became a captain of industry after 3 attempts.
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:47:57
You're asking people who will benefit financially if you buy bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:07:40
Doesn't sound secure enough to me. Is that PC connected to the internet?
@_date: 2013-09-29 00:00:21
LOL sorry a free money machine doesn't exist. But some bitcoins from me so I get rich.
@_date: 2013-09-27 01:38:53
That's exactly what will happen. It happened to reddit gold. All the vote spamming on the dropbox site will cause it to fail. I wouldn't be surprised if they can see the total votes vs unique votes
@_date: 2013-09-30 12:30:21
I'm going to be blunt. If you had a machine that literally generated money why would you sell it? When you can answer that question, you will know whether to buy it or not. In case its not completely clear, buy this damn machine!
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:00:53
Fiat users:unaffected
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:59:09
If you think a digital currency will work after all electronics are fried, you are stupid as hell and will lose your wallet no matter how you attempt to secure it, solar flares withstanding. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 04:32:06
It's only so much an investment as any other "currency" eg USD. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 02:20:34
For one, everyone would.be billionares!!!
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:34:15
*BZZZT* you failed at bitcoin. Only answer is: keep the BTC. Why do you want shitty fiat anyway?
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:53:35
They make fun of literally everything, though. They're fucking awful 
@_date: 2013-09-30 04:26:53
I never made that claim. This is my point, you can't stay on topic or even make a coherent argument. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:56:54
Have you heard of a thing called capitalism? Perhaps look it up on Google, because it has been around for quite a while.
