In all likelihood if you had given anything away that led to your being robbed you'd be compensated greatly by the many newly Internet-rich folks of this subreddit, while I and all the other plebs slink back and watch, grinding our teeth

Hey man, thanks for such a reasonable post. I recently showed your post to my great-aunt, who's been in sort of a rut as of late, and it really boosted her spirits! I think she may be interested in investing in bitcoin now -- WOW, this really is a life-changing phenomenon! Her response, verbatim, when I forcibly read aloud to her bedridden body your post, among several others from this subreddit: "huh?" I never thought someone I knew, let alone someone from such a bygone generation as her's (the 1850's), would actually be interested in bitcoin!!!!!! I'm in utter disbelief!!!

ELI5: everything about this post. I just spent 50 minutes of class time confusing myself trying to understand this. Does this mean I'm too dumb to do this? This sounds like fun, whatever it is
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:56:16
I, too, used to be like that.
Then I wasted all $700 in BTC on Satoshi Dice in a single night. Now I'm once again free (read: poor) to eat ramen with my fiancée, watch the sunset each night, and play some good old stickball with the neighborhood kids.

Lars Von Trier would be my pick. At the film's conclusion he can perform a self-clitorectomy while Bitcoins literally rain from the sky and destroy humanity (not that it wasn't already decayed). La vie est souffrance :-\

Coinbase once took the last $170 I had to my name without warning. When I contacted support, they offered to reimburse me the $170 plus $35 in overdraft charges accrued as a result of the error. Sucks big time that you spent more than you'd have liked but for the most part the people at Coinbase are on our side, from what I've seen.
p.s. hey I'll take some of those btc off your hands if you've got more than you'd like :D

Congrats man. You made an incredibly lucrative investment at a crucial point in your life and have gained far more than $1,800 because of it. I presume you're currently the envy of many strapped-for-cash college freshmen browsing this forum. Hope to see you back in the game soon!

I currently have 10 that I've been holding on to since this weekend's rise from $62. This is probably all I'll be able to purchase for a while so I've been rather uneasy about the possibility of letting them go as we reach a potential tipping point at $100. However, I also would like to secure a vast and thorough fortune for myself and my seed, which the possibility of BFL being a success might afford. Care to shed any light on your pre-purchase with BFL to a fellow theoretical risk-taker? Were you motivated by any strong statistics which convinced to pre-order, taking into account the predicted increase in difficulty? Any information you can offer would be much much appreciated, thanks!

I hate myself, obviously, and have so much regret but that would probably describe ~60% of BTC speculators. At least I learned an incredible amount of useful information during my 2 years as a coin holder, in addition to the newfound fact that I should never, ever, ever, ever gamble.
