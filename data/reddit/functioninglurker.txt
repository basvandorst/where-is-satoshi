Eliminating this risk is the one of the main reason I chose Coldcard. Transaction signing is done offline. This drastically reduces the risk of malicious firmware. I've never connected it to a computer or network.

Use the OCO option (One Closes Other IIRC) to place both a stop and limit sell.

It seems strange that outlook doesn't show logins from other IPs if they managed to read and delete emails.
Do you have any 'unusual' Chrome extensions? Many have full access to the web pages in open tabs. I pared them back drastically a while back when I realised this potential risk.
I'd also scan for malware on Windows.

It doesn't. You are responsible for your Bitcoin. This is good because it means you have no counter-party risks.
Bitcoin is a protocol to operate a distributed ledger on a network, not a bank. There is no concept of custodial services at the network level. You do not deposit Bitcoin into the network. You are not a creditor of the network.
The underlying cryptography of Bitcoin is secure at present and in the foreseeable future. 
For someone to steal your Bitcoin, there will have been a lapse of security leading to disclosure of your private key to an address, or to your seed phrase to a wallet, or physical access to an incompetently configured hardware wallet.
