lmao do you think Mark fucking Cuban needs your validation or publicity on anything?

1) Yes. We are talking about a technology which will replace SWIFT and lower banking transaction costs. Do you still think it's a huge market cap?
2) As far as I understood it works as a security measure only implemented if a wallet gets compromised.
3) So the fuck what? Are you still living in the 14yo utopic mindset that we can function as a society without a financial system to back us? We would collapse without one. And btw BTC is centralized too :) also the variety of banks adopting XRP will make it more and more decentralized over time.
This "shit coin" is 900x faster transaction time wise in comparison to BTC and solves real use cases in the real world.
Have fun paying 10$ in fees for a 2$ coffee and waiting 1h so that the cashier can verify your payment

I am shocked by:
1) Seeing that some people were freely handed out much bigger quantities of XRP than I could even afford to purchase
2) People who undervalue Ripple 
To all the BTC bandwagoners here, Bitcoin is in a decadent state. At best it will not move down much more than it has been. 2018 is the year for truly better coins, such as XRP.
You made a big mistake converting it into BTC. Your gains could have been 10x better if you stayed with the XRP you discovered

The 'white' differentiation factor in between labels. Love it. Libtard spotted.

You read those news wrong.

BTC is not in the "laugh at us" stage at all. It's on a fucking 13k/14k € range for a week now. That's far from a laughable stage. You made that conclusion from a vague scroll through Jamie Dimon's declarations. No wonder you spoke shit. Go read it again. 
He said he believes in cryptos as the future just not in Bitcoin. Which is right since there are a lot of alts with better tech, Bitcoin just got first mover advantage and is now riding the fame.

This is shameful. I toletared the Bcash scandal and drama but I'm pretty upset about this. 
Have been thinking about dropping my BTC for XRP. Now that I've turned it into a decision I simply can't, because GDAX has apparently frozen all external transactions.
Shady as fuck.

Good post. What upsets me most is the fact that the Bitcoin crash influenced all the other altcoins. I learned a lesson today. 
Next time I realize something similar is happening I'll sell everything and re-buy at a lower value 1 or 2 days later.
Also, fuck Roger Ver and his bitch coin

Except the 3rd square is irrealistic af

No. Bitcoin is French. Ethereum is English.
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:59:29
The other way around. Which doesn't mean Bitcoin will die. But will lose importance and hegemony.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:43:47
So if "Bitcoin has no specific legal framework in" my country, does that mean that if I made a mil I could cash out untaxed?

That's ridiculous. If you're a local in Portugal, you can find beer at 50 cents.
Just the thought of handing over a 10€ bill for a single beer makes me not want to drink beer ever again.
How much do you have to spend to get wasted with your friends, 200€? Lmfao that's like 1/3 of a minimum salary here.
