This wasn't an existing rule, they sneakily passed this new "rule" without telling anyone. In fact, in the recording I was talking about, the rep the guy was talking to seemed to back pedal heavily after he accidentally revealed that it was a *new* policy change.
And now that they've passed the rule, there is no warning, they just steal your money. If they had been clear and upfront about it from the get go, completely understandable. However people are being tricked here.

Do you have bank of America? I've heard they silently passed a "policy change" that makes it illegal to send/receive money from any known crypto platform. My friend's account is frozen and they seized all the money from it. They won't even let him close the account now and he has no idea where all his money is.
This is different than the normal "freeze your account because it seems like fraud" stuff they do, they are freezing/seizing accounts simply for being affiliated with these crypto markets.
I'm not sure what the fuck they're doing, but it doesn't seem good.

I googled it after he told me about it, and it's happened to quite a few people. There are a few articles about it happening, some guy recorded his conversation with a bank of america.
It started happening around Nov. 26th as far as I can tell.
I use a credit union and they won't pull this shit on me, I freaked out a bit and called them to confirm that they wouldn't freeze my shit. Everyone should seriously switch to a credit union, fuck big banks.

I don't understand why people don't always do this. I constantly have  low buy limits set, like a few thousand below the current price, specifically for events like this. I always end up getting some really good buys in.

That doesn't sound very friendly.

I may or may not know someone who worked as a programmer/IT for a university, that had control of every machine on the network, and could apply patches/updates to all of them at once. Mining script runs on startup behind the scenes. That's like 1000+ dedicated PCs.

Ah, ya I guess I'll check on mycelium if there are any nearby. I admittedly don't know much about bitcoin, but my savings account has done fuckall for me.

Nah, not everyone. I happily pay taxes, however I am not at all happy with what my tax money is used for, and how it's used.
I continue to pay them because I know some of it goes to help other people (and the whole avoiding jail thing). I make way more than enough money to live comfortably so it's not a big deal to me.

I'm a programmer with $30k in my savings account, because I live like a poor college kid.
I've been trying to buy but fucking coinbase keeps on cancelling my transactions with no explanation :(
I've missed out on thousands of dollars in the last day.

Why is that exactly? I don't know much about day trading, but will prices drop so quickly that you won't be able to wait a bit and then sell?

Depends on the degree. I got a computer science degree, got a good paying job 2 days after graduation, and paid off my debt in less than a year. That was like 3 years ago.

Oh I don't plan on it, I think I'll put 7k (1 coin, whatever it is when I can buy), and then keep the rest in savings.

1) You are exaggerating by a large margin.
2) This was 2013.
