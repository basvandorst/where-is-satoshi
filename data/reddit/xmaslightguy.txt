Well then that is really bad for true adoption of bitcoin as a currency

Mining takes time because of a difficulty requirement, but this is based on the hash power of the network.  If the fees and rewards disappear so miners stop mining, the difficulty shifts down and it becomes easier and less costly to mine

I've cashed out for the time being.  Not because bitcoin has a lot of users and so fees are high, but because the solutions are so far away.  I want bitcoin to be my currency of choice, but right now I can't do anything with it.  I'm very excited for LN to solve these problems, but until it does and my utilities, rent, etc get connected I can't justify the value.

Okay, then how much bitcoin would you want to spend for each item in a dollar store?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:50
This is ridiculous...

To consider it a job, your income needs to be withdrawn so you can spend it on rent, food, etc.  Therefor the pay raise of 12.8 cents each day isn't accurate

It will take too long to move the bitcoin for you to take advantage of it

Right now Gemini is $100 higher

My orderbook on GDax is updated.  it shows about double the amount of bitcoin waiting to be bought than sold at 16,260.  I don't think this wild ride is finished...
EDIT: Now 226 selling to 188 buying
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:32:50
Today I felt like a fool I hadn't bought earlier and now it was $15,800 so I snatched it at $15,600 and now it is near $14K

If BTC dips hard first then I'll be buying as much as I can carry

To expand on this, a fork is when someone announces they have a great new idea for cryptocurrency that will improve bitcoin, but they don't want to go through the process of getting it into the bitcoin source code.  So instead they take one block, or basically the balances of all wallets from a certain time, and say that anyone with any amount of bitcoin at that point gets equal amounts of their coin.  Usually this other coin is then sold off by all the bitcoin investors who don't care about the changes and the price settles to a new value separate from bitcoin

Rule 1: Only buy what you can lose
Also it is down 15% so that isn't all of your money gone, and as long as you don't sell you haven't locked in that loss

I appreciate you not taking the post too seriously and for those links as well!

bought some at 10K, then some at $11,479...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:53
Just broke through

Can someone explain nodes?  I have the computer, internet, and interest in bitcoin to do this, but I want to know more about what I'm getting into

Got to say I hate this video.  Not that it doesn't have some relevant points, but it uses a ton of logical fallacies to over blow those points
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:33
At least for a little bit...
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:03:09
I bought the last dip at $6,850 so does that count?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:00:09
Do you have any memory of the relative time or date you bought it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:02:45
They weren't wrong, just didn't mention why different forms of money have different values.  The dollar use to be on top because people thought if they had a dollar they always would, then 2008 happened and people aren't so sure.  Bitcoin has the guarantee that it is your money and no one can spend it on your behalf

Why is it a bad idea to use coinbase?
