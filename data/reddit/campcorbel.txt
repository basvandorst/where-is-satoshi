Don’t fucking use that word.

Why use bitcoin? You blame core but you don’t want to to spend money transferring btc. Your a fucker looser.

You ignorant mother fucker. That’s a very rude word to use. You are clearly uneducated.

Why be a dick. Not your money not your problem. I wish people like you would stop being dicks to others in pain.

You must of not read my initial point dumb ass. I said I went to /btc for more info thinking it was bitcoin. My point is that they are hijacking the btc and bitcoin name. Bcash should have a sub called bch not btc. That’s my point you dumb fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:16:30
I definitely did make a mistake. My point here is that they are misinforming newbies about btc and that sub should not be btc. It should b bch

I have learned that to stick to bitcoin only. I don’t want to invest anything in a CEO like Ver that only cares about his pocket.

Your an idiot for saying that. I’m not saying it’s their fault. I’m saying they need to stop spreading misinformation. Btc is bitcoin. Bcash is bch
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:09:35
No but they are spreading misinformation. Btc belongs to bitcoin and people get confused. They are trying to highjack bitcoin.

Why be a dick?

It’s not hate. They spread the wrong information to new comers. When my grandma gets into bitcoin, she shouldn’t get the wrong info by /btc telling her they are the real bitcoin. They should give up that sub to something that resembles the name. Bcash. Do you not agree?
