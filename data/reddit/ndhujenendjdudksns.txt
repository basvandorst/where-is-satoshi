They could just fire up a new litecoin blockchain, premine it, keep it centralized and then sell coins via credit card on fb.

They "believe". They believe the stock price will go up because the company, and specifically the financial bootstrappers/brokers makes PROMISES that the company has the know how and capability to truly and honestly increase the value of the stock. That's how it works and the financial and stock markets are FULL of scams. And LARGE scale scams. Like bailouts and ponzi funds. Have you traded? Ever believed in promises made only to find out that you believed misinformation? Lies? I have. If you are pretending that Apple or amazon can't suffer a catastrophe that halves the stock price because of negligence or self interest than you are naive. Love it or hate it crypto is here to stay. So long as it serves the most basic function it will remain as a risk/chance value based game of accumulation.

At one point no one had a fax machine so mail worked fine and was accepted everywhere by anyone. Then fax machines became cheap and so the advantages were undeniable and accessible.

What they've been planning is quite literally the beast system. One world coin, government, religion. Facebook controls the most valuable data in the world. Imagine a bank that not only has access to your undeniable identity but also all your social connections and their identities as well. And then they have complete knowledge of every transaction between everyone. The social graph is a control mechanism that almost completely destroys fraud or any vulnerability against the economy of the graph. If a fraudulent transaction is attempted there is no anonymity so impossible. Now take all the biometric data of a person and develop an algorithm which generates a deterministic GUID or a crypto keypair and you have an account number/wallet. Combine that with the social graph so that all accounts are identified and thereby all transactions are impervious to successful fraud. This is facebook's purpose. It's not written in stone. Google is in the running. The free human is also in the running. Even if free decentralized humans win the ultimate outcome is a surveillance biometric crypto slave economy beast system. Then jesus comes and the whole thing is trashed and bad things go to hell and the rest live in a free paradise for 1000 years. It's in the bible.

Honestly, and I'm not trying to be facetious but when email really started gaining acceptance and adoption no one was racing to invest in fax machine technology.

It is a completely new, novel, digital store of value that offers direct control and ownership and is secure and requires no counter party trust. It does this right now. This did not exist until bitcoin.  It is also the closest thing to an agnostic global currency that the world has ever seen. It is deflationary and so a viable hedge against inflation. When I started my first Internet business in 1994 it was a hard sell to people who barely used computers. That's how it goes. Personally I find value in crypto right now. That's why I own it. It works for me and does something for me that was not possible before it was created. You might argue there are alternatives and honestly it sounds alot like people disparaging email and the Web way back when. Back when I first became enthralled with the Web there was an estimated 20-29 million users world wide. Before that I was an avid BBSer. My experience is when technology captures the attention of enough developers and enthusiasts because it's promise then it becomes unlikely that development will stop until the ultimate evolving vision is realized. The value in crypto is there and now the early adopters, developers, investors will not stop until the majority of the world understands this and accepts this. Crypto wasn't created by luck or for fun or for any other frivolous  reason. Some smart people felt it absolutely necessary that it be created.

No one seems to be acknowledging where the contract settlement price is derived. GEMINI auction price! Who's going to stop some whale entity from driving the price on the Gemini auction  up in the day of settlement? They can go ahead and dump btc to drive the price down worldwide only to have a single entity at the right time (settlement day) on a SINGLE market (gemini auction) to DESTROY them and take all their USD. Also... WHO in the hell is going to SELL all these lucrative contracts to the shorters?  If it was going to be as easy as this OP theory (which I've seen repeated all over reddit multiple times) then there would be no one stupid enough on the other side to sell the contracts.

Thanks for bothering. I keep seeing this half baked theory of institutional 'sure thing' shorting. Who in their right mind would be selling all these contracts if it was sooooo easy for people going short. Also.. the settlement price is derived from Gemini btc auction on the day of settlement. How fucking easy is it to drive up the price of an auction item? This futures market might be a big flop as the real already matured btc market chugs right along unaffected.

It wasn't a stupid decision. And not for any reason you can acknowledge. There are characteristics of bitcoin which liken it to a different class of opportunity.

The people that apparently took a bigger risk acknowledged information other people couldn't.
