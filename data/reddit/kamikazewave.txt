It's called diversification.

Ah yes. The part where you insult my lack of knowledge (which I freely admitted in the post) while implying you have more but just won't deign to impart it.

You're completely ignoring the fact that this is distributed computing. Encryption adds a difficulty barrier when looking for information. It's like trying to piece together a puzzle that's been spread out among a bunch of other puzzles, and they've all been painted one color. 
Also, I never said this would be a source of distributing power that everyone would want to use. If you're sensitive records, you should be doing it differently anyways.

The number of miners is proportional to the price, but not always proportional the the size of the commerce Bitcoin does, as seen in the recent bubble. 
This would decrease the size of the network effect. Now, even a small network can work because the lower limit of the value of bitcoins is how much processing power is available in the network minus some inconvenience cost. 
I'm not saying it's a perfect or end game solution. I fully believe that the end goal should be a fiat currency. But if we had something similar in the beginning bitcoins might be in a better position.

What does this have to do with amazon's servers? They're not distributed computing. They're a completely other service. 
If you were analyzing photos each photo would be broken down into its characteristic array and then split up, separate computations distributed throughout the system.

Bitcoin's value is equal to the size of the commerce it does, not the size of the community that run the bitcoin client or mine bitcoins. This is why bitcoin is in a deflationary spiral. Too many holders, not enough transactions.
This way, a bitcoin's lower limit value would be equal to however much processing power it can command, which is proportional to the number of miners.

So? The person running the computation gets a small part of the overall data in a manner that won't be easily readable. Again, you're not working with bank records here.

I explained later on in my admittedly long post about tying it to processing cycles, since it's an inherent part of the bitcoin network already.

With distributed computing and a quick encryption, I don't see how privacy would be an issue?
