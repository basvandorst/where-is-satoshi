Sure and even I have made this same argument but average TX fees have moved from 1-2 cents a couple years ago to closer to 50 cents today. That isn't much of a user choice. That is eroding of a use case. How far away are $1 tx fees?

[This link]( verifies this.
Jumio’s Netverify® solution enables Coinbase to verify user ID cards/documents and then ensure the person holding the ID matches the identity on the card prior to approving increased buy/sell limits within the marketplace. This added level of security is enabled through the Jumio Face Match technology, which allows users to take a live webcam video of their face and compares it to a photo of their photo ID. During the Face Match video stage, the technology detects even the slightest facial movement, ensuring that the user is a real person, not a photo, and that they are a match to the ID being presented.
“Jumio is the best way for us to verify physical IDs and give our customers a frictionless experience to access and scale with our services, while ensuring we prevent ID theft-driven fraud, as well as meet regulatory requirements and KYC for safe and secure transactions,” said Soups Ranjan, director of data science at Coinbase.

I'm not interested in really selling almost ever... If it is clear that Bitcoin is about to $0 finally forever, then I might consider it... but I see "the moon" as being a fully developed closed loop Bitcoin economy to emerge. In that case, I never "sell" the coins, I just use them as Bitcoin.

Let's just wait for Yours Network to go live, yeah?
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:19:40
Yours Network requires LN which is made much easier with segwit. Ryan supports larger blocks but also needs segwit in order to have the product really work at all.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:36:11
Yeah, you're correct. Just listened to the newest podcast and I suppose I had the details jumbled around. Also doesn't require segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:55:15
Thus far, the majority of the hashrate seems to be voting with their "CPU" power that the status quo is superior to both segwit and BU. Next.

@_date: 2017-04-19 00:16:18
The Bitfinex price being higher is most likely skewing the average Bitcoin cost and Bitpay is roughly the same as Gdax at the moment. Bitpay has always generally had a "below average" exchange rate though and I noticed this whenever I bought anything on Gyft with Bitpay instead of the Coinbase option.

How hard did you investigate this before assuming malice? 
The price on the left seems to be an average price among all exchanges (comparing to

So while it may be odd to have two different Bitcoin prices, it makes sense. One on the Bitcoin.com site is just a general investment number meant to give you an idea. Store.Bitcoin.com has a price that is specific to the exchange rate you'll pay through any Bitpay based store.

Sure, but you don't even know if he is dumping for fiat. You're guessing this. Bitpay is more than just dumping to fiat. It is also an accounting software for Bitcoin  transactions. You can also choose to not dump to fiat and be 100% Bitcoin or 95% Bitcoin or any other percentage desired. Can you please demonstrate what that number is? You don't have the ability? Then you're talking out of your ass. 


Bitcoin.com is not Bitcoin. It's just a website with the name of the coin on it. Nothing else. Your expectations "because it is bitcoin.com" are just silly. 


Why would you? Bitcoin.com has an average of all the market prices out there. WHICH ARE ALL DIFFERENT. ( Why should they set their Bitcoin price at Bitpay's just because they have a Bitpay store? It's not like they don't post the Bitcoin price at the top of the page where it is readily apparent. 


Roger loves Bitcoin and profit. They are not mutually exclusive. Nobody is forcing anyone to go gamble on Bitcoin.com or anything.  You're also asserting he is dumping for fiat with no evidence, just your own inference so you can be angry at the "other side". Be more critical of your own bullshit. 


To be fair, Roger helped to hype and build the price of Bitcoin way more than you will ever do in your entire life. So how much does Roger get to profit from his own work? What would be fair?


Says the dishonest person. While Roger isn't my favorite person ever, it is intellectually lazy to keep doubling down on your own mistake and lack of critical thinking.

@_date: 2017-05-10 19:05:47
Coinbase has pretty much been like this for the longest time. If you listen to podcasts with Olaf Carlson-Wee, you'll realize how the customer service at Coinbase works. They have an AI send out a form message as a default way to weed out as many customer service mailings as possible. 
Their customer service hasn't degraded, it's been pretty much this bad the entire time. They've just been getting MASSIVE amount of customer adds. I work for another Bitcoin company and I know we've seen an order of magnitude more customers/more tickets. 
While it sucks that your ACH is not working right, keep in mind that we just had a *HUGE* market run up in BTC, ETH, and LTC. Coinbase support is probably backlogged out of the ass. They are not trying to fuck you specifically.

It wouldn't be an instant throughput increase across the board, but it does help with a lot of other things and would allow other INSTANT throughput increases including schnorr signatures, MAST, LN, Mimblewimble, and others. 
Go mindlessly raise the block size on your own blockchain if you want, but I'd much rather have throughly researched dynamic block size vs just giving the keys to the kingdom to the n00bs at BU.
