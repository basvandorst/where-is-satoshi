He seems to be assuming the paralell universe/es? theory of time travel
in that you actually travel across to another universe, and also into That past.
thus anything he *changes* won't matter because the universe he is in is not his universe of origin.

Now now, from what I gather gwern has been mostly debunking theories on who could be this and that person, arguning the reasons why someone would make said theories and then pointing out why said theories are impossible, as he said before: he hasn't seen anything which made him &gt;50% confident about a given person being a given persona.


You do have a point and I agree that caution should be taken.
I also think that gwern has already taken this to heart, to some degree.

I prefer to think that the fork universes already exist, because otherwise the time travel device would have to consume enough energy to generate an entire universes' matter worth in the first place, and it's simply not possible for humans to by 2025 have reached kardeshev V status (and the whole fact that a time traveler's story is based on mere petty economic failure just points to poor imagination...
You could easily do so very many things with a one way time travel, for example collecting artifacts and "lost" information such as a secret backdoor implimented in the initial bitcoin protocal and then instructions on how to activate it inserted in a time capsule and buried in a precommited (for the time traveler) location for his groupies to pick up one day their time after he travels back.
and that's just one half assed idea given three seconds of thought.
Given certain phrasing the time traveler seems to be implying that this is an alternate timeline for him and he wants to save us seven billion people from the fate of his timeline's seven billion, which in anycase subverts your argument.
