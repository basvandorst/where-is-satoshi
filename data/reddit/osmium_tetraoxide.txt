We are talking about a bitcoin HODLer, let's not expect someone able to read properly.

Here is my analysis, bitcoin is a giant decentralised ponzi scheme using up the equivalent electricity to power 3 million american homes. There are no fundamentals, there are 7 transactions per second. It would struggle to scale for a whole town to use. About time it popped and burned people who wanted the next get rich quick scheme.

Your going to be fucked if it crashes and they end up putting a lot of money in.
Imagine they liquidate and buy 50% of their net worth because they fall down the HODL rabbit hole or end up buying on a fake/dodgy exchange, they will blame you, fairly or not.
Good luck when it falls like 2013 and they come running for you.

Now buy fifty foot blockchains by David Gerard to add some balance to the mix.

I bought a car for £500 two years ago and I just got an offer to sell it for £30,000!
That's what a car bubble would be.

Andreas is a dishonest man who doesn't understand the basics of physics. The energy usage of bitcoin is growing everyday, if it increases within two years it would require the whole world's electricity supply, how is this sustainable?
He needs to talk to even one of the many scientists and economist who have investigated the energy usage of bitcoin mining. Read his book, he mentions it in passing as some after thought, not as one of the central requirements. Useful shill for energy companies.

I'm looking forward to the day Bitcoin crashes again and people get burned.
This is all straight up speculation.
Hope you've diversified for when it crashes.
This DD is a joke.
