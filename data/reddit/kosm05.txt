you should check out credit unions.

This is actually what most of the tellers payroll comes out of, overdraft fees.  
This is why it's VERY difficult to convince them to refund an overdraft fee. And it is also why they (for a time, maybe still do) would always process deposits last.

it's almost as if they want you to not do business with them.

here is something that may slightly cheer you up. 
1] you hang onto the theory that you wouldn't have cashed out on the first big jump and would've waited until now, which you probably would've. Meaning you most likely wouldn't be the multibillionaire you imagine yourself as. 
2] you could've invested a ton, and had it hacked/stolen or simply lost the key. 
3] there is still the chance that even today, it could more than triple in value, therefore it isn't too late. 
: ) hopefully this makes you feel better.

it might be worth keeping a personal chart on when you buy and how much. 
overall, i'm in the green with my bitcoin. but i have a few purchases that are negative because of this dip.  that's ok tho.

Not worried about it at all. I just wished i would've cashed out when it was 19k+ so i could buy back in at 13k to get more coins...

are we also also predicting coinbase to completely crash on sunday ?

if you're buying bit coin and you're living paycheck to paycheck, you're doing something wrong.

every fucking time i keep telling myself i'm going to buy (this was even 3 years ago).  I'm going to do it now. 
Which service did you buy from on the list? 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:25:41
[right](  you guys are loons. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:22:05
Oh you mean the asshole that tired to have someone killed?  Yeah, fuck that guy. The world is a better place with him rotting in prison.  He did nothing but bring great shame to the bit-coining community by linking us with his heinous acts. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:23:48
He's in prison because he's a fucktard.  The only fool is himself. He's a stupid cunt that did nothing positive for the bit coin community and you treat this guy (keep in mind although they didn't charge him for trying to have someone killed, he still tried it) as a second coming figure head. 
He is exactly where he deserves to be. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:24:20
He didn't. He's in prison for the rest of his fucking life..exactly where he needs to be.

trying to hire a hitman is part of it. people often forget about that whole thing.
