What have I said or done that pointed at the trash that is bcash?
I care about Bitcoin being useful, not about your portfolio.

Quite the mental gymnastic required to pretend this won't provide immediate relief to the network. Whether or not TXN load increases further is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:17:49
I've been in Bitcoin from early 2011 and have considered immediate TXNs with super low fees a key feature. Seeing it lose this capability makes it much less appealing. 
Let's just hope it's doesn't stay in this "temporary" state until no one cares about it anymore.

Yes, I know we just did Segwit. Yes, I know there are many pushes to the rep and things are happening. I simply don't see why not alleviate the pressure by making this simple change. 
It's not meant to be an end all, it's not in place of adopting Segwit or implementing Schnorr signatures or 2nd-layer solutions. It's just an easy way to have a win.

I refer you to economic theories established in the past few centuries about "supply and demand".

I'm sorry, I thought I was making a valid stupidly irrelevant and exaggerated response to that useless freeway example.
"We can't improve things now because people will want to improve things again later." said no one ever about anything besides Bitcoin.
What's my agenda? Having lower fees in Bitcoin? :)

If only we could edit one line of code to change it to 2mb while still working on other solutions! Alas, that is too complex even as a thought experiment. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:49:32
That sounds quite Machiavellian. Keep things shit so people work harder. Almost as if... it's a government running the show.

Feed the poor? Why, that would be terrible! It's better if they starve and live in squalor until we come up with a final solution to all of humanity's problems.

Heya. Synereo CEO and ex-IAF guy here. 
We are working very closely with a legal team to make sure that selling token for the system before it is up is absolutely legal. We would not risk your money (or prison time) otherwise. 
Regarding surveillance: I want to echo what citizenpolitician said. I am completely disgusted by the current situation and by how easily it's become almost unquestionably acceptable. By the fact that all of our private information is open to anyone in a position of power. One of the reasons I got into the world of crypto tech in the first place (well, besides seeing the sci-fi I've been reading materialize in front of my eyes) is the issue of personal freedom and privacy.
I can assure you that one of the axioms of the system is that it's as private as you want it to be. This will be apparent even without seeing the code, just by understanding the nature of the asymmetric cryptography we will employ (and seeing it in action). 
Either way, the system will not be *completely* decentralized until it's open-sourced and forkable, and when that time comes, if you feel like we are doing anything that shakes your confidence, I am sure there will be others who feel like that as well and you'll be able to start your own Synereo from scratch, implementing whatever changes you like.

I am busy with the TLV conference right now ( but feel free to ask me any other question and I'll be sure to answer later on.

I do know Yoni. Why do you think he should be involved? :)
I advise that you read Daniel's latest post to get a clearer view of the scope we're aiming at. 
We are hard at work on documents detailing the various aspects of the system in higher resolution. Sign up on synereo.com and follow the BTT thread and you'll be sure to see everything as it materializes.

I wish they'd link to the blog where I posted this instead of to pastebin, though. :)

How so? 
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:05:10
Well, sometimes you need to perform other trust-dependent operations beyond just sending bitcoin around.

Being able to distribute AMPs to thousands of people frictionlessly, without having to pay transaction fees for each transfer, Synereo becomes the absolute easiest way to onramp people onto the cryptocurrency world.
All one has to do is participate in the network as is the norm on other social networks to enjoy the value that others place on his attention.

Good UI isn't magic. It's about investing in a process that begins with understanding what users want and expect from a service and then iterating over and over until a good, flowing experience is created.

Make sure you check out our new Learn More section, going into detail about Synereo's functioning distributed storage solution, smart contracting system, and attention economy model.

What's the use of the Factom token, exactly?
Is there any mechanism creating increased demand for it as the project takes hold and people utilize the technology?
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:52:14
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:23:31
This is not a philosophical discussion about inherent properties and the nature of value. :)
When you have a token with explicit buying power that is readily and unconditionally available to you, it has this as an inherent value. It's inherent in the definitions of the platform, and as long as people use it, it has value there. 
It's not up to the user to decide whether or not it's valuable as long as he uses the system. This is as "inherent value" as it gets!

The beauty of decentralization is that people can act in an uncoordinated manner and without prior agreement and/or a coherent and unifying strategy and still reach great results.
Some will invest in new technologies and projects that may evolve the entire ecosystem and push the Internet/humanity forward and others will stay safe and guard their money closely. No reward without risk.

Unfortunately, all Israelis have to serve in the IDF, so you'd be hard-pressed to find a project originating in Israel with developers lacking a military record.
