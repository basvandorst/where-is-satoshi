So i have either a 26,14 or 40 character file its in hex 0-9 a-f what i mean by either 26,14 or 40 is i copied the contents of the file to a paper and in that paper i have a set of 26 characters and one of 14 its either one or both, that's why i want to see what an old file looked like.  I also remember i erased some f's that came in front of it i cant really remember how many

Ok so im not sure it was an aes.json file, but it was back in 2010 when i did this and i have read that used to be the format for the pk file. However this might be part of the problem ive had recreating the file it might not be a json file at all. Why would it seem odd to you is aes.json not supposed to be hex encoded

well this is what i did i opened the file on the notepad and copied its contents to a paper, but i remember i left out the first part as it was consecutive characters(im prettey sure it was all f's or 0xfffff) im just not sure or how many were they, thats why i want to see an example of what an old wallet file would have looked like
