This is the best answer by far. If you really believe that bitcoin price will keep going up then it makes no sense for you to hold any amount in fiat currency. You basically convert everything into bitcoins and spend them as and when you need to buy something. Sure, you need to pay your bills and you can leave the minimum amount required for that monthly. Anything that is not essential and can be bought with bitcoins, you buy with bitcoins because your purchases for non essential things are spread out and your purchasing power increases in the meantime. That is if you believe that the price of bitcoin will keep going up.

The world economy is around $70 trillion. Assuming we don't get fractional reserve banking with bitcoins and all bitcoins are used to transact that would put them at $3.3 million. But because bitcoin is also a currency that stores wealth, not all of them will be in circulation so the value would be much higher than that. 
That's what we are seeing now as well. Some believe the valuation is not justified but because a lot of people are sitting on their coins, it makes them more scarce. We don't need merchants with a turnover of $12 billion in total to justify $12 billion valuation. We can have enough people holding their coins long term making the coins in circulation scarce and therefore driving the price up. 
Of course speculation, people cashing in early and the lack of massive infrastructure where bitcoin can be used add to its volatility.
