can you imagine anyone but a fool trying to use a payment system where he has to guess at an extra amount in order for the payment to resolve, and then hope that extra fee doesn't change in the next hour or so? it's absurd.

there are posts here every day from people wondering why their transaction hasn't confirmed in 24 hours, up to a few days. It most often turns out they didn't provide a high enough miner bribe. It'll only get worse if blocks stay small and transactions increase.

Let's get something straight. If a merchant wants to support Bitcoin it isn't a matter of simply enabling the functionality and then sitting back on the fat stacks of coin that roll in. Supporting means adding it and suffering through the slow times just like the rest of us.
We use these vendors when it is appropriate, by keeping them in mind at purchase time and occasionally choosing them over another vendor (even if it costs us extra money) because that is how we support it as customers.
Neither of us has to be beholden to the other. I'm tired of hearing merchants bitch. 
Bitcoin is a relative baby on the scene. Support it or don't, but stop bitching, because that makes me realize that a given service was only on the hype train and never supported Bitcoin anyway.

He was, I think, in DC and was talking about how his coins "look real" and that he could spend them and no one would notice. He then went to a street vendor and used his coins to pay.
Also, with 3 seconds of Googling u can find that "...Liberty coins were marked with the dollar sign ($); the words dollar, USA, Liberty, Trust in God (instead of In God We Trust); and other features associated with legitimate U.S. coinage."
I'm not saying anything about whether he was morally right or wrong, or anything about the principles for which he stood. I'm just presenting facts. He intended to pass his coin off as USD and that is a no-no.

There is risk with any payment; counterfeit cash, credit card chargebacks, etc. Currently BTC's downside may be price fluctuations and/or risk of currency failure. As a business you do what you can to enjoy the benefits of each while mitigating the risks.
A large retailer keeps some cash reserves. If you decide Bitcoin is benefit to the business, perhaps you should keep some BTC reserves by setting up your BitPay to only convert 95% of the sale to USD.
When someone purchases in cash, refund in cash. When purchased with BTC, refund in BTC with no fluctuation.

This is the part where I imagine lies the true difference in folks who want to believe in ghosts and gods, and people who know better. "Destroying the mystery of the world" is simply progress in the human knowledgebase, and by definition it means we wipe away medieval superstitions. I am still awed by Penn and Teller but it doesn't mean I have to buy the existence of magic. You can be awed by the Universe and not have to chalk it up to an undead superhero.

Would be nice if your facts actually were factual, and that you could form a sentence. I understand it's asking a lot from you.
1) Please provide documentation Bitcoin tips happened every day for the past 6 months and do not for the next 6 months. At least I think that's what you said. It is hard to tell with all that chewing tobacco in your mouth.
2) the bitcoin community is alive and well. Folks on Bitcointalk.org help each other often. Hop on the developer subforum and see for yourself. Andreas A. and GMax offered to help Gox free of charge before their implosion. Also folks bought millions of bucks worth o' stuff (happy st. patty's day) from Overstock, Tiger and other Bitcoin companies to support them when perhaps these customers prefer to shop elsewhere (like me). If you're complaining because you're not receiving tips that would be a problem with your *own* greed, not someone else's.
3) your dreams are fact? The good old days were never good. Dinosaurs die, the world keeps turning. Be the change you want. If you want to see more Bitcoin tips then you, personally, start giving them more often. It works better than complaining.

Fair enough. I guess some folks will be stressed no matter what. Or are you saying you didn't take profit (get your initial investment back) before the fall? The recipe is to invest, after rise either sell completely and enjoy the gain or if it went up enough sell to recover initial investment plus keep the remaining. If u do this then there is no stress even if we hit zero. Maybe a bit of sadness to see the end of the experiment, but no stress since initial monies were recovered.

it wouldn't do much good. they're a marketing company. most "web firms" in the U.S. no longer make their own product. They are "marketing companies" who simply outsource to the cheapest 3rd world developer they can find to build it for them. The project gets coded horribly, the marketing company and developer collects as much money as possible before disappearing. Everyone wins but the end client, however they did get what they paid for.
you might be asking how the marketing company wins in this situation. "What about their reputation, the repeat business," etc. There is no such thing. Companies do not have the money to remake their web site every year or even every 2 years. Your average company goes 4, 5, 6 years or more in between sites. When it comes time for a new site there has been much turnover and they probably don't even know who their web developer used to be, and if they do they just don't bother using the same developer because they're sure it'd be cheaper with someone else, anyone else. And web developers are all the same, right? 
Therefore, surviving in the web development industry means continually finding new clients with money, not being able to rely on old ones, getting as much money for as little work as possible, *maybe* delivering the actual product and if it is delivered just ensuring sure the bugs don't show for 30 days, then dropping the client as fast as possible now that their money is drained and they're discovering what a shoddy job your outsourced developer did.
Look at the code: they're using WordPress and the code is broken. The HTML has 71 errors.

The world doesn't revolve around you. When you do not gather the info yourself from sources instead of people, you are basically asking them to stop and waste their time so you don't have to waste yours. Spoon feeding folks info is "giving them a fish" and instructing them on googling it for themselves instead is "teaching them to fish." It isn't necessarily "being a dick" to decide I don't have the time to explain a concept to every person on the planet over and over.

Eek... I was a part of that scene, though a hair late, maybe '85 for me. Back then my PC had only a few colours like cyan, magenta, and I think yellow and white maybe. Played Bard's Tale and some Karate game for months on that thing when not BBSing.
Before that, when computers had one color, green, I had a friend with a tape drive on which we played Wolfenstein. It took like 30-60 minutes to load each level. Each "level" of course was just some dots on a screen, of which the player was one. That was probably '82-'83, about the first time I ever saw a computer in person.

People are childishly selfish. If they are offended or don't get what they want, they complain incessantly to anyone who will listen. People in the U.S. want a U.S. exchange and Coinbase is one of the few reliable choices except that it doesn't allow for immediate trade like a normal exchange. There's a 3-7 day wait time for buy/sell.
This makes Johnny unhappy so Johnny complains. This makes Johnny call Coinbase "not a real exchange."
Also, to protect themselves Coinbase denies some transactions. Since many Bitcoiners are up to no good, when their transactions get denied Johnny gets online and yells loudly that Coinbase is the scam, not them. Doubtless, as with any company, sometimes one or 2 people fall through the cracks, meaning they may NOT be up to no good and still get transactions denied. Johnny gets offended and screams online where the company and everyone else can hear them.
I have no doubt Coinbase has made some mistakes. Everyone does. The hate comes from Johnny and you hanging out in this Bitcoin echo chamber where everything seems louder.

And we're back to square one. There is equal lack of empirical evidence for my flying unicorn as there is for any god or magical prophet. "Ancient spiritual texts" are fiction passed off loosely as testimony, certainly not evidence. 
That "atheists are a minority" means nothing. Argumentum ad populum:
Many people do say they are agnostic. I imagine its because they're trying to be polite.  Maybe they don't want to stir up heated debates with nutters who believe in talking snakes and such. It's tough to look into the empty, glassy eyes of someone who believes in the absurdity of the Bible, and other "ancient religious texts," and talk common sense to them when it is clear they cannot conceive of what is common sense.
I like to think most find your precious ancient texts a silly as I but they're still stuck with the unconscious fire and brimstone guilt required to keep people in a religion. It is a lasting form of torture unfortunately. They're hedging their bets with an attitude of "I don't buy it but just in case I'll stay in the middle where it is safe." This is simply the process of religion disappearing entirely for those people. It just takes a while for some. There are plenty of stories on the net for those who've had severe trauma trying to drop their beliefs, and the fear of Hell is a strong one. Shameful, what religion will sink to.
Listen to clergy talk about their trauma upon leaving their church:
What agnostics may not realize (or just aren't ready to come to grips with yet) is they've already admitted they don't believe. They are un-admitted atheists. Because, in the case of Christianity, the book of rules says they must do certain things such as prostelytize or witness, that is, try to convert others. If they don't then they are denying their god his commandments and supposedly end up camping by the Lake of Fire for eternity (or whatever equivalent of Hell a given religion has). So agnostics don't believe, they just don't want the trouble of dealing with the social stigma of being "an atheist."

As with anything else, when battling on price it's a race to zero, or as close to zero as possible. If a company can manage to make money elsewhere (by collecting your info or by advertising to you) then transactions fees will become zero.
Bitcoin's fee can be zero however one risks the transaction not completing. We'll have to get routinely close to consistently zero fees with no/low risk of Dorians (unconfirmed transaction) to win this battle.

When I said 2.5 BTC was too low for investment I meant legitimate investment. There are many firms who will take any penny you can send because they have no intent to return value.
On the lower end of things you can always use Bitstamp or Bitfinex to trade if you enjoy the risk. I believe Coinbase is safest but because of legacy banking issues it takes up to a week to process each buy/sell which makes it less useful as an exchange, unless one keeps much extra funds in one's bank account and extra BTC in Coinbase. This way one could essentially continue to buy/sell while other transactions are processing, however I believe I've seen posts where Coinbase has cut some off that have too many transactions happening at once.
I'm not saying there is no wild growth investment opportunity. There's just so much potential for loss that one really needs to have a lot to begin with. Unfortunately for folks who just don't have much to start with (like me and likely you) the best investment may be the hardest one: buy and hold.
Having said that, remember it is a currency which value rises the more we use it as such. Hold a % and spend a %. Good luck to you!

Meal replacements are generally meant to replace only a couple meals, the popular types advise something like: "shake for breakfast, shake for lunch, regular food for dinner".
Soylent is an overall food replacement. You need no other food source at all. It is also more of a philosophical approach to "less wasteful farms/land, less expensive food, less wasted time cooking." Of course the taste is highly subjective. Some find it pleasant, others not. There are variants to the main recipe, and you could always add a dash of cocoa powder, sucralose or something if you want.

I think it's obvious OP is lying or hasn't fully accounted for fees. ATMs in his own banking network may be free but the fact is we use ATMs for convenience and it isn't always convenient *your* bank will have a machine near you when you want one, so it is likely he has paid fees.
Also, while a checking account may be free, after the first 5-10 freebies given by a bank for a new account checks cost money to be printed. If he writes checks then he's paid this fee.

There was a time when Mark did good things like paying back people who'd lost funds elsewhere out of his own coins. He also trademarked Bitcoin because there was a trademark troll attorney trying to TM it just to make money (he wasn't involved in Bitcoin at all). Mark/Gox was one of the few people in the space at that time who could afford to go through the costly process to defend the Trademark.

2.5BTC is not enough to seriously invest in anything. Aside from that, outside the Bitcoin world investments can be scammy as well. 
I believe I read somewhere that venture capitalists plan on only 20% of their investments paying off, however that 20% usually makes up for the other losses, but only after VERY careful evaluation of the investment. This doesn't mean one Googles the investment opportunity for 10 minutes.... this means not only financial evaluations but also physically going to the investment property/office, investigating all leads about the company with the intent of discovering deceit. Even then investors can be swindled.

Atheism is one position on one question: Do you believe any god exists, and the answer, no. Anyone who refers to atheism as a system of beliefs is, in no uncertain terms, wrong.
Now, one may say that a large group, perhaps even a majority, of atheists subscribe to a group of beliefs known as humanism. Or one may say many atheists trust science is the most appropriate structure upon which we collectively hang our conception of reality. But one should never refer to atheism itself as a system of beliefs, for you may offend the Buddhist.
I'm not sure where agnosticism fits into your spiel however again you've expounded beyond your knowledge base. The agnostic is not necessarily neutral; the agnostic simply is literally "without knowledge." 
An agnostic may or may not believe in a creation theory but is simply unsure whether it is true. One can be an agnostic theist. One can be an agnostic atheist, meaning "I don't know if there's a god but I don't believe there is," which seems to be a popular stance within the atheist community. A more strident atheist will drop the agnostic part of that label.

I didn't suggest a bank wasn't a 3rd party. Re-read the sentence, emotional one. Security is the primary function of a bank. 
Because banks have money they can offer loans, which may be their primary source of revenue but not the primary function. Because they handle lots of money and the gov wants us to feel warm and cozy about it, they also have insurance.
A loan shark's primary function is loans.

Perhaps it is miscommunication. Having been always taxable isn't the issue.
If it is taxed as it stands now I apparently have to do paperwork (over $600/yr) on EVERY transaction's value for every taxable event, over and over, every day. If taxed as currency instead I only need to do paperwork once a year on the total bought/sold ending value, not on each transaction. You see?
10 transactions a day means 3650 paperwork entries for "whatever" as opposed to ONE paperwork entry if we are taxed instead as a currency. This will have a chilling effect on using it as a currency in the U.S.
The IRS ruling was pleasant for folks who want to trade rule financial clarity, not so much for those who want to use BTC as a currency.

he loves dogecoin, gambling, soccer, and doesn't know the difference between "there", "they're" and "their". he does get credit for fixing some of his previous typos but this is outweighed by his devotion to soccer, whose fans are collectively as smart as a box of rocks.

Even though this isn't Gyft's fault perhaps a warning on the BK GC page would be the classy thing to do. As an American I want a warning on everything (of course), like "Warning: swinging on these monkey bars may cause you to lose grip and plummet to the ground," or, "Warning: this carousel could make you dizzy," or, "Warning: showering may cause wetness." 
Would likely hurt sales to say, "sometimes BK cards do not work," but even though my rational mind knows it's BK's issue, I am still out $25. The teensiest amount of misplaced blame may still land on Gyft for facilitating the fuckery. Call it "defensive driving" for Gyft to put a note on the page letting folks know there can be issues with BK.

It's not worth the hassle to use them until they solve this problem, and anyone forced to use them is asking for trouble, sad customers, and an intermittently miserable user experience. It's a shame but it's true. Hopefully they can be publicly embarrassed into fixing the issue.

Yeah, it's sad news that Bitcoin is definitely NOT "the internet's currency." It may find a place in face-to-face transactions like restaurants but only if it develops a more immediate way to confirm. It may be that, as a currency, it will never settle into being used for more than long distance transactions to already trusted receivers.
Perhaps more value will eventually rest on the things built on top of Bitcoin. This is OK. We got into it because it's an experiment, right?

Nice anecdote. Here's mine: 20 years without a virus or Trojan and never used anti-virus. 20 years of time saved "scanning hard drive for virii." 20 years of NOT paying an anti-virus company for their updates, which don't do much good anyway because most nasty virus action is zero-day. 20 years of clicking on whatever I want without concern as to what it'll download.
Meanwhile I go to work where I'm forced to use a PC which wastes time every day scanning and scanning. They have special rules: don't click this, don't download this, don't open emails from folks you don't know. I can't download software -- some other dude has to come download it and put it on my machine. 
All of this waste and stress could be avoided. Just use a Mac. And maybe work on not downloading every dodgy freebie that comes your way. Life can be simpler.

This isn't meant as an attack but it would likely benefit you to completely desist with the "woe is me" aspects of your posts, which I seem to stumble across from time to time. You are reaping what you've sown.
If you feel you've made mistakes in the past that you want to move forward from, offer apologies at every turn (even if you don't feel it is warranted) but otherwise do not dwell on them. Pay back BTC you may owe. Actually do move forward. There is no justice in the world; we know already.
Get involved in something Bitcoin-beneficial which is completely transparent and quietly excel. People will notice. 
Find an outlet for your desperate need for attention which has nothing to do with Bitcoin: join a band, become an actor or comedian. The attention you seek online coupled with the "woe is me" act is pathetic. It makes people side against you. 
It may also have something to do with your insistence that you're a great guy, given your shady past. There's no escaping your past. There is only recognizing how to grow from it. Some people *will* respond to your "turning over a new leaf." Others won't. Don't expect anyone to feel sorry for you however.

I worked several years in a phone center, on the phone and then as a supervisor. The people who answer surveys are either:  
- old and lonely  
- folks who will chatter with anyone about anything  
- folks who intentionally give bad info to skew results

To figure out the deal just look at 40% of new posts are about the danger of an attack that could render Bitcoin worthless. 20% of posts are people who lost their BTC due to password/2fa/scams. 15% of posts are about burdensome tax issues. 10% are veiled or outright begging. 10% are hoping to deify who wrote the original code (which has nearly been replaced in entirety). 7%-10% are posts containing bad math. The remaining 18% percent are trollish posts.

I did make the trip to my local grocer yesterday to let the manager know I would be driving the extra 30 minutes to shop for some of the groceries at Walmart, though I personally don't enjoy shopping at Walmart. I did tell the manager about Gyft and that I would prefer to shop at his store but he wasn't a corporate guy so I was basically talking to thin air.

If you're looking only for positive and supportive comments, you've already made up your mind. The truth is plain and repeated over and over: if you do not control the private keys, the bitcoin isn't yours.
Now it may be that you're comfortable trusting an online entity just as you trust your local bank. Many may have to do so, which is what Coinbase and Circle are betting on.

So then, how to know which are naughty and which are just life? No one wants to be hoodwinked/enslaved/lied to/whatever so sometimes we go down the rabbit hole questing for knowledge. The deeper one goes down the hole, the more engrossed one becomes, the more unfathomable it appears to be.
The trick is to go down the hole until you can still see sunlight coming in from above. Maybe make a few changes in your life if you feel compelled. Hopefully you've based your decision on science not superstition. Then climb the fuck back out of the rabbit hole because further down dwells insanity, and it is a tempting mistress.

I used to make a lot of online ads for AOL when they meant something. During that time they wanted clicks, didn't care how. I created ads that fooled people into clicking but I warned AOL it wasn't a good idea. They didn't care, they wanted clicks. Eventually there was a backlash.
I see something familiar in click-bait headlines. They work but it tarnishes the image of a site which uses them. Maybe Forbes finally noticed her trashy click bait articles tarnish their image, and Yahoo is simply willing to do anything.
Either that or I'm still sore about Kashmir's stabbing of Bitcoin in the back by supporting Leah McGrath Goodman when she "outed" the wrong Satoshi.
The fact the Fusion site looks like it was developed by my Future Farmers of America teen nephew appears to me like a step down. Maybe the Brian Williams debacle has some purveyors of online news concerned about the backlash of (and/or appearance of) deceit.

If ICANN can demonstrate global cooperation on what is clearly the most important technology the world possesses (the internet) then we are one step closer to governmental cooperation.

This is why web development should NOT be done "IE first." Always use FFox/Chrome to do initial testing on both platforms, then IE, then Safari. 
When you're testing IE use F12 to pull up developer's tools to emulate IE8-IE10. Fuck IE7 or less - the world has got to move forward. Note that some tech like IE8 won't support Bootstrap or whatever else the kids these days are doing, without add-ons and shims and your grandma's panties included, so you may want to add IE8 to the "fuck you" list depending on your audience.
Generally Safari and Chrome share their issues, sometimes these coincide with IE, however IE almost always has more issues resulting from its shittiness. So building in IE gives you a false sense of cross-browser reliability.
As someone else mentioned you have invalid HTML. Use w3.org to check your code:   You have 326 errors... though granted, validation can be persnickety.
You should probably be using HTML5 these days; XHTML is on the way out, if not dead already. Be aware that IE doesn't like HTML5 so you'll probably need a shim, or I just add the JS by hand myself.

America used to be a place where pride in the quality of one's work and craft mattered. That's been replaced by the desire to build the cheapest product at the cheapest price, then replace it when it breaks.
Another offshoot of our brand of capitalism is that a company does everything it can to control a market, keeping possibly better technologies out of the marketplace simply to retain dominance. America isn't about being the best any longer. It is only about making the most money for as long as possible.

Give it time. Coinbase is reputable though sometimes their estimates on time are low.
They only have instant coin buying if one attaches a Visa credit card to one's account. Otherwise plan on 3-6 bank-day wait for each transaction. Also note that Coinbase has lower maximums until you've bought/sold a certain minimum.
As with any company there are likely some who've had issues. Personally I have probably 100 transactions without flaw. 
Note Coinbase works with many banks which could have their own issues. Some banks consider Bitcoin high risk and may close your account simply because you used Coinbase. I advise opening a new bank account specifically for Coinbase, and to research banks which are not hostile to Bitcoin.

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
Some years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, envisioned Bitcoin as the Emancipation Cryptoclamation. This momentous software would come as a great beacon light of hope to millions of fiat slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
But a few years later, the average Joe Bitcoiner still is not free. Years later, the life of Joe is still sadly crippled by the manacles of fiat and the chains of financial discrimination. Years later, Joe lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of Wall Street prosperity. Years later, Joe Bitcoiner still languishes in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, Bitcoiners as well as fiat lovers, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her Bitcoin using citizenry are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given Joe a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of financial segregation to the sunlit path of fiscal justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of fiat to the solid rock of cryptography. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of Joe Bitcoin's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Two thousand fifteen is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that Joe needed to blow off steam and will now be content with Lawsky's self-serving regulations will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until Joe is granted his fiscal rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of cryptographic justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new righteousness which has engulfed the Bitcoin community must not lead us to a distrust of all fiat people, for many of our cash brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of fiscal rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as Joe Bitcoin is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of checking out with a credit card. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities without credit. *We cannot be satisfied as long as Joe's basic buying choices are limited from alpaca socks to scammy mining hardware. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: "Cash Only."* We cannot be satisfied as long as a Bitcoiner in Mississippi cannot use GrubHub and a Bitcoiner in New York believes he has no Bitcoin license which he reasonably afford. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until "justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."¹
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all forms of payment are created equal."
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of Bitcoiners and the sons of former fiat owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of New York, a state sweltering with the heat of financial injustice, sweltering with the heat of fiscal oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the choice of their payment but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight.
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:
    My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
    Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,
    From every mountainside, let freedom ring!
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
    Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
    Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.
    Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
    Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
But not only that:
    Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
    Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
    Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
    From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, fiat and crypto users, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
                Free at last! Free at last!
                Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!

Coming to a biased marketing thread like (which the user probably doesn't even realize) and asking for suggestions means asking for a guised marketing pitch, whereas if he/she/it/they/them/hey youze guys did a Google search and took it upon itself to read up on experiences from many different sources there might be a more well-rounded decision outcome.

Would be nice but let's try grass roots. Get to know your local pizza guy. Talk to him slowly over time about the benefits. 
Don't be pushy. Don't lead him to believe he'll get a ton of customers using Bitcoin.  One day maybe he'll ask for more info. 
If he begins accepting Bitcoin because he sees the benefit, he'll be more willing to hang in there through the slow time until more people are using it.
Most of all, if he does begin accepting it, patronize the establishment. This means even on days when you may not be in the mood for another pizza.

He ran a market for illicit goods. Whether you find it reprehensible or not, it doesn't make him a hero. 
Your logic is astoundingly poor. Should we assume you also worship governments and banks, which take money away from cartels?
By your logic any online retailer makes people safer, so no big deal there. And perhaps he took crime off the streets and moved it indoors, like the mob has done; so what? Are mafia members heroes to you as well?
Tell me he was brave (or naively foolish perhaps). Tell me he attempted something revolutionary. But calling him a hero only lessens your credibility.

If you should go skating  
On the thin ice of modern life  
Dragging behind you the silent reproach  
Of a million tear stained eyes  
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice  
Appears under your feet  
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind  
With your fear flowing out behind you  
As you claw the thin ice

I don't see a problem: they don't own the hardware, you don't own the coins. Seems like a good fit. DOH!
Hope they're keeping backups truly off-site unlike these guys:  
I know I read a story a while back either on reddit or bitcointalk about someone who lost their entire AWS web site because of some glitch where the entire database was stored as temporary memory or some such, and he either logged out inappropriately or something... sorry I can't remember details but it sounded woeful. Maybe it was a lower end Amazon product.
Anyway, congrats and good luck to Bitstamp. It's rough out on the Bitcoin sea.

I'm a web designer and developer.... I'll never forget the time I started seeing weird hits on my stats package, only to discover my entire (back-in-the-day static) site had been stolen (stats link and all). I wrote to the domain owner but he was Italian and he didn't understand. I used babelfish.com (i think it was...) to translate but he still claimed to not understand. He finally changed the design and code after I managed to demonstrate some security inefficiencies he was suffering from.

2) Hype shoddy company, working like a dog the first 6-12 months to create the air of responsibility while dough rolls in from bitcoin rubes.  
3) Begin intermittent issues, resolve them  
4) Go down for maintenance for an extended period

we're talking about rights, not non-rights. North Koreans only have the right to do what their government tells them is within their rights and which it protects. If NK gov says their subjects cannot move then citizens do not have the right.
A right is a fantasy construct. People think they come from god or are innate however they are not (especially since no gods exist). You do not have a right to breath air unless your governing body allows it. If your government outlaws breathing air you might get away with it for a time but that doesn't make it a "right."
If there were no governing bodies on the planet you might still breath air when you choose, however it is still not a right. A right is something granted, and therefore requires a governing body to grant it.
All the downvotes are from emotional nutters who want to scream "Statist!" when it is simply a matter of definition.

Great, welcome to Bitcoin! The first rule of Bitcoin Club is: don't trust anyone involved more than you absolutely must, and even then think twice about your decision to trust someone. Bitcoin is money. The software wallet which holds your coins contains very real value, just like the wallet in your pants pocket holds cash and credit cards.
Your best bet is to find a decent exchange to get some. Don't trust me, but some seemingly established places to buy are Coinbase and possibly Bitstamp however Bitstamp has seen quite a dropoff since they were hacked a couple months ago. Circle may possibly be another avenue but it needs time to mature. Many people use Bitfinex however they're up to some unregulated activity, I would guess, so be careful.
Don't worry that the price is $250, you do not have to buy a whole coin. If you want several coins try selling a service for Bitcoin.
Once you have the coin you need a crash course in security but that is another post...

See item 3: there's nothing spammy about having a web site with relevant content which causes other sites to want to link to yours. However you are correct that an additional tactic in playing the game is to find high page rank sites to reference your site.

That depends on what one thinks of personal responsibility, which is sorely lacking here in the U.S. Everyone wants to blame everyone else for their problems. So, at least in the U.S., the most final personal act of suicide is usually someone else's fault.

My methods have worked for me. I'm sharing them. It really doesn't matter whether you like it or not, does it? Just because I haven't bragged about who I am, who I've worked with, and my experience in web development doesn't mean I don't know a thing or 2 about you, SEO and the slimy industry of which you're a part.
Someone could take my advice and go wrong, or they could take it and save some money while improving their site. Or they could take the advice of someone who's in here to drum up business for himself; an admitted "former" blackhat SEO guy who used link rings even when we knew it was shady. Oh... "surprise" Google put a stop to it. Oh... "surprise" some of your other techniques were penalized by Google.
How many people's sites did you fuck up, exactly, while you played with what Google might or might not accept? All this before you so bravely struck out on your own, away from the $300/hour job you boasted of in your original AMA? Higher hourly wage than a lawyer! My, my... you're so good!
Look, this community is full of folks who will take you at face value. I understand it seems like easy prey in here. But you can stop trying to win me over. Even though I don't practice SEO 9-5 I know enough to know 85% of SEO is shucking your wares like a used car salesman. Now if you don't mind, I'm not interested in your mint condition Pinto even though I heard you tell me it is a great deal.
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:24:04
You were concerned that I couldn't read. I'm trying to show that I can read. Here's another thing I read all by myself:  
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:36:12
You misunderstand. You were concerned I couldn't read. I'm simply trying to show that I can. 
As for the complaints of fraud and poor management at Alarm Grid detailed in the handful of posts on that site, I wouldn't know anything about them except what I read there. It does appear to be several upset folks, or like you say maybe just one crazy old man writing multiple negative posts. For all we know, it could actually be martians or lizard men leaving the comments.
I admit I'm curious what all is involved in scrubbing the internet of a dirty past. I hear it sometimes involves using 3rd party services to help, and even really tedious nitty-gritty work done all by oneself alone at night. It seems like a lot of work (especially if, for example, one had a lot of dirt to hide, or possibly a medium amount of dirt on several people). 
Since you're knowledgeable (about "reputation management"[1]), would you say it involves even something as menial as vote brigading, do you think? Getting friends and such to downvote negative posts, theoretically of course? 
I'm not suggesting anyone in this conversation of course. But let's just say as an example, if someone were to go to  and see all the downvoting for no apparent reason on the negative posts, and all the upvotes (with not a downvote in sight) on the positive post, is it within the realm of possibility that it was a feeble attempt by one person (or a group) to make the negative posts seem not credible? On the flipside of that same token it should be in the realm of possibility that Alarm Grid has a legion of fans who scour the internet for positive posts about the company so they can be upvoted.
Hopefully as we continue you will help guide me in learning about SEO and brand reputation. Maybe you could begin sharing examples of negative Alarm Grid posts you have "managed" so we can all better understand how it works? I admit I am perplexed that the definition of "keeping a brand safe" does not mean doing a good job but rather using any means necessary to have facts ~~deleted~~ "managed".
[1]   
"Brand management is incredibly important. I've really enjoyed watching products like Knowem.com and searchEGO.com show up on the brand / reputation management landscape as ways to make sure your personal or business brands are kept safe."

Your family tradition started because Jeebus, after being nailed to the cross, began weeping coins from his wounds. So now folks hide money in eggs.

Sorry for your loss but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin, so it shouldn't be a cause for you to lose faith. I understand you're venting but you gave your money to a stranger.

- Start a website with the domain: how-to-send-money.com  
- fill it with pages whose page title is some variant of "How To Send Money? Bitcoin!"
- fill those pages with relevant content to which other sites will want to link, making sure the &lt;h1&gt; is the same as the page title. In other words the &lt;title&gt; tag should equal the &lt;h1&gt;.
- the page content should be sprinkled with variants of "how to send money - bitcoin" being sure to use &lt;h2&gt; headings with that same text.
- if you overdo your use of the same words/phrases you'll be penalized.
- Now you understand the game. Have fun playing.

Thanks for your advice. Your terrifying threats to "destroy my sites" are unnecessary. I'm sure as a dedicated SEO guy you'd be more knowledgable, and obviously rank more highly on the douchbag scale as well.
I do not spend money nor my time focused on SEO. I gave advice which has worked for me and my goals, with minimal effort, and no link building. 
I'm sure if I were selling whatever the hot thing is at the moment I would not be able to rank well. Too much time, effort and money required. It requires someone more devoted, with money to burn. Most people don't have that and I hope I have helped one or 2 of them.

common item upon which people get discouraged. Note that in this phase of Bitcoin we're only trying to get people to use it. We don't care if they convert back to USD. Once enough people are using it, and price has risen, and is more stable, and more services have been established, people will begin stopping the transfer back to USD.

Bitcoin seems scammy for sure. It's a constant battle to explain to people that it isn't. I can't personally wage every Bitcoin battle but I can ask the merchants I buy from to accept it. 
In this case I could also choose to withhold my money from a merchant who wouldn't allow me to use my payment method choice. There are other Maxillofacial surgeons in town but I chose this one because of reputation, which limited my ability to go elsewhere. But that was an option I could have tried, using only surgeons who I knew would accept it. But again, I wasn't going to fight that battle.

The rantings of religious fanatics TODAY shouldn't be heeded, let alone advice from back when the average person couldn't read or write. Whether you want to argue "the writings of Jeebus" began when the texts were cobbled together in Nicaea or before when myths like the flood were stolen from 2500BC's Gilgamesh is moot. 
Religion served a purpose for its time. We don't need it anymore. We certainly shouldn't be following most of the advice given. I will grant you that "treating others the way you want to be treated" is nice. You can keep that one.

NY is rightly concerned you cannot make good decisions for yourself, so they'd like to be paid to make them for you because they do know better than you about what's good for you. Look at it this way: you no longer have to trouble yourself over learning which bitcoin companies have money to burn.
It is too bad the court overturned the big soda ban. Again, NY knows best about how you should live.  
I was also saddened to learn of the overturn of the food container ban in NY. It was nice to know NY had the back of its citizens by determining for them how they should carry their food around. Goodness knows citizens shouldn't go around making that tough choice for themselves.

Again, as to be expected, pitifully poor logic. And of course we naturally segregate in our history, doofus... We shun the other for survival. 
If you can't see that need no longer exists, and that the evolutionary trend is for a completely mixed race all over the planet with some small variance for global characteristics, then there's nothing I can do to help educate your pea brain. I mean, I thought this was obvious to everyone by now. I keep forgetting there are folks like you who are dumber than a box of rocks.

i see the value oppositely. online transactions require trust: you pay and hope the seller provides the goods, leaving the transaction much more open to scamming. These transactions are better left to existing systems like credit cards.
Face to face transactions don't require as much trust. You sit at a table, order a meal, eat, then pay. You pick out clothes, go to the counter, pay. These are perfect for Bitcoin.

They're in a very strict industry. They will cancel any transaction which appears fishy. 
"Fishy" doesn't necessarily mean you've done anything wrong. It could be something about you doesn't add up for them, or something about your bank, or your Bitcoin transaction pattern which they've studied. In the end it may not seem friendly but they're not in business to be your friend, unfortunately. I understand it can be frustrating.
Sometimes they'll work with you to whitelist you in this situation. I would look at the MANY other Coinbase posts here on reddit from users with the same issue to see if you can track down the username of someone who works at coinbase, then PM that person to see if he can help directly.

If one has a negative view of Bitcoin one prefers a viewpoint which sounds the worst for Bitcoin; and if one has a positive outlook on Bitcoin, he prefers the viewpoint which looks the worst for banking/Wall Street type industries. Unfortunately Stolfi's only point is that he's as biased as anyone else.
Whoever keeps a store of value, especially one known to others, risks getting robbed whether its a bank, a Bitcoin exchange, a herd of cattle, or lawn flamingos. A younger industry will take a while to develop appropriate safety precautions but theft will never be completely stopped.

I can feel less sick to my stomach understanding TJ was a product of his time, and evidence seems to suggest he was pleasant to his slaves, but he still made a WRONG and horribly distasteful choice from a humanistic standpoint (that remained until his death!) which speaks to his overall character and actual thoughts about the freedom of humans.

If a team of shotgun wielding meth addict rednecks kicked down your front door, ransacked your house and robbed you blind I would feel sorry for you. Knowing nothing else about the incident I wouldn't place much blame on you.
If however you did as this gentleman did and, metaphorically speaking, stored $450 in a cookie jar resting on a kitchen counter, then invited 20-30 random townspeople to spend lengthy amounts of time loosely supervised at his house while he was away at work, I would not feel the same amount of sympathy. I would place some of the blame on you for not being cautious enough.
This doesn't mean I would feel no compassion for your plight, nor that I am blaming you not the thief. It does mean you ought not claim you did nothing wrong because in this case you did do something stupid and might have expected the outcome.

3) While a typical bank's hours of operations have changed a little bit in the last 20 years, hopefully you're smart enough to understand "banker's hours" is a phrase that exists for a reason. If not, my condolences to your momma for the raising of a dummy.

Same happens with every scam. People running around shouting for heads. Majority of the time once enough time passes, no one cares. Karpeles is the only scammer in trouble and its still unclear if it was a scam. Ulbricht was not a scammer. All large Bitcoin scammers have disappeared (some even occasionally pop back up to say 'hi'); their thefts all but forgotten. No heads collected.

This is an interesting reply. It debunks the "bitcoin obviously puts WU out of business" and the "bitcoiners love spending" myths with real-world examples of someone in a pinch choosing anything but bitcoin. Hopefully bitcoin continues to mature to overcome these current real-world issues.
