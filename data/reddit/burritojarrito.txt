I use a debit card??
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:13:02
Okay. Many thanks. I always busy running around with work and school right now so my only option really is something with a mobile app.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:40:14
Ahh ok. Thank you.
Edit: Looking at other comments I could be screwed over.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:51:09
What is FUD
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:47:06
Holy shit. Guess I'm not using Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:55:20
My first few transactions were. This one, my largest one is pending however.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:53:26
It's set up as a debit card.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:59:20
Does anyone know if there's a number o can call??
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:03:26
Okay. I'm using Coinbase right now. Do you know how it compares?  Coinbase is trash so I can only assume it's way better
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:45:21
Okay is this an app? Because I can't find it. I'm on apple? Is it android only?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:01:26
Why downvoted? I seriously need some advice.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:29:45
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:07:34
Ok. So what I can just send bitcoin to my Coinbase account? Also what is a fiat gateway??
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:31:34
Fuck. It was me. I guess I hit the wrong button?
@_date: 2018-10-24 03:32:06
Flip full time??
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:16:15
Wait so it's bitcoin? Just another name for it? Or is it another crypto
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:23:10
What's satoshi?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:56:39
I really hope it drops back to 8k because I had to sell for financial reasons, but for the overall well-being of btc I want so see it healthy.
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:27:06
Only 10 years for ordering hit contract???!
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:47:01
What. These need to be everywhere.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:09:24
Good point, time to buy my drugs online. (Joke)(disclaimer)
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:49:37
I don't understand any of the terms or what any of it means.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:02:01
What are bitcoin keys? I just use coinbase and none of these comments are relevant to me.
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:58:52
This is totally a scam.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:37:13
Wow everybody buy!
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:48:33
Any of it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:18:04
Yeah if had cash I'd stick up
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:50:21
My prediction: sits around 10k till late 2019 and then skyrockets to 40k+
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:59:07
I smashed 5 and got 4 coins. Super lucky.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:17:51
What does any of this even mean?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:30:02
Got any articles up your sleeve with opposing views?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:08:01
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:10:47
True. However I have no education on emerging bitcoin advances. I don't know what segwit is. That's why I'm asking these questions which may seem pointless or stupid to you.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:53:03
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:06:39
You know if you wanna go that way. Your generation was built off the one before yours. That's a stupid argument, it's called evolution.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:23:46
W8 it's mixed?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:11:29
Aren't there trading problems with speed and security though? Don't other coins handle this better? If so is this something that can improve? If not, does this mean that it will render useless?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:07:22
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:59:39
No, I just want to go into this knowing all view points so I am out most educated on crypto currencies 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:42:24
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:15:11
Ahh I see. Thank you. I just read in the jimmy article that coin with a governing body over it can be a large disadvantage . ..?
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:09:01
So you're saying I should sell. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:24:27
Thanks. Hopefully it stays up. I'm working can can't watch.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:33:57
Can the network be improved? Are there possibilities of it being improved vastly to the point where transactions could be instant if everyone in the world was using it? Or is it set in stone? Is bitcoin going to be a high value - slowtrading coin that is meant to store your wealth? While other coins will just be there for trading small, quick transactions? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:23:10
Or its under control of the holders. Not the founder. I see. My bad.
