You fucked up

Its OK, I've started to just cost average after pulling my beard hairs out from stress of day-trading. If it tanks more, buy more :)

I should, but I haven’t sold any btc in a couple years. I just buy high and watch my money decrease
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:47:36
That's literally the price now?
What a call. "We are bullish with the price estimate of bitcoin being the current price"

Good thing I bought yesterday at $11,400 :D
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:37
Sucks for you. Can't wait until you regret that and buy in at 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:26:18
lol you'll short BTC once a major market upset happens? sounds like a solid plan
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:28:02
Probably feels bad that it just went up 20% in an hour then xD
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:55:07
same... ive been buying on my credit card (RIP) in the meantime because I can't contain myself lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:56:05
Bought all the way down...
7150, 6700, 6200, 5800, now added a bit more at 6500 :) 
Feels better now than my avg buy being 7600 last week

Any crypto is considered a volatile investment, so it makes sense to me. Against the rules right below your comment.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:15:33
Yeah its fine, I have the money to pay it off the cards. Just wanted to get something in ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:17:07
I love you

uhh... bitcoin is more widely adopted now than ever lol
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:48:07
They probably wont teach it in schools ever
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:25:09
I'd hope XD
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:23:11
Well to be honest, those shorting bitcoin for the last year or so were the smart ones...
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:01:40
Is 60$ in two years even worth it?
