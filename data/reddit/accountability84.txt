Oh yea if you have a cool idea about how to gift bitcoin other than a paper wallet I'd love to hear about it.

I was thinking its perfect it forces then to either move it and learn on their ownhow to use it or let it sit and let me know their private key

Even better considerations!

His comments and posts for the last 6 days check out as a legit user that's VERY new.            
Dude was trying to have someone in LA come and unsend an unconfirmed transaction by, i guess, giving him access to his private keys. XD

Occasionally people say things to a rise out of others on the internet.  The person you're replying to, I believe, is one of those people.  Check out his comment history if you want to lose faith in humanity.

Understands btc, doesnt understand people.  That sounds right.

An interesting thing I noted when watching [this]( over a weeks time,  is that a gentleman, [Brad Peterson]( , is confident in using the technology for settlement using a less intensive proof of work.

Its almost like you could have different distributed databases for different things.

Check out op's other posts to r/DarkNetMarkets and r/bitcoin.  I'm pretty sure he bought bitcoin on coinbase for a third party, he thinks instant buying means instant delivery, now is trying to blame coinbase for his own mistake.  I bet the third party still wants btc from op at current market price.  Rip op

This post is showing up on my feed, this is utter nonsense.  The white paper dictates how changes are made to the protocol.

Bob the "best" ones are still going to give you a trival amount of btc over a very long period of time.

Definitely start margin trading and report back.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:49:34
Yea, no dont do that at all. I was being facetious.  Unless youre doing something really innovative that isnt being applied by quants right now youre just getting really lucky.
