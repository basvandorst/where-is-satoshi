It would really help if you explained why. Why is Bitcoin similar to and different from a stock? Give examples, and then explain what the consequences are for assuming the two are the same and how someone can benefit from understanding they are different.

make sure you understand what your public vs private key is
put the public key in blockchain.info

I'm not entirely sure what you're asking here, but Baidu has a division called Jiasule, which focuses on security and internet services. That division is taking bitcoin as a form of payment.
Also, what other businesses are you referring to?
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:07:30
*(no sass taken)* You are right that it's partly an issue of semantics, but it's not totally inconsequential. Cash is the physical form of currency, but not the currency itself. The payment system for cash is cash exchange. You wouldn't be able to do anything with cash on its own, for example, if no one else would take it in exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:05:25
I'm sorry the other commenters are being jerks. Basically, it's impossible to predict what the price will do over some amount of time. People can have guesses based on some assumptions but that's about it. All that being said, do research on who/what you're buying bitcoin through and make sure they/it are a trustworthy service. This is a very nascent space and totally wild right now.

The Fed started tapering. Bernanke is leaving and being replaced by Yellen. I highly suggest you pay attention to what's going on with the economy rather than spout the nonsense you are right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:16:51
Security, Security Security. Do you have any development experience? How do you even know you can trust those eLance developers? 
$1-3k is absolutely ridiculous and it will cost you way more than that. I hope you're not going to have some guy in Bangladesh or Pakistan do it. I suggest you do some serious looking around for real, trustworthy developers that can give you a real quote, which will likely be above $15k, if not much more.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:13:34
I'm down to brainstorm with you. I guess I have two main questions:
1) What method would be best to get merchants more interested in bitcoin?
2) Which merchants are easy pickings and which are harder but necessary?
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:26:20
I have no idea either way. I'm trying to understand what you meant. You seem to have a good point but it's very vague.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:25:54
Please elaborate what you mean with some examples.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:01:26
Gotcha. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:09:31
Yeah, I have, and I haven't heard a response back.

Payment systems are a framework to transfer monetary value. Typical currencies don't act as payment systems on their own. They represent the monetary values transferred over payment systems.

I have no idea if you're asking a question or making a statement or what you're saying. Please elaborate.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:40:52
Just wanted to say you have an amazing cottage!
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:22:31
Like what?
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:01:59
Thanks for that explanation. It helps quite a bit. Would you charge for the service?  Like how big of a fee would you charge? Between you and your friends, how much capital did you put up and how much of a return did you get (a rough estimate is totally cool too)?
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:10:09
Ahh I see. So how is your card different for either the consumer or the merchant? Are there some savings on either end?
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:47:46
I'm just surprised they would build internally (which would, I'm guessing, cost a decent amount of money for development and security) what they could just use for cheap (BitPay, Coinbase merchant solutions).
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:50:16
what's the difference between this and Coinkite?

Have you been able to do it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:13:39
Food costs. Energy costs. Housing prices. Broadly, tons of other asset classes.
Now I don't think hyperinflation is reasonable either, but over the last few years prices and costs for goods have gone up phenomenally.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:15:01
Can you explain what he meant by that? I'm trying to wrap my head around it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:24:15
Just looked at it. Looks interesting, thanks for the rec!
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:40:00
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:34:51
It's a great paper. I'm guessing that most people just care about bitcoin's price than what it really is and represents. Good PSA though!

Not sure what you're talking about here. Nobody is debasing the Yen except the BOJ itself. Having a cheap currency is what drives exports. That is why china has kept their currency so low for so long. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:06:09
I think the market is a little different mostly because China is so connected. They even already have some familiarity with virtual currency (QQ). It will be interesting to see though, given how weak the Rupee has been and how horribly corrupt India is.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:50:38
I suggest you enlighten yourself. u/killerstorm has been closely involved in Bitcoin for a while now. He's one of the main people spearheading colored coins.

@_date: 2013-11-10 20:34:15
Speculate until two things happen: 1) price stabilizes; and 2) I can buy things with BTC I normally buy with currency (groceries, utilities, etc.)
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:03:21
What exactly is his question? He didn't give any information about what kind of service this is nor anything about what it would do. What exactly is a "bitcoin arbitrage service"? A service that helps you find price differentials for btc over different exchanges? One that is a trading platform? I have no idea. Simply using a word like "arbitrage" doesn't give someone leeway to be nonsensical.
These posts on this subreddit are becoming more and more asinine and I'm regularly shocked that these are the people driving up the price of btc. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:38:26
They can't sell the block until DPR's trial is over and he is convicted. Assuming that happens, they may choose to hold the btc or sell it in an auction.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:38:57
You realize that bitcoin is a DIGITAL currency, not a VIRTUAL currency right? Do you understand the difference?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:42:52
And that's not a crash? What's your definition of one?
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:31:11
But don't you think it's common sense to do some research about who you're giving your money to? I know this is hindsight, but there have been scams like this for a long time now and it's your fault if you don't do your own research. This kind of stuff worries me because it seems like so many bitcoiners are completely naive. But yes, to hell with Realsolid. I hope this teaches you to do some research than just go with "it looks professional."
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:47:14
This sounds like freelancing. Not sure I see the difference, but open to hearing why it might be.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:11:20
I understand your sentiment for sure, but I don't think it's a matter of course. An open source payment solution would quickly end the need for 3rd party merchant solutions, like [this one]( being worked on right now.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:32:56
I'm not a bitcoin fanatic. I posted a response to you why people think there is dollar related inflation. I'm sorry you are such an angry individual. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:02:18
You charge a 4% fee? That seems kinda high. Why wouldn't I just get my payment in cash and buy btc on my own if I want?
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:31:01
Bitpay is 0% for a certain $ amount per month.

Did you just read the first sentence and then nothing else? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:29:42
And clearly you don't know what colored coins are. How about learning about something before having such a visceral reaction to it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:33:52
Most people on here want btc's value to go up. I don't think they really care about those kinds of nuances.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:45:50
Why not just do the arb on your own?
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:58:38
just curious what line of work he's in where they can do this!
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:07:54
You should! At least the ones who take btc
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:17:55
When did the double spend go through?
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:59:51
These are all fair points, but what stops a wealthy group from buying up a significant chunk of btc and making it like any other currency (by lending it out, making a market in it, etc.)?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:27:59
Why do you say that?

Japan's imports have increased recently because they started importing energy due to Fukushima not producing anymore. Historically they are not an import heavy economy, which is partly why the BOJ doesn't mind keeping the value of the Yen low.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:57:37
If you actually read the article, he's talking about 5000x upside for btc compared to gold, not $5000 per btc. He actually assumes a $1million per btc price (700 oz of gold). The title of your post is completely erroneous and misleading.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:32:37
Just because you haven't heard of him or know what he's doing makes him a noob?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:24:28
Yes, announce it to the world so it can have zero value. You do understand how arbitrage works or no?
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:04:46
Gotcha, thanks for that explanation! I guess I don't understand why Visa has to play a role. What's in it for them?

That's an interesting perspective. But why couldn't there be a utopian society with traditional currency? What about bitcoin do you think is better for that?

Another run of the mill stock trader (or stock market dabbler) that thinks bitcoins are like stocks. Nobody cares about your recommendations. The following statement highlights your lack of knowledge:

Those are great ideas. It's going to be hard to organize this sub. I don't think many are interested in anything but the price of btc. All that being said, you could get a hold of the email address of a merchant a few times a week and then broadcast that merchant's email address along with a form email that people can just cut and paste and send. Or you could have a website that people just need to log into and click "send" to send an email to the merchant. Just an idea.
I don't think there's any harm in aiming high and low for merchants. Why not email amazon, overstock, western union, mom &amp; pop pizza place, etc.? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:09:10
