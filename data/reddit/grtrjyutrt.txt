i swear i'm always on the wrong side of the curve. The crypto market hates me
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:59:07
bloody Tuesdays. Why does this always happen
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:12:04
imo bitcoin is actually old tech. Since the ledger started 9 years ago. 9 years is a long time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:41:36
Probably hard to admit this, but this is a relatively small dip compared to the huge one we've seen in Jan. 15.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:06:32
i want cheap bitcoins plox
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:28:00
That'll teach y'all not to buy early, thinking it will rebound.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:59:12
if we were to go by that logic, then bitcoin will hit 1k soon cuz there's ppl who bought for $100
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:54:45
well now its crashing to what little it ever recovered
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:06:24
hi roger ver
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:43:01
it will hit 7k soon
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:02:56
DOWN DOWN DOWN TO THE MOON!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:48:59
im gonna have a heart attack if prices go up and down like this
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:15:16
same, rip my life savings
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:08:22
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:29:01
bitcoin to the moon!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:50:04
nah it was escalator down, elevator up a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:23:38
I guess it's Asia's turn to panic sell over old news.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:30:19
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:41:15
When is btc going to make a bull break
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:43:25
I kind of suspected this would happen. Once BTC Dominance reached 50%, it would shoot past 50% leaving the alts in the dust. It happened last time btc reached 50%, hence why 50% BTC Dominance was such a strong resistance. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:21:44
So we can tip with Verge? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:22:49
Ripperoni 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:37:15
BTC Dominance at 49.5%
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:42:51
Bitcoin and Dow really took a hit today
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:58:36
bitcoin arises from the dead
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:49:41
I bet Soros sold all his bitcoin for 10k each
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:39:07
yea, there's a lack of support between 7300-7700. Last time it was at those prices, it took the elevator down and elevator up between those levels. I'm afraid to even buy the dip there because of lack of support.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:18:57
lol here we go again...
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:35:48
well, there goes support
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:29:26
BTC Dominance continues climbing!
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:58:25
bulls are tired, need to rest now... Imma let the bears take over
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:29:26
lol, at least bitcoin dominance is going back up
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:59:12
I'm curious to know as well lol
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:33:03
We need Soros to start pumping bitcoin again
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:01:03
I love how these big whales are so malicious. One last short squeeze before a huge dump. Just to fuck everyone up.

1% gain can buy me a nice breakfast at McDonalds
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:39:11
fuck, I lowkey want bitcoin to not rise this fast so I can buy more
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:13:30
my theory is that the mt. gox trustee is dumping. A week ago there was news of him moving the bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:11:41
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:57:36
i wonder what the price of bitcoin will be going into the weekend
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:44:14
are the bulls back?
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:06:52
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:06:05
This Consensus hype is boring
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:16:38
I wonder what Asia is gonna do with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:49:31
Guess a whale got tired of seeing stable prices
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:52:17
Deja vu. Why does this shit look so familiar. The last time prices were a straight line, it was at 6.5k. This must mean we are close to the bottom. Even though I think the bottom is around 7k.
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:49:37
yay I'm back into crypto again
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:57:38
whales are in control rn. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:59:16
Nice fail pump. It triggered my stop loss order almost right after triggering my stop buy order.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:07:27
What the flip the happening
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:50:21
lol bitcoin is testing support
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:54:54
yea, that was funny
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:51:06
nah, I'm not going to buy first then put a stop loss in. I'm already down too much. I have a stop buy in that I'm lowering each time bitcoin crashes, in case bitcoin gets pumped back up.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:29:42
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:43:15
lower highs as well mate
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:29:37
Where the hell is the bottom 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:23:28
Did Snoop Dogg just buy into bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:44:00
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:48:32
Y'all have any good songs to listen to while watching bitcoin crashing?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:27:26
"You pumped it up, now I'll pump it down"
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:27:48
you mean shorts
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:16:11


That's their goal - to fuck with as many people as they can before going into their direction that they favour. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:05:02
Someone must be dumping. I can't find any news relating to why bitcoin is crashing.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:33:48
I have no idea where we are going
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:55:31
well, there goes support
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:28:46
The Dow is down alot today. I guess stock market money is flowing into crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:41:17
wow everyone abandoning ship already
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:54:05
so I guess 7k was the bottom?
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:22:57
who let the bulls out, i thought the bears locked them in their cages
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:04:40
How long until bitcoin gets out of this stable flag? Been seeing a lot of these flags ever since bitcoin is starting its next bull run. 90% of the time it's stuck in flags, 10% of the time it shoots up or down instantaneously. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:21:42
At least BTC Dominance is at 41%
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:26:17
So we still have 2 more years of bear market, got it, thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:52:14
the mark of the beast
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:58:14
up or down
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:02:52
bitcoin stop triggering my stop-limit order and then going under it ffs
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:21:11
is this a bull trap?
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:09:44
I guess Tom Lee and all the bullish bitcoin analysts are going to be wrong. Bitcoin probably won't hit 25k by the end of the year. Not when the trustee is selling whenever bitcoin gets too high. I'm glad we finally found out who caused the crash to 6k because there had to be an insane amount of dumping on top of the panic that went on during the time. If the Mt. Gox news never happened bitcoin probably could have reached 25k by the end of the year. But this is seriously going to affect bitcoin for a couple of years. I'm guessing bitcoin will probably oscillate between 5k to 10k unless the trustee auctions the rest to a billionaire at a discounted price or the judge says no more needs to be sold.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:02:10
I think no one knows what's about to happen
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:39:10
ok what the hell bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:52:58
lol what a morning. It looks like bitcoin pierced its 10.5k support and was immediately dumped to its next support at 9.4k, where it bounced off. Didn't think it would go that low tbh. The last time it touched 9.4k was the last bear run at Feb. 24. If it does manage to break 9.4k then bitcoin's next support will probably be at the mid 8k.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:34:34
same thing could be said if you wake up and have a bite of toast with your mouth completely dry with 5 hrs old drool. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:14:58
when it hits support
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:04:56
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:13:51
I guess day traders right now are feasting on easy buy and sell targets
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:18:47
is bitcoin seriously going to make altcoins drop like this..?
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:23:51
It means the trustee has bitcoin on a leash for a couple of years. He has proven t be a powerful whale. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:56:09
bitcoin may have skipped leg day this morning but at night it knows he's gotta work out those chicken legs.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:17:19
who knew MT Gox could still come back and haunt us after all those years. I wonder what the MT Gox hackers have to say.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:32:51
lol I just bought at 9.7k sold at 9.8k thinking I could get it for it for a bit cheaper (after seeing how bitcoin went as low as 9.4k). Did not happen and ended up rebuying at 10k.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:10:40
get your 8k memes ready bois
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:27:47
It sucks though seeing alts crash even though they have no relation to Mt. Gox at all.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:33:44
why can't they pin more than two posts
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:23:29
at the rate and the way he is selling, it will take years until he will be done.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:08:00
lol the dow is also a couple of points higher. This cannot be a coincidence
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:19:45
is this breakout for real this time?
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:21:35
It is possible, however this might be people panic selling also. All we know is that he won't sell when bitcoin gets too low and will sell and bitcoin gets too high.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:17:24
bitcoin is not cheap enough
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:29:09
bitcoin is delaying an inevitable crash to 7k 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:04:47
not trying to spread FUD: but do people think bitcoin will continue to rise just because it has been rising for the past 7 years? It's like people assume the sun will rise every morning just because it always does. There's going to be a point where the sun will not rise.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:20:06
g20 meeting hasn't even happened and price already on the rise? Either this is inside trading or a whale is buying to cover their position. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:23:21
G20 has not happened yet
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:24:19
looks like everyone is liquidating their crypto assets. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:05:32
why is bitcoin so unpredictable
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:11:33
redditors getting their hearts crushed
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:52:20
ouch that number 6 is back
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:25:32
It's naive to think "that this "is" the new equilibrium". You got to look at the charts and figure out patterns. Right now prices are consolidating. We will see movement soon.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:48:32
I've noticed there seems to be big whales cashing out of bitcoin recently.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:59:48
It's actually kinda funny how similar bitcoin look to this chart lol: 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:33:43
looks like Asia is about to dump again
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:21:48
It did happen, just on a smaller scale. Right now we just need to watch out for the 19:00 - 22:00 dump.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:33:40
yea stocks are much safer...
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:03:45
everyone seems to be a bit panicking today 
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:02:48
lol, just rebought back my bitcoins. Guess the 19:00 - 22:00 crash isn't happening
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:12:38
ur clearly not using Quad
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:26:31
I find it harder to day trade a bullish trend like this than a bearish trend. Or at least I'm so used to trading bearish for the past few weeks that I always think everything is going to crash.
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:47:45
bitcoin was rejected at 11.5k twice, and now it's being rejected at 9k twice. This is getting sad man.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:27:16
lol right after I sell there's this huge pump. Fuck me
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:23:27
it went to 6958 at least
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:57:41
lol up and down like its nothing
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:22:23
because we can afford to buy more bitcoins at cheaper prices.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:42:47
it just bounced off twice at the support
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:01:18
lol it happened for like, what, 3 mins?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:35:41
wait till Asia wakes up
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:03:15
cya at 7k bois
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:03:26
are we out of the woods yet?
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:51:34
these whales are rinsing everyone's wallet 
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:57:13
bUy hIgH SeLL L0w, aMMi rItE?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:20:26
probably going to test 8.5k again
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:24:44
It's probably going to retest 8k again soon.
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:20:04
the dow is going to be an absolute blood bath when it opens on Monday
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:07:04
idk, guess we will have to wait an see. I could be wrong. This was the pattern the past 2 days.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:48:35
hmm I need to check the rsi
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:09:34
at this point the market seems to be waiting for another dump
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:21:13
if bitcoin tests its support again, it's probably going to break it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:26:40
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:25:26
nice try bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:20:57
looks like the stock market experienced some China FUD
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:31:48
nice FUD
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:27:50
yep, sadly.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:01:23
bitcoin recovering already?
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:07:15
good thing masturbation is free
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:25:11
no yesterday it broke out of its bear flag, now its in another one
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:25:29
bitcoin skipped leg day.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:07:02
obviously for cheap
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:02:11
lol guess the bubble popped
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:32:49
ok wth bitcoin. I was only gone an hour and bitcoin rolls over
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:12:19
rip bcash, roger needs to pump that shit again
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:23:17
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:00:36
yea ik. Traders get paid for the stress they endure. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:43:37
get your 8k memes ready bois
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:53:21
maybe next month
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:12:13
For the past few days I've noticed bitcoin getting dumped during these times:
* 10:00 - 12:00  DUMP 
* 19:00 - 22:00  DUMP
However, yesterday's 19:00 - 22:00 dump time lasted 2 hours longer, resulting in a larger dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:20:48
Now that you mention it, I do kind of see a double top. Before the 2nd peak I thought it looked like a bear flag. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:23:01
From what I've seen in the past, sideways action for this long usually results in a break downwards. If it does break upwards though, it never lasts very long.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:35:44
well would u rather have a slow ass dip like this or a large -30% dip like before?
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:34:03
10k is actually the resistance 
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:23:13
tbh I would be happy if bitcoin stays above 9k for at least 24 hrs. That's a first good step.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:05:50
Why can't the US Marshals just dump $25 Million worth of bitcoins in coinbase instead of holding an auction that costs $200,000 to participate lol?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:59:10
I'm calling it: I'm obsessed with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:25:36
everyone in this discussion thread seems to be bearish now. What happened? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:21:00
what about Ferraris?
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:06:45
well back down the shit hole
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:09:08
little rise and everyone is celebrating wat
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:16:49
what just happened
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:00:43
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:04:06
well guess bitcoin breached the bear flag
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:28:04
ur joking
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:53:06
This shit is way too predictable. Someone probably has a bot set up to liquidate their bitcoins from 19:00 to 22:00 EST. There is no way in hell a person can always dump at this exact time unless they have great time management skills
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:18:22
what if it goes down even lower
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:55:19
if i win i'll invest all into bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:35:10
hmmm I wonder if this is a start to another rally or just a trap
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:49:43
lol I knew this shit would happen
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:41:30
i wish
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:21:24
lol what is happening? Any news that caused small rise?
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:25:18
looks like its holding support for now
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:10:24
i missed out on cheap bitcoins, fuuuuccckkk
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:17:24
the walls are too strong
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:34:42
nice FUD
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:16:23
no shit sherlock
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:34:37
what a sad game
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:30:37
what do y'all think bitcoin will do next?
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:23:58
no one knows where the bottom of a bear run is. That's the problem with trading, is trying to find the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:34:16
holy hell bitcoin. Please give me time to think.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:26:16
Guess Asia chose to dump
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:42:01
bitcoin fucks with you like that
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:51:48
key thing to learn is never FOMO during a bear run
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:47:42
stock market follows bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:52:57
for those that HODL at low prices
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:35:45
will it breach 11k?
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:18:19
can't believe bitcoin didn't reach my buy order overnight at 8.5k. Sad game.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:18
what if it dips even more????!!! What if the rise was a bull trap all along????!!
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:37:08
i need that heroin tho
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:19:59
bitcoin forming another bear flag?
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:17:25
You have to invest in an amount you don't mind losing. Whether it's $100 or $1k you don't need. If you invest a very little amount then you won't look at prices all the time. If you are investing your life savings into crypto then ofc you cannot stop looking at prices.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:58:59
hmm the dow is also down as well
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:38:07
the bottom is probably when bitcoin hits 6k again, then the trustee will let bitcoin recover and it will rise. Then he will repeat the liquidation.

imo TA works more for stocks than it does for crypto. As an unregulated asset, crypto seems to depend heavily on news and whales more than regulated assets. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:24:41
bitcoin needs to break the resistance in order to be confirmed bullish. Not sure if it will, today has been awfully quiet and stable. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:45:00
holy shit, I'm not sure if I should leave a lowball overnight. This crash looks scary...

@_date: 2018-03-18 00:50:42
lol I think I'm done with crypto. Until I see the 24hr charts show a -20% then I don't think I'm buying.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:47:17
rip roger
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:37:32
looks like bitcoin just bounced off support
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:59:44
well look like bitcoin rolled over...
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:31:03
guess its Asia's turn to panic
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:33:43
lol same
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:29:56
the only thing that will probably save bitcoin is retesting the 6k support again. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:25:54

@_date: 2018-03-26 18:26:47
no need because everyone is making negative income
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:17:54
lol this CNBC FUD is funny. I'm starting think that's what caused the panic from 11.3k to 10.9k. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:43:44
sad, sad
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:51:09

these trading bots must get tired from putting buy and sell orders all the time.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:03:25
even if 6k was the bottom it won't instantly shoot up to 10k. It would have to stay at the bottom for awhile
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:09:52
the FOMO is real

@_date: 2018-03-18 21:22:20
wtf just happened
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:08:13
is this discussion thread bullish or bearish now???!! I want to get on their good side so I don't get downvoted.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:28:31
first of all what do you mean by moon? Bitcoin can't rebound to 10k in one day.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:53:55
gucci gang
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:14:09
well just as I said this, bitcoin took a big shit
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:34:23
better bring the diapers!
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:52:37
because that guy gets paid in crypto. He wants crypto to go up obviously.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:11:18
well, why can no one predict prices to be exactly the same after a year? There always have to be a certain movement by the end of the year. For example people predict bitcoin to be 25k at the end of 2018, others predict 1k. Why has no one predicted 7k by the end of the year yet?
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:12:20
I guess this is why the stock market doesn't open on the weekends, to prevent drunk people from selling off for no reason
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:50:36
Asia has been bearish, Americans have been bullish
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:16:37
I don't want to see that number 6 again pls
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:06:43
the dow is also down 
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:26:33
how long until we break out (either up or down)?
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:15:36
Any one else more concerned about why the pumps and dumps are happening at the same time everyday? I don't think it is a coincidence. There has to be a more significant meaning than just it does down at this time and rises at this time.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:17:16
what is bitcoin going to do next??!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:09:17
look at the 6h candles then
Read this: 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:30:46
I'm crying for bitcoin right now because if it goes below 7k it may never come back up
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:02:48
at this point we just have to make sure Asia doesn't wake up and dump on us. Prices for North America always fluctuate like this.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:58:07
tbh I still think bitcoin needs to go a bit lower
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:43:24
congraz to those who held during the nice 8k to 11k rally and made max profit. I didn't have the balls to hold for that long because I knew one day this day would come. Just didn't wanna get caught up in the shitstorm. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:17
lol I keep pussy out on buying the dips
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:47:24
it is
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:50:48
tbh didn't think bitcoin would rise. There has been less and less volume each day since Feb 6. I guess cuz there is no FUD that bitcoin is rising a bit. I think a lot of us are waiting for FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:51:07
sorry it's for EST. You can find the dump times yourself if you zoom into a 1 week graph.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:10:18
not so fast kiddo
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:02:13
lol trying to convince others to buy i see
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:50:30
new lows here we come!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:31:38
could this mean this rally has exhausted all possible bitcoin buyers and a crash is imminent?
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:46:40
such a boring day today. Whales are going to get frustrated and say that's enough. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:56:19

this dip isn't very volatile 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:36:29
isn't it getting sad that we need countries to confirm whether or not they're banning bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:10:24
lol, I'm starting to read FUD TAs
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:24:09
wont go to 6k overnight lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:35:51
bitcoin is life
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:51:43
C'mon guys, big turnaround to 6k tonight! Sell! Sell! Sell!
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:05:01
the thing is many of us were fooled by the large volume, thinking it was heading to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:43:35
imo it's going to be difficult for bitcoin to rise over 10k again. Too many people are looking to sell for break-even and many have bought for over 10k. There are billionaires who bought for over 10k and are in a huge loss right now.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:34:02
i wish
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:38:40
seems to have a lot of support at 6.7k
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:02
lol that was a billionaire's pathetic attempt of trying to save the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:29:59
bitcoin and tears dont mix hunny
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:03:14
what needs to happen? You need to wait years.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:57:40
Won't happen because too many people bought over 10k and want to sell for break-even
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:41:22
To be fair, it was all green the past 4 days so this was bound to happen
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:49:51
holy shit bitcoin, calm your tits
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:27:08
probably going to be another blood bath Monday
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:36:27
Friday/Saturday. There was a rise of similar magnitude. Then it ended up crashing. Now it's doing the same thing by rising slightly.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:39:23
dead cat bounce?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:12:37

@_date: 2018-03-08 23:40:52
they decide sideways!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:28:41
I believe we are close. When bitcoin was around 8-9k I predicted a bottom of 6k-7k. Imo anything lower than 5k would mean the market is actually dying and the last 3 months was pointless and caused no growth whatsoever and was just a whole pump and dump scheme for the rich to get richer.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:14:01
no, probably the trustee is liquidating again 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:49:21
well fuck, I should have put a stop loss order overnight in case this shit happens
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:25:29
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:10:58
the rise in price is mainly because there hasn't been any FUD news for awhile. Once prices get too high I'm sure wall street or some other fake news agency will pull an article full of FUD out of their asses 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:44:44
remember the good old days when we had nice rallies upwards?
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:38:31
it's called a bear flag for a reason
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:34:06
lol I figured this shit would crash overnight. It just had a really tough time breaking 9k
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:05:13
don't day trade, it's like trying to catch a falling knife
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:55:43

@_date: 2018-02-01 16:33:43
time to test 9k. Will it pass?
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:26:52
I'm just gonna buy and HODL at this point. Going in an out is not worth it lol.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:26:17

@_date: 2018-02-22 03:50:57
-&gt; looks at bitcoin prices. Sees it's almost the same price as 24 hrs ago.
Y'all know bitcoin has to test sub-10k prices sooner or later. So can we get this over with by going to Point A to Point B with little resistance please?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:49
well looks like its going downhill
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:21:57

bitcoin took a huge shit
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:52:01
was referring to the small rise 30 mins ago, not the last 18 hrs. Judging by the downvotes I guess people took it the wrong way.

to the moon pls
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:39:49

@_date: 2018-02-08 00:26:27
I told you guys China still needs to sell before the complete ban. If China doesn't sell before the ban there is no way they can get their fiat currency back. There are people in China who are trying to emigrating out because of this ban.
I know Americans and Europe have been bullish lately but y'all gotta chill.

imo I think bitcoin needs a hard reset if it wants to start a good rally (like the 6k to 11.5k rally). Right now these fluctuations are only benefiting day traders and not long term HODL'ers

@_date: 2018-02-15 22:08:07
lol wat
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:13:06
small dip and bitcoin is back on its feet. wtf
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:41:30
thanks for rebounding bitcoin. You may crash now
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:33:41
lol this always happens when bitcoin hits 11.7k
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:44:05
HODL!!!! 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:36:15
your stop buy order might be too high tbh
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:12:20
tbh if you missed out on the rise it's better to wait it out and don't buy during the hype
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:28:07
same. At the time I was thinking short-term and panic selling my butt off
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:26:58
for those that said it's not a crash. Look at it now mother fuckers.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:47:01
Just got a call from Asia. They said they are having problems with grizzly bears!
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:58:20
small rise and ppl are already celebrating smh 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:26:15
asking reddit for buying and selling advice is like asking...[insert comparison here]
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:34:34
most of us reading reddit are small investors
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:01:10
long-term Mt Gox prevents bitcoin from getting too high. It means big rallys cannot happen because the trustee will just end up dumping. It's like a ticking time bomb, no one wants to buy when dumping whales are in control, especially when you know they are selling. It scares off everyone. Unless the trustee can address a suitable alternative in getting rid of the left over bitcoins, then these big dumps are going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:47:31
its not low enough imo. There needs to be a hard reset before it can start another good rally upwards.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:32:38
dead cats love bouncing 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:14:43
It is possible it will dip down even further. It looks awfully similar to the Jan. 16 dip, where it was stable from around Jan 17 to Jan 30. The volume during the major crash on Jan 16 was relatively high aswell. After Jan 30 it started crashing again.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:45:22
back to 6k
back to 10k
choose one
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:46:13
sorry i took a big shit
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:14:02
why don't you just sell now and rebuy cheaper?
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:03:34
lol small rise and people are already celebrating? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:12:42
I'm waiting for the dump as well
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:30:27
lol back down the shit hole
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:57:11
I'm second guessing if it will rise overnight
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:38:58
lol this shit is like a rollercoaster, holly fuck
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:11:54

Has China official put crypto on their great firewall yet?

@_date: 2018-02-02 00:14:51

@_date: 2018-03-13 00:06:43
You have not said anything about whales. They have been proven to be a powerful and prime influence. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:47:56
spread the FUD!
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:46:40
Do not underestimate the amount of whales in Asia.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:23:06
this is similar to the Jan 18 - Jan 31 movement. Steady for a few weeks, then a huge decline from Jan 31 - Feb 6. Any dip could end up being a huge crash. You just have to pray when you buy it's not one of them.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:53:41
9k wall too stronk
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:59:20

This is so fucking boring. Can bitcoin just crash or do something pls.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:44:32
back to 6k pls
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:08:31
im scared

just be patient and wait for the dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:27:48
it will!! I got u fam!!
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:02:20
will the bots let us pass this time?

what did roger do this time?

i want to be a bitcoin whale when i grow up
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:12:03
on the upside: at least the volume is up
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:06:58
that's bitcoin only when it crashes. When it's bullish I believe it dips during the weekends like it did when it was rising to 20k.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:55:23
A good indication of when bitcoin hits the bottom is when it hits its "WTF" price. A price where no one thought it would go that low. Usually the price doesn't stay at the bottom for very long and bounces back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:54:47
well back down the shit hole
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:36:54
wheres the daily discussion thread? :(

too much resistance

lambos suck, i want a tesla roadster so I can travel to the moon too
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:33:20
you will find out sooner or later 
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:39:29
ouch, bitcoin getting BURNED again
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:32:54
i missed the dip aaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:23:34
ahhhh the breakout
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:35:54
I think your times are wrong. The next potential dump is around 12:00 am utc (7:00 pm est). So roughly 1.5 hrs from now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:05:00
there are people who bought at an ATH
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:34:54
lol I profited from that little rebound
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:08:30
I don't see any support until 6k
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:10:16
its a trap!
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:49:07
they thought bitcoin was going to moon after it hit the supposedly "bottom"
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:07:48
with that kind of volume it might as well mow my lawn
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:12:59
kinda sad to see how big whales like the trustee is basically controlling the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:45:20
who let the bulls out
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:47:35
lol what's up with bitcoin doing 180 degree turns lately
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:54:17
we need crashes like this more often tbh, it make things fun!
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:35:26
anger does not lead to FOMO. Anger leads to people EXITING the market and converting all their digital assets to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:16:49
honestly who needs tether when you got bitcoin as the stable altcoin   /s
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:02:49
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:13:46
At this point the best trading is no trading. Take the day off. For the average trader it's too easy to get burned right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:00:54
I don't like how it's testing the same price over and over again. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:31:42
things are gonna get ugly when Asia wakes up
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:10:53
fuck, I needed that mini rise to profit. Was afraid the shit would continue crashing and I would have to take a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:15:05
cya at 10k bois
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:56:47
i knew this shit would crash. All the little rises were deceiving AF but also had very little volume. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:47:47
ha, not so fast
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:52:09
night, night don't let the bitcoins bite
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:06:14
well that will teach me a lesson to not get greedy and try to sell for $10 higher lol.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:16:22
looks like bitcoin skipped leg day
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:50:26
nah, no indication that I can see
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:36:48
anyone else lowkey want bitcoin to continue crashing. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:21:16
I'm going to say 6k - 7k is the absolute bottom. It seems reasonable enough of a guess. Bitcoin did grow, and after all it's been through, I don't see it going lower than 7k. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:19:37
It's a story about an exchange printing money that they claim is backed up by every USD. This printed money is called USDT. If every USDT is not backed up by a USD then bitcoin is being artificially pumped, since you can buy bitcoin with USDT.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:56:13
well, all alts are doing very poorly. If that's any indication.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:44:21
what are you trying to say? That we are heading towards 3k?
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:33:34
calm before the storm
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:45:43
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:31:53
ayyy 11k breached, now it's all gonna start caving down. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:50:43
it means people aren't making any memes
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:37
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:47:35
I'm exhausted trying to keep up with bitcoin prices. Idk how traders do this.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:13:11
bitcoin is in a bear flag atm
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:18:08
great, why is there always FUD when I buy and when I don't buy there's no FUD
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:03:55
bitcoin staying strong. But for how long?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:04:18
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:56:23
it will go lower, market is still unease
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:09:10
ouch, the bull looks exhausted. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:22:03
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:50:05
volume is low
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:44:12
now that I look at it, it looks somewhat correlated 
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:58:25
BTC Dominance continues climbing. Let's see if it can hit 50%
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:29:20
i missed the dip
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:22
ver is
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:27:14
wrong. You don't make money unless you sell, same thing goes with losing money. And we cannot all sell at once.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:52:21
well looks like bitcoin broke 9k lol
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:51:27
It's only nice to hold during a bull market. I wouldn't say we are out of the woods yet though. Right now I would sell high and just put a stop-buy order slightly below my sell just in case it does go up. I still think bitcoin needs to dip more but we will see.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:45:39
pAnIC sElL
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:53:26
It means bitcoin is not out of the woods yet. The Inverse Head And Shoulders was supposed to signal a reversal, only to reverse like $400 and slump back down today, which is a bad sign.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:42:19
RIP, Tether is the only coin in red today.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:26:23
This crash actually has a reason behind it though.
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:06:23
sorry I meant the dip we had an hour ago lolo
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:46:31
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:41:09
whales give the best April fools jokes
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:12:17
so this is how bitcoin will bottom out - with sideways movement
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:09:33
It really hurts missing out on the rise like this. Unfortunately I had to sell all my crypto to pay my taxes sadly.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:55:36
weed bro
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:27:30
how long until we reach the bottom? I'm sure we are 1k-2k away from it. Everything right now is moving so slow, bear flag after bear flag. I haven't seen two consecutive green days for weeks now.
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:50:34
shower thought: Are these automated whale bots programmed by millionaires (which assumes millionaires know how to code) or do millionaires hire programmers to program these bots for them?
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:29:03
yea, my virginity.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:14:52
People who tether up will just end up buying for around the same price they sold. It's no biggy. Even if it doesn't go lower, it's alot less stressful than holding when prices aren't moving and/or dipping a little. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:38:43
These pumpers and dumpers are playing with our emotions - "hehe, I'll make I fuck up all the sheep who bought in" -&gt; dumps
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:45:57
nice TA
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:16:32
lol reading through these old memes: 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:00:58
Imo $7k is already too low of a consolidation from 7.5k. Anyways that's out of the question now looking at the price.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:35:29
I don't think Chinese tariffs and trade wars have anything to do with bitcoin, that's only with stocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:08:48
did you read the Mark Karpelès AMA?
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:56:42
What was the purpose of the little dip from 6.95k to 6.8k before the spike to 8k? It seems rather odd and totally did not expect that. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:44:47
its bought btw, not brought
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:38:10
lol bitcoin triggering everyone's stop-limit orders
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:32:02
so much sideways movement
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:34:17
imagine if you wake up tomorrow and prices still stay like this, that would be legendary. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:42:24
9k is the real resistance test
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:03:17
Anyone else bored AF. This has got to be one of the tightest price range bitcoin has ever been. If you zoom out its been like this for half a month. Everyday I wake up anticipating price movement. Only the alts seem to be benefiting while bitcoin is stable. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:25:26
oh my gosh, just realized Soros and Buffett are both 87 years old. Why is Soros investing in bitcoin at such an old age. The stress is not worth it and these guys aren't going to spend it all before they die of old age.

Anyone know why bcash is on the rise?
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:19:10
bitcoin chose this path
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:22:46
How many times do we have to pump and dump up and down $200
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:25:53
nah, look at the timing of the crash and the reddit post
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:40:15
ouch, everyone's stop sell orders going off
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:55:48
i don't see any breakout or any big buy volume, just seems like a lack of sell volume that's creeping the price up.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:36:28
lol someone tries to dump and the bots buy it back up to the exact same price wtf
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:11:36
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:27:57
Are we breaking out????!!!
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:17:00
in regulated banks
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:59:22
Not to be a party pooper, but whatever momentum bitcoin had the last few days is gone. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:01:47
in an apocalyptic world, my friend
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:31:07
there's probably a huge buy wall at 6k
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:06:36
I have my stop-buy-limit order just above resistance. Let's see if we break it. So far, prices are back to what they were this morning, which is a start. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:27:05
quiet day today for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:16:15
wow bitcoin broke out of the bear flag faster than I expected tbh
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:40:16
that twitter account belongs to bcash
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:39:53
ouch, that dump was quick and slick

exclusive insider redditor-only information 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:37:40
bulls are really trying, but will it be enough?
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:40:32
guess i was right
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:32:23
because 6.6k has absolutely no support. It has proven in the past. The next support is 6.4k - 6.5k then 6k.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:43:23
Anyone else feel bad for John McAfee? I'm reading his bio and it said his "personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million" because of "the effect of the global financial crisis and recession on his investments".
It sounds like he's one of those millionaires who got unlucky and lost everyone. Now he's into crypto and shrilling about various ICOs.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:39:15
Soros is probably laughing his ass off from this rise. It's a shame his older brother was not as successful as him and ended up dying early.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:27:04
taking a shit brb
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:22:51
bitcoin needs a higher high or people will start panicking 
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:33:09
I heard he shorted and crash the pound not too long ago.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:20:32
thats a good one
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:14:21
It's not fine. Since it failed to break resistance, it's going to break support.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:45:26
You don't need to set up a wallet if you are not holding long-term. Just open a coinbase account and ask them to send the bitcoin to your coinbase's bitcoin wallet address, then you can withdraw for fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:42:52
l0l why are ppl buying bcash? A hard fork will still makes it trash.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:59:13
Remember those who said bitcoin died? lol
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:30:59
fuck the bulls
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:00:35
that's funny. Crypto would not be as high as it is right now without Asia.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:15:59
it's not. Imo it adds even more FUD after reading all his posts.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:44:38
Holy fuck, thank god my stop buy limit order filled. I specifically put it $50 higher because I knew if it ever reached this price, it would be a huge rise.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:09:20
lol that pump out of no where
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:23:54
probably Soros bought in
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:46:15
i wish
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:29:34
The reason why bitcoin isn't moving much is because everyone is buying their asses off with altcoins

Funny how it take 2 hrs for bitcoin to crash and 3 days to recover 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:51:50
666, the mark of the beast
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:25:57
USDT is like real USD you pay on coinbase. The coin/coin pairs are technically crashing as well. You just don't see it because every coin is down the same percentage.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:42:48
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:22:45
Holy hell, these dumps out of no where. I was looking at some alts, then I check back to bitcoin and BAM it dropped $200 instantly

tbh bitcoin was close to breaking 7.5k. It ran out of steam and fell short.

then we got to start saying the opposite: What is the opposite of "going to the moon"? Going to the ground?

better to put it into alts

lol bitcoin dropped because Mt Gox CEO did an AMA on reddit, would you look at that rofl

this $150 pump doesn't seem very convincing.

I think alt season is back again. If bitcoin starts crashing than BTC dominance will go back up again.

I've never seen bitcoin price stay this straight for a long time. It's as straight as a horizontal line, it's a straight as my gender

The real test is trying to get past 7.5k, which was the previous high. If it doesn't get past 7.5k, then it's another failed attempted like last time, and so many other times.

@_date: 2018-04-16 02:20:38

@_date: 2018-04-12 13:49:19
Anyone else think maybe Soros bought in lol

I've been posting on different subreddits lately. Sorry if I have posted here for awhile.

Would you rather be a prisoner in jail for a year and come out being a billionaire for the rest of you life or only a millionaire? Honestly that guy is richer than Roger Ver now. At age 32, people die trying to become a billionaire at such a young age.

whoa, time really flies when you're having fun engaging in bitcoin/crypto discussions.
