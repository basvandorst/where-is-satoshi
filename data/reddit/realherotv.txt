You should start checking the price now. It's falling. 
Just to say that there's no need to be rude. There are different ways to trade of course but Technical Analysis is not always bad. It's usually giving pointers where the price may or may not head to. Of course Fundamental and Technical Analysis both can fail, they are not 100% safe proof!

Good for you! I'm overall bullish on these markets. Dips are when I buy usually more

Here's message for you who were doubtful. Where the price is at right now? It's going down. Market capitalization is dropping already.

Why Gemini got rejected by SEC? Simply because it is not regulated exchange unlikely CBOE which has higher chance to be approved.
