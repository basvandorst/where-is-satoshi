If this were true there would be literally hundreds of thousands of SARs filed each day, making the SAR system totally useless.
Seriously do you have any idea how many small businesses send multiple $2k transactions on a daily basis?  Like the tire shop around the corner, construction companies, etc etc etc.
A SAR has to be about something *suspicious*.

No, it's because the IRS only has three years to start these sorts of actions -- unless they can show criminal fraud and want to involve the DOJ, which is a lot more work for them.

Assuming there is a "next contract".  What if the CFTC yanks their license?  The existing contracts run out to expiration and there aren't any more.
And don't forget that circuit breaker idiocy.  Because of that braindamage there's no guarantee that selling the current contract and buying the next one has the effect of rolling your position over.
Last but not least, nobody guarantees you the ability to actually buy or sell BTC at the expiration price.  I will be astounded if we don't see ridiculous BTC price gyrations occuring one minute before each expiration.  3:00pm-4:00pm London Time is going to become "daily BTC manipulation hour".

If people want bitcoin but don't have it, why would they wait for it to drop 10% before buying it?

Absolutely wrong.
With the exception of Chinese Yuan every futures market has at least one exchange offering delivery settlement.
To have an asset for which there are cash-settled futures markets but **zero** delivery-settled markets is unusual and not normal at all.

Growing pot or any other indoor plant has a pretty distinctive power usage pattern that is very different from the "full blast all the time" consumption of bitcoin mining -- plants know what season it is by how long the daylight part of the day is.  Nobody's going to confuse one with the other.

How, exactly?  This is not a deliverable contract.
If the BRR is consistently way below the actual (OTC) price you can't exploit that to get cheap coins when the contract expires and sell them for a profit on the OTC market.  Because you won't get cheap coins.  You won't get *any* coins.  You'll get a wad of cash that the BRR people say is "what you deserve".
Without delivery there is no mechanism to transmit arbitrage pressure.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:53:06
TL;DR: lots of circular reasoning.
