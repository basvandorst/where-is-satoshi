It's odd that the article says "according to BTCPay, the service would be a good choice for you if: you currently use BitPay as a payment processor but worry about their [**commitment**]( to Bitcoin in the future" and links to an article announcing that BitPay will process other blockchains. 
Then in the next bullet it says BTCPay is for you if "you want to support another currency than those offered by BitPay."

What if he needs a refund from the merchant or was overcharged?

Generally it's not a good idea to say you're taking financial bribes to bias your speech to the government.

Really? That is part of a larger joke. If you take it seriously, the joke is on you.

I'm there. He's said bcash a number of times. I can't help you if you aren't able to understand a joke.

Yes you can make the comparison. You just can't expect people to take it seriously when it's a bad one or it's dishonest.

Yes, there is no corporate entity controlling Bitcoin so don't compare what Bitcoin Cash did to making a knockoff of Mcdonalds. Totally different.
