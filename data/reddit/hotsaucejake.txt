Haha me neither.  I had to host the files myself and implement your changes.  That would have saved some time :)
Also, thanks for the tip!  I'll match it and pay it forward!

I think someone moved it RIGHT before I did.  I saw 20 mBtc available, I tried to sweep it and then it was unavailable.  Still made me feel good about solving it :)

My dream is coming true!  
I want to create a "brew" house.  Coffee and Beer on tap and it's all self-serve.  For the beer you could cut people off after so many ounces/hour with software.  Pay in bitcoin for instant pours on tap.  The self-serving will make it cheaper to sustain and as a result the prices for beer and coffee will be cheaper.
But the kegerator build is for fun and getting my friends interested in beer (I'll donate bitcoins of course so they can drink for free at my place).

I'm building a Bitcoin kegerator!
You'll be able to pay for beer (by the ounce) with bitcoin.  Once purchased, the user can pour beer from the tap.  The flow control and bitcoin POS will be powered by a RaspberryPi.

I bought a domain and will start posting to it soon a walkthrough of my build and how to implement it yourself.
It'll be very similar to [kegberry]( but my own implementation.  I wanted a hands-on project that I could call my own.
I have a dual tap so I'll post my solutions to monitoring/controlling multiple taps.  I'm PB&amp;Jealous of your 4 tap build...

Forgive my typo, I'm drinking bitcoin right now...

Logic like that not only extends the "debate" but is also the reason we're having this debate.

Raspberry Pi is capable of this.  ~$35

It's safe to assume that Bitcoin has succeeded in this scenario and transactions rival that of Visa.  From the [Bitcoin Wiki]( Visa averages around 2,000 transactions per second.  That's 1.2 Million transactions (on average) every 10 minutes or block.  
I think you can find a nice profit on 1.2 Million transactions every 10 minutes from only 21 Million of something.  And fees are still cheap to the users.
Perhaps my miners will be powered by solar panels on the moon so I can turn a bigger profit with fees.

What IDE is this?

Imagine if there were such an open network for media.  The artist themselves (i.e. music labels, film producers, etc...) could upload a verified file(s) and make money with no middle-men.  Distribution of the funds would be even more clear for actors/directors/etc... if they are to receive a percentage of the proceeds.
Similar to a Spotify model, but open.  The price should reflect what the average person spends on entertainment (i.e. a few bits for songs, a few more bits for movies).

Technical details:  When you click save, your notepad is encrypted by your passphrase using AES256 encryption.  Then a SHA256 hash is run on your passphrase.  The hash and encrypted notepad is then sent to our server for storage.  We have no way of knowing your passphrase, and have no way of decrypting your notepad.  No data is ever stored in your browser, so when you close the website, no trace is left behind.
How is this provable?

I think a protocol based on money will increase innovation, thus removing these bottlenecks.  There's a lot to gain with fixing problems tied to money.
The thing I worry about most, is that because it is money, it will constantly be under attack (cracking cryptography, double spend, new methods not yet discovered).  My hope is that with it being an open community, it will get the most attention to detail and security.

I think they'll help devices connect to the Internet of Things.  Your phone or refrigerator might be on the blockchain one day.

Inadvertently, I think this is good news for Bitcoin.  I think a lot of people may switch over to a centralized cryptocurrency for reasons of misguided 'trust.'  In any event, which history shows it always will, some negative action will occur within this system.  Over time I think people will see the light and more easily switch over into the Bitcoin economy.  
Bitcoin doesn't have any competitors outside of duplication.  Meaning, centralization has been the problem all along - decentralize it and, well, you have Bitcoin...

Not a scam.  I receive a % of my paycheck in bitcoin sent to *my own wallet* with this service.
