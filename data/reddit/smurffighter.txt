In many countries the government DOES NOT control money.  I don't know why people say this.  The federal reserve in the United States is NOT controlled by the government in any way no matter what the appearance is they'd like to you to have.  They ARE exceedingly expert at managing appearances.  Guys like Ben Lawsky write the laws FOR the banks in the Fed.  It's such a fucking scam.
You can't publicly say all this though.  For some reason, the truth is equated to tin hattery now.

Dick.  Why is this subreddit so full of dicks?  Banks ARE NOT antithetical to bitcoin.  Online wallets are a type of bitcoin and there can be many more services.

Good thing there was a god damn block chain then huh?  Thanks for showing EXACTLY what I mean.  Here's one source:

I stopped voting 4 years ago.  It's absurd.  All candidates serve the same masters.  You only have perception of choice.  It's a hard pill to swallow but it is the truth.

Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:36:33
Huh??  What the fuck does this even mean.  This is just stupid.  I agree with you op. 
Folks are always trying to one up people here.  Op is right.

I'm not filling out shit for a cup of fucking coffee.  I don't have to do it with dollars and I'll be damned if I'm doing it with bitcoin.  Fuck the police.

There are plenty of places that trade pesos for bitcoins.  Also the presence of Bitcoin in the US is negligible.  
This is likely an asshole Buttcoiner trying to be...an asshole.  Go figure.

Government doesn't control the money.  They don't create it or manage it.  
It's easier to tax bitcoin.  Anyone can pay in cash and leave no trail.  Happens ALL THE TIME.  With bitcoin, there is an electronic trail.  If you don't pay your taxes, they shut down your business.

That will NEVER happen.  The software and cryptography are nowhere near as important as the blockchain.  Unless you think you can somehow scam millions of copies of an extremely over-analyzed ledger for years.  In short, not going to happen.

I agree with you.  There seems to be an element now to this subreddit that doesn't want to promote.  I believe many of them are against bitcoin.  
With 70%+ of the United States still not knowing what bitcoin is, we MUST promote.

So...correct me if I'm wrong but you're going to attempt to get a bunch of money from various groups to pay for commercials you need to run for pitching yourself as the new governor.  Do you not see a problem with that in itself?

Probably not a million but some.  It's going to take a long while for people to trust or even care about bitcoin--ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY LOUD MOUTH ASSHOLES AGAINST IT.
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:27:39
Hey man, it might work.  It's hard to build trust though.  That will be your biggest problem.

He's talking about panic selling.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:00:39
Jesus Christ, it's happened already.  Bitcoin is just a damn ledger you bunch of panicky Petes.  The fix is to just go back to the correct ledger.  Bitcoin can have a shitton of bugs and everything will be fine.

Volatile as compared to what?  You seem to think all places have a perfectly stable currency or commodity they can simply trade for.
