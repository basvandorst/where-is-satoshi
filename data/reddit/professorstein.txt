No, it's factually a lie.

Yeah, that's my point. There's no winners here, just degrees of losing. I hope you follow your own advice.

Listen. I debated not making this post because I'm sure I'll be crucified, but Jesus Christ please do one smart thing today.
It's going to rubberband. People are going to tell you that everything is fine, that you can totally make a bunch of money. 
When btc hits 17k, or peaks around there at end of day, fucking sell. Get back what you put in and please, please go invest that money in a safe, sane market that cannot literally melt to nothing overnight like btc. Get your fucking money back and get off the stupid fucking boat before you are losing tens of thousands when the bubble really does pop.
There is a reason experts are paid a lot of money for advice and handling of investments for people. Do not play with stuff you literally cannot possibly be qualified for.

None of that directly overrides an account setting. Knock that shit off

Huh. This might be the first time I get to properly report something to the admins for "breaking Reddit"
P.S. You're not really supposed to do that. Your wishes do not override my account settings
Edit: confirmed with an admin this is being worked on and has to be changed.

His policies are only acceptable of that are in compliance with Reddit policy. Right now, they are not. Disabling the functionality of auto hidden threads is not allowed to be done by moderators.
