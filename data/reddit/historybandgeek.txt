and below it could be the start of...?

take a breath, know that this market will always have buying opportunities, now is certainly not your last chance to get in haha. I anticipate a correction then the market will decide bullish or bearish from there. take a breath 
EDIT: Also, always buy on GDAX, if you're not familiar with limit orders/how an exchange works, I would suggest learning before getting too much into crypto

Thanks for the info - see the link below, around the 6 min mark, I really liked what this guy had to say about the crash and when to buy in/what to wait for. Do you agree - I don't think he went quite 90 days, it was just short of a month of low volatility in the 2014 cycle (I think he was pointing out the buy signal towards the end of may).
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:29:39
Wait for reduction in volatility. Follow the 2014 crash charts and you’ll see a period that’s quite stable before building again.

Can you explain what you wait for as far as stabilization? I’m waiting for that too but my parameters are not well defined.

Great, good to hear, but the breath will probably still help  and do be prepared for it to go lower (or higher or stay the same!) from your 6k price :-)

thats... thats a quarter of a BBBBillion... we could buy all the superbowl ads with that...

But I'm pretty sure Howard Marks is blind without his glasses...

Haha - I was making a reference to minority report. Do yourself a favor and watch the opening sequence which contains this reference :-).

I've always been interested in playing a little with a bot - I've done research but it quickly goes out of my league. Would you mind sharing your experience/setup either here or PM? I'd love to hear more about that.
Also, not too bummed on being stopped out no with it being below, but I think I might throw in 100 or so just to participate in the craziness of gold this week.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:42:19
why do you say that? interested...
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:26:29
Whoa that sounds cool! Is this something you'd share or consider giving pointers on. I have what I feel to be a moderately advanced spreadsheet keeping history of all my trades but I don't think I could have this type of functionality in it - I'd need a lot more googling!!

Though I do plan on doing it, and am happy to do so for my country, the 10+ people I know personally in crypto are not planning on taxes playing any part in their april plans :-0
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:41:58
why do you say that? interested...
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:43:34
and took out my freaking stop-loss by 1$!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:15:44
Though cyrpto is still pretty wild west. One in particular has gone to great lengths to use small deposits to multiple anonymous exchanges, which the bank will very likely not report, and using an anonymous bitcoin debit card. I actually think he'll escape the law for now, but is definitely breaking it.
How do you plan on doing taxes? There's a couple online services that supposedly take all your orders and calculate gains/losses/taxable etc - that's the route i'll go. Of course I probably won't think about it until april! ;-)

I did the same this morning, but tight stop loss and little leverage.
