Puerto Rico is a good example.  You are hindered by not having electricity or an internet connection - on an island.  You’d have to wait that out.  However, anywhere else where there’s mobility you can’t beat Bitcoin.  Here’s another thought (emphasize thought) scenario - you carry $10,000 in gold/cash in your backpack for about a week, pretend your house is destroyed.  I’ll keep an encrypted $10,000 wallet.dat on a thumbdrive in my backpack for the same amount of time.  Your backpack I wouldn’t let out of my sight.  No one even comes near it.  My backpack, not so much.   I’ll bet sometime this year you’ll start to see some stories come out where someone loses everything they own in a natural disaster, but still is able to get their crypto back.

I wouldn’t qualify “trading” as German soldiers forcibly removing gold fillings and every item of value from Jews.  However, God forbid if anything similar happens again, and I’m (or all members of my family) detained, there’s a store of value anywhere an internet connection exists.  Try that with any other store of value.  I can destroy every wallet I have and know that other trusted people can retrieve it without consequence or concern.  Gold?  One hit and it’s gone forever.  
Answer about the hurricane?  If I had enough?  Expedia and cheapair.com accept bitcoin directly.  My family and I are on the first flight out.  I can cash out safely on US soil.  Try that with gold, lol.  You wouldn’t make it out the front door unless you had a lot of weapons or trusted friends with weapons.   Don’t even bring up how useless gold would be during any SHTF scenario.
I wanted to add a simple challenge for people that believe gold will good during a disaster:  pick any small, inconvenient event.  A snowstorm maybe, a temporary loss of electricity.  I challenge anyone to take any amount of gold and attempt to buy something with it.  A tank of gas, some milk, batteries, anything.  It won’t happen.  First, the amount of trust it would take to believe your gold wasn’t fake would be incredible.  Second, are you going to pay someone with a $1200 gold coin and expect change?  What are they going to do, shave some off and give it back?  Gold is the most useless item to have in any disaster scenario.

I remember watching interviews with tsunami survivors, hurricane victims, and people that barely escaped tornadoes.  All of those families said “thank god we had our gold, if it wasn’t for that - we’d be screwed!”  
Ok, after you’re done laughing, please realize that gold has very little use in “SHTF” scenarios.  
It’s not divisible.  You have a 1oz gold coin, good luck splitting it up to pay for gas/food/whatever.  
It requires a significant amount of trust.  You can buy some pretty good fake coins.  People won’t know what’s real or fake in a crisis, and they certainly wont have the means to test it.
It’s heavy.  It’s more of an argument with the silver bugs, but carrying a lot of heavy metal in a bug-out backpack isn’t smart or even feasible.  I’ll tell you what.  You carry around $20,000 in gold on you for a month (in case of natural disaster) and I’ll carry around my Trezor for the same amount of time.  Game?
It really has no other use other than being ornamental.  It has great conductive properties, but since your scenario is “no electricity”, that single property is moot.  
It’s a single point of failure.  With my paper/metal wallets, I have many secure duplicates in several places in the world.  If I literally lose everything i have, I can have all my crypto back by just going to one of these spots.  The gold gets gone, it’s gone for good.

So I can go out in public and claim that I had an affair with Scarlett Johansson, in a $5000/night hotel, which she paid for on her credit card.  If anyone asks me to verify the story, I’ll whine about “muh privacy”.  Got it.

There are currently two competing chains for new buyers/speculators to buy "Bitcoin".  There are now 42 million coins in play when someone decides to buy a Bitcoin product (Core or Cash).  By the end of this year, there might be 63 million coins as a pool to choose from, each fork saying they are the true version of Bitcoin.  
This is exactly the opposite of what made "Bitcoin" appealing years ago.  You're right, nothing lasts forever, this act of forking and claiming "X is the real Bitcoin" will eventually kill it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:23:28
Gold/silver won't work in a disaster.  Imagine trying to buy gas/food/medicine with 1oz gold or silver coins.  First thing is that you'd have to convince shop keep that it's legit.  Second thing is that, especially with gold, it's not divisible.  Are you going to hand over a $1400 gold coin for one tank of gas?  Third, you attempt to show that you're carrying any kind of PM coins, you're getting robbed.

You are confusing cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency calling themselves "Bitcoin".
If they co-exist like Jews and Muslims, you're going to have a bad time.
I sound like a realist.  The rarity of having 21 million Bitcoins was built for a reason.  Every fork calling itself Bitcoin {insert snappy word here} ultimately damages the Bitcoin space.  
So when you see a "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sign in a storefront, are we to ask "which fork"?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:33:11
Kinda obvious bias based on the phrasing of each option, but hmm ok...whatever.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:01:24
Bzzt.  Wrong answer.  Bitcoin Cash is the obvious better solution, and will only be matter of time before squashing Core... and I'm talking out my ass.  Who knows which "Bitcoin" will prevail?  I know for a fact that I have 2x the amount of Bitcoin product, which is now a dilution.  I expect once free markets take over, and just watch, both will be around $1000.  Much less than $2700+$400(estimate), right?  But I have double Bitcoin?!?!? Air-drop free money amirite?  It's dilution of the Bitcoin brand.  When the next hard-fork happens later this year, just think! You'll have three sets of diluted Bitcoins to track!
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:51:52
That's crazy.  You have to sell sometime.  Better recommendation: never sell everything.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:15:40
Or the combined value of your holdings decrease when the combined value of a diluted "Bitcoin product" is less than your original Bitcoin pre-fork.  You're spot on though.

@_date: 2017-08-03 23:30:16
So which do you consider the "true" Bitcoin?  Because there are, right now, two competing Bitcoins.  I have X amount of Bitcoin Core, and the same amount of Bitcoin Cash.  Twice the "Bitcoin brand", unless one completely destroys the other.  There may be two competing Bitcoins for many years to come.  Another hard fork may be coming soon.  I'll own those as well once it's forked.  
There is an obvious dilution of of the Bitcoin brand, regardless if you understand it or not.
Edit: same amount of each Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:24:13

@_date: 2017-08-04 00:29:01
Can you answer?  Which is the "true" Bitcoin?  
There's no compliment here.  If you haven't noticed, there's a civil war going on.  You can't just name Dash "Bitcoin-dash" unless I have twice as many "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin" is in the name.  None of these alts you mention are planning eventually to be the "true" Bitcoin.
Ok, by your "enough wealth in the world" theory, you've just described quantitative easing and the endless creation of "money".  
I'm invested in alts.  I've had litecoin and dogecoin for a long time.  They are much different and don't aspire to be a Bitcoin replacement.  
Go ahead and answer which is the "true" Bitcoin.  Whichever one you choose, I'll tell you you're foolish and you'll lose money.  Instant dilution because the best answer (for now) is to keep both.

Think about it this way: 
When electric service made its way to people’s homes, only a small portion of the privileged few had it.  Places like Boston, Philadelphia, NYC were some of the firsts.  We are, at this moment, the privileged few that are replacing our gas lights with electricity.  To the rest of the population, these magic wires bringing light are a scary phenomenon.  That’s where we are now with Bitcoin.  
In short, Bitcoin is still cheap.  If it’s easier to think of it as $7 a mBTC (milli-Bitcoin), then rationalize it that way.

In my recent experience, Whole Foods will not type in GCs at the register any longer.  This is a problem, because Gyft/eGifter gives you a partial bar code that will not scan at the register.  After doing a bit of digging, Whole Foods GCs has the number that appears above the bar code, but the bar code has that plus eight digits.  Most likely a counter-fraud number.  Anyways, if you're nice to a manager they can type it in, but it's gotten harder and harder.  Gyft/eGifter needs to incorporate the entire gift card number into the app barcode.

It’s interesting when people bring up the “slow confirmation” and don’t realize what involves a successful double-spend.  
Not saying that confirmation times couldn’t be better, but it’s certainly not as much of an issue as you suggest.  A Bitcoin payment broadcast is under a second.  If bad actors want to attempt a double-spend, they might as well report a fraudulent purchase on their credit cards.  Same net effect.  
I tried out a Bitcoin ATM about a month ago.  Small amount, $200 withdrawal.  Waited for the cash the same amount of time as a regular ATM.  No confirmation.

I think most people would tell you that it's almost impossible to time this market, or any market.  Unless you need that money for an emergency, weather the storm.  Wait a minute.  It's down like 7%.  This is like a shpritz.  Wait until you wake up and see red 30%-40%.  
However, I can tell you that bitstreet's got the smart plan.  Buy a little, spend a little, save what BTC you can.  
I remember crashes from $100 down to $40 and people were losing their shit.  "I'm out!", "Bitcoin is over", etc.  If any of those people stayed the course, they're in really good shape now.  Think of them.  It's quite possible that this could go to 5k, 10k, who knows.  Years ago, I never thought it would go over $300.
Best of luck, if you start to doubt Bitcoin watch a couple Andreas Andropoulous videos.

And the geek shall inherit the earth...
[II. Temples of Syrinx]
We've taken care of everything
The trolls you hear, the reddits you read
The hash rates that give pleasure to your eyes
It's one for all and all for one
We work together, common pools
Never need to wonder how or why
We are the Priests of the Temples of Hijinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed basements
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Hijinx
All the gifts of Satoshi are held within our walls
Look around at this world we've made
Bitcoins are our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Neckbeard
Oh, what a nice, contented world
Let the t-shirts be unfurled
Hold the paper wallets proudly high in hand
We are the Priests of the Temples of Hijinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed basements
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Hijinx
All the gifts of Satoshi are held within our walls
[III. Discovery]
What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth some heat
It's got wires that vibrate and give 2nd degree burns
What can this thing be that I found?
See how the fans sing like a sad heart
And joyously screams out it's pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or whirring that fall gently like rain
I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see it's light
Let them all make their own alt-coins
The Priests praise my name on this night
[IV. Presentation]
I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an recent miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my fan blades whirring
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Yes, we know, it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ASICs now
The world is doing fine
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this currency
Just think what we might do
Listen to my fans whirring
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
Don't annoy us further!
We have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the Plan!
[V. Oracle: The Dream]
I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?
I stand atop my basement stair
An angry wife confronts me there
She leads me on saying "Its too loud!"
Through Wheel of Fortune, Big Brother
I see the works of gifted hands
That that used to make dinner, mow the lands
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes
They forced us out not too long ago
The nagging race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down...
Home to change!
[VI. Soliloquy]
The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams...
Just think of what my life might be
In a world without mining like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood...
... Spills over...

I consider myself old enough to give this advise.  Unless you can sell that car for a profit, or use it to marry someone with a future - don't buy it.  The insurance, the interest on car payments, the inevitable repair bills, etc etc.  Its not worth it, especially when you're young enough to weather risky investments like crypto-currency.  
Looking back over the last 20+ years, I spent a lot of money on things like two new cars - not fancy but not cheap either.  Investments in most of the things i was interested in would have netted ridiculous gains.  I had some money in Netflix back when they just mailed out DVDs.  I could have done more if it wasn't for the car and insurance payment.  Google, yep.  Amazon, yep.  Martha Stewart Living and WWE? Ok, we can't be right all the time.

I've done pretty well mining ETH and BTC (long ago) with video cards.  I would never use a laptop.  It's a little bit of outlay, but you could patch together a decent rig for $1,000-$2,000.  Once the laptops burned out it's done.  If a card craps out, you can usually replace a fan or junk the card.  The rest of the rig works.

If I remember correctly, salt and spices were at one time just as valuable as gold, and not all that long ago.  The last 100 years had more technological advancements then the 4900 years before it.  
I'm hedging my bets that someone or some government will be able to strip away or add one electron to make gold way before a global grid collapse or global EMP.
There's a great Twilight Zone episode called "The Rip VanWinkle Caper".  Anyone holding gold and not paying attention to crypto should watch it.

Constant attempted take-overs will eventually destroy not only Bitcoin, but all crypto.  You can see it now with BCH/BSV.  It’s a joke at this point.  There won’t be any legitimacy to the brand “Bitcoin” if there’s eventually hundreds of copies.  All it does is cause confusion and make crypto look like a huge con game.  I have no problem with any alt, just as long as “Bitcoin” is not in the name.  
I wish at some point there was a purposeful, directed attack on BCH and BSV, disrupt their chain.  Create all the coins you want, let the market decide.  However, don’t intentionally confuse the market into thinking BCH or BAB or BSV or whatever is Bitcoin.

I remember people telling me that :
"No one will want to tie up their phone line just to check e-mail when they can just write a letter"
"No one will want to type out their credit card info into a box on a screen."
"No one will want to stream movies over a slow connection like this"
"No one will want to buy someone else's used stuff on-line" (eBay)
Ahh, the '90s.  I'm glad I paid attention through them.  The similarities between Bitcoin and '90s internet are so many it's laughable.  Your comment brought back some good memories.  Thank you.
Edit: I just remembered another good one.  "Why would anyone want to wait for a DVD to be shipped in the mail when they can just go to Blockbuster?".  Netflix was a quirky little company that started out by mailing DVDs.  So many people dismissed it because the infrastructure wasn't good enough to stream.  What you're seeing now with block sizes and fees and BIP is the infrastructure just starting to take off.  Netflix crushed Blockbuster and rental places in less than six months after high speed Internet made steaming possible.

No, they don't.
"Both trackers are designed to mirror the return of the underlying asset, U.S. dollar (USD) per bitcoin. The product is an exchange traded note designed to track the movement of the underlying asset after fees."
So, the company may or may not hold Bitcoin, and then you trust them to issue you "stock" in a fund that has Bitcoin in the name.

Ah ok - that's true.  You need all of the multiple locations secure if you split your key.  That defeats the purpose.  If there's a problem getting to one of those locations, you're hosed.  I suggest keeping password protected wallet copies at many locations.  Think hurricane Katrina.  If for some reason you can't get home or your house is destroyed, your full wallet can be recovered at any other safe location.  That's the comparison I was making with gold.  There are a lot of "gold-bugs" that claim "if you don't hold it, you don't own it".  Ok, then I guess these people never leave the house or go on vacation.  The beauty of crypto-currency is freedom of movement.

If this is true... then every person that wants to see adoption should use it.  Spend BTC, then replenish BTC.  These merchants are going to be looking at numbers.  The numbers are going to dictate whether this experiment is worth their time and effort.  
By all means, show these suits they made a good decision.  Also, replenish your supply.  If it’s stagnant, they will drop the option as worthless.

You are lacking much in research.  I suggest you look at Newegg, Overstock, Gyft, eGifter.  There are many places on-line and off, if you take time to look.  If you like shiny metals, Amagi metals and Veldt.  If you like to travel, CheapAir and Expedia.  Plus there are a multitude of companies based out of the US that accept Bitcoins for payments.  
It's the only currency that's globally accepted.  1 Bitcoin is the same whether I'm in Chile, Greece, or China.  It may convert differently to the local currency, but it is the only currency that is the same everywhere.
Either you are ignorant or just trolling.  Pick one.

Four years? Ha!  Do you know how long the internet existed before Netflix, eBay and Amazon?  
The analogies are spot-on and mirror almost perfectly with the evolution of .com.  In 1990, you could make the same argument that no one used the Internet except for a very small section of the population.  Those that did have access only used it for sending e-mail and visiting newsgroups.  Go ahead four years to 1994/1995 - eBay starts, Yahoo starts, Amazon starts as a bookstore!

Hmmm.  From the article, it looks like it's more like an exchange traded fund (ETF).  It "tracks" the price of Bitcoin, which is a roundabout way of saying that the exchange doesn't hold Bitcoin and neither do you.  You hold a paper saying that you own the value of X amount of Bitcoins in the fund.  It's done with gold and silver, where the you can buy essentially "paper gold" but never actually own real gold.
This fund doesn't have access to any real Bitcoin.  The only thing Bitcoin related is the name of ETF.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:55:45
I think that's the upside compared to gold.  Let's take the example of SHTF.  With gold, even though it may be well-hidden, it's one spot you absolutely have to defend.  If you lose that spot (house, in the ground, etc), it's gone.  
With crypto?  You have the ability to move freely and carry nothing.  A proper password protected set of copied paper wallets in multiple locations is perfect.  My house is taken over/destroyed?  No problem.  I'm on vacation and natural disaster makes it impossible to go home?  Not a problem.  I can take one of my copies, eat it in front of you, and smile knowing I have about a dozen more, hundreds of miles apart in all directions.  Gold?  Try moving and securing a large quantity in a crisis.  Doesn't even come close.

Relax, I’m pro-bitcoin.  Crypto is only as secure as the holder.  Stealing crypto can be done much easier than stealing a car.  Consider a car as a physical object has to be driven somewhere, stashed, then sold for parts or whole.  This kid stole much more, and without too much heavy lifting.  So, I won’t teach you this lesson - but the lesson is taught.  “I know nobody can get to my bitcoin” is a pretty careless statement.
