Except, here's the problem. MacGregor likely never had $15 million. And just like Matthews he worked for Bodog/Calvin Ayre.

It's highly unlikely Robert MacGregor has $15 million to give anyone. It seems Canadian investors are the new Canadian girlfriends.
MacGregor is a longtime Calvin Ayre employee, which the LRB neglects to mention. So is Stefan Matthews, who talks about Ayre in the article.
I suspect the gambling guy is behind all this.

O'Hagan strongly hints that the mysterious backer is gambling tycoon Calvin Ayre but for some reason he doesn't follow-up.
MacGregor was also (and likely still is) an Ayre employee but either O'Hagan didn't know this or for some reason chose not to report it.
According to people who know MacGregor it is highly unlikely he has, let alone invested $15 million in Wright.

I don't think Ayre was the mark since both Matthews and MacGregor work for Ayre. 
I'm trying to figure it all out, which may be a hopeless endeavour. All I can say for sure is MacGregor has many documented ties to Bodog. It's strange that the LRB didn't discover them.
It's possible that Wright was pressured into claiming he was Satoshi and that explains why, according to the LRB, he was so reluctant to claim he invented Bitcoin.
I just have no idea. It's all so bizarre.

Is there any evidence at all of him behaving in the manner Satoshi did in his posts and emails?
@_date: 2016-09-25 18:05:18
Are there any remaining threads where he can be seen in conversation?

I don't get anyone thinks Craig Wright and/or Kleiman could be Satsohi. There's zero evidence other than Wright's claims.

There's  absolutely nothing -- not one speck of evidence -- to indicate he was Satoshi. All there is is the word of a conman, Craig Wright.
There are hundreds if not thousands of people, who know as much about security as Kleiman did.
His credentials have been grossly exaggerated (not by Kleiman, I should add).

This is just a rumour that some people seem to take as fact.

But there have been lots of people here on Reddit supporting the idea Wright could be Satoshi.
Yeah, I know. It is Reddit, right?
