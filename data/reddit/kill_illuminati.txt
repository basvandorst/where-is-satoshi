It was then too. Why do you think England  supported the Confederacy?  Because it depended on the cheap cotton.
Now,  a different form of slavery persists.

"One important news that the world press has refused to publish is that just a few weeks ago the United Nations independent official rapporteur, Professor Alfred M. Zayas has most emphatically declared that there is no “humanitarian crisis” in Venezuela despite media reports and generalizations. “…the population does not suffer from hunger as for example in many countries of Africa and Asia – or even in the favelas of São Paolo and other urban areas in Brazil and other Latin American countries...“humanitarian crisis” can be easily exploited to justify “regime change”, under the pretext that the government lets the population starve. Some states pretend that the Venezuelan government can no longer guarantee the rights of the people. Hence, a humanitarian crisis emerged and now they want to intervene militarily to “save” the Venezuelan people from a failed socialist experiment.”(venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/13614)"

We can have all three;  the question is how and in what degrees :)

Reddit karma is like anti-karma:  the more you get, the more you're punished in the next life.

Lol you don't know shit about shit. And  you're clearly not a writer.

Yeah, definitely a Brit.

Netflix will be the very last place you would find such a film. They specialize in fake documentaries to support the deep state (e.g. The White Helmets).
Further, Forbes has every reason to lie about the Chinese economy.

Wittgenstein comes to the same conclusion about certainty. But an interesting question for me is:  why do we want it so much? :)

Usually it has something to do with the fact that you don't rape little kids.

I read it;  a good book, and a good movie. I still feel the same way:  neither went far enough.  Both film and book ultimately defend the corruption they aim to expose.

No. It's my interpretation, never having met the man, of all that he's said and done and what I've read of his writings. 
Like I said, he's smart:  but ultimately unimaginative. No fucking way he's Satoshi.  Lol

BIS ( Bank of international settlements) is the granddaddy ;  and all banks (with interesting exceptions:  Russia ... north Korea... iran) follow it like a bitch.
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:37:34
You can have a revolution in ideas--like the printing press and protestant reformation-- that's technically bloodless. But the political revolutions naturally follow, and the old leaders rarely go quietly.

The guardian would happily eat your children and strangle bitcoin in its crib, if it had one.

Well I'm an anarchist;  so everyone is their own government, or should be ;)
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:35:07
I thought so too but now I'm not so sure ;)  I think, at best, they're ambivalent. Bitcoin is too useful to too many people;  the CIA, like all governments, prefer monopolies on power.

He's a smart guy, but not when it comes to politics. Despite the "decentralized / libertarian" aspects of crypto, Szabo, like many programmers and libertarians still today, backs the powers that be whenever push comes to shove.

Insurance is a creature of fiat.  If aliens land and abduct your gold from your basement, am I going to pay you in gold?
Ultimately, insurance is a political creature just like the US stock/ bond market:  a Ponzi Scheme designed to protect the wealthiest parties, and raid poorer ones at the first sign of trouble.
Hopefully Bitcoin will do a fair amount towards eliminating insurance as we know it.
