True, but domain name matches search result matches don't have as much value as they used to. Google started devaluing exact domain name search result matches when people started buying domain names to manipulate search results. 
If an alternative portal became popular with valuable content it will show up before bitcoin.org.

[schnoor signatures]( and [lightning network]( are two
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:35:02
The experience is a lot better IMO.  
I love those lightning wallets do this.

The issue for me isn't the technology, rather it's how powerful individuals will use it for their advantage.  
If something can be done cheaper with no humans involved it will be done.  
if technology can 'problem solve' at the same level of humans, humans can not compete.

The BTC unit is more arbitrary IMO (why base the units off 100,000,000 satoshi?)
satoshi (base unit)  
kilosatoshis (ksats)  
no need for people to think about decimals, or do the math that way..  
Sending .001 instead of .0001 isn't a small mistake  
Sending 1,000 instead of 100 feels a little easier for human brain to catch

or you know... taxing large scale automation...

as tech advances, if the majority of peoples' economic output drastically reduces...
What do you propose we do to prevent people from becoming powerless in society?
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:18:25
because cars/computers can't scale as AI can.
With AI $$ can be funneled and it's a race to best "problem solver" to $ ratio.  
if that becomes centralized people can't jump on board the race.

My beliefs are it seems to be more like:
 "If technology did not ~~benefit society~~  individuals with economic power, it would not be adopted."
I worry if people no longer have access to economic relevance/power society won't give a shit about them. The market powers might just overpower them.
I see a lot of instances today where society doesn't seem to really give much of a shit to individuals economically irrelevant. :\\
Traditionally the solution is to just tell them to 'be better' and 'learn a skillset'... but that might just become significantly harder for a normal human to do as things become more complicated/automated.
I want to be wrong, I guess I have a fairly selfish view on people, and think society just works because it's a bunch of people that need each other to make their lives better. Maybe someday they don't really need eachother...

Hi -
Can the old node be gifted?
My goal is to gift to allow someone to start using sats app without the overhead of a gold subscription.
EDIT: per  [  seems like that's an option. Please confirm :D
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:12:39
Historically that is true, but that may not remain true.
Artificial intelligence that can learn from data and adapt accordingly could have fundamentally different implication.
I work in the ML/AI field, and do believe the vast majority of humans literally won't be needed.  
"problem solving" algorithms are trending towards becoming simply good enough.
But that's beside the point,  
I wasn't making a claim, I was simply asking...

@_date: 2019-08-11 20:07:48
they can compete if they have land/resources.  
Given enough timeframe, they will need to compete, and lose their control of it to stronger forces.

My big worry is if many individuals don't have access to these machines that are earning income.
If AI tech isn't available to everyone - people could be pretty damn powerless..
I don't want to redistribute, more so I want to give people platforms to build off of.  
Unfortunately, that costs a little $.  
I want to pay for it, I just can't pay for everyone.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:22:08
What if few individuals end up controlling others?
Do you trust the market to correct itself?
What if 100 powerful people are like nah... we want to control everything?
Feel free to answer any, I'm genuinely asking.
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:34:30


Yeah, there is a lot of room for innovation. Once the innovation dries up, I'd expect the price to drop. Unless individuals had enough power and will to control the market.


I'd support giving people cars if gave people a better platform to be economically prosperous in a free market.  
I don't believe that the solution would be best to do that, I'd be more inclined to support free public transit.
My worry is specifically technology making the requirements for humans to be economically relevant post-automation to be too significant for the vast majority of people.

Not sure when you've tried last, but it has gotten much better.  
I recommend just jumping to mobile and using  [  for android or  zap for IOS
