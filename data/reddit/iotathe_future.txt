IOTA uses less energy than bitcoin; iota clean energy

Nah, iota never bows to btc
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:19:19
People still acting like they can predict the future
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:34:36
It'll probably be worth about the same as a bitcoin once people realize how shitty bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-08-20 09:46:00
Yeah, some are luckier than others
I can finally confirm that the site does work because yesterday I withdrew at 50$ worth of btc! 
I bought a bitcoin shirt with my winnings and the rest went to hodling

You see the bitcoin reference in family guy?
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:35:24
But how do you know that, I get it decentralisation is everything but major companies will still have to get around fees and  long transaction times
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:53:01
You should do some research in the tangle, it's actually pretty impressive.
Basically the tangle allows things like infinite scalability, and free [feeless] transactions

Maybe I need to read the book because I just don't see bitcoin being useful at all, there are so many other systems that work a lot better like DAG's and although iota's tangle isn't perfect I see that as a lot better than wasting money and electricity through bitcoin and future DAG's would surely be more stable. Can someone help me understand why bitcoin is better?

You are corrrct, January 1st 1970
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:38:08
You can still secure something through centralization, bitcoin and blockchain isn't the answer and it isn't the best, not even close. Look beyond blockchain.

I started with litteraly nothing so there isn't much to gamble, the website is also a faucet so that's where I got my starting bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:17:56
I am now at 0.00050080!
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:07:44
But one major downside and that's sacrificing decentralization as many people don't consider iota to be decentralized
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:17:07
trinity, what? You didn't say what kind of wallet
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:11:34
Not if IOTA takes out all other competition
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:15:14
What about when quantum computers wipe out most online currencies?
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:01:54
Well eventually bitcoin won't be worth anything due to how outdated the tech is, honestly so many issues with blockchain based cryptos.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:27:21
Well you know my point, die to the point where it's rarely used
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:33:28
Holdleing bitcoin is a bad idea, shits crashing and it's not going to go back up, the fact is that bitcoin is out of date and it's probably one of the worst cryptos out there
