Hi everyone!  Thank you so much for viewing. I'm a huge advocate of Bitcoin and wanted to do my part for getting the word out to those who really are fully unaware of it.  I have written a song about Bitcoins and is exclusively available to Bitcoin users for the first two weeks.  I have been getting such amazing feedback so thank you so much.  Hopefully it will help the general population aware of it more :). Toodles!!

I absolutely agree. I have had nothing but trouble. I phoned them to ask why I needed to ask for billing cus the whole point of bitcoin is to be incognito so to speak. they couldn't help me.  the problem is I'm not sure how to offer the download through coin base.  BitPay have been emailing me and they said this was their best option. :( any suggestions greatly appreciated x
