You can create lightning invoices after you’re activated. Just an FYI. I’m gonna send you sats to activate you. 
PS.. DM me your Twitter handle

I havent watched the show for a long tome. That was a funny monologue actually.
@_date: 2019-11-17 09:09:54
You’re welcome. Enjoy!

Unless you’re doing coin join over Tor and know exactly what you’re doing, you’re part of chain analysis too. Bitcoin isn’t anonymous
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:23:42
How did you get BAT out of brave? I thought you can only use them to tip content creators
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:28:36
No problem. DM me your Twitter or Phone number
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:54:35
relax . it's just a custodial service to send LN via phone numbers or twitter handles. No one is putting their life savings on it. Just few dollars at most to onboard friends and family and show them how easy it is to use lightning network.
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:35:32
LN is working just fine. I use it everyday. I almost never use on-chain now. Obviously, it’s still very young, many rough edges to smooth up.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:41:21
Some banks aren't crypto friendly. I'm with Capital One. Never had any problems with Cash App or Coinbase ( I prefer Cash App).
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:44:38
Yes, you can send btc from cash app to any wallet. You can buy and sell on cash app and they charge zero fees.
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:10:02
Just a twitter meme
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:00:55
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:48:59
You're welcome
@_date: 2019-10-09 08:35:25
It just bitcoin over the lightning network. Real bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:47:54
You just withdraw. Very simple and quick. You enter destination address and press "withdraw".
@_date: 2019-10-03 04:30:57
If you're in the USA, use Cash App.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:28:10
lol Mcafee. The dude is crazy.
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:59:35
Aren't they tax exempt?
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:20:50
There are no shortage of trusted, open-source bitcoin wallets: Mycelium and Electrum are the one I’ve used and recommend. And for lightning I recommend Breez wallet. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:57:04
How do you know that no one has the keys to them? You can never know
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:16:05
If you’re into the lightning network, I suggest Tales from the crypt and LN junkie podcasts.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:05:24
Received. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-10-18 00:32:26
Yeah, OP is confused.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:52:20
Foldapp.com also pay with lightning instead of on-chain to save on fees.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:37:33
Yeah it’s magic
@_date: 2019-10-20 16:49:35
Who cares. 1 sat = 1 sat. Fuck fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:10:03
Yes. ATMs charge insane fees. Not worth it unless you're desperate to get some BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:20:38
No one is certain they're lost for ever. Just am assumption.
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:20:12
Context for noobs: 
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:29:09
I don’t know. I don’t give financial advise. Sorry
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:58:26
Forget mining
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:54:54
I scanned the QR code. Only one transaction so far: 
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:14:29
If you cant transfer it to your own non-custodial wallet where you're 100 in control, it ain't bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-16 04:42:40
The code id open-soirce. Nothing is stopping anyone from creating bitcoin2. We already have it. It's called Litcoin. Identical to bitcoin in every aspect except it has 2 min block time and uses a different hashing algorithm.  There's no real use for it really.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:40:08
@_date: 2019-10-09 10:32:27
Website looks shady
@_date: 2019-10-23 00:52:48
Cash app
@_date: 2019-10-09 10:33:32
I’d say Jaxx or Exodus
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:50:19
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:59:48
Delete Conbase!
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:03:36
Not a good look for Jack. I actually like him. He's pro bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:30:39
Yes. Be aware of scammers. Never disclose your keys to anyone. If it sounds too good, it a scam.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:55:12
No one knows anything when it comes to price. Any random guess is as good as any.
@_date: 2019-10-07 04:41:03
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:18:41
Imagine being in bitcoin and you don't know what 6.15 means. lol 
@_date: 2019-10-14 20:20:02
Nice. Now you have a whole bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-10-23 02:50:36
Must be an exchange address
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:01:56
Cash App
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:17:01
One thing to keep in mind, you gonna get a lot of DMs from people trying to scam you. Never share  you wallet info with anyone. Never trust anyone. Good luck in your journey.
@_date: 2019-10-05 09:20:06
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:10:25
@_date: 2019-10-08 04:36:19
Exodus is the best multi-asset wallet out there imo.
@_date: 2019-12-08 17:10:48
Yes. You can withdraw and deposit bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:20:30
Cash app
@_date: 2019-12-07 16:30:50
It’s an app you download on your phone . Just search App Store or google play store for “cash app”
@_date: 2019-12-07 13:08:02
Yes. Only bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-08 16:02:40
Of course not. But you can transfer bitcoin to a wallet you control. Cash app is buying and selling only.
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:52:42
An exchange transaction most likely
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:02:29
Depending on how you store your paper wallet. I know people are moving to hardware wallets, but a paper wallet or even a burner phone that has never been connected to the internet is just as good as any hw.
@_date: 2019-09-21 00:36:31
 Bitpay is holding us back. Seriously. They don’t even have Segwit yet. Fucking lazy greedy bastards
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:01:43
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:49:37
@_date: 2019-09-28 11:07:16
Did bitpay finally switch to segwit?
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:25:13
Yes. Bitrefill.com
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:40:13
Nice. I want the stacksat shirt. Where'd you get it?
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:09:44
Because every bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:52:51
Coinbase has dropped all alts.
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:44:50
Hundreds of them exist already
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:41:12
What in the actual fuck?
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:05:27
Mining in 2019 lmao. Forget it. Get on the [lightning network](
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:03:32
Can someone please explain to me what is BitLicense?
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:00:06
Bitcoin isn’t anonymous.    
I think you’re confusing 2 things:    
- custodial services (walllets) : like an exchange (Coinbase) holding your coins on your behalf. Not recommended.    
-non-custodial wallets: you and you only are in total control of your keys. Highly recommended.    
Example of non-custodial wallets: Mycelium, Electrum, Blue Wallet, Breez ( lightning)...
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:18:29
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:13:44
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:46:45
It's bitcoin (not capitalized)
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:42:32
Awesome.  Cheers!
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:53:20
This movie sucked btw
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:50:13
Thank you
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:58:25
I don’t exactly get what he meant. Pirate the book and donate to me via bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:08:48
Some people deserve to fall victims to this kind of preposterous scams. Do you even have to ask?
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:27:27
Looks legit to me. Do you not see the seal?
