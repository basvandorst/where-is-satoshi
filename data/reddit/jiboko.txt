I work in technology PR and could not agree more. MtGox makes me cringe every time they communicate with the public. 
In their AMA a while ago they mentioned tapping professional help with their communications strategy. That doesn't seem to be going very well..

I am a PR/marketing guy who has been watching the media's general mishandling of Bitcoin with great interest over the last few years. There is no doubt that a program needs to be put in place to cultivate a better relationship between between facts and the news media. 
Can you please go into more detail about how this project plans to do that? At the moment I see there a documentary of some kind planned. What comes after that? Is the expectation that interested journalists will watch your program to learn about Bitcoin? How will you make that happen? 
Your posts below indicate an end goal of building a sort of 'Bitcoin Television Network.' Are you trying to circumvent journalists by building us another echochamber? 
I got excited when I saw this post but after poring over your site this seems more like a crowdfunding effort for your interest in film rather than a serious effort at changing the relationship between Bitcoin and the media - an objective more closely aligned with what I would support.

It is unbelievable that the McDonalds-Bitcoin theory was able to get so far. C'mon guys.

Hi I am having the same issue. What is the best support channel? I do not see one on your website.

Can't believe you are getting downvoted. I work with the media. You are totally correct.

This joke deserves more kudos

There is no giant media conspiracy being led by a mysterious congress of "Elites." Do you think that the titans of business, politics, and the drug trade came together last week and held a vote to determine that Bitcoin is okay? 
You are reading too far into this. The general populace still does not care about Bitcoin and that is why you are not seeing wall-to-wall coverage pro or con about it. 
Just chill out and buy Bitcoin if you believe in it (I know I am) but try to approach this as a reasonable investor.

EDIT: I decided its not worth engaging. There is no evidence I can provide which will sway your steadfast opinion.

I work in technology PR and can tell you that this is absolutely true. Whenever there is claim of some giant media conspiracy I can't help but roll my eyes. Media folks are nothing more sinister than very busy people under a lot of pressure and given very little time to do things. 
At some point bitcoin advocacy groups will have to cultivate dedicated spokespeople whose full time job is educating the media and being aware of journalists looking to learn about bitcoin. Otherwise journalists will be forced to rely on whatever information they can find quickly.

As a tech PR/marketing guy this admission makes me very happy. We all have our own strengths. 
Let me know if you need any more help with this. I would enjoy chipping in.

This attitude is going to make it much harder to drive mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. Quit being arrogant because you know more about it than someone who is A) curious about it and B) actually spending instead of hoarding. 
I recommend an approach of gentle education rather than of callous "Let them eat cake."
