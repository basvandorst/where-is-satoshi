It may have come out harsh, but I think many of us here are very tired from the constant bashing of the core developers by unknown third parties with an agenda. 
It is a legitimate concern, because as mmeijeri is saying, people are presumably less inclined to think well of the core dev intentions due to the past months of constant personal attacks. Some of us choose to jump and defend them. 
Having said this, SW does not need to wait for LN, and most likely wont. Things just take time to get going.

Probably also the most important issue you raise here. The fact that Bitcoin has existed for 7 years and is still resilient is the reason alone to not look beyond its protocol. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:46:16
Please educate yourself. This is a very very reasonable improvement to Bitcoin. There is nothing scary about it, and it solves more issues than you can imagine. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:18:51
Brilliant analogy! 
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:38:24
Just shows that the core devs had the solution all along and that time was wasted on XT hard fork discussions. 
They tried to stop us, they failed miserably. We won this round as well, and can scale without having to risk the ecosystem.

All this depends on how quickly we get changes to Bitcoin core. You are correct until you are not. 
Rome was not build in one day, give it time. The initial proposal is just a hint of what will one day be standing.

1. You can peg Bitcoin to RSK 1:1, meaning you can move freely between the 2 chains. There is no premine. You lock Bitcoin in the Bitcoin blockchain and get equivalent RSK in the Rootstock blockchain. When you are done using the RSK's or you want to exchange them back to Bitcoin, you do so by sending a msg back to the Bitcoin blockchain and your Bitcoins will be available to use again. 
2. The new chain will be merged mined if the mining capacity is high enough. If not, it will be a combination of designated signatures together with merged mining. 
3. Since more op_codes are available in this sidechain, and many more features are enabled, you would be able to run Turing complete scripts, aka. full blown applications that are decentralized. 
4. It helps Bitcoin by increasing Bitcoins usability to pay for programable services in a sidechains, thus Bitcoin is the currency for a growing ecosystem. 
5. It can run all the apps build for Ethereum and pretty much makes Ethereum useless since there will for certain be more mining capacity on this sidechain. 
6. Miners increase their revenue by mining this chain, thus more power, thus more security on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Read the white-paper, its really informative. 
EDIT: Its no surprise this comes from Sergio Lerner, one of the brightest minds in the Bitcoin industry.

February 2016 according to interview with Sergio:

Very good speaker, and definitely the type that would speak to an audience most old-school Bitcoiners wont be able to speak to ever. He is good, no doubt! 
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:19:07
If you want consensus and security a-la Bitcoin, you want miners to secure the chain. And we need that since this chain will mostly be focused on complex executions, rather than payment orientated like Bitcoin. 
If banks want to setup their own chain, they can copy the Rootstock code and run their ecosystem on that. No need to fedpeg or use miners if they want a private chain. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:49:26
Very good work! This is one of those projects that holds big potentials. Any idea when we can see some code? 
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:08:23
This is quite the release that we have here! A merged mined sidechain, fully pegged to Bitcoin 1:1 with the option to add smart contracts and payment hubs on the sidechain. 
On top of if we have increased revenue for miners as they can effectively earn money from mining multiple asset chains at the same time. 
Huge huge huge improvement to the Bitcoin industry and an indirect scale to the economy of Bitcoin.

Finally some more words of wisdom! This is exactly the correct way to increase the block size, and not jump to increase it 20 fold as seems to be on the table right now.

@_date: 2015-05-31 13:29:53
Please update with 
We do NOT support the blocksize increase. We have a partnership with Northpayments:  and these 20.000 merchants will never accept the XT version with the increased block sizes. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:22:01
You do not stand alone at all. We hope to see sidechains from you soon! 
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:18:15
Operator of nodes have dropped faster than the bee colonies. And since we do not even have anyone working on an incentivizing system for node operators, this should not even be a reason to increase the block size 20 fold. 
To your second question, I do not want to answer yet. I want to see blockstream and sidechains and what solution they offer. Upon that we should decide. Right now, we are not even in a rush to increase the block size. The transaction overflow wont happen for another 6 months at least, plenty of time to come up with a solution based on sidechains helping out. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:06:25
Nodes cannot be expected to carry all the transactions made via Bitcoin. This will eventually lead us to keep increasing the blocksize, thus ending up with a few data centers that will act as full nodes, thus destroying the last decentralization we have. 
For more info about what nodes actually do in this ecosystem of ours I can reccomend this post:  
If you kill the nodes by spamming them with transactions (and 20MB for each 10min is close to spam), you wont keep the node count, which is the single most important thing for Bitcoin to survive as it is.

It is difficult to take something from Mike Hearn as valid any longer. He left the Bitcoin industry for the banking industry, the very same industry Bitcoin is trying to replace. 
Hard forks are dangerous because it breaks the 7 year run towards thousands of services, miners and nodes, on the same network under the same consensus rules. 
If we loose 20% of that in a hard fork, we set ourselves back years for the sake of an increase we dont even need right now (blocks are NOT full).

Lightning Network (aka. payment channels) just went public with their source code: 
The alternative version is called Thunder Network, and is developed by Mats Jerratsch that works for blockchain.info (probably because they are looking to make use of payment channels). This code is also publicly available here: 
21.co is working on their own version of payment channels, but so far that code is not released. 
Sidechains works perfectly, and have for almost 6 months now. There is a test network that you can connect a node to, an start experimenting with the cool stuff that was implemented in sidechains. 
SegWit is happening, and it works and it will be with us soon. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:09:36
Well said
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:34:11
Can you point to any example of when Bitcoin has been hard forked? 
We are venturing into unknown territory with a hard fork, and we might break the whole experiment doing so. 
Once it all breaks, there will be a race to promote various altcoins to take the reign from Bitcoin and the chaos alone could kill it all. 
We cant agree in times where Bitcoin works, imagine having to agree when the whole network is fragmented and nobody can understand right from wrong any longer. 
Fear, manipulation and mistrust has been spread throughout this community for months now, and people are loosing track of what is correct any more. 
Once we hard fork this can spiral out of control and really bury the consistent, WORKING, consensus Bitcoin we all know, understand and trust to keep track of our money. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 12:35:11
Perfect description of what Bitcoin is! Thinking that increasing the blocksize would let us compete with Visa, at this layer, and not level-2 layers is utter insane. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:20:50
If Bitcoin ends up being the layer of choice for all payments on the planet, it will end up as a settlement layer regardless what option we choose. 
The question we should really ask is, what type of settlement layer it will become. 
a) A settlement layer where nodes are only large ISP's, mining corporations and large banks/payment processors, due to extremely large blocks and bandwidth requirements. 
b) Where everyone can be a full node, but only very few can afford to clear transactions on chain, centralizing the settlements on chain to banks/payment processors and the future financial institutions. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:43:37
You are correct! 
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:59:30
Given enough time, the misunderstanding, due to mass promotion of private chains, will quickly change to accepting Bitcoin's blockchain layer is the only useful immutable database. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:57:20
LN is not a financial institution, it is a an extension layer to Bitcoin, using Bitcoin as the currency to transact, but without committing the transactions to the blockchain (aka settlement/PoW). 
There are currently a number of payment channel integrations. 
1) The LN, currently under development by Rusty primarilly: 
2) The LN, currently under development by a couple of developers, such as Tadge: 
3) An "LN" called Thunder Network: 
4) Something named Duplex Micropayment Channels, but has no code in the open yet: 
All these are payment channels and are taking use of new opcodes, some which are already activated, namely CLTV: 
There is no institution or any trickery involved in payment channels. It is all open source, and what is cool about payment channels is that they are using Bitcoin as transaction unit without bloating the blockchain.

We wont be accepting any clients from New York. Any clients we currently have in New York will be removed from our services.

One slippery slope opens up for another slippery slope, and culminating in a vote for anything, including 21 limit. 
It is a precedence, and what might not be up for questioning now, could be later, if we go down this path. 
Basically, this shows that 1 core dev (Gavin) + one known dev (Jeff) + X amount of "devs" + a bunch of reddit accounts would have the power to change anything. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:56:09
As it should be! A protocol that has shown resilience for the past 7 years, and has proven itself in the wild against every hacker that wants a piece of the 5+ billion dollar prize, should obviously be the choice of everything "blockchain".

You will be surprised about how safe Rootstock might turn out to be. Dont discredit them just yet. 
Rootstock will probably be that killer app we have all been waiting for that will make Bitcoin go to the moon. 
With the interoperability of a sidechain (one way for now, 2 way when we soft-fork the BIP into Bitcoin) and the fact that it will be based on the same tested code as Bitcoin + a bunch of new features, it will make its mark. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 19:11:40
And sets a precedence to hardfork anything, such as the 21 million limit, blacklisting, 20MB blocks and whatever else banks would like in the future. 
The promise of scaling the network comes with the hidden fact that Bitcoin will be controlled by the group that can scream loudest. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:36:14
We will most likely announce all merchants on our website,  or tweet about it. Stay tuned, this has just begun! 
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:07:39
The federated signatures that keeps getting quoted left right and center is probably because most of these banks are going to use the sidechain protocol to power their interbank systems.
