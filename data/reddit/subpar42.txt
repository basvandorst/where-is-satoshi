I'll keep my eyes open for a tutorial for the less tech saavy on running a BWS server. Like you two, I run bitcoind and electrum on a public and private server now....
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:07:30
Hmm - I save TX from watch-only to USB drive and bring to offline for signing.  Save signed  TX to USB and bring back to watch-only to broadcast.  Not sure how I can use QR codes in this scenario.

In the .conf you can do as follows:
There is a donation_address option in the .conf but cannot see how that gets used or is visible to the clients.

My largest ever received donation for my Electrum servers (yes, I run two) is 0.03 BTC.  Less than .21 BTC after 13 months.  I consider running the servers my charity work for BTC as tips will never come close to offsetting expenses for a dedicated server.
Very cool to see someone support your server so strongly!

Both my electrum servers went offline - back now...
Session counts are both much higher than normal due to other servers not coming back yet...

Zbar works for win32 - I didn't think so...

I think Aaron mentioned using slightly revised fee structure going forward on breadwallet

My pleasure

Quick update that I suspect will be directionally correct going forward.  Bandwidth down from ~20GB to ~6GB.
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:34:08
As noted above, currently at 52 connections.  I have restarted with maxconnections=20 to gauge the impact.

Currently at 52

Via PayPAL?!?
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:41:47
Yes, I am aware.  I wanted to run an unconstrained "experiment".
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:09:09
You are entitled to your opinion.  I am now constraining it to 20 connections to gauge the impact.  I'll report back in another ~30 days.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:10:25
Yes (to both)
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:43:41
0.13.1 ?
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:56:57
Not needed on the same server - you can connect to a remote bitcoind but need to have access to its RPC.
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:53:30
A lot of progress being made here (now at version 0.2)...
Full sync in just over than 11 hours on AMD FX-6100 with SSD and just over 9 hours on 5930K with Samung 950 Pro (in a VM).  This is connecting to a bitcoind on my LAN.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:21:38
What is the address that supposedly has the funds?
Can you see them in any other block explorer?
@_date: 2016-11-11 11:33:43
To give some idea of the speed improvements in syncing from genesis.
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:57:25
Not quite but getting closer...
@_date: 2016-11-11 11:29:38
What are you talking about?
The Electrum server(s) maintain a seperate database from the Bitcoin blockchain.  Currently with ElectrumX that is 17-18GB.  The original server (E-S) is now over 46GB.  So smaller DB and faster sync = improvement.
@_date: 2015-07-05 11:38:48
I have added the Bitcoind version information to the banner messages of both servers -- v0.10.2

If the funds arrived and then you see an additional transaction sending to an unknown address (i.e., a transaction you didn't create) then yes, your system is compromised.
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:36:43
Yes - old (1.9x) seeds are fine - and maybe earlier that that.  I started with Electrum at 1.9.8.
No need to sweep unless you want to keep a new backup of the new seed.
@_date: 2015-10-04 10:31:22
With respect to Electrum - you can uncheck auto-connect and manually try to select different servers.  This page will give you a list and current status of electrum servers - 
What version of Electrum are you using?
