Don't be absurd.
The conversation was about whether anything was backing it up, but now you're changing the goalposts
Name one thing that has "inherent value."

It's backed up by it's security in the form of the work done by the miners.

Isn't it the one cub scout award that is acceptable for the boy scout uniform? Isn't cub scouts a subsection of the BSA like venturing or sea scouts?

Wellp! i agree.
More conversationally than argumentative-ly, i think they're really closely tired together and less offshoots. Den chief being one of the official leadership positions, The bridging ceremony , they use the same councils and districts,  etc. Cub scouts seems like training wheels for the bike you ride on your own later.

Wow. I sold all my bcash for btc as soon as the fork happened, and figured I'd use the proceeds to start dabbling in mining by buying a bitmain asic.... I guess that's not really on the table anymore.
Are there more reputable companies that make decent mining hardware?

They're working on rolling it out already. I have 2fa enabled

I appreciate the honesty. It seems to me that it takes a lot more than people give credit for to own up to a mistake.
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:09:25
sure, but you could still have that in a wallet by sending all but one satoshi. and i think you TECHNICALLY could send one, although i agree you in practice could not.

uhhh... I really don't participate here or (or at all, and was just passing through. I saw you admit you made a mistake which is something I don't see often on reddit so thought I would express my appreciation. It had nothing to do with the inter-subreddit politics, and i think it's weird that you're making it into that.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:27:50
I absolutely agree.

Bitcoins are divisible up to 8 decimal places. You do not need to have a whole bitcoin. If you wanted, you could have 0.00000001 BTC in a wallet. You can store such partial bitcoins however you'd like, including on a paper wallet.

A bitcoin transaction can be broadcast to the network with a fee of zero. Miners deciding to include it in the next block is indeed possible, but highly unlikely given that there's no incentive to work for free.
I tried to include a link to a stackexhange post about this, but my comment got removed by the automod. I'll post the contents of the answer her anyway:
Zero- and low-fee transactions aren't relayed by default. If you attempt to broadcast one over the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, most nodes won't pass it along for you (and they might even "ban" you by refusing to relay any of your transactions for a while). However, such transactions are still valid, and it is perfectly legal for a miner to confirm such a transaction by including it in a block, should they choose to do so. So this raises two questions:
How would they get ahold of a zero-fee transaction, if they're not relayed?
The miner might have created the transaction for themselves. For instance, if a mining pool needs to pay its members their earnings, the pool operator could create a transaction and include it in the blocks the pool is attempting to mine. There's no point in including a fee, because the pool would just be paying the fee back to itself.
Some large miners may have alternate ways to receive transactions (e.g. a web site where anyone can paste a transaction and the miner will consider it). This is also useful for people who want to create transactions which can't be relayed because they are not standard.
Why would they confirm it?
Obviously most miners are motivated by profit and so they would prefer to confirm transactions with higher fees. But other than altruism or bugs, here are some reasons why they might choose to confirm a zero-fee transaction.
It's their own transaction, so there is no point in including a fee. See above.
They've been paid in some other way. Some miners have "transaction accelerators" where you can pay that specific miner some amount to "buy" faster confirmation.
"Child pays for parent." If the zero-fee transaction is used as input by another "child" transaction which has a high fee, the two transactions together might have a higher average fee than any other two available transactions. The miner can't confirm the child without also confirming the parent, but it might be worth it to collect the child's fee.
