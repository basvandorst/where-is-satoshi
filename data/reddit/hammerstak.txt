Honestly I left Facebook because people were assholes, and I'm new to reddit.... You're giving reddit a good name right now :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:57:37
See above please

Honestly I'm not following you.....but you must use the autism thing a lot if I randomly run into this twice in two days.....
Not trying to give you a hard time (well, kinda).....but dayam....new material needed?

I have no doubt with my kid's therapy (we caught it really young) he will be ok. The social stigma is really the biggest thing. But there is progress being made there too.

So calling people autistic as an insult is a thing now? I have an autistic son, something like 1 in 60 kids are born autistic. Please don't contribute to this kind of degrading behavior. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:31:16
Yes I get it, I can't say anything except if you have a kid with any sort of issue, you'll realize how bad it makes you feel to hear things like this thrown around. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:29:20
Thank you. I do understand, I was guilty of using the term retarded, etc, before. When it happens to you, you suddenly "get" why it's not ok to say things like that. Really it just makes you sad and concerned for your kids' future. Uphill battle though, but your response was much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:32:32
That's not the way it works.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:37
Or ma'am.... 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:25
Thank you sir

So this is what it looks like when someone has a stroke mid-Reddit post.....

I think the "wow Bitcoin up 500%" is what gets people paying attention. Then the hesitation to throw their money behind something they don't understand kicks in. Then they learn about Bitcoin. Then they see it. Then they invest.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:10:53
I-anal..... Bit of a stretch of a joke. Pun intended. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:57:40
Wow.... 
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:02:04
Honestly the price is at the mercy of the media. Just reading more articles about how dangerous it is to invest in crypto (and that's true for almost all altcoins) but then they go and say something that proves they have no understanding of the concept of decentralization, etc. So I think most people capable of understanding bitcoin will eventually learn to tune out the media.
Until then, we're one measly article away from a surge or a crash.... So put your seatbelt on or wait for some stability.

Downvoted by the guy who was about to tell me it's all good cause it's still early? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:47:27
Apple has a smart butt plug now????? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:45:08
Looks like I was sort of right. Let's say 4650 and then a drop now. Why not, it's a blind guess
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:46:13
A drop to 4350......if I get that right too, I'll start taking btc donations for my advice lol
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:00:57
Feels like if we break 4610, we're going to keep going up for a bit. If we dip back through 4580-ish, think we're going to head down for another while.
Totally unqualified opinion, just been chart watching.
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:52:38
5800  . I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:50:49
Good God
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:30:23
I am literally waiting for a bank draft to clear at an exchange.... Basically the second I sent it, the price started skyrocketing. And I'm stuck unable to buy for at least another few days. 
And I will SMACK the first person to say it's all good cause it's still early, etc.....
