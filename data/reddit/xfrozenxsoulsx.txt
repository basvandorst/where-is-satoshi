The more the years go on the more we develop the more advanced we become. Many people are stuck in their ways and dont want change, this includes the older men (especially in Congress) who call this money thin air. No one wants to study and understand the technology behind it, this includes older men especially who are controlling our future at the moment. I do believe in 10 to 20 years well advance so much more in tech and we will continue moving forward with crypto. 
Not saying all older men are like this of course, but understand those making decisions in Congress and the federal reserve are mostly in their 60s plus. They are stuck in their mind on the old banking system.

I still believe alt coins in the top 20 will follow, just not as heavy as they use to. Bitcoin bumps to 20k, could see 100-300% moves in these alt coins easy, especially litecoin.

I only ask because the polls lie but have him on top. I will probably vote trump again but he needs to get on board.

 this video got me into it. Plus the fact that GOOGLE is interested. Much opportunity to get closer to its rival dash @ 105.00. I dont think 20 to 30 bucks by end of year is completely out of the question.

Bingo! They have no skin in the game. But trump's money will disappear and all these Congress men if they dont start investing. I like trump but he says it's based on thin air, news for him billions of dollars trading daily isn't "thin air", better technology, better money. We control our money, it's ours not theirs.

Libra is crap, owned and will be controlled by the government. I am against it, I am just sick of politicians being against crypto.

Far from the truth. If only you actually understood the technology. Have a good one, ya evil devil you.
