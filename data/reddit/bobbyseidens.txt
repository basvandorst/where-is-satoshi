As soon as a pool finds out that another miner has produced a block, all of their hashing on the previous block is wasted.  So, they want to get new work on top of that other block out to their miners ASAP.  Since they get the new block header from the network first, and that is all that is required to mine an empty block, they tell all their miners to drop what they are doing and mine the new work.
Before they can get their miners working on a block with transactions in it they have to do the following:
1. Download the rest of the block
2. Make sure the block is properly formatted, high enough difficulty
3. All transactions are properly formatted and valid (pretty sure that means all the ins up in levelDB)
4. Find out what transactions it has included and remove those transactions from their list of unconfirmed transactions
5. Consider which transactions (if any) from their list to include in the next block.
6. Package the block
By sending empty work out first, they save their miners a few seconds of working on useless stuff.

I like Bitstamp, they have pretty decent customer support, and their API is decent.  It's not stellar, but it's not Gox.  So, since some Bitcoiners seem to love to go on a vendettas, I set out to attempt to call OP out.
OP is probably not lying but I don't have enough data to prove it.**
I have a server which gathers and saves all data trade and order book data from Bitstamp.  I wrote a script to find OP's timezone, get all the trades around the listed time, get the depths around the listed time, and print the data.  My comments in bold.
All trades from 1399372920 to 1399373280 **120 seconds before, through 120 seconds after**

I was actually working for the guy who he had planned to stay with.  They agreed that Nefario would pay in bitcoin, so it wouldn't have been an issue.  I also imagine that he could have sold bitcoin to one of his fellow bitcoiners here to get cash if necessary.
We did think it was kinda stupid on his part that his game plan was to tell the authorities that he had tons of magic internet money so it was ok.

It was a joke.  Nerds just want to have fun, so they named him a founder.

Bitcoin miners moved faster than Moore's law because they quickly skipped through the processes.  Avalon used 130 nm, ASICMiner used 110, Alydian used 65 nm, Bitfury used 55nm and KNC, Hashfast, and Cointerra all used 28 nm.
20 nm tech existed when all these companies made larger, less power efficient chips.  The reason they didn't is because time to market, upfront cost, and development cost are much more manageable with a larger process.

There are 48,099,479 unique, non-multisig, non-P2SH addresses in the blockchain.

To add to everyone else, there are much better places to put your money right now.  The regular markets are in the midst of a major up-trend.  Why put your money in something that is losing value when you can make money virtually everywhere else?
When that bubble pops we should see some big investment into bitcoin.

Hey, I wrote some bitcoin accounting software for my employer, and finding the answer to that first question was a breakthrough.  You should get the latest bitcoin core daemon installed and check out:
bitcoind getblockhash [index]
bitcoind getblock [hash]
bitcoind getrawtransaction [tx_hash] 1
Getblockhash takes an index (block number) and returns the hash of that block index.  Call bitcoind getblock [hash] to get a json formatted block header.  The 'tx' field is a list of transaction hashes.  
For each transaction hash, call bitcoind getrawtransaction [hash] **1**.  The 1 is important as it returns it in json format instead of hex.
Normal transactions have vins and vouts.  The vouts are nice because they have the value and addresses included.  The vins just have the transaction id, so if you want to get the value and address you will either have to parse the scriptSig (hard and error prone), or just take the txid and look up that transaction (easy).  Note that for each vin, the "vout" number is the "n" in the previous vout.
Let me know if you have any questions, and yes, I will ask my employer if I can open source my code.

When you come down on either side of an issue you are implicitly calling the opponents wrong which is a pretty decent insult on it's own.  The "plan for success" is just PR filler.

Exchanges have their own internal ledger.  You deposit 10 btc, and they store the 10 btc with all the other depositor's btc, and make a note that your account has 10 btc.  Then, Mark (or hackers, another employee, a software bug, etc...) takes some btc from the pile without making a note in the ledger.
Repeat this over and over and you may eventually find out that everyone's deposits add up to 850,000 btc, and you only have 200,000 btc.  Whoops!

You can also not plan for success without planning for failure by having a different definition of success.

Mining empty blocks in the first few seconds is absolutely necessary.  When a new block is found, until miners get new work, all of their effort is completely wasted.  Pools do not want to wait for the entire block to be downloaded and validated before getting their miners working again.  They just need the blockheader to make new work for an empty block.
Also, miners working on empty blocks for ~3 seconds only means that the network is 597 / 600 as efficient at confirming transactions as it could be. (600 is number of seconds in 10 mins, the average time to find a block, and 597 is the average number of seconds miners spend working on a full block per block)
So, it's necessary, and it doesn't matter.
