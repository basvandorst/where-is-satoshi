Dang!  You weren't kidding.

I believe it will be a volume-based reward system, paid to the uploaders by megaupload, using (micro) Bitcoin transactions.

Damn, major feels for your situation.  That's crazy.  Hope you get some restitution.

Yes, wallets vs exchanges.  Buy btc then move to wallet ASAP.  Mycelium for Android is a great phone wallet.  I recommend a hardware wallet as well.  My favorites are Ledger, then Trezor.

I wouldn't describe it this way.  More like he's an enthusiastic advocate, like many other excited btc early adopters and investors, IME.  Is it possible his statements are in your consciousness more though; him being a cult celeb involved in Bitcoin, and you consuming a lot of btc news and info?  
Furthermore, the guy is *Mega* rich and neckbeard deep in disruptive technology, so if he's optimistic about btc, and has a positive track record with prior btc statements, I'm more inclined to consider his guidance, and appreciate his active role in the community, developing awareness and user adoption opportunities with btc.

This happened more than that one time with all the helicopters?

Placing expectations on people, then dwelling on why people don't live up to expectations, is an exercise in futility.  
Think about it, why do you care so much if someone online agrees/disagrees with your point of view, or that you're "right" and strangers --who have no impact on your life-- are "wrong"?  So much so you created a post about it.  We're we to all read it, see our error, and immediately place a special vote to elect you honorary custodian of crypto investing awareness for the sub?
It appears you've worked hard and carved out a nice setup for yourself.  The validation you seek has been in you the hole time!
edit: per your mention of trading btc for a while...  what's your + return % for 2016 and 2015?  Are you *on the dot*, like your post claims, regularly, or is this a "*clock is right two times a day*" thing?
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:33:30
This makes a lot of sense!  Genius indeed.

I'm not seeing the bad.  Bitcoin made it easy to complete a transaction.  After that, it's between the gambling site and the gambler.

90 btc on an exchange?  wtf?!  I feel bad but also kind of scratching my head at why so much money could be managed so insecurely.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:51:06
You were in the process of selling 90btc (from your personal wallet to the purchasing exchange) when the exchange shut down and locked out your 90 btc?  That's unfortunate.

How about keeping a copy of your Nano's receive QR code/public key, then quick access that as needed, instead of retrieving it from the device each time? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:26:59
Exactly likely?  I'm listening...
@_date: 2016-11-04 12:18:46
what else did you do today?  were all so intetested..
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:16:47
Which lives, specifically?  Or did you mean figuratively?
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:15:36
Please do elaborate what facts you've found..

But then she wouldnt feel all included and shit.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:19:14
Then follow them more closely if you're curious.  Also, the way you phrased your ~~accusation~~ question assumes WL already has, or can get, dirt on any country/person at any time.  How do you know this to be true?
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:11:12
Are you serious?  You bought **5** Bitcoins and you don't know basic knowledge of BTC storage/security?

You're focusing on the actions instead of the motivations.  No wonder you seem confused and upset.  There's a reason for Coinbase hate.  Have you not looked into it objectively, critically, yet?  
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:29:54
Huh?  Except the part where Ruski hasn't embraced BTC, but this story details the potential for a change in adoption by a major player.
@_date: 2016-10-18 18:41:43
My counter argument is to point out how entrenched Hillary **already** is with Banks and Wallstreet - so if they don't like Bitcoin (we already know this to lean toward true), then it's pretty clear she wont like it either.  Since Trump was first to kill the TPP option, I'm hoping he'll approach Bitcoin similarly.
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:29:35
I didn't see anyone claim BTC is now being considered.  However, this story does position BTC in a more favorable option than previously.

I'm not sure I can cover everything, but general online safety rules definitely apply, as well as hardware security and social engineering best practices.

*memorized the randomly generated 12-15 word seed (I have a weekly calendar reminder to mentally recite my seed).*
Firstly, that's cool!  I lost some important files and a gift card number because I couldn't remember the damn "I'll totally remember this later" password I used on the folder.  I just can't trust myself to go full brain wallet mode, even with a paper backup.
How did you go about memorizing your seed?  Clever idea for the, literal, reminder :-)

Try the Dollar Cost Average rule with buying BTC, and eliminate stresses from timing the market.  Simply begin spending the same amount each week/month to buy BTC.  Over time you'll have spent less for each BTC vs. emotional buying which comes with fewer purchases and higher cost of BTC average.

Cool ad!  Lots of creativity.  I was imagining it playing before a new movie.

As long as you have your keys, you're good, even if your hardware wallet, or the maker of said wallet, goes kaput.

I agree with you about using both, but according to what I learned in the /opsec ("operational security") sub, it's the other way around: TOR first, then VPN.
Hopefully no one is choosing a VPN that **does** keep logs.  The better VPNs do not.

Yours would be an interesting ama on here :)

If they're used safely, sure.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:10:59
I'm wondering this too.  Is there a simple way for lamen clients to pay in BTC, that I don't know about?  Maybe it's worthwhile to sit with their bookkeeper for an hour and help set it up, but even then I'd be concerned about them messing it up in the future.
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:35:21
With ya on the banks!  Fuck those NSF fees, among other distasteful acts on their part.
However you want to frame it, living 100% on BTC is pretty fucking interesting to me. :-)
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:40:35
Notice it's singular "bitcoin"?  This dude didn't even have 1 entire BTC, I bet.  Nothing to see here...
