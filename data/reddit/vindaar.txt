Yes, on testnet. The thing is basically that you don't want to have an easy to use GUI for software, which might lose the user's funds. On testnet that's obviously fine. But if you give the average person an easy to use mainnet wallet, no matter how many warnings you put there, people will go crazy if their BTC are lost / random other critical bugs happen.
That would hurt the adoption of Lightning much more in the long term than simply waiting a few months until it's safe to use.

That is a seriously cool visualization! What tool is used to create it?
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:06:00
Cool, thanks!

Well, yeah. But more data is not always for the better. At least not if the data comes at a cost. 
You don't put real missions on your untested rocket, despite that potentially paying for flights (some people definitely cry "I'm happy to have my cubesat etc. destroyed, if I can have the launch for cheap!"), because the downsides of screwing over all those customers is not worth it. Sure, some of them will be content with that, because they *actually meant* what they were screaming, but you can be sure that a lot will not. And these are the problem.. 
Maybe not because of the actual damage done, but due to peoples' focus on bad press.

Holy. Crap. I'm so happy for him. He deserves it!

One example: You have a wallet with 10 addresses with small amounts of BTC each. Now you want to send a transaction, which needs to combine all 10 addresses to cover the BTC you wish to send. Currently this means you need a signature for *each* input address (all 10!). Each signature takes up space on the blockchain. With Schnorr signatures you'll be able to only perform a *single* signature for all 10 addresses, saving a lot of space on the blockchain and saving you BTC in fees.

Here you go:

So I guess:
46. "post '100 Ways To Earn Bitcoin!!!' but only list 45 and expect to 'earn' BTC"?

Aside from a single function ( getCoinbaseTxAddress() ) and the last 4 lines in each file, the code is the same in both files.

Yeah, it's a pretty weird and unclear table. If you click on Bitcoin however (  ), you see that the Bitcoin exchange rate is given as BTC - EUR and not EUR - BTC as every other currency is. So to keep it in line with the rest of the table, you're right.
I just sent them a mail regarding that. I'll update this post once I have a reply, if anyone's interested.
edit 2:
Received an answer today. It is basically a simple 'thanks for letting us know about it, we'll look into it.'

Personally using KeePassX. Recently noticed too that keepass.info isn't using HTTPS. Was pretty shocked to see that (and relieved that I've been using KeePassX all along...)
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:25:29
Yep, I'm confused as well.
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:41:06
Wait, you're saying there are more than 1,000 BTC ATMs in Switzerland? Or did you misread the title?
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:38:57
Woah, I didn't know, thanks! Gotta check that out next time I'm there!
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:32:47
Aside from the fact that in 20 years there still will not be 21 Mio. around, this still assumes that you'll be able to retire owning all the coins in circulation at that time. ;)

The gif game is strong in this one.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:03:58
Yeah, *soon* we can move there by paying Elon Musk 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:07:12


This is only partly true. It only works out if your salary actually increases along with the devaluation. More often than not you're just stuck with your unchanging salary and can watch how your money is worth less and less. Sure, in case of hyperinflation it's different, but well..
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:43:21
Let's start by cloning Elon Musk another 20.999.999 times!
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:59:17
Can recommend. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:04:10
Yep, hope so, too!
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:38:08
Yep, that's the way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:41:29
*slow clap* 
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:39:05
I'd love that, not gonna happen though for me in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:18:38
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:34:37
r/ChargeYourPhone is happy with this one
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:26:53
Well, I agree with you. My comment wasn't entirely serious if that wasn't obvious. 
In fact, although I'm able to understand the source code in principle, have I put in the necessary effort to understand it all? No, I haven't. Which means I need to trust other people. It's always a time / priority thing. And that's the same for a lot of people I reckon. 
So yeah, I get what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:09:47
Good thing we're talking about Bitcoin. Don't have to trust those guys.. Or me. Or anyone for that matter :P
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:08:54
In a way this is starting to be funny, since it's so damn obvious..
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:53:15
That was one hell of an interesting read! 
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:30:59
When you say `they` I hope you're not referring to the people who're interested in technology, because then you couldn't be more wrong. It's absolutely infuriating to live through the attitude a lot of people, especially in politics, have about technology.
You're right though, if you refer to the rest of the public (which unfortunately is quite large...).
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:29:01
Yes, it does.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:02:26
This is me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:32:32


Ehmm, nope...
