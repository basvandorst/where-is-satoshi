Can you explain this further? Is it actually possible to do anonymous payments with bitcoin?
Isn't the bitcoin trail traceable through the blockchain to the ultimate point of converting local currency into bitcoin? Or would paying for bitcoin in cash be the solution?

Thanks! lol I have zero btc atm.
Another question about the paper wallet. I've read that once you store your money into that paper wallet, you cannot take fractions of bitcoin out of that paper walllet, so you would have to transfer the entire amount. Is this correct? 
To proceed with the example, how would one deal with the situation he has stored 100 BTC in a paper wallet and wants to buy something worth of 1.25 BTC? From a perspective of security of course.

Can you explain this further? When you move your money, let's say 100 btc for example, to that paper wallet from your bitcoin-qt wallet, it leaves a transaction trace right? This transaction is also publicly available in the blockchain right?

Sorry this has confused me more.
Say I buy 101 BTC on coinbase (crazy I know) and then transfer it to my paper wallet, with a fee of 1 BTC, leaving 100 BTC in the paper wallet. 
I want to spend 1.5 BTC on a product from some website, so I have to either
1.  transfer 100 BTC from paper wallet to bitcoin-qt wallet. From there I transfer 1.5 BTC to the address of the merchant, leaving 98.5 BTC in the bitcoin-qt wallet. Next tansfer this amount to the paper wallet again.
2. transfer 1.5 BTC from paper wallet and send the 'mining fee' (amounting to 98.5 BTC) to the address of the paper wallet again.
Is number 2 the process which you explained above? If not can you explain it using this example?
Also, now I wonder, how do you transfer money from a paper wallet to a software wallet or another paper wallet for that matter? Is there a program that allows you to give an 'input' address and an 'output' address? If so when using this 'input address' you have to sign this transaction with the private key of the 'input address' right?
