...source? Why wouldn't the guy do his own research as well?

Probably, you're not allowed to swear on the internet after all

Thanks! Unfortunately I don't share your feelings, but to each their own. Good luck in development.

You're developing an app but don't know how to record your screen?

Author doesn't appear to know where things like Facebook and Google come from. (Bonus: DNA is an uncountable noun.)

Yeah lol, I have like four hours' work in crypto. If it goes to 0, oh well.

Well I went and looked, but my two seconds of googling can't bring up any big policy changes that have made the drop happen.  Thing is, I spent $100 a while ago to buy some coin.  If it went to $0 because of nebulous financial reasons I literally wouldn't care, besides having something to laugh about at parties.  If it went to $0 because the concept was broken somehow then I'd be concerned.

Why would they put out "dangerous chemicals"?

I literally don't care about bitcoin price, if that's what you're on about. I just think the tech's cool and want to see more widespread adoption. Is there a big change in usage going on rn?

That's, like, not a problem. I keep most of my money in a high-yield savings account and top up my checking account as needed.

Well you're definitely not a copywriter.

Well you don't have the FCC if you're not in the US. But it's probably still a bad idea.

You know these aren't wifi jammers, right?
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:00:43
You know jamming devices are hella illegal? Like you'll actually get hunted down and prosecuted if you regularly use them. The FCC is no joke on this one.
