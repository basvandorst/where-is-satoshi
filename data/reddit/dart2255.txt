BFX= BUTTFUX

or MAYBE THEY PAY since it was their fuck-up.  This assumption that all their clients money is actually theirs to do with what they want is very concerning.  They are not a non-profit after all

Bitfinex= Cyprus ?  In what world does a company think that they have the right to take the money of everyone else BUT themselves to pay for THEIR fuck-up?  
Explain to me how some unauthorized person going into your BTC wallets and taking it without your permission is any different than the shit you guys are about to do to all your customers?  
I was very lucky, I had a decent amount of BTC in Bitfinex 2 weeks ago....moved it into my Trezor but NOT because I was concerned with Bitfinex....which obviously I should have been.  
1. YOU fucked up, you have all the money and all the expertise but apparently can't use a tool correctly (Multisig/Bitgo) WTF is the point of that if your freaking settlement wallet is not also secured? 
2. You have single handedly FUCKED the market multiple times in the past 90 days with your "Software updates".  
If you survive after this it is only due to how few decent options there are and how lazy people are, you really and truly shit the bed for the last time.  My guess is that you are about to get sued in every jurisdiction where you have a license, as you should be.

The site is legit for sure, I have traded there for about a year, and there are some very very big traders on there, like 20k+ feedback.  It is P2P, so yeah I am sure there is some BS in there JUST like there is on LBC or fucking ebay for that matter, but the admins are fair and as long as your not an idiot (i.e. selling an amazon gift card to a dude in Nigera with no feedback for a AMAZING price....then your fine...people are fucking idiots sometimes and then they blame the site not themselves.
Haha, read the article on the arrest, it was like them sitting on a patio taking pictures with a AR 15 and some (probably some little fucking candy ass hipster) called the cops saying there was a sniper. Oh and they had a joint..LMFAO....I am that shady DAILY

Charges were based on some people seeing a gun (AR 15 or something totally legal) and flipping out.  Wasnt it like some pot?  Who cares..haha, legal in half the country.

Yeah, you can log off.  The mods will probably ask the other person about it, get a reply etc.  At the end of the day this is not a turn and burn buy that opens an account and does some shady trades, takes the money and clears out his bitcoin, that guy is doing a bunch of business so I expect it will get sorted.  There is also a chance the store messed up and didnt activate the card, I had that happen once (few years back at a Walgreens) but the cashier flat had NO idea what they were doing.  Another posibility

Can take a couple of hours sometimes, especially on holidays, but if you market it as paid then there is BTC in escrow being held until they look into it.

 I would imagine that is is a error of some kind, 30k trades means that guy is doing a LOT of revenue...I just dont see someone risking that for $60, at least not on purpose.  You checked the balance on the gift card I imagine right  (login to Amazon account and go to gift card area and you can redeem/check balance) .  I would wait for the admins on paxful, they will help you sort it out
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:49:13
That guy has 14000+ feedback....and 36k trades
So my guess is something else might be going on.  Did you open a trade with ANYONE else before that you sent the cards too?  Paxful (like any peer to peer market place) can be full of scammers, like ebay,LBC or craigslist or whatever, but if they have good feedback you should be fine.
Like the other guys said, open a new trade for $60, mark it as paid and send a reference to the other trade to the admins and they will help get it sorted.  
On another note, NO ONE should do trades with anyone under probably 1k feedback EVER on there or Localbitcoins unless it is like face to face.  Be smart (you got lucky here probably,  but if that Best Offer came up some asshole with 10 feedback in Nigeria..DONT GIVE YOUR CARD pics...duh, but people do it then say the whole site is bad when it is just them being MORONS.  In my experience (not a ton, I have used paxful and LBC like maybe 15 times each for btc to play online poker) it has always been fine, but I usually dont take best offer, I look at the offers and pick someone with good feedback.
