What's the best? Coinbase seems to have the most users/reviews.

Interesting. Best of luck of course :)

I'm not currently invested, but I'm watching with interest and definitely seek answers.. you accurately need to determine where the world is headed, and with that confidence, get in early for this to pay off. 
Reaching $2k USD is a nice milestone nevertheless

Considering it's end volume and the shift going towards this type of currency (maybe) - where do you see a single BTC being valued at in 10 years time?
What's stopping other coders making something far more superior in a few years time as technology only advances compared to BTC coding/algorithms?  Is this literally the be-all-end-all? Nothing would ever make this obsolete no?

I would suspect a dip to come soon when whatever is currently happening slows down. 
Could be some big investors buying up a ton of BTC.  I heard people in China/Japan were getting in on it?
I'm not sure, but the rise seems to be actually stupid at this point and without anything to back it.  
I'd keep a VERY close eye on it.  If you plan to invest in some LONG TERM, buy in now and wait 5-10 years.  The price/movement today shouldn't bother you.

Maybe. Don't get me wrong, the overall concept and how this has been done is amazing. 
I wish I knew more about coding myself... but from what I've heard, the coding and algorithms ... it's unique. 
I just think the world is rapidly changing, technology especially, and as with anything in this field, it's a gamble.  Just hoping cryptocurrency becomes the main way we deal. On the other hand, Elon Musk thinks the world will have a global basic income when A.I truly kicks off... just so many variables in the mix.

What price per BTC do you see them going to over "x" years, and what price would you ideally sell them at?

The big banks globally are already hoarding gold for when shit hits the fan.
