I think you'd be better off investing in tinfoil. Easier to make hats out of something real than 1s and 0s.

If I had a jewelry shop, would I need to pay you for referring someone to me so I could sell a gold chain?
No, because gold, a real thing, has a certain real rarity associated with it, which makes people want to buy it without being referred, even if they're not purchasing it as an "investment."

They control inflation by adjusting the money supply. A big no-no for hodlers.

Yes, just ignore all the factors that go into food pricing, like wages, logistics, supply and demand...

Of course he does... one of the guys on the board of PayPal is a major player at Coinbase.... go figure...

Yes, I understand the technology...
You can't give a real world use case in which bitcoin is the solution, however, because there are none. Which means bitcoin has no value at all.

How many people did you refer when it was at 15-20k?

Yes, the blockchain is good technology... which, by the way, is already mostly implemented in most enterprise level databases by way of sharding and nodes... But what makes you think bitcoin is valuable?
Why would I use the bitcoin blockchain to store, say, my company's accounting records when I can just as easily create my own blockchain and not have to pay a fee every time I post a transaction?
Why would my bank use bitcoin to send international payments when there are other blockchains that do it faster and cheaper?
What purpose does bitcoin have outside of pure speculation?
It's even more fucking annoying listening to morons invested in a bubble rationalize their own poor investments by comparing them to things that actually have real value.

You realize USD and EUR have intrinsic value based on the government backing them, as opposed to bitcoin, which has an alias backing it... right?

No, real money is what you pay your taxes in. You know, since you'd go to jail if you paid in bitcoin, since they wouldn't accept it.

Except bullion is a real thing, and forex is the difference in the strength of economies, but whatever you need to believe to keep telling yourself bitcoin is a good investment.

As if crypto markets aren't manipulated? 40% of bitcoin alone is held by 1000 people....

Can you pay your US taxes in bitcoin? That is backing by the government, since they require USD to pay taxes. That is intrinsic value.
By "alias," I mean nobody. Especially since Satoshi could be a monkey behind a computer for all anybody knows.
Why would I store an image in Bitcoin's blockchain for a fee when I can store it on imgr for free? Or implement my own blockchain and not pay a fee for the same benefits as bitcoin? That is no intrinsic value.
Bitcoin is nothing but proof of concept. Newer networks do everything better and have real-world use cases.

But you're selling it on a false premise because you equate 1s and 0s with real things...
