Coinbase really came through!  Not only did they fix my account issue, they also compensated me for fees and inconvenience!  They went above and beyond on this!

No email in spam.  The most frustrating thing besides being out of money is not knowing what happened.

I don't know what's going on with Coinbase, but I really wish I could talk to someone over the phone about my issue.  I sold some bitcoin, and it was supposed to be deposited to my bank account by Friday.  Thursday night the transaction disappeared out of the log.  Unfortunately, my bitcoin has disappeared too.  It's very upsetting to think that your currency has virtually disappeared. I was singing praises about Coinbase to a friend over a week ago.  I can't endorse a company that has money disappearing into crypto-air.
Well guess I was panicking for nothing.  Coinbase is on top of this!   I got a reply today saying that there was a slight problem with a patch and that they are working on restoring the missing BTC.  Thanks Coinbase!  Support really came through.  Now I can keep promoting Coinbase to my friends!
I will update when the issue is resolved to let you guys know the timeframe to resolution.
Last Edit: Coinbase really came through! Not only did they fix my account issue, they also compensated me for fees and inconvenience! They went above and beyond on this!

They did get in contact with me.  They said they had a problem with a patch they released and that it's fixed now and they will work on restoring my BTC!
