Not sure if I am answering the right question - have you seen the stats on the different Ethereum github projects?

Electronjs?  Will give it a test. Thanks

'Central bank CryptoCurrency' seems like an oxymoron.  I am not sure they fully get this yet....

Buying Segway now, how will this help?

That is what I thought too ... but then again confido is still not at zero.

I will simply live in the blockchain.   /s

Why haven't they?  Because honestly it is a pain in the ass ... still...  I say this as an early adopter, someone who received bitcoin from faucets and actually tried mining on a CPU.  For a non-crypto person, the concept of magical 'keys' and 'full nodes' make it a non-starter.  Even for a person who enjoys the challenges, securing your keys is always a concern and presents non-traditional risk.
Things have gotten better but now we have the rise of shit coin scams, overzealous fanboys, and unclear tax guidance.
It is nice to see everyone so excited about crypto but we do have to be realistic.  The idea that everyone cannot own 1 whole bitcoin misses the point of how divisible it is and pushes people to not using it (HoDL).  This is as also arbitrary as saying everyone can't own .5 bitcoin or 10 bitcoin.  If we are now saying bitcoin is only a value store, that doesn't promote development in the cryptospace and doesn't encourage the wealthy to rush out to obtain it.  The extra risk and lack of true hedges make it a tough sell when trying to preserve wealth.

They can do the the same thing on Bitcoin exchanges.
