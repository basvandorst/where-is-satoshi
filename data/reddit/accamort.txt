When you buy and sell shares of a public company, aren't you just paying someone to update an entry in a centralized database (share register)?
There are several other factors to consider.. such as the frequency of the trades, the intentions the the taxpayer, etc.   But your right, we won't really know the correct answer until it's decided in tax court.

Tax return page 2: "Did you own or hold foreign property at any time in the year with a total cost of more than Can$100,000?"

I don't have free power mining isn't that profitable.  Unless the BTC exchange rate doubles on Dec 1st when the block reward halves, which I really doubt, mining just won't be profitable for me. Power bill is too much. 
I've already taken 2 of my GPUs (6950s) and built a sweet gaming computer.  I'm selling the other 2 (5870s) to a friend.  I've preordered a couple BFL Jalepenos so hopefully thats not a scam and I can keep mining some coin

Hello fellow Regina bitcoiner. I would actually consider taking you up on that offer but I'll probably be shutting down my rigs come Dec 1st

Power meter says the 1 machine is pulling around 400-450 watts. 
I just don't think GPU mining will be worth it anymore, even with free power.  I'd rather just recover some of the capital cost and do some gaming

In Canada, capital losses can only be used to reduce capital gains and not business or employment income

Canadian accountant here.
You are required to report all income on your return regardless of which "currency" the transaction happened in.  You just need to convert the amount to CDN$ for your return.
If you just bought some coins and sold them later that sounds like a capital transaction, just like buying and selling shares. Fill out Schedule 3.  Only 1/2 of capital gains are taxed.
I see mining more as a business operation... If your mining income/expenses are significant, fill out a T2125 Business Statement. Since the income is taxable, expenses related to the mining are deductible also.. for example depreciation on hardware and electricity.  
But if your return is this complicated already, you should talk to a professional (maybe one that will accept BTC).  The fee is well worth future hassles and penalties from CRA when you screw something up doing it on your own.
