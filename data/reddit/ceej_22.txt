No its not. We have no way of being sure what the true value of any of this is. It absolutely is a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:26:07
You talking to me or OP? Could apply to both of us.

I've had no problems and withdraw USD daily.

I know. A little tongue in cheek as I find the whole conspiracy theory to be bull shit. They are contrails, and I refuse to use the other term. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:58
I just don't say much and vastly downplay my returns. Don't get then seeing Lambos or they will FOMO their life savings away. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:00:26
This belongs in r/conspiracy with the contrails. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:20:31
This has only been all over reddit for the last 24 hrs. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:42:05
Or the ones who put their life savings in pets.com and held. Holding only works if you are holding the right asset. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:50:48
You sure about that? Pretty sure the article is poorly written and that's how they used to do it but are removing support. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:46:35
What dump are you talking about? If you are looking at the buy/sell orders that's not really an indication of a crash or resistance against a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:45
I swear when I come in here I have to double check to make sure I'm not in a religious or Trump subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:59
Maybe. Easy to say you'll buy more if it drops that much now, but a good portion of those people will hesitate if it falls fast enough. There is a lot of new money in BTC and in the back of their mind they are worried that what their friends are telling them is true and this is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:45
It already is the dotcom boom 2.0
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:27:05
How will we manage the energy usage of bitcoin and it's impact on the environment? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:27
It dipped 20% since I posted that lol. I think a 40-60% dip is quite possible. Yeah 90% is probably a bit unrealistic as well, but from current prices and the volatility of the market 10-20% is a normal day, 40-60% is a bit of a bubble burst and is entirely possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:33:59
I wouldn't be surprised with the US tax bill that just passed. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:06:35
Do you have a source for that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:09
They say the know, but knowing and resisting the urge to act on emotion are two different things. When they wake up one morning and see they've lost 1/3 or more of their value in terms of USD they may start singing a different toon. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:07:23
The thing about T/A charts is they don't predict anything.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:16:54
Extinction event is implied in the last episode. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:36:04
Delusional. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:36:38
You guys have a weird fascination with Buffet. He's probably right in many ways. I believe crypto is here to stay but no way will the thousands of shitcoins all make it. So why would he risk his fortune guessing which cryptocurrencies or tokens will survive. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:07:56
Yeah I mean it's not the same guy. The guy stoked about it hitting $1000 is still stoked at $100k. Just look at long term holders always pointing out how bitcoin is way above what it was a year ago. It's the people that bought at $20k that are freaking out and it will be the people that buy in at $150k, if it gets there, that will freak out at $100k. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:08:32
Investing? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:41:51
Did you last week? If not why? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:33:07
And what is it you know? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:39:05
Except those fees. Why buy with bitcoin and then replacing paying two transaction fees when you could just buy goods with cash and avoid the fees? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:25
Or lobby legislators to make bull shit regulations so you don't have to adapt and kill innovation in the process. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:37:11
Explain. Bitcoin is up 2.2% since yesterday. Had you kept that $6.5 in Bitcoin you'd have $6.67 now. So where does the $4 come from? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:19:26
This is literally the story of every investment. Bitcoin isn't special in that regard. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:32:46
It's terrible lol. And they put in a chicane on the eastbound exit while every entrance with exception for the eastbound movement has zero deflection. Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:32:48
ITT a.m bunch of people making claims about agreements between Mt Gox and the creditors with no sources and conflicting information. Proceed at your own risk. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:24:48
This is fucking terrible design lol. Traffic moving from left to right can just motor right through there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:13:28
As much as I'd like to jump on the bandwagon and call this guy an idiot. This has to be a troll account. Just look at the username.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:57:34
Reading Comp 101. I never said it was going to be fine. All I implied was that you can't definitively say this is a repeat of '14/'15 crash any more than someone else can say this is the bottom of a dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:26:11
Doubtful, your just a troll. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:02:55
Love you too
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:05:37
Cool story bro. Might have to buy some more when that happens. I trust you sold yours so why are you here. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:20:46
The same fucking meme every day. Congratulations. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:11:11
Get out of here with that last statement. You don't know that anymore than the people saying it's about to rebound to new ATH. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:49:38
No that's not what he's saying. He's saying that he won't be able to pay everyone back due to taxes and more costs involved with distribution which is why he is pushing for civil rehabilitation. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:39:34
But that's also dependent on the courts right? If the courts say no to civil rehabilitation and instead demand a sell off and payment to investors in fiat that is beyond his control. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:46:38
Oh you must be mistaken. I'm not trying to vilify him at all and certainly am not determined to do anything in this thread as I believe that was my only post. I'm going to assume you meant to respond to someone else.
Is the American jab suppose to be an insult? That's unfortunate. We are all living on this small planet together. Insulting others for where they are born isn't going to make this world a better place.
