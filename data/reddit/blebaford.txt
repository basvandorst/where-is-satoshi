you can't have a society without roles and expectations that people are born into.  i don't think that's a super useful way to think of collectivism, as by that definition the entire world is collectivist.
the "collectivism" in anarcho-collectivism comes from the idea of collectively owned and managed enterprises, as opposed to enterprises owned by a person or group separate from the workers.

leftist has always meant anti-capitalist, people just find it hard to understand how that would work without gulags because it's not taught in schools or the media

people in a work place get together and decide amongst themselves how the work is to be divided.  this has a collectivist character because people are making decisions as a collective, and it has an anarchist character because there are no bosses.

you wouldn't have to check reddit every five minutes if you had a 6310i :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:23:44
if you're a member of a workers' council that makes a decision you don't agree with, you can either (a) leave, or (b) remain part of the collective and defer to the consensus of the group.  if you choose to do (b) that doesn't mean you're submitting your will to them.  these sorts of consensus decisions would also happen without rulers in an anarchist society.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:03:14
collectivism does not imply a ruler.  you and i can join in a collective right now without either one of us ruling over the other.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:10:21
right, some dude on reddit can define what the terms right, left, and anarchism mean.  forget the way they've actually been used throughout history.
the only way you could have your opinions is if you don't know anything about revolutionary catalonia, which also explains why you didn't answer my question.

so what would you call the anarchism of revolutionary catalonia and why do you keep using left as a noun
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:32:48
okay but can't you have a collective with no rules
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:45:58
i'm not saying i would do it, but makes sense, though i would not do it

you can have a collective with no rules
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:31:24
who to call a leftist is all just semantics and not worth harping on at this point.  but here are some things you may not have been aware of: 
- there are currents of [left/libertarian marxism]( and [anarcho-communism]( which criticized the soviet union from the left, for being authoritarian and not truly giving power to the working class.  these strains of political thought have been totally erased from the media and our political education so i don't blame you for not being aware of it.
- you may be surprised by how many americans take an unfavorable view of capitalism: 
- it's hard to know what those people really mean, or how many organize against capitalism, but from my experience working with the sanders campaign last year i found that maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of the people in the streets supporting bernie were far to the left of him and opposed capitalism.  i also went to one rally in august responding to trump's tacit support for white supremacy, and it was entirely organized by a coalition of anti-capitalist groups.  it's anecdotal but if you go to these things you start to see how much opposition to capitalism there is, and how much it's totally ignored by the media.

@_date: 2018-01-05 08:19:38
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:23:50


agreed, but i don't see why this situation follows from collectivism.  you can have voluntary collectives.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:58:25
yes but only in a sense which is different from the way Charlie used the word
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:59:07
you could still have regulations in the sense of food standards or environmental standards.  but in an ideal anarchist society they wouldn't be enforced by punishment.


that's right, but the idea is that people would want to take care of each other, even if they weren't forced to.  crazy i know.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:06:29






call it what you want.  if rat shit were getting into foodstuffs, people making the food would throw it away or the people responsible for distribution could choose not to distribute it.








the difference is that ancaps value private property, which allows for the accumulation of power.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:59:45
so you're saying a society _based_ on voluntary cooperation must not have any rules.  to believe this you must be taking a very narrow definition of "rule."  but i suppose there's nothing outright wrong with that.
so you've dropped your strange definition and gramatical usage of "far left."  but i still don't see why anarchist collectivism is an oxymoron.  voluntary collectivism.  nobody would ever join a collective voluntarily?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:56:17






then people would get sick?  and the recourse would be to care for the sick, and investigate why rats were able to shit in the food, and why the people didn't throw it away, and why the distributors distributed it.  the response would be directed towards preventing another outbreak by addressing the root causes.


no, that would be personal property, as opposed to private property: 


people would help you with your idea for a fishing net machine, and would look mistrustfully at you if you insisted that you should be the sole owner of the machine.  if they helped you out, why would you be the sole owner?  if you refused their help and built the machine 100% on your own, they may not give you salted meats out of resentment or because you're being weird and trying to shoehorn this idea of property into a society based on sharing.


if there were enough people willing to play your propertarian game such that you could accumulate a ton of salted meats, the remaining anarcho-collectivists wouldn't take your private property thing seriously, and would help themselves to your meat.  after all what could you possibly need 1 ton of salted meats for?  they'll go bad!
so you wouldn't get to the point of having a mansion all to yourself, and if you did it wouldn't be an anarcho-collectivist society, or that attempt at anarcho-collectivism would have failed.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:16:09
the political spectrum in the u.s. is shifted so far to the right that political terminology is rendered meaningless.  the democrats are not leftists.  in fact no democrat will call themselves a leftist because it's a slur in the U.S.  for an example of a party that calls itself leftist, see the [left alliance]( in finland.
saying that a capitalist country (denmark) is as far left as you can get denies the broad base of anti-capitalism around the world. it's the way fox news hosts use the term, and shouldn't be taken seriously.

i don't think they would call it a fork in this context.  case in point is that nobody says LTC is a BTC fork.  they forked the bitcoin code base without forking the coin.  on the other hand, BCH could have re-implemented the protocol from scratch, with the same result of forking the BTC blockchain, but without forking the code base.

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:25:40
I don't understand this.  Increasing block size means there is more data to hash in order to check if a solution is found, which could require more RAM (or more CPU cache, since everyone has well over 8mb RAM).  But why is that a problem?  Miners already have to buy custom hardware; why is it a problem if the optimal hardware needs slightly more RAM?

yeah you're probably right.  i guess i was thinking of desktop machines, which is more relevant to security "for the average person."  in that case, linux is less tested, but there's also less reason for people to design viruses for desktop linux.
this doesn't apply so much in the server world, as server operators are likely to be on top of their shit, and actually do upgrades.  desktop users are more likely to leave gaping holes in their system, and virus developers are more likely to design for windows than for linux.

@_date: 2018-02-14 06:34:26
because $5k to $19k in two months was unsustainable growth, and therefore unstable.  it's unstable because a large portion of people who bought in during that two month period had to be short-term investors looking to double their money then dump, as they did.  $5k to $8k over four months is much more stable, because the people buying in over that longer period are less fickle.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:52:13


right, because the difference between 50k a year and 100k a year is a matter of "basic needs" and not leisure.  you're acting like being happy with less than 6 figures breaks some law of nature.
