Any thoughts on how they calculate the price for final settlement?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:43:41
Right but how easy is it to manipulate that rate?
Example: Hedge fund takes huge short position immediately before contract expires, then pushes down price at the bitcoin exchanges used to calculate reference price.

Literally everyone here uses [SUICA cards]( For many people (like me) they're integrated into cell phones and linked to bank accounts, so essentially your phone becomes a debit card. I use this:
* for every train fare throughout the country (incl bullet trains)
* at every convenience store in the country
* at every shop inside the major train stations (incl restaurants, cafes, clothing, flowers, coin lockers, etc)
* with every vending &amp; tobacco machine
* at every parking meter in the major cities
* for most taxis in the major cities
* at most major supermarkets
* at some major hotel chains
And we've had this for at least 6-7 years now.
Further, the entire Japanese banking system is interconnected and it's possible to wire funds to anyone else's account from any bank or ATM for a flat 315 JPY ($3.20 USD) fee. If you punch in their bank and account number, their name pops up. No messy routing or ACA numbers. It just works and has been for over 20 years.
So based on my experience, the use of digital money is well on its way here. In fact, I'd say that Tokyo is way ahead of any other place I've personally visited in the last few years (NY, SF, LA, Sydney, HK, SG, London, Paris...).

Apologies, you're right. The 5-7 is actually from Dec. Since Jan I think 15 days is more accurate for JPY withdrawals. I will update my post. Thanks for pointing that out. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:05:47
Yes, agree fully. Their USD withdrawal issues are well known. Same for JPY withdrawal delays (daily 100m JPY limit from their parent bank Mizuho). But why they're having BTC withdrawal issues has yet to be explained clearly. Let's hope it is in fact just a system bug on their end.

Heh, yeah. The deposit I put in today via JapanNet literally got verified within about 90 seconds.

JPY withdrawals *are* being processed. One of our guys requested a withdrawal on Jan 17th and received his JPY **today** (Feb 21st JST). Obviously it's gonna be WAY longer now since their withdrawal queue is more slammed than it was on Jan 17th, but it gives Gox's operation some small tiny teeny weeny amount of legitimacy. Take it how you wish.

haha, ever the options trader. its still the wild west in these parts, but getting better post gox.

Don't you find it interesting that at precisely a time of crisis we are flooded with paywall'ed links? 
Support good journalists! They're mostly good people, and they actually make a difference.

Or you can just price in deflation into your loan's interest rate. For example, if you agree to borrow at +3% real rates and adjust for the going -2% deflationary rate, then your overall nominal interest rate will be +1%. So every year you just pay +1% and this accounts for both the risk the lender is underwriting and the deflation of your currency.
Not that I ever expect anyone to actually make loans and investments in bitcoin. It'll stay reserved to the online 'Commons' economy, which in time could be very large indeed.

I was there. ~~Building owner~~ Another tenant got pissed and called cops. We got kicked away for not having a license to protest (yes, such a thing exists).  Talked to police later at the station and they are on our side. Will try to be back up Monday. 
In the end, ~~building owner~~ the other tenant was also sympathetic after we told him Gox wouldn't return our money or coins! All good. Thx for support!

They are out there in the snow trying to drum up media attention (and in fact WSJ and CoinDesk were there covering it). The guy on the left flew all the way from UK for this. So fuck you. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:13:45
Thanks for that! Missed it. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:00:27
Just some mBTC to test it out. Wanted to see if system issues were two way or not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:25:30
I agree ads are awful, but good journalism requires investment. Let's hope they implement a BTC paywall/microtransaction solution soon.

Can you elaborate a bit more how 1MB excludes you?
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:20:22
This is why we can’t have nice things (ETFs, more institutional money, etc).

DMM began as a hardcore porn site. It now has other businesses including a crypto exchange, but porn still accounts for about a third of revenue

You just snipped every "but" to fit your message. Here's the full context:


For the record, NK has been linked to sophisticated hacks on Sony, NY Fed, etc. They're not in the Stone Age when it comes to cyber attacks.

Didn't ethereum scale successfully last month? I never actually use it so wouldn't know first hand, but that was my understanding.

Wait, doesn't everyone get 3% off all purchases then? Gyft gives 3% discounts to bitcoin users right? 
So: user's bank -[USD]-&gt; coinbase -[bitcoin]-&gt; honey -[bitcoin]-&gt;  gyft -[gift card]-&gt; amazon -[purchased product and 3% points at gyft all for same price!]-&gt; user
