Yeah Mt Gox joke, not saying these exchanges can’t be hacked. But the territory’s a lot different these days than it was than. Time will tell!

BTC is the worse because of the volume/congestion. Not good for smaller transactions at the moment. I would try 1am.

I’m aware. The CEO ChenPeng Zhao was the CTO of OKCoin a few years back. He left and now we have Binance (Binary finance). I like what their doing and don’t sense any shadyness.

But the crash didn’t harm anyone, wait unless they didn’t HODL.

Not nearly as often as COINBASE! And they don’t fuck with that insider trading BS either. I’d rather use kraken than coinbase.

Best to try in the early AM (1AM). Have time.gov open and submit your transaction # at the change of the hour SHARP.  Works like a charm every time over here.

I don’t actually use kraken or fuckbase. Gemini &amp; Binance FTW.

I leave everything I own on the exchange other than what I can put on my Trezor. The price is too volatile in crypto and I  want to be able to trade on the fly and that is the only way to do so.

Evening, usually things die down by that time or in the early am (1-3).

I don’t use coinbase so not sure if they add anything but when I sent some BTC the other night out was $5.00

What is a soft fork?

CNBC should post how much more reliable Gemini is than fuckbase.

14Billion dollars daily in volume, 100K or even 1Mill ain’t gonna move the needle. And to why anyone would sell? The reasons are endless, taking profits, scared it’s a bubble, paying for mining equipment, ect.
