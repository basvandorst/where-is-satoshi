I don't really understand the point you are making. You can't compare the results of a hedge fund that has to allocate positions for maybe many $10-$100MM (whilst minimizing the risk for their investors) with a day-trader who can enter and exit the market at will and who is watching charts and tracking price action all day.

I've probably made over 5000 trades since January, and the net result is that I'm up over 1200% in my BTC holdings, that is more than enough proof that my strategy is working. The only question is how much variance there is in the profitability of my strategy I.e. maybe the statistical range of probability of my strategy given the sample size is somewhere in the realm of 750-1400%. This would mean I ran slightly above average and as a result yielded a bit more profit.

crypt0c4t gave a good answer, that is if you understand the mechanisms behind short-selling. People shorting eventually have to buy back to close their positions, this means that when shorts are at a very high level you have a bunch of undisclosed buy pressure sitting at the sidelines that will eventually be released, this acts as driver for prices.

This is completely wrong. I myself trade short-medium term movements and I'm up over 1200% in BTC value and around 400-500% in fiat value since I started trading 9 months ago. I also didn't even use leverage, I just traded spot. Even if you used a coinflip to determine your positions you would still be right 50% of the time, anything greater than that and you become profitable.

He asked why people betting on the price going down vs the price going up moves the price itself and the answer you gave him was wrong.
