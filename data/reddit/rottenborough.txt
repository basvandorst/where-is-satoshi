Uh, exactly? It doesn't have to be considered "hurt" by everyone on the internet for it to be real to them.

... which is something that plays on people's expectations by breaking commonly held assumptions in order to elicit laughter.

The original comment was relevant to the discussion. Your reply is what's farming upvotes.

Really? Personally I think he's a Ra worshipper.

Can you give some specific examples? Because I'm thinking about things like Bitcoin, free software, Occupy movements, human rights and animal rights movements, environmental movements, our local secular food banks, and I'm trying to figure out how few institutions other than churches can gain momentum in grassroots efforts to make an impact.

Don't need to put it there yourself. There will always be friends tagging you in photos with location enabled.
In the words of Stewart Lee, social media is "a state surveillance agency staffed by gullible volunteers".

I usually downvote "lol"s on reddit. But really, what else are you supposed to say here?

It doesn't sounds like he's buying bitcoin to participate in the economy. It's just an extremely risky investment.

Regulating as in "organizations must identify all users of bitcoin in order to prevent money laundering, and report all suspicious activities."


Not quite the freedom you're accustomed to in the West.

Regulations from the top level tend to be vague in China. People in the middle (owners of websites, forums; financial and tech institutions, etc.) err on the side of caution when determining the detailed implementations, in fear of getting shutdown. People down at the very bottom though, are always trying to figure out ways to get around the detailed implementations. If they succeed, people in the middle get into trouble for having ineffective implementations.
Basically the way Chinese politics work is that the middle and the bottom are locked in constant fights with each other, while people at the top sit and wait to reap the benefits. The only way Bitcoin is going to get anywhere is if they're the ones who profit or come out looking good.

Nope, you can't accept it as currency. What you *can* do, is *trade* your goods with your online *trading partners' virtual goods* called bitcoin.
A lot may come down to how local authorities and financial institutions implement the policy.

Thank you, sir!

It's funny to me how the discussion in the US is "how good is bitcoin for money laundering" where the Chinese government just went ahead and said "we'll stop it from happening."

Well, Shihuangdi was fairly effective, except for the part where murdered scholars and burned scholarly texts. Sure, the Han scholars weren't exactly fair to him, but there were good reasons why they hated him so much.
That and he consumed mercury regularly in an attempt to become immortal, so he couldn't have been that effective towards the end of his reign.

Can you toss a Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:51:02
Yep, and if fedora was bitcoin I'd have another bitcointip.
