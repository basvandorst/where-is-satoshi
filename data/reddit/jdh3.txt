One miner running on the network could process the all transactions. The only tricky thing would be waiting 2 weeks for the difficulty to correct.  There would be a huge back log for 2 weeks. Then  super easy difficult adjustment.  People would be scrambling for any old usb asic they could find. Gold rush on old asic machines.

Let’s see I’ve had 2 people this week willing to sell their vintage collectible  cars for btc and just went to a listing of a house that wanted btc.  I don’t see a problem here. 
Been here for 5 years.  You?

This is where a smart contract would come into play but I think we are still a long time away before this can happen.
Hopefully soon!  This is what makes a smart contract so amazing.  To know for sure ..trustless

I'm tired of it as well.  Drama

You need to set up your router to allow it.  Took me a couple hours of searching around to get it to work.

It’s usually people that heard about it and never bought in. Now they see the ATH’s and are feeling regret.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:28:19
Yes , every time I feel scared to buy. It always ends up being the best purchase I’ve made.

Meme pool getting spammed by small transactions while bch is being pumped.
Basically btc is being attacked right now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:49:04
Yeah this..best I’ve used so far 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:36:33
Now that I look at it I think your right.  I just assumed it was the standard micro transaction spam as before . 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:41:32
Yes, coin base 
Wire transfer is pretty easy to setup.  You lock in the rate when you buy and it appears 4-7 days later.
Debit is instant but limited.

I’m doing the same.  Should we block nodes not running the latest?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:26:18
 
 
This is why mining should be allowed simply running a full node.  Like the original bitcoin allowed.  When people had to start building huge dedicated mining machines it was leading to this.  Fighting for control.  Miners vs users

I get what your saying but I don't think it would be all at once .
Can you imagine all those miners just waiting for a 50 percent mining difficulty drop ? You would not be able to buy the worst USB stick miner for under a .25 btc. 
Maybe I should start buying up old USB miners /s

Hash rate drops, difficulty drops...back on track in a week.
Can we find a new FUD angle?

I’ve used them for 3 years.  Never a problem unless the market is going thru the roof or crashing .  Basically you need to buy your coins there and move them out later to your own wallet.

Its been almost immediate for me yesterday and today.  Though I had some problems with them on a ether withdrawal. 2 weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:06:42
Thanks from me too...
I didn't know the private keys would be the same..but now that Im thinking about it that's a pretty easy concept to grasp.  I'm sure this question has been and will be asked often.
