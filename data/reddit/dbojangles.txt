For those that aren't aware, there is a plan to "strike" BTC at the next difficulty adjustment (1800+ blocks away at time of writing).

Tried to link in original post but it got removed by automod -.- not a fan of the rules in this sub. Hence the vaguery

my post got removed for mentioning r/btc originally. Wanted this to get through. Moderation here is shooting itself in the foot.

to be fair I'm probably generalizing a bit, yeah. But there have been more than a few posts of this nature in the past week, just wanted to call attention to it.

I get where you're coming from, but I still think that as long as there is a fixed supply of BTC, it will be a store of value rather than cash.

Very cool infographic. I think benchmarking bitcoin's marketcap with gold is the most useful comparison. Segwit/scaling options to improve transactions are great, but with a fixed supply, Bitcoin is squarely in the realm of a digital store of value. I know that outcome would be disappointing to a lot of people here, but I think that is increasingly how it's perceived in the investing world. Which I think is great. Bitcoin has proven itself to be a remarkably secure means of storing and accounting for value. Other cryptocurrencies can and should take up the "digital cash" effort. BTC is digital gold.

So, pay two transaction fees that will likely cost more than the pizza itself?

Not every Bitcoin user has a spare 100+gb. This is not practical or efficient. Props to everyone running a full node and supporting the network, but if BTC is gonna be successful 99% of people should not have to even know what a full node is.

Considering avg tx fees, I don't think my comment was misinformed. I don't want to pay an extra $2 for a slice or a whole damn pie just to pay with Bitcoin over other accepted payments. Is that crazy?
