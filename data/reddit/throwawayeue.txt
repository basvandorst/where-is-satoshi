It is definitely because of Bitcoin futures ending this afternoon and whales attempting to manipulate the market. Bitconnect, bubble popping, etc. are all just side affects that were waiting for this. Bitcoin will see better days though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:15:39
Which is what originally gave Bitcoin value. But is that still true today? Does anyone have data for this?

**Banging the Close**: A manipulative or disruptive trading practice whereby a trader buys or sells a large number of futures contracts **during the closing period of a futures contract** (that is, the period during which the futures settlement price is determined) in order to benefit an even larger position in an option, swap, or other derivative that is **cash settled** based on the futures settlement price on that day.

Why try to be anonymous and then post on forums as Hal? Like it would be possible for no one to know Hal so why do we know him? Because he doesn't care to stay anonymous like Satoshi does.
I think the smartest thing you can do to stay anonymous is to let someone that is also very smart and interested in your creation to be the person the media sees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:28:53
I'm sorry but if he was smart he would have sold at a number of highs throughout the years that bitcoin hit. No one could have predicted where it is now, no point in reminiscing.

It's definitely possible Magnitsky was killed by the other billionaires. But this is only a short list of Putin opponents that have died from mysterious circumstances. Here's a list of 10: 
How many of his opponents must mysteriously die before he could be likely responsible? If 20 more die but there's not direct link to Putin can you still defend him?

I got interested in 2014 but I was too poor to buy any ��
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:44:17
We need easier ways to use it so it's not confusing AF to the average person
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:54
I've updated my comment above with multiple examples. Even if Putin was not aware of many of these, after he was made aware he has given awards to the murderers. Also please don't assume where I'm from because I was not born in either Europe or USA :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:44:23
In 2014 it spiked to about 700. But yes true I didn't have the vision because I thought it would go back down.

There are multiple opponents of Putin that have been murdered. There is camera footage of one. There is no doubt Putin is popular in Russia when you will literally get murdered if you criticize him too much.
**Some examples:**
* Boris Nemtsov - on video being shot by an assassin
* Denis Voronenkov - shot outside of his hotel
* Alexander Litvinenko - Poisoned by the Kremlin after accusing Putin of murdering ANOTHER Putin opponent. FUNNY ENOUGH, the British found out Andrei Lugovoi was one of the murderers in this case, but not only did Russia refuse to extradite him, he was given a medal for "services to the motherland." 
* And the most popular: Sergei Magnitsky - beaten in prison and then refused medical attention. He was investigating massive tax fraud by Russia's elite billionaires including Putin.

Exactly, which is why his reasoning is off. 729k is the only real number we have to go off of
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:08:12
Are you saying that Tron and Ethereum are actively paying developers 6 figure salaries to work on it? Then yes. If you are saying their market cap is large? Then obviously no and you are purposely misunderstanding my argument.
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:11:49
Ya but also some people might have less than a bitcoin in two separate wallets that might equal more than a bitcoin together. In fact I would say this situation is more likely than an individual owning more than one bitcoin in multiple wallets, so I feel his reasoning is off
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:37:45
Uhm, yes you can. The more money there is in a sector, the more talent that is attracted to it. The more talent in a space, the more likelihood that a 1% genius comes into the space. That's basic economics. You're right that you can't just create 10 of them, but you can increase the chance that more come. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:28:16
I mean, maybe not USD but credit cards sure

There are more benefits to blockchain than just cryptocurrency. Centralized does not matter there.
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:26:38
No because you can't have transparency with a database. You can't have accountability either. Block chain is more than a database.......

Legit question, should I buy XCOM 2 for xbox one? Sorry if this is the wrong sub
@_date: 2019-06-09 04:42:25
OK but you clearly bought other currencies afterwards so would be the same whether you bought more bch or btc or eth because everything follows btc
@_date: 2019-06-08 22:59:29
IRS stuff affects all coins so saying you use other coins makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-06-08 23:01:54
All coins are capital loss if you bought them at the peak and spend them now.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:35:45
V true. It allows the economy to transform to a more democratic economy, one that the people want, without government laws getting in the way 
@_date: 2019-06-09 05:00:28
Well, when you bought the xmr, you could have bought btc instead. Simple as that. Then you would still have capital loss. So doesn't make sense to say xmr has capital loss when both btc and xmr have that
@_date: 2019-06-09 04:52:39
Doesn't really make sense to do that. If you can sell any coins for a loss, you could potentially just have sold bitcoin for a loss. Not some trash coin like tron. So like, I'm saying you shouldnt do that again in the future
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:29:57
That makes no sense. If you bought btc at 10k and bought something with it right now, it would be a capital loss event. I don't think you know what you're talking about
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:53:21
Because we all use it every day?
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:52:25
Ah that makes sense. So does that mean fees will continue to be more and more expensive as the amount of coins to be mined dies down, or will it stay the same?
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:41:12
Just looked at your comment history. Out of curiosity, do you do anything in life other than troll crypto subreddits?
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:16:05
Meh, no one said he was a newbie.
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:09:56
Guys I have a question. If there is a limit on bitcoin amount, then who will maintain the ledger once there are no more coins to mine? Probably not the right thread for this but worth a shot
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:21:34
Imagine going from $735 to ~$3700 in the span of 2 years and people being disappointed in it.

There's no such thing as being "pushed out". He can simply hold if that happens.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:23:00
There is a certain btc price in which I would consider buying a full suit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:46
Well, it's below 9 now
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:15:46
Still, given its history, you can get profits in bitcoin if you're just patient. But no one ever is.
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:26:31
That's not how markets work. No one would buy bitcoin at $20k right now 
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:13:12
There is a guy who mints these coins with private keys printed on them for people to use. However it requires you trust this dude (although his reputation is all over the internet with people that already bought them) and idk if these coins are the same
Taking them to the bank tho....Jesus

His power level is 173,773,098,426!!!!

It might get deleted because people might mistake it as financial advice. I mean half the people that upvoted it did so why wouldn't they.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:11:02
What? No that would suck. Imagine how boring a random developing country that you have no personal ties to would be. All your friends and family are in another country and can't visit you easily. Your favorite restaurants and food are nowhere to be found. You have nice things but no one to share them with. I'd rather not.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:54:54
At least* imo
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:47:21
Lol alright mister why don't you try and show all this data on one chart? Including the highs and lows of every single rally and crash? Oh wait you can't do that with a normal scale because too small of a increment in the y axis makes the graph stupid large, and too big makes the beginning 6 years a straight line.  
Given bitcoins meteoric success, a log graph is the only way to show this data.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:13:07
Well he literally mentions the log scale in his comment so idk what you're talking about
