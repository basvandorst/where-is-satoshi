A lot of people don't like ethereum here because people used to be spamming about it trying to get people to adopt it, but a 970 will earn a couple of bucks a day mining ethereum. I would recommend running the nicehash miner benchmark and plugging in your results to whattomine.com to see your potential earnings and what is best right now. If you need any help you can pm me. Gpu mining is not dead yet people!

Actually it's its own coin!

I told this to another guy a minute ago, with a high end GPU you NEED to be mining altcoins if you want to actually pay off the electricity. also it can't be sha 256 or scrypt altcoins either because those have asics.

I suggest you go learn both what a pyramid scheme is and what  a bitcoin is because we are all sick of people like you here on Also there is a "Common Myths" Article on the bitcoin wiki that you can see on the right hand side which explains why it is NOT  pyramid scheme.

I can see you've already gotten a lot of advice, but I just thought I'd give you a couple tips. Search the ENTIRE computer for a file called "wallet.dat" and if you find one, get a bitcoin wallet program and import that as a wallet. Also search any flash drives, google drives, random sticky notes, text documents, etc for a random string of letters that I believe usually begins with 5. This could be a private key that you can also import into a wallet program to get to his money. If you do find his bitcoins, you can exchange them for cash on a number of exchanges such as btc-e, bitstamp, and coinbase. I believe coinbase has the best system for withdrawing in USD.

Moore's law is the computer one, murphy's law is anything that can go wrong will go wrong. On the issue of Moore's law we can keep improving 2D chips at the same rate for at least a decade more, and after that we'll just make 3D chips viable, eventually make quantum computers on the same scale as modern computers, or some other solution.

Hasn't the price gone up like crazy since the spam started though? I realize now I should've bought as soon as I saw people were spamming it and left before the bubble bursts.

I thought they were only banning PURCHASES of VPN services using PayPal? It was my understanding that you would still be able to use a VPN and use PayPal.

I see. Guess we will never really know what effect the spam had on it, it just doesn't seem like it would hurt the price.

If I memorize my electrum seed and put my bitcoins on one of the addresses, and then the electrum servers all mysteriously shut down the next day, can I still recover my bitcoins? I tried to research it and it seems like electrum simply does a sha512 hash on the UTF-8 seed and uses that as a password for... something? As long as I can go Electrum seed -&gt; Private key without electrum I will feel comfortable using the wallet but I want to make sure.  
TL;DR How do I go from Electrum seed to Private Key list manually?

-Most uses of tor are for legal activities  
-This won't stop the illegal activities  
-I support the legalization of most of the illegal activities done through deep web anyway
