My employer will not pay me in bitcoin, I live in albania, the fact that I get paid in euro is a godsend. What I'm trying to do is get EUR in albania to USD in the states as cheaply as possible and I hear bitcoin works for that. The issue is that as many services I explore and verify, they all have hidden fees or poor rates which make it so I might was well just do the old fashioned wire transfer.

I have a greater understanding of that, but through verifying my id through 5 different services now, nothing is getting me closer to the process of how to transfer it cheaply. Is it through wire-transfer? Cash in hand? Debit/credit purchase? How specifically is everyone buying and selling to have such a cheap rate?

Alright, thanks for the help. That's the major hurdle I was trying to wrap my head around.

I guess im just not quite understanding how to set it up and how to use this system in that way. Where do you buy and sell for it to be a few cents?

Why shouldn't I be? I can see how much I have on either side by transferring 100EUR, whichever puts more USD in my account is the better option, isn't it? One issue I'm running into is I don't live in a SEPA country.

Okay youre starting to make more sense. This comment totally contradicts the first comment however that says bitcoin always wins, but If I'm paid in bitcoin and I transfer only bitcoin its nothing but if my end goals are cash than its different.
Edit: I understand your logic behind comparing it to the triangle inequality, however the variables are what makes it confusing. If I pay a 40 euro fee to send money bank account -&gt; bank account than that's one constant, however if it cost less than that 40 euro to go bank-&gt;exchange-&gt;wallet-&gt;exchange-&gt;bank than it isn't quite the triangle inequality.
