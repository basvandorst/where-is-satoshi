Sounds like a good one for r/writingprompts.

Satoshi would disagree fwiw.

That seems like a pretty loose metaphor man. If we are going to go "patronizing eli5" for this conversation, I'd contest with this: 
What if we say bitcoin is like a farmer's market where the miners are the farmers (because the miners are actually producing stuff from scratch with their resources),  and the users/hodlers (one and the same) are the customers. 
If you tell all the farmers to piss off, our "farmer's market" next weekend will just be a bunch of confused hippies standing in the street with nothing to buy.
Edit: also, is the answer you gave to my question that "buy and sell orders are the new voting power?" Because that's a bit silly and can't be right. Hodlers aren't really making any buy and sell orders, so they would have no power, and an automated trading bot would have massive power.

It seems that we may soon find out. 
I have held coins for awhile, so I reckon I'm part of the economic majority (whatever that vague phrase means) but I definitely could not help fill the void left by a miner-exodus.

I can confirm this. I don't have the technical skillset to evaluate the two protocols personally, but the heavy handed moderation in favour of core is a real turn off and had made me skeptical of their intent.

Actually it could be a good result to have a couple days of volatility shake out among the current community before the influx of "less-hardened" traditional investors buy in on Monday.  It's going to be an interesting next little while in any case.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:39:04
Whatever man, miners do create both the new coins and the transaction blocks that even let a hodler bring their coins back onto the market (which is what I think you're convolutedly saying creates "new" coins). You aren't going to convince me with this sort of rambling jibberish, and I'm pretty sure you're a troll so lets just go our separate ways.

I'd be interested to learn the reason for that comment not appearing as well. Because it was magnificently timed in the context of the discussion. any news?
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:21:48
Well said
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:04:13
An immutable blockchain is one that can never be altered after-the-fact. These guys are referencing an issue where, as I understand it, some sort of bug caused the bulk of the ethereum community to agree to roll back some exploitative transactions to prevent a thief from having a huge pool of ether, with which said thief might manipulate the market. The group that didn't agree with rolling back the blockchain hard-forked away and created a separate coin and chain called ethereum classic.
For your second question: I can't say that I've found any crypto to be well-suited for retail yet. The price growth make it more compelling to collect and hold, which had been a rewarding approach for many here. Also, most vendors don't accept crypto yet so it's a bit of a life burden to make crypto purchases for any more necessities than a novelty purchase like this. As for which crypto could be well suited for retail... I am not technical enough to say.
E: words
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:45:36
That's super easy to manipulate compared to hash power, and literally does not give any strength to the most common type of bitcoin user currently: those holding and not transacting. 
I can't believe people are actually considering this a good idea. It feels like shooting ourselves in kneecap.
edit: u/niggo372 It took me awhile to realize that you're the same person I'm already arguing with in this thread. You literally just went through the process of arguing with me and then went back to the comment at the beginning of our discussion and repeated the same statement that IMO I had just disproven. It's like groundhog day.
Would you please respond to the counterpoint I provided in the other thread of comments from the VERY SAME comment you just replied to, in which I discredited the very-basic statement you've just parroted again? [Here is the comment for your convenience]( in case that comment doesn't show [**directly** above]( this post for you as it does for me.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:44:06
I'm not convinced by that argument, but that's unimportant because I'm not a miner. Perhaps in time we will all get a first hand look at what they decide they "have" to do.
Edit: also the phrase "economic majority" seems pretty vague, could you help me understand whom specifically is included in this potential all powerful decision-making body that's intended to replace the miners in voting power? It's being tossed around pretty liberally this week, but seems on par with an airy platitude like "freedom-lover."
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:40:01
Thanks for the detailed and civil reply friend. I'll add my thoughts on each point below, but the single critical flaw I see in your entire argument is the comparison you make between a trading bot having to fight the "economic majority" and a malicious miner having to fight the hash power majority.  While these things may be similar in mechanism, they are not at all similar in barrier-to-entry.  Any whale, organization, or government could absorb far far more than "quite a few BTC for fees" in the grand effort to dictate the future of bitcoin. If the trading bot is good, then it would be offsetting those fees, and a malicious individual could just be ping-ponging their liquid coins in and out of this bot (trade them away, buy them back, repeat).  This is in direct contrast to how challenging it would be for that same whale or organization to build enough mining power to act successfully as a malicious miner competing with the majority hash power. As I understand it, this is 100% by design, and this principle is fundamental to how bitcoin functions.  Voting based on bot-trading/transactions would become a contest of technique (with the least-honorable party finding the most success), which IMO can be manipulated far more easily that a contest of raw computing power... which is why the protocol was designed as it currently stands.
As for the other points you made:


I disagree strongly that people who don't transact have very limited interest in changes to the transaction mechanism.  I would love nothing more than to be able to live day-to-day on BTC but I do not *currently* transact often because of the ecosystem as it stands *right now.* I have seen many others that share this sentiment. More specifically:
* It is inconvenient *currently* to find daily necessities with BTC, because few vendors are accepting it today.
* The volatility and current growth makes it extremely compelling to hold *until* longer-term consistent price has been reached.
* And, less relevant to me because of the above two, but of note: fees are currently really high for small purchases. Buying a beer with BTC is, in effect, paying extra for a novelty.
For these reasons I don't believe that the vast majority of current users are included in what you'd call the "economic majority." I do not think they would have more of a say with this new wild-card, untested mechanism (literally the angle of taking a UASF approach is a week old, pretty bold to be calling it anything like "the answer" already). It seems like we are shifting the strength from one group that is already functioning as designed (miners) to another difficult-to-define group (exchanges? bots? the CIA?) whose votes would be far less accountable to any sort of measurement; and far less resistant to manipulation by a small malicious group.


I strongly disagree with this claim and can't wrap my head around how you'd make it. There are **many** groups that would benefit by maintaining the current global fiat status quo and seeing bitcoin fail.  For one easy example: banks.


I think I've argued my case against transactions being the heart of voting power above, but if you feel there's a gap in my argument I'd be happy to discuss it more deeply.


I also want bitcoin to be a currency that is used for transactions, but the fact of the matter is that the ecosystem is not well suited to that **yet.** The bulk of BTC's users are not using it for transactions currently, and are, therefore, distinctly *not* included in the vague "economic majority," as it seems they are being led to believe.  So by giving all voting power to transactions, *right now,* I think we would see exchanges, day traders, and trading bots have all decision making power for the entire future of BTC in a fashion that seems highly open to Sybil attack.
Two cents deposited!

Great catch. I second your wtf?
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:56:59
It seems like that could be easily manipulated with a trading bot (further incentivizing bot traders), and on the flip side it seems like coins being held will have no voting power (because no transactions are being made). Perhaps I am missing something.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:30:15
Sorry, I thought a node was as inexpensive to set up as buying a cheap computer or a raspberry pi with a hd. How could that sort of structure be credible as the voting mechanism behind bitcoin?

You can use a debit card on Circle. IMO it's the easiest way to get coins.  The downside is you're limited to $100/week to start.

Its an app to send money, and actually while I was digging up this link I read that they're distancing themselves from Bitcoin a bit.  At the time of writing you're definitely still able to buy and send BTC.
