Try telling that to Paul Tudor Jones

I  think in this case, bias is what they are referring to...

As every counter argument you pose includes an insult, it sounds like you are the one who needs  to qualify yourself for this conversation, do you even know how a nonce works? You sound uneducated and like you’re all for tyranny. Dorsey is a 1984 big brother. If that’s the kind of world you want to live in, enjoy, and leave the important discussions to the adults.

Totally, until they moderate your transaction because “arbitrary reason”

I like how he censors his platform. Shows he’s not ill-intentioned.

Bitcoin is constantly evolving. That’s what BIPs are for. If you think governments, bankers or tech bros like jack don’t want to influence development you are not paying attention.

Not yet, with people like Dorsey influencing core development you can wind up shifting closer to the shitcoin side of the spectrum. reversible transitions / Censorship is a slippery slope, and why we don’t want arbitrary decision makers

Derivatives are not debt

God he’s fucking awful. Stupid ass bitch censors his own platform... you know, the opposite of censorship resistance.

Looks real in the video, these things are a great concept. If you’ve ever looked on some of the 3D modeling subs you can’t even tell if they are real or CG. Pretty amazing

You can tell by the lighting it’s a 3D model and not an actual prototype. It wouldn’t have a shadow on the front yet the wall behind it is lit up like a summer day.

Bitcoin &amp; crypto currency are on the precipice of becoming know to main stream consumers. I advocate often, however millennials are barely starting to become familiar. So Snap is a good intro to spread the word...

Max Keiser was the first place I heard about BTC  when he said to buy when it was sub 1 cent.

They will be left holding an empty bag when another Carrington event hits.

I would expect reporting like this from MSM

James Altucher,  he’s a super smart guy. he’s also currently working on becoming a standup comedian. Isn’t that ridiculous?! Lol

The choice of nonce is the solution no?
