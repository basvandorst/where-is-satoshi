The spirit of college Gameday is to make signs, in an effort to make it onto TV. I was trying to promote crypto in the a way that still relates to me.
I feel slighted because security allows signs promoting Venmo for beer money. I was promoting Crypto for college education. Gotta hustle to make ends meet. I wish i got into crypto earlier, it would have funded my college education

The technology behind this was pretty cool, I got to learn a lot.  I used a QR code generator to point to a website hosted on Amazon S3. Its plain HTML, as any styling wasn’t really needed.  I edited the QR code in photoshop to include the logos for BTC, ETH, and LTC. I figured these were the most popular, and had the most familiarity. I wanted to make a sign that would promote crypto as much as possible.  If i peaked the interest of a few college students,  this would have all been worth it. 
Making the website also allowed me to demonstrate the concept that I'm currently learning in my Computer Information System class.

Last week, espn GameDay came to my school. I was all hyped, camped out Friday night with my friends and woke up early Saturday to get a spot in the pit. 
I had my sign ready, which compiled with all the school rules l, and was super excited to be on tv. Well, when I was going thru the security, they told me that they won't let me take my sign in because it was a form of 'personal endorsement.' The rules said nothing about personal endorsements. The rules were simple; no political statement and no derogatory comments. Oh and signs that were asking people to venmo them money for beer and such were allowed. How's that not personal endorsement??
To make a long story short, the staff ripped my sign in two and just threw it away.
