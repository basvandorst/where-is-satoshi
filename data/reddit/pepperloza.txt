A decade is enough?

Well, PayPal right now is good, for our current needs, it’s a payment facility. However, Bitcoin and its technology is far greater and more important for our future and how we will manage/ use our money. PayPal can only work if its connected to your debit card or credit card which in turn are connected to a bank, therefore it doesn’t really do much for anyone who doesn’t have such facilities, ie people in developing or 3rd world countries.  So Bitcoin has the potential to encompass everyone without discrimination. It is peer to peer. It is a developing tech,  and its potential is much bigger than we can realise at this point. Bitcoin could very well end world hunger, poverty and shift the balance of wealth. I advice you to dig a little deeper in your research so that you can fully understand why PayPal and Bitcoin aren’t really up for comparison. It’s almost like comparing the postal services with email.

It's a new technology that is and will produce new ways in which we deal with money. It is digital. Most People invest in it because it is the future and solves alot of problems that fiat currency currently creates. Also with Bitcoin because it has a public ledger, should any criminal activity need to be uncovered it can be. It is traceable unlike fiat cash. If you really want to understand what it is do some research and cover all angles. At the end of the day people can throw opinions but understandably we need to look at the facts and open our minds to how revolutionary this new technology is.

If this isn't a sign to get people to invest in BTC , I don't know what is. Another economy crash seems to be on the horizon.

I cannot wait until the day comes when I don't have to walk into a bank or a government institution and be at the whim of a moody , power tripping human being.
