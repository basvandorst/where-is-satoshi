I agree with your sentiment. One of people's favorite gripes is that Bitcoin is not backed by anything. You point about transaction costs hints towards what it is backed by, it is backed by technological adepteness of a society i.e. ability to create mining hardware and availability of energy. Any nation which can tick one or both of theses boxes can control Bitcoin.

And the crappy asics will need tonnes of shielding to handle all the radiation. The error rates will be huge. Cooling won't be an issue though, most of the ASIC blades is heatsink so some tight packing is possible.

You have a 15day cooling period for 2fA disable at Btc-e. If you are away from any trading during this time the hacker will access your funds at the end of it. But which day trader stays away for 15 days ?

Just wondering if there are any medical institutions or profesaionals in Botswana accepting BTC, other wise some localBTC dealer will have to buy back these donations for a good cause. Anyone on holidays there want to pick up the BTC ?

If I give away a dollar bill they will still have to hold on to a piece of paper. One night after a fair bit of drinking I took out $200 from the ATM and gave it to a random girl. She said I am not having s** with you, but held on the money.

Just the fiat will not survive without the Gov buying printing presses, BTC will have a hard time without miners. Miners are doing a public service, like early explorers. They may end up poor like the native Americans or native Australians, but I think most do it for the joy of hearing fans whirring. I am a propellorhead.

Guns have a great return for investment. Say in Kenya, you can buy a gun for $200 and then rob someone for $1000 in an hour. Then the issue becomes keeping your $1000 from others with guns.

I am more interested in Stross' analysis of bitcoin. Unlike Krugman , Stross is pro-tech, pro-opensource and an entertaining author. His stance has me concerned about deflation. We have always lived in an inflationary system and made decisions accordingly. Can we adapt to deflation, with a few holding large stakes ?
On a side note investment in land seems deflationary, so should land holders encourage forest conservation and discourage space exploration.
