That makes no sense as to why this is trading at such a premium. I'm not interested in arbitrage I'm just curious to know if the reaction to the price increase would be to balance their books with the ETF to buy more BTC.

I'm going to make an assumption this is in response to the Craig Wright article. If that's the case that guy was kind of asking for it.
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:31:27
I did it by setting an automatic weekly buy on coinbase and just letting it run for the last year or so. Also help price average through the ups and downs.

I'm not saying he deserved to have his house raided. I also don't know the tax laws in that part of the world. But if you go about seeking attention in the brash and manic way he has then you will get that attention. Especially from a government that thinks you owe them money.

Why wouldn't those documents be directly given the to ATO if that were the true intention?

THANKS! I would love to partner with the right people to increase bitcoin awareness and accessibility in Philadelphia.

Yea, I'm realizing the err of my ways now. Sorry if this comes off as possibly shady. I published a link to her personal donation page...which unfortunately only accepts credit cards. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:31:58
What proof would you like sir?
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:11:51
They only run out of coins when the market goes on crazy runs. I've been using them since Jan. And have only run into that once

She sent out an email earlier today to all of her friends and family requesting donations for the AWANJ charity 5K this weekend. I asked her if I could donate in bitcoin, she didn't exactly know what bitcoin was. So I walked her through creating a wallet on coinbase. As I feel this is currently one of the more user friendly wallets for people outside the understanding of bitcoin. I had her generate a request and and I sent her .04478 btc for her charity and I told here I would tell the community about whats she's doing and see if we could help her raise some money and raise some awareness for bitcoin. AWANJ is a Fairly large organization. 
She said should would present officially accepting bitcoin to the rest of the board members. I figured her having a predonated wallet would certainly give her some ammunition to get a great charity on board with accepting BTC...and if she can't convince them which I can't imagine happening she will exchange the BTC to fiat and donate the funds that way.

Yea, u got scammed by these shitheads. Then they extorted me for more money
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:09:31
I just bought a mattress and dog food this week with bitcoins. before then I've been hoarding them. I plan on using them more and just replenishing my stash as I spend them bc I still want to keep my position as a speculative investment.
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:55:52
bitcoin loans could easily be achieved in the right regulatory environment. Banks could convert existing loan capital in to bitcoin at the time a loan is approved.  
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:45:36
Totally bought my mattress, sheets and comfort with BTC 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:04:55
I've used a couple times on amazon.  Great experience!

@_date: 2014-05-16 02:42:38
As I've said in the post. The organization does not officially accept bitcoin. My cousin who is a board member of the AWANJ has accepted bitcoin from me into a wallet we created so she can show the other board members the benefits of accepting bitcoin for their charity in the future. If she is unable to do so she will exchange the btc for fiat and donate it via her personal pledge account which is here.

I will be surprised of apple integrates btc. Would be nice if they did but I think its too soon for apple. They always seem to be a step behind.

Im not really concerned with volatility.  Bitpay allows you to accepts bitcoins and then quickly turn them in to usd daily. I could not uphold my end of the bargain.  But eventually someone would report me to the authorities and I would likely be prosecuted for fraud. The same way if I took a bunch of peoples money and not shipped them merchandise.  Took the money out of the bank and shut my doors. I would eventually be arrested. I was saying rhat it eliminates to possibility for someone to get ahold of your cc and then run up a huge bill in your name. Its not going to stop a criminally minded business owner from being a scumbag.
Also we don't plan on only offer bitcoin as a payment option. Just another option for additional convenience to our customers.  If they want to send cash in the mail they can. But that the is just a pain in the ass

Right, the problem is migrating the store, down time even for 1 day would cost us $1000's. the other concern is possible lost organic traffic from lowered Search engine rankings. I'm not sure how migrating the store would effect that our SEO. something I need to speak with an SEO professional about I guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:32:14
Thanks, I'm sure there is a way to integrate without plug. would likely just need to be more customized and not as streamlined as a plugin. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:08:25
I know! I've been trying to convince my partner to migrate to a new platform.  I cant get him to budge. We've heard some horror stories

Customer wanted 10 hats @ $6.99 + $5.00 s/h = around $75.

Do you know of any providers that are compatible with Yahoo store?
would love to accept BTC. but not willing to switch ecommerce platforms just yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:04:30
I had to call the customer to figure this out. He wanted 10 hats at 6.99 plus the $5 shipping.  Totalling around $75
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:16:03
Working on that now! Created a bitpay account. but they don't have a plugin for yahoo stores yet. So trying to figure out how to do the installation on our site. I've contacted bitpay a couple days ago but no response yet.

Usually the people that send us checks, money orders or in this case cash are people that don't trust putting their credit card over the internet. Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of fraud, like having your credit card number stolen over the internet. The other point of relevancy is that this was an incredibly inefficient transaction for both the customer and myself. The customer had to hand write the letter, buy stamps, mail the letter. now I have to pay one of my hourly employees to manually enter this transaction,drive to the bank, Deposit the cash in the bank, etc. Bitcoin  is an incredibly efficient method of payment. I agree that this Nutty person that sent me cash will likely never make transactions with bitcoins. There will always be those people. but I think that in the near future it will be much more widely accepted. I know I will personally be working on spreading the bitcoin love. We are currently working on implementing bitpay on to our store and the next phase is to educate my suppliers so I can pay them with the bitcoins we accumulate. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:27:09
That's showing you how to integrate 3dcart with yahoo's shopping engine. not yahoo's store platform. 3dcart is essentially very similar to what a yahoo store platform is. the yahoo shopping engine is similar to google shopping. more of a search engine for products.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:22:59
I spend about 300 monthly on amazon. bc I buy lots of supplies for my business there. if I could use BTC to make those purchases I absolutely would!
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:13:38
Horror stories, of problems with the migration from the old platform to the new platform. Retraining employees, loss of Organic search traffic. 
Yes, yahoo is probably not the greatest of platforms. however, when we built it we had no experience building a website. so back then it was the easiest way for us to get started. I would really love to move to a more dynamic platform but there are some major mentalhurdles as a business owner.

Yessir, We have a large selection of heated motorcycle clothing
Hopefully you'll be able to with bitcoins in the next week or so.
