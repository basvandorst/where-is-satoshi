If we're going to talk about our investments to strengthen our argument/point let me just point out all of my investment is in to bitcoin/litecoin.
So why am I arguing that the time in existence is definitely relevant?
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:02:11
I'm not saying I would do it either way. You just aren't explaining why it isn't relevant. 
You would graph it that way because you want it to seem like Bitcoin is untouchable and dear oh bitcoin community don't worry about these altcoins/etcetc.
I'm just pointing out that yo uaren't properly explaining why it is not relevant. Like a coin is going to have a $10b market cap after 2 months in existence vs 3-4 years? It is just a ridiculous point to make without including the relevant facts - and one of those facts of relevance is days in existence. 
It's funny because this sub was all about 'we need altcoins to prosper, it is only good for bitcoin' and now it is all about shunning altcoins. It is pretty sad, really.
If the bitcoin community wants cryptocurrencies to remain truly de-centralized then altcoins have to exist. Otherwise, Bitcoin itself will slowly become more and more centralized the more impossible it becomes for people to mine.
Another problem with altcoins is that many are just scams, pump/dumps, pre-mined, etc. which you can point out too as to many possible reasons for their market caps.
This post and the many comments in support / 'woo bitcoin' just goes to show how bad this community is and how blind/ignorant it can become when money is on the line.
I'm sorry for being a Realist.

funny this has already been pretty big in these places/poor nations. I've read a ton of articles about it the past couple months.. it was already blowing up.
People just prefer to use their phones/phone credit to pay for things makes everything easier. 
But this still helps crypto currency - the less people turn to paper and plastic.. the more they will learn/be intrigued by digital.

honestly with all of it pre-farmed it's like a centralized currency.. and I think it was pumped up/invested in with the goal of getting Bitcoins cheaper than just actually buying them with their investment.

You're saying that like 'because John worked hard and James' thesis is based on a lot of his work, James' thesis doesn't matter'
 
please get a grip on reality.
the points you are making are not related and do not enforce the idea that the age of the coin does not matter. You are just making an excuse as to why you don't care about the age of the coin.

It seems like a bigger scam than anything else.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:30:39
yes, facts.
But you aren't doing anything for the argument.
And you didn't articulate at all why days in existence is not important/irrelevant to your post. 
You did exactly what you said - just put 'facts' out there irregardless of their relation to the argument.
I don't know how much clearer I can make it that the points you made do not point in favor of not factoring in days of existence.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:59:55
And what does it do that no other coin can
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:13:06
I don't know. I wouldn't say Silk Road is an 'important' bitcoin site in the way you are implying it is.
It's important in that it will be remembered in history for what either pushed bitcoin towards becoming more legitimate or pushed it over the edge into the abyss.
I would say more legitimate - while the FBI cracks down on this illegal activity and realizes it is even easier to do so when bitcoins are involved vs. cash being involved.
It is not important in that is needs to exist, is a good thing, is a great bitcoin trading place/whatever. It is a black market - Silk Road getting caught/users getting screwed over/etc - is a good thing, in the end.. imo.

Yo uare seeing this as some kind of contest and think you need to downplay the others. The point is you are posting market cap of each and teh day they were introduced is important in conveying the point. Unless your point was 'I love bitcoin. Here is Bitcoin beign 10x more valuable than everything else'
Which, from all the comments - was your point.

someone else asked about showing the days in existence. he said it is irrelevant to the person without making any actual reasons - which I see as being rude, you didn't make any points as to why it actually isn't and neither did he. 
the funny thing is no one is asking 'why is it relevant?' because they know it is.

1. The person who created the coin is not indicative of it's value unless it was Bill Gates, or whatever billionaire is behind the Ripple Coin scam. The creator of these cryptocurrencies on the graph as far as most people are aware/common knowledge is that their isn't some shadow biajillionaire behidn teh scenes that makes the market cap 10 billion when in reality it would be 500k. So, no, the creator wouldn't matter.
2. # of websites/vendors who accept the coin - yeah that would be good info. It may be a bit biased in some ways but would be evened out mostly.
3. # of articles about the coins - this wouldn't matter that much. There's many papers/sites solely dedicated to pumping up certain coins, so there would be heavy bias and it wouldn't be indicative of anything.
See, this is how you argue against something. You provide reason.
but relevant to market cap - yeah, days in existence is a factor. You aren't going to get $10billion dollars on an altcoin in a day. It took years for bitcoin to be worth anything.

they did not do that

Britain has 1 currency and it is GBP - they have not entered an agreement to do the Euro - nor do they accept it in their country.
countries that mutually agreed to work with the Euro have 1 currency - the euro. 
He is asking if there would be an issue with them recognizing x currency while being a euro backed country

@_date: 2013-12-05 01:03:35
no.. you aren't making sense because you didn't read what I said at all.
**How long will it take to generate all the coins?
The last block that will generate coins will be block  which should be generated at or near the year 2140. The total number of coins in circulation will then remain static at 20,999,999.9769 BTC.
Even if the allowed precision is expanded from the current 8 decimals, the total BTC in circulation will always be slightly below 21 million (assuming everything else stays the same). For example, with 16 decimals of precision, the end total would be 20,999,999.999999999496 BTC.**
21million BTC or 21billion mBTC, etc. There is a finite amount of BTC and it will be reached well before 2140. This is part of the reason Gold/Silver can be volatile.
BTC is similar to Gold/Silver, and it will become more and more apparent as the pool of BTC becomes smaller and more difficult to mine.
this is why you see these sites switching to mBTC as a default, not just because it relates better to other major currencies but because it makes you feel like the volume is far far larger.
Also what happens when that cap of BTC is reached and no mor ecan be obtained? How much damage can this do towards an economy / inflation / etc?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:01:43
IPv6 allows for an exponentially larger # of addresses
Bitcoin has a cap to it much like gold/etc. bitcoin, unlike national currencies, at some point cannot be printed infinitely - am I wrong in this?
I'm not muc hinto bitcoin but I have been reading on all the cryptocurrencies and the appeal that all of the others tout is that they, after x years, are actually able to have 5-10x higher the volume that bitcoin can cap at. 
I think the problem with bitcoin is that it isn't even on IPv4 level, that it will be flooded way too soon and people will panic. 
I'm not even sure if I am completely right, hopefully someone that knows better can chime in - but you don't seem to be the one that can.

right but it doesnt matter to them in terms of recieving a donation
a donation is a donation.. if someone will donate in bitcoin or not donate at all then what would it matter?
It is essentially just saying 'no, we're fine with nothing. Thanks'
Also, it isn't viewed badly by mainstream media. It is viewed differently by many different media outlets as well as by many people. I would not come to the conclusion that bitcoin is viewed badly by anyone except Mark Kirk.

are you guys this stupid?
He explained pretty fucking clearly:
They said they would deliver on X day after lockign price at X time. It has been a very long time since the day they were supposed to deliver.
They are costing him money. This is a problem they have caused, this is not a risk he should have foreseen/prepared for. If this company cannot be trusted to deliver when they say they will it hurts the integrity of their platform as well as bitcoin as a whole.
You don't buy 35K in a stock and  they say 'you just paid us now at $38. you will receive ownership of this stock on Friday' and then they don't give it to you until Thursday when the price is $15.
I don't understand anyone trying to give him advice or anything, this is an issue caused by coinbase and coinbase alone.


Like this guy said ^? He didn't get the deal. The deal was he gets what he paid for on X day and it has 4 days since that point.
Coinbase said he would be credited on the 13th. It is now the 18th.
