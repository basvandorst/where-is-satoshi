Best idea here.

I linked this article because it was the first one I found with direct quotes that wasn't behind a paywall.  The same information is posted on several 'reputable' news sources.
'reputable' with the knowledge that all 5eyes news sources are propaganda.

Ah okay, well this provides a lot of the answers I was worried about.

I disagree.  If you're a wealthy white male American sure.  Sure, I'm not saying we're rice farmers in Burma or anything like that but there has been a significant reduction over the past 50 years from what I would think of as a "free" United States.

Look out the window. Tell me what you see. You see the same things that you see everyday. Well, imagine you've never seen it. Imagine you spent your whole life in other parts of the world, being told everyday that you're defending freedom. Then you finally decide you've had enough. Time to see what you've given up your whole life for, everything. Get some of that "freedom" for yourself. Look at the people. You tell me which ones are free. Free from debt. Anxiety. Stress. Fear. Failure. Indignity. Betrayal. How many wish that they were born knowing what they know now? Ask yourself how many would do things the same way over again, and how many would live their lives like me.

It's a plane full of people that is missing, this isn't funny and detracts from the community.

There has not been a single piece of effective change that has come out of these stupid WH petitions.  The absolute most you can expect to get is a written response from WH staff about how they aren't going to do anything about the situation and it will be written as though the petitioning audience is in grade school.

Because if everyone starts buying up BTC on that exchange the exchange price will go up on CoinMKT and down on Bitstamp and the arbitrage advantage will vanish as they come into balance with each other.
I misunderstood the question.  MtGox is a blackhole.

Not really.  There are several exchanges that have litecoin both inside and outside China and it's been abused to hell for arbitrage purposes.  It generally just drives that coins trading ratio to btc down.  Adding more coins to multiple exchanges will temporarily allow fast arbitrage  but at the expense of the alt coin and there are people with rapid automatic scripts setup to take advantage of it before the average trader could do anything.  Trading is gambling.  Buy hold and use some.  The more btc is used the more people will learn about it and buy their own.

I 100% thought I had enabled 2 factor security on an online trading account while also using a complex 11 character password on my associated email.  Turns out 2 factor wasn't enabled like I thought and they broke my email password anyhow.
It was 1.19345064 BTC on Feb. 8 2013 all from litecoin I had mined myself.  It mostly destroyed my crypto investment.

I had 1.19 BTC stolen from my account because of a noob security error on my part more than a year ago.  I hope this money finds it's way to whom it belongs to.

Buying at $800 and still seeing a profit in a few months.  You realize it takes decades to see these kind of returns investing in absolutely anything else right?  And none of those things are even within the same realm of attainability as Bitcoin is.  Even with the risk you would have to be an absolute idiot to not have even just a little money invested in Bitcoin or at least Litecoin.

Some of the BTC movement in China probably has something to do with the [new economic reforms](
