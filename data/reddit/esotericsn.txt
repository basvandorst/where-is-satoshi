Right when Zcash starts to have more exposure and is soon to be launched. Uh I like the competition.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:59:11
woah an actually nice comment with cool info to dig in, on reddit! thanks for the links, will check them out. I wanted to know more about that TTP issue
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:29:03
Thing with coinbase is they are too restrictive. I've seen many people get their funds frozen and I don't want to risk it.
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:27:15
Assume something happens. What does the customer get, fiat value of the BTC or the BTC amount he originally had?
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:21:50
If you want the most "accurate" or "fair" price, use the one with the most volume. However there will be always a difference in price between exchanges. It's called spread.
@_date: 2016-04-21 10:33:29
Well, it's cointelegraph so take it with a grain of salt
@_date: 2016-04-24 17:04:32
lol, you're right though. I'm not using them for holding but sometimes if you trade, it has to sit there for some time. I don't like it, hence why I'm asking this. It's still risky and like the comment above said, even though it might take quite some time to get them back, at least you're somehow protected,
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:25:59
Exactly. Are there any that do reimburse the bitcoins and not fiat?
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:25:08
Wow plenty of them! Thanks!
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:28:33
Yes, but I want to know about that. In case the exchange is hacked and it's their fault, not the user's.
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:54:07
You can implement 3rd party services into the DEX. Exchange is still decentralized, you build a business on top of it that allows you to wire money there. Of course that service would need to trade your fiat for their respective IOUs. But still, you could then trade that for whatever coin you want on the decentralized exchange. Now you don't have counterparty risk. You only have it when you wire it which seems to be something inevitable atm. At least you would get a quick way to get your money into the DEX
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:43:04
but will I receive it physically or will they text/mail the info on the card like the number and PIN? I would like to know that to have an idea of how much time I have to wait until I can use it.
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:45:59
Thanks. Ok I got some info it seems it can't be used outside the US. VS doesn't accept it.. it's a shame.
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:39:25
Well because having the largest marketshare on bitcoin hardware means bigger profits which can be used to destabilize the network. That should be something to take into consideration. 
An insecure destabilized network won't bring people the profits they seek through mining.
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:40:46
No, we're trying to prevent exactly that. Giving money to someone who has intentions of messing up the network by forking should be something to worry about. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:19:28
Actually you can have your assets on exchanges and trade them while keeping them safe. It just has to be a decentralized one, like BitShares. It solves many people's problems. They don't want to have them on their wallets because they can't trade and they don't wan't them on exchanges because they can't be trusted. Now you can do both.
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:16:21
So a person who supports any other project can't comment on anything Bitcoin related? smh. Nice logic. Then that can be said about a myriad of other people.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:09:59
I like the fact infrastructure is being built around Bitcoin, I guess that's positive. I just don't like the fact of it being on the hands of private investors and not giving everyone a chance to participate. 
I thought with cryptos people around the world could participate, help and profit from these kind of projects without being accredited investors, angels, etc. A chance for everyone. Guess that's not always possible due to regulations and legal issues, but that's something I would like to see more in the future.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:05:52
Hopefully we'll start seeing decentralized exchanges catch a bit of the market share. It might be a very slow process, but that way no one will ever be goxxed again!
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:45:10
Are any disadvantages on doing this?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:56:20
That's why BitShares was created. It solves just so many problems in crypto. We no longer need to trust exchanges, we have stability with bitAssets. The potential of this just amazes me.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:00:28
At how much would you value Kraken atm, if it was to be acquired? 
@_date: 2016-03-16 23:05:25
People like that are the dirt in the space. They would sell their mother for a profit. They don't care about Bitcoin or the blockchain technology, they are simply using it and it's community as a stepping stone. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:24:32
I believe not. Still, there are fees.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:24:35
We have a few ones starting to appear. It's up to us to support them to change this whole market dynamic of exchanges having the monopoly. This way they're fully transparent and each user actually owns his private keys. This should be the way to go.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:20:17
This blog post has nothing to do with BitShares. It's fully centered around what the title suggests
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:22:47
2016 will be an interesting year. If this ends up being true, associating with the Bitcoin halving and the fact Bitcoin was awarded the best performing currency in this last years, we could see many people hedging against the markets by going in Bitcoin. I'm not even counting with the investment that was made. Everyone saying 2016 was the year of Bitcoin/blockchain the same way they said 2015 would be, but with just a bit of luck...
In the last market rise it was mentioned the chinese have left the cryptoscene to chase profits. If they come in again and we time this with the halving we might get an interesting year. Call it wishfull thinking but it's a possible scenario giving the circumstances imo.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:33:59
Maybe it's time to move onto decentralized exchanges? This has happened countless times, but people don't seem to get it.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:00:05
Blocks are just fine

Even if Unlimited was the right choice by consensus, their code is awful with many security breaches. What's Bitcoin without security? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:39:40
Dont keep your coins on centralized exchanges... It has already happened in the past.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:49:00
Is this true? Can someone else confirm this? If it is, it needs it's own PSA thread
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:24:13
If it is, then every instant exchange of the same type (ie. metaexchange) is. Honestly, they aren't. A decentralized exchange, would.
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:10:47
Dunno most likely not but I thought it would be interesting to the community given some people worry about quantum computers breaking algorithms 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:44:30

It's not spam, because a fee is getting paid. However those are low priority transactions because the fee is too low. Then some kind of "starvation" happens, similar to processes never getting executed.

I wanted to run it all the time, so I was wondering if there was just some cheap hardware we could order, plug and play, with low consumption.  I really would prefer not to run it on my everyday use laptop. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:42:27
Sure, I was just under the impression we would have some simple hardware to run a full node by now^^

"Teechan does not require any changes to the existing Bitcoin network". Seems pretty cool. Like a new layer on top of the protocol.

Decentralized exchanges win again. Too bad there are only a few and not yet fully developed.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:01:35
There's a securing blockchain method named DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) that seems similar to what it's described in the article. It is, however, like the name implies, based on Proof of Stake so I don't know how that could be applied to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:13:41
Any kind of decentralized exchange
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:53:04
Yes, that's what I'm afraid. Of course a company needs to be profitable but placing their interests on top of Bitcoin's... I mean, Bitcoin itself doesn't have an interest, it's all up to everyone who takes part of the network, but they sure can use their position to influence people into thinking this or that is the correct thing, when in fact they have other plans.
I guess the real question is, what situation would Bitcoin be in, if we didn't have these companies pushing each own their own stuff. If devs were self sustainable and didn't need to be paid by third parties. Would we really be in this position? Would the community be as split as it is?
@_date: 2017-04-22 10:22:48
Even the account is a throwaway. Imo this is the type of post that should be downvoted to oblivion. Fake news and giving importance to a known scammer. No one cares.
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:49:54
Didn't see the last part I apologize. It seemed you were pro blockstream and attacking r3, while I don't have any problem with your opinion, I misunderstood it because I thought that wasn't the topic at hand my mistake.
I agree with you though, both sides can bring their interests in and place them above the rest.
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:50:21
I'm not defending R3, Blockstream or anyone else. I'm simply questioning if the big money behind can start have its influence on the system. While people argue with the belief they're doing the best to the network, the ones behind might have other interests.
This is what creates this horrible atmosphere that we have at the moment. While I question everyone and try to be unbiased, someone comes along and immediately starts arguing A is wrong, B is better.
That is not what I'm talking about. This is about the influence of big companies on the state of the community.
Some people however don't miss a chance to try and force their views on others when that's not even what we're talking about.

Sorry for your loss, but, really ... "As you can see, he had me do a survey, at the end of the survey send coins to an address to receive double." Common sense. Either way, you now know a valuable lesson. Next time it might keep you from loosing way more. I agree with you, helping users publicly could potentially leak out important info, they should know better.
@_date: 2016-09-11 16:14:15
That's precisely the point of Bitcoin... view narrower than a needle. Hopefully these kind of people and businesses are replaced by better ones. It may take a long while, but I hope it happens eventually.

this^ I have a verified Kraken account but not a verified Gox account. Can i do it through Kraken or does it need to be an offline method?
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:50:29
Yes. It allows you to trade without having to worry with a Mt.Gox like incident. Has more transparency and the more exchanges and services use it, the more market depth you have. Funds on your account are actually yours, you hold the keys, not the exchange.
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:08:55
Still have no idea on how invest on Pivit, if I wanted. Do I have the get Hyperledger command line interface? It looks like they don't want regular people to get into this at all. Unless I've missed something.
@_date: 2015-09-28 00:12:17
As much as I find this interesting, one thing seems strange to me: a single agent takes down the biggest DNMs(Evolution and Agora were mentioned if memory serves me right) out there, without the FBI itself being able to do it?
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:52:24
bitches dont care :p
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:34:11
Decentralized, transparent exchanges are in need.

They can't even keep their wallets safe.

There's also the possibility all of this was made with the objective of removing commit access from Gavin.

This might just turn out to be the same as when Coca-Cola changed their formula.
@_date: 2015-10-25 23:57:25
They're not 100% yours if you don't hold the private keys. They're yours only to the extent - whatever 3rd party you're using - allows them to be.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:02:04
Our daily bread. People still depend too much on centralized services. There are other options out there :) multi-sig wallets and decentralized exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:55:51
We are all still early adopters
@_date: 2016-05-09 00:47:22
I think they would only be comparable if US exchanges charged zero fees. As it is it doesn't make much sense imo. Btw, does Japan have zero fees?
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:52:22
Apparently Gaving might have been hacked. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:19:24
I don't want to sound like an ass but why are people surprised? Centralized services will always be target of this kind of situations. After Gox, BitStamp and numerous others, people still don't get it? Come on.. if you have Btc on an exchange, they are not yours, they are not on your possession and you are vulnerable to loose them anytime.
Use decentralized services. You have BitShares. It has gateways to minimize the risk so you can trade your btc for bitAssets. This might not be the only option, there might be other decentralized exchanges, it doesn't matter. Just use one! Each day you use a centralized exchange you're perpetuating the cycle and nothing will change. Just use something decentralized. If you argue you can't get fiat in, well, once you get your btc, just use a gateway that is way less risky or send them immediately to a decentralized exchange. 
Now what annoys me is most people won't do this. Yet they will keep complaining when they have the solution right in front of their eyes. smh
