The current fees and transaction times of Bitcoin right now make small purchases unfeasible, I don't think anyone is arguing that.  More SegWit adoption, LN, and eventually Schnorr signatures are going to take care of those issues.  Later there will be new tech that improves on it further, as is the nature of technology.  LN with recurrent transactions especially (Amazon, eBay, etc) will keep BTC very competitive and functional as a currency.  There is a bit of a race going on right now to see if BTC can get these things taken care of in time to remain king of the space.
In the future I see Bitcoin as the central store of value for crypto (as well as a viable currency) given its (functional) security and name recognition.  This is assuming that the aforementioned upgrades can be implemented in a reasonable time.  But it's not going to be the fastest/cheapest "cash" system out there due to its inherent limitations (block size/time).  I love XRB for that and think/hope it will be a top 5 crypto and handle the bulk of day to day purchases that are not feasible with BTC (random drunk buys at a taco stand, for example).  We'll also see what IOTA can do, when it's ready.
Anyway, I'm tired of the waves of people in here saying "DURR HURR IT COSTS $50 AND 3 DAYS TO SEND BITCOIN, BITCOIN IS DEAD".  It's not true, is damaging to Bitcoin, and I'm really tired of it.  Thus my agitation there.  I'll see you on the XRB moon.

I just sent $2200 in BTC *with a high tx rate*.  It cost me ~$9.75 and had 2 confirmations in 12 mins.

Surprising after such a strong start it ended so badly.

You can sell BCH for BTC all over the place.  Might as well wait for the next BCash pump though, they're getting close to end game here so I expect some desperate/slimy shit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:50
Dipped just below $10k on GDAX.  I DCA on dips, so $11.8k was not my only purchase. :)
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:59:24
Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  BCash is a centralized (over half of the nodes on Alibaba servers) scam coin ($45B out of thin air riding on Bitcoin's name to make a few people rich) that doesn't do anything the best (it doesn't have the Bitcoin name despite their best efforts and it's not even close to the best payment coin).  I'm hoping by the end of 2018 BCash will fade away and we won't have to deal with this drama (that hurts crypto as a whole) any more.  When the correction occurs BCash will be one of the casualties given that it's not the best at anything and was created solely to make a few people incredibly rich.
Obligatory BCash is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:25:59
BCash's only path to survive long term is to take over the Bitcoin name.  Aside from the stolen name they serve no unique purpose.  Oh cool, a more centralized version of Bitcoin put together by a relatively small group of greedy assholes so they can become more rich.  Sign me up!  It's also hilarious that they won't be able to use LN, lol.  Anyway, fuck BCash and their ongoing attack on all of crypto (by attacking the cornerstone of crypto you're attacking all of crypto).  The day it fades into obscurity will be a great day for the entire space.

I hope Bitcoin goes on a strong run here which temporarily pushes the price of alts down, so I can buy more alts.  I own BTC and several alts so it's a win-win for me.  I also don't know why anyone would be 100% into Bitcoin right now (given all of the exciting alts out there and the progress that they are making).  It's disappointing that each crypto community seems to shit on every other one, with Bitcoin receiving most of the shit despite being the only reason the other communities exist.  There are a lot of good projects/tech out there.  Can't we all just get along?  Except BCash, because fuck BCash and everything that it represents. :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:06:52


I just sent ~$2200 in BTC for ~$9.75 with a *high* tx rate, two confirmations in about 12 minutes.  But please, keep talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:18:51
People giving me advice on a topic they know nothing about always baffles me.  I had a few calls and texts saying I should sell everything (at the bottom) before it was all gone.  I'm tempted to just tell them I did so they'll fuck off and I can crypto in peace.  And by crypto in peace I mean dump aggressive amounts of fiat into the market when everyone is panicking and losing their shit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:21:55
Snagged some more at $11,800.  Will probably buy bigger and bigger chunks if it keeps dropping.  Steering into the storm has worked for me so far.  My alts are getting fucking slaughtered though.  WWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:09:56
This kills the BCash.
But in all seriousness, I am so excited for LN (and of course SegWit) implementation this year.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:09:10
Yes, which is why you should be using VISA right now for those kind of transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:24:01
Thanks for all the hard work anti BTC shills, was able to grab a bit more at $12.7k earlier today.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:25:16
Haha, I bought a bit at $0.62 and then a bit more around $4.  I was waiting for a correction to around $8 but I don't think that's going to happen..
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:58:25
FYI I just sent some BTC from GDAX to BitGrail and it was there in ~10 minutes.

Bitmain: the unbiased and never misleading source of Bitcoin data!! /s

@_date: 2017-12-26 19:37:12
Due to a lack of regulations (pro and cons aside) a free market response is what needs to happen here.  Customers should move their business elsewhere (i.e. Gemini) if they don't support the open fuckery/collusion Coinbase pulled with BCash.  We're somewhat limited now with a lack of U.S. based exchanges (especially in some states) but you still have options, money talks.  I'm pulling all of my business from Coinbase and moving to Gemini once they finally approve my docs..

No worries, I've been there. :)

I ♥ my Trezor.  I'm going to pick up a Nano S for some of my alts though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:27
I think a lot of new users are expanding into alts, especially with Bitcoin "slowing" (lol).

I can't tell if some of you guys are legitimately daft or if you're just new when we get the same comments every time BTC is at $X.  Always the same stupid shit "BITCOIN $10K SOON HURR DURRR".  Either way it's boring and obnoxious, just sell your $50 worth of BTC and move along if you feel that way.

It's shitty because it works (on the noobs). Placidpenis or whatever hasn't posted since I offered to bet him $500 on his prediction, so either that worked or he was banned lol.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:46:13
Check out get set up on a couple of "alt exchanges" (I mainly use Binance and Bittrex), then start off small and do your research.  And enjoy the ride down the rabbit hole(s)!  Fwiw I still have 90% of my crypto investments in Bitcoin, but most of my next pending gdax deposit will go to alts.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:31:10
Personally I hope we get more segwit adoption and LN before Bitcoin is really brought to mainstream adoption (as a currency).  Price stabilization (relative) and segwit/LN prior to being used for eBay, Amazon, etc is the best path *imo*.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:40:08
tl;dr  
1) Buy Bitcoin a few years ago
2) Cash out initial investment plus some profit
3) Don't worry about the $0 (well actually less than $0) you have invested
Thanks man!  :D
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:41:53
Binance and Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:34:11
It's frustrating for sure but they're experiencing unprecedented growth, of course there are going to be some growing pains.  To say "this isn't fair" is some pretty ignorant/entitled thinking *imo*.

That's...actually a very good point.  Brb claiming 2-3% losses on my USD tied assets annually.

Protip: check people's posting history to see if they know wtf they're talking about.  I know that's a bit ironic given this account is new but I'm not saying you should listen to what I say either, think for yourself.  But post histories are nice to establish context.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:08:39
I lol'd too but to be fair that was a pretty rough time to buy and then be able to hold through the dip (probably ~50% for him).

@_date: 2017-12-28 19:12:11
Check out for some exposure to alts but keep in mind they're generally anti BTC there and there is a ton of group think, shills, etc (standard crypto community).  I have most of my portfolio (total balance) in BTC but that is due to buying in when it was much lower and its growth.  Most of my "newer" investments have been into alts.

Check out Gemini or Bitstamp (if your state allows it).  Also try not to frame your questions in a complaint if you want some help.  Also if you would be more specific in what's not working that would also be helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:04:52
Absolutely, I mean we're only up ~50% over the past month.  What a joke, it should be 10% a day or I'm fucking out! ^/s
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:05:43
People are very shortsighted when it comes to Bitcoin ("I can't buy coffee with it economically right now, Bitcoin is dead!").  But Bitcoin has established itself as THE cryptocurrency, and is the only reason alts are worth anything at all right now.  The problems with Bitcoin are being addressed, and they will be implemented as soon as they are ready.  This is a GOOD thing, Bitcoin is primarily a store of value right now (and will likely be THE store of value) so it's extremely important that it's secure.  This is all *imo* of course, but I think most of the complaints are very short sided and/or maliciously motivated (i.e. BCash shills).
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:52:05


That seems like a pretty...absurd excuse.  Have him poll the users asking if they want faster Bitcoin transactions with lower fees, I'm assuming everyone will say "obviously".
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:17
Bitcoin is up like 25% over the past ~48 hours, lmao.

Or consider buying up a bunch of miners and start a low fee mining pool. :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:12:55
Eventually, yes.  Right now, absolutely not.  Bitcoin needs to remain at the helm while the alts battle it out for market share.  If Bitcoin was listed at $17 instead of $17,000 noobs/most of the planet would think it was only worth $17 per coin.  Eventually using smaller denominations obviously makes sense, but for now it would be damaging imo.
@_date: 2018-09-23 06:39:13
Interesting, they must be creating models for what not to do.
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:20:43

You should look into DeFi.
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:51:08
I was more going to the point that crypto will be coming for banking revenue, not that DeFi is currently ready to fund billion dollar companies and fully supplant the existing financial system.


Short answer is it will be cheaper to borrow (less friction, less pockets to fill) and you won't have to rely on a third party who can lock your funds whenever they want.  Also competition should drive prices down as P2P lending will become significant as banks will no longer have a(n effective) monopoly on lending.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:12:02
BCash is not Bitcoin.

Plus CB's spread which is usually ~0.5% or so.

Usually takes about 5 business days for Coinbase to release the funds to you.
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:22:30
Then you have to wait 5+ days for the bank transfer though, which is why many just eat the fees and do ACH.

If you deposit USD into your coinbase/cbpro account you don't have access to it for about 5 business days, here in murica.

You can use BTC as well, but both are through BitPay so AT&amp;T isn't really accepting either (just cash equivalencies).  BCH has lower fees but so do 1000 other shitcoins.  At least with BTC you know it will get there (and not be rolled back like in this example of BCH).
