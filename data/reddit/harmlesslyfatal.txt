“We expect a substantial decrease in volatility going forward, both in selling and buying BTC. Most of the run upwards from the $750 level was powered by rumors and speculation surrounding the Coin ETF,” Zivkovski told Bitcoin.com.
I dislike this statement so much. They're speculating about the speculation....

Just because they aren't supposed to operate on American soil doesn't mean they don't still do it. Just like the NSA isn't supposed to spy on non-National Security threats within its borders... but they still do. So, while I don't think that the CIA would target people's bitcoins on its own as they have bigger fish to fry, I do think that it is still something that people should be concerned about.

I was able to verify my identity by uploading photos of my ID instead of using a webcam. No idea why it worked because GDAX was requiring a webcam / front facing camera, which is dumb as shit.

because they are not dependent upon each other. each proposal will have different things that they are bringing to the table. just because one gets denied doesn't mean that sets the others up for failure. however, if COIN gets approved, it could pave the way for the other two to get approved.
also, if COIN gets denied, then SolidX could make changes based on the reason for the denial. Same with GBTC.

This is why I'd assume most of the smart hodlers already have the bulk of their coins stored in cold storage, especially considering what happened with Mt. Gox.

I just don't want to go to sleep then miss all the action. Not going to make any moves one way or the other but I *realllly* want to watch how the price is affected.

I'm pretty sure that simply stores on GDAX, but I don't know for sure as I've never sold on GDAX. It *might* be dependent on having a USD wallet on Coinbase. I know if you have a USD wallet, you can instantly buy and sell (in theory) from that USD wallet, but that's only after you've deposited into it. That money can also be transferred to and from GDAX.

Right right. I see it as more of a hedge. I mean, I wouldn't have put that much into it personally. That's crazy to think about: ~$3,900 at peak prices.. I'm not that ballsy.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:47:16
yeah, this seems like the consensus. I just didn't think that most of the recent rallies were because of the ETF anticipation and I think this proves that. Call it confirmation bias, but... still. But we still have Monday (in China) to get through, but I don't think it'll have that huge of an impact.

Snap. I've been watching Coinbase and Bitmex simultaneously and even when Coinbase dropped, Bitmex bottomed around $1,170. Bitmex usually runs a bit lower. Either way, gonna be a ride.
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:44:17
but even if they go after the leaders, if those coins are taken away / stolen / whatever, it would have a huge effect on the crypto market as a whole. Yes, you'd still have your coins, but the market would tank.. at least temporarily.

it can take 5-7 business days for ach transfers to take effect. 
Wire transfers usually much quicker. I'd probably expect it Monday. I placed an order on Sunday and it's expected to arrive on Monday. 
It will likely depend on the time of day you ordered it on that Friday.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:43:50
I fully agree. and even then, I don't think it'll drive the price down too low before the bull market kicks back in. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:15:42
if it doesn't confirm, it'll be sent back to the wallet you sent from.

@_date: 2017-03-11 19:20:54
Different exchanges, could be different prices (slightly).. Coinbase has a lot more volume. That's why the charts move so fast... If you're wanting to put it in GDAX to trade, then you may want to deposit into GDAX directly instead of Coinbase. Pretty sure Coinbase has a fee for performing the buy/sell instead of doing it the market order directly on GDAX but can't be certain. 
If you deposit to GDAX, then no buy will be placed until you buy. If you buy on Coinbase, then the buy order will be at the price that you buy at. So if you buy at $1,200, but the bitcoin doesn't get deposited for 7 days and the price goes to $1,300, then you've made $100 per. The opposite is also true, if it goes down, you lose money..
But if you want to trade with market orders / stop / limit orders on GDAX, then you can deposit with your bank account directly there and place the order when you want instead of doing it through Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:02:35
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:05:09
Fair point. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:49:08
Before the news came out that the CIA has the weaponized materials to hack into any computer, did you really think that anything you did on a computer was safe from intrusion of the government? This is nothing new. Hardware wallets are still the safest way to go to ensure you don't lose your coins. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:26:49
It takes some discipline to hodl like this. There are times where it's really hard not to panic sell. lol.
I just wish I had money on GDAX when this happened.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:47:32
It dipped $300 within seconds of the decision. It rose $80 within minutes of the dip. Pretty sure the worst is over.
That was just a pit stop on the way to the moon.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:02:32
if you're able verified, GDAX (Coinbase), Gemini are good. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:16:42
ETH does it too. Yesterday, the dashboard/market price was 18.90 or so, but the purchase price was $19.07. Not as much of a difference, but still a markup.
I think a way around this would be to move money to GDAX and buy with at market price and move it back to your wallet, but Idk for sure as I haven't tried it. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:16:39
Haha. I'm not even tired. Plus I have things to do in a couple hours. Regardless, I think the same. Bitcoin is not going to be dependent on the ETF. Even if it gets denied, I think the result will be a slight dip. I don't think any of the rallies to date have had much to do with the ETF. However, if it gets approved, I think the price will rise quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:00:12
Yeah, usually it's 3-5, but I've seen it take 7, sadly. Depends on the bank it's coming from and all sorts of stuff. But as I said, it depends on the time of day. If it was ordered late in the day, it should be there Monday. If it's not, I'd give them or Coinbase a shout and see what's up.
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:47:17
Fully expected it to drop then rebound. Never expected a crash. This just proves that very, very little of the buildup was actually due to the ETF decision.

I know you can have more than one credit card added, but I don't think the limits raise. I have two bank accounts connected but the limit didn't raise when I added the second account. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:36:46
Well that'll do it. Better safe than sorry! 
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:42:40
Definitely. It's pretty remarkable to think that a lot of people think that because the government made up these rules about jurisdiction that they actually follow them. It's quite silly.
I do think cryptocurrencies can thrive, even if the government (CIA, FBI, whoever) is involved. It may tank the market for a time, but it'll rebound. Besides, the only reason they'd target any form of crypto is if they felt like it endangered something that they relied on. I don't think we're anywhere near that point. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:51:37
This is very true. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:01:00
that's just how it is. it has no bearing on your actual credit limit. just a limit on your Coinbase account because credit card deposits tend to be immediate(even though they still have to be confirmed by the bank), whereas bank account deposits take 3-5 business days.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:35:50
Oh, I didn't have any thought on selling. I just was sad I didn't have anything on GDAX at the time to buy it when it dropped. S'all good though.
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:38:21
Think so. but this also means that SolidX and GBTC will get denied or withdrawn.

@_date: 2017-03-01 06:36:32
