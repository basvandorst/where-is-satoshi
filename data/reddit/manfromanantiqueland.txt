Two factor authentication means you have access to something you know (password) and something you have (phone).
Your point doesn't make sense because someone knowing your information doesn't give them access to the device they need to login.

That would completely defeat the purpose of it if that were true.
The point is that the attacker needs something you have (your phone) to access your account. If they have access to your phone, 2 factor doesn't help.

I definitely don't trust freedompop to implement everything correctly. Apple or Google, maybe... but not a company that small and with no notable cryptographers onboard.

This has been discussed numerous times on and consensus is that letting someone know indirectly there has been an order received would be legally speaking the same thing as directly telling them. 
Rsync has a warrant canary, but given that failing to post it indicates they received an order, that is the same thing as telling everyone there is an order.

The order comes with a gag order that prevents them from disclosing that they received an order. If they set up a signal to disclose that they received an order, it would clearly be a violation of the gag order.
Bottom line... if you tell people that some signal means you received an order, it is the same thing as telling them directly. A federal judge presiding over a national security court is not going to be kind to someone who violates the order by trying to come up with a legal loophole. And the loophole doesn't exist. Legally speaking, the company has to literally act as if they never received an order. If continuing to post a warrant canary is part of that, they have to do it... otherwise it would be disclosing they received an order, which violates the gag order.
Search warrant canary in or look in my submission history as I asked the question there also.
