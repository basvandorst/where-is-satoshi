I'm upset because this one hearing guy who knows ASL (American sign language) is taking advantage of deaf people and preying on them making them sign up for onecoin. Fucking scammer did the same thing with i2g/g1e Ponzi scheme .   Look up onecoin ASL group on Facebook. This guys name is Elisha jancik.   He's got a bunch of asl.videos on YouTube look up onecoin ASL on there.  He needs to be stopped!

Ok thanks. Looking forward on reading up this guide ... I haven't launched my site yet.  Should I wait until after the fork?    And what about non private wallets like a coinbase wallet? I only have $100 worth of BTC there.. should people be transferring CB funds into a private / paper wallet before the fork?
