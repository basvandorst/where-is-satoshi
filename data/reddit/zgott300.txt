Everyone know who's responsible but that doesn't mean they can make things right.

That was a great talk and explanation of the challenges of bitcoin but his conclusion wasn't very strong.  It seemed it was essentially "Don't change bitcoin and let the high transaction fees motivate someone to figure out a way to proxy transactions".  There's a lot of faith in that stance.

Great... You've stumbled upon the fractal nature of the markets.  It doesn't mean bitcoin is destined to go up.
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:30:20
He's not.  This is just a desire disguised as a prediction.

Did they also lose their bitcoins or just the rigs?
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:25:07
BTC will never be ready for prime time if that's what it takes to be safe.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:55:43
Close enough for me.

eh... close enough for a non sys-admin.

question.  Why does Washington have more power to destroy it than any other capitol?  Why does it's success depend on how Washington reacts.  If it's truely a global currency, it shouldn't make any difference.

What's the logic behind the blue line?  Is it just drawn to meet the yellow line?   It doesn't seem to represent any mathematical concept.  It's just a straight line drawn from some arbitrary point in the past to the current day.  Imagine this same graph drawn a few weeks ago when the price was higher. The blue line would be even steeper.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 21:19:25
Well.  There was no other way to put it.  Intro type explanations about complex issues have a use.

Bitcoin is way too volatile to be seen as a safe haven. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 04:29:45
Anything dumbed down to a level below your understanding is painful but you can't blame them.  I don't have a deep technical understanding of bitcoin so this was perfect.  I found it really interesting.

I guess it depends on voltage.   The higher the voltage the lower the current needed to deliver the same power.  I do know Edison's original plan for urban electrification included neighborhood generation plants.  That might have been more of an engineering than physics problem though. 
Edit:  I just read your link and it agrees with my comment.  AC is more efficient at long distance transmission.  I think it comes down to voltage. The higher the voltage the lower the current needed and energy loss is proportional to current.  Given the same voltage, AC and DC might be just as efficient.  The thing is, it's much easier to step up AC voltage than it is DC. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:19:26
AC is also way way more efficient to transmit over long distances. I think that's the main reason. With DC we would need thousands of neighborhood generating stations. With AC we can have a few larger stations out in the middle of nowhere.

I thought difficulty went up the the number of coins mined and could never go down.  Do you know anywhere that explains how difficulty is calculated? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:00:33
To me, that's like saying Amazon is amazing but the internet is a bubble.   How can bitcoin be amazing but not the technology that made it possible?

Part of the point of this crypto experiment was to encourage the spread of anonymous transactions, not to protect your investment.  
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:09:08
LOL.  That's why the masses get their asses handed to them from speculative bubbles.  You're just one of the heard, if that's all you're looking at.

@_date: 2018-10-30 15:38:27
It's also an investment.  Just because you happen to be investing in a currency, doesn't take that fact away.
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:35:32
That's incorrect. DC over long distances would be hugely inefficient. We transmit over long distances using high voltage AC, then step it down to low voltage AC in the local neighborhood ( that's what those trash can sized things on some power poles do ) then convert it to DC at the power adapter ( that's what the square part of your laptop cord does )
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:49:26
My guess is that we're in the complacency phase. Everyone is holding on waiting for the next rally.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:39:46
Ok buddy, whatever you say.  Sounds like you got this figured out. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:06:18


Predicting the future is never a sure thing, especially with something like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:46:12
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:39:27
Is there a meaningful difference?
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:48:33
For most of the those 9 years it was an underground hobby.  Now that it's become an investment tool, it's much more coupled to the stock market. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:45:45


You have a source for that?  There's so much infrastructure improvement in my neighborhood it's getting annoying but it's all needed. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:59:06
They know this too which is why they've been dragging their feet on the whole process. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:46:00
I think it's obvious.  If people view it as an investment then it's going to be subject to the same decision input as other investments (trying to time the market or panic selling etc...)  That's where the coupling comes from.  Years ago, when it was just a small group of people talking encryption and exploring it out of sheer interest,  the stock market wasn't even part of the conversation. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:30:40
Except if you got paid in bitcoin, your pay rate would have gone down over this same time and you buying power would have, essentially, remained the same.  This image is just dumb.

Trust. 
It's the same thing that backs any currency, including bitcoin.  Trust that it will still be worth something in the future.

The world bank isn't even mentioned in this article.  It mostly talks about growing corporate debt and the dangers of Trumps trade wars.  
Nice try again.  
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:39:44


Stiglitz isn't even mentioned in that article. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:20:30
LOL ok.  So you're argument is:
1. The economic landscape looks dire (I wouldn't necessarily disagree)
2. Stiglitz is an economist so he is  partially to blame, therefore he doesn't deserve his Nobel prize therefore he is also wrong about bitcoin.
You do realize economists don't control the economy right? 
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:55:09
LOL.  So much buthurt in this sub.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:33:33
I did. Fortunately it was only $200.
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:07:31
The only reason you know about Stiglitz is because of his opinion of bitcoin.  If he said something good about bitcoin, you would be using his Nobel prize as proof that he knows what he't talking about. 
You've proven you have a child's understanding of economics.  I'm done with this waste of a time discussion. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:29:33
That sounds like the text book definition of a speculative bubble.
