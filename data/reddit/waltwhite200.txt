Exactly, looking back I'm happy it wasn't $500 or something cause I had $700 for sale

Not understanding the sarcasm here so I'll carry on

Exactly my thought process. I don't know why in any situation they would keep this guy around after I proved they took 200 bucks from me. If they do I'm prolly going to stop using their service. Can't imagine how many crooks they've kept around on the site even though they know they are scammers. More money in their pocket I guess.

Honestly, like I give a shit that you down-vote my post....

Sorry, trying to save people from getting fucked over. I bet if you were a seller, you'd rather read a couple words in caps than lose hundreds of dollars.

UPDATE: LocalBitcoins messaged me to that they banned the users and since they have no bitcoins in their wallet I can't get refunded (not surprised there). However I clicked on their username and the accounts are still there. 1 account says it was on 50 minutes ago (wtf?) The one with 30 feedback now has 95% feedback but I'm still here out $200. What's up with their accounts still being there, am I missing something?

Yeah why would sellers on LBC not want to know their names????? Should I have just said I got scammed from 2 accounts so be on the lookout for 2 people that shall remain nameless?

Basically how I'm feeling right now hahaha. You live and you learn, except it sucks cause I would rather have wiped my ass with 2 Benjis than give it to that punk.

I mean I really wasn't concerned about their username, I wasn't expecting them to scam me hahaha
