I like your idea but i dislike that you will be donating it all to charity. There are so many tech, med and agricultural startups that need funds desperately.
Investing in companies like these will allow you to actually help more people. We need companies to research the advancements that will be needed and we need investors that are willing to take the risk.
Charities help but in the long term clean energy, clean food and advanced medicine will help humanity a lot more.
For charities I can only name a few I know need funds critically in south africa:
SPCA (animal welfare group)
Red cross 
Cansa (cancer welfare group)
I had almost 100 bitcoin back when bitcoin started and I donated it all to some charity back then that gave people their first bitcoin wallet with some bitcoin in it. I kinda regret that lol but hey I think i made some people happy in the end.

Were you ever contacted by victims of the scammers who you were running the ads for? Did you know, check or verify that you were advertising legit businesses on your sites? 
When you took the offer was it essentially a guilty plea or admission of guilt?

It is that damn trumps fault that the in 2011 some of the worst financial policies that have drained nearly twice op's amount from the budget and is mandatory is somehow the fault of a man that came into office in 2016.
If the US could shed some of the financial burden of other countries and including some of the richest in the world it's deficits would turn to profit in short order. 
You US taxpayers pay for the protection and stability of countries that are smaller and better off that the average us citizen. Why? I can give you a hint it has nothing to do with republicans or trump.
