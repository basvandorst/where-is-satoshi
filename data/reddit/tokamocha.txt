People weren't joking when they said this sub is super hostile.
Just cause your anon on the internet, doesn't mean you can be rude.

Thanks man, this is really helpful!
So to make any money I would have to leech electricity, and even then it wouldn't be much.

How come there are so many people doing it?

Look at it from my perspective:
I Googled for an hour to find out how much I could make with my computer. I didn't find any results for a GT 750M.
The only thing I found were calculators based on hashrate. So, I decided to search my GPU's hashrate.
Couldn't find that either.
After all that hassle, I decided that a community of Bitcoin miners are obviously the authority whether or not to mine because they have experience.
So, coming to this sub was my last hope.
(Not that that should matter to you anyway, if you don't like that I asked a question, then don't comment.)


You don't know enough about me to know whether I deserve anything or not. You have no idea If I am lazy or not, you just made a foolish assumption. Regardless, no one ever deserves rudeness, even if they are lazy or stupid.
It is completely possible that I could've been a mentally handicapped person, which means you would've been rude to someone who may not be as mentally acute as you.
Try to be understanding to people on the internet, cause you never know they're side of the story until they tell you.
