0.00001% of all bitcoins?

To buy BTC with a card? Coinbase allows you to buy a small amount after you are verified a couple levels.

I now understand why the suicide hotline gets stickied after crashes lol.

Sounds like some people are abusing chargebacks to scam this guy. Offering a BTC discount isn't going to stop them...

That's pretty cool, never noticed that. Stripe and Square both use a lot of blue as well.

This is exactly it. There needs to be better incentive for a regular person to get into it. It is cool that you can buy a sandwich in person with Bitcoin but that wears off quick. Buying goods in person is not a real pain point for people but it seems to be one of the things that is triumphed as a use case for Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to be triumphed for what it does better than current systems.

This would add another step to impulsively watch a random episode of something. Netflix wouldn't want to do anything that makes it harder to watch.

Using bitcoin as a POS option/replacement is thinking way too small.

Is there any place he specifically mentions he did this totally for the purpose of creating a safer drug trade? Why would he make so much off it then? Seems like the dude wanted to get rich off the drug trade for his own benefit. He knew the risks of the game so don't get mad when you get got.

How would they prove their coins weren't used to purchase illegal goods at SR? What's stopping the new owner from using a mixing service once they have the coins? Serious question, not too familiar with how that works.

Don't try to day trade, you will lose. It sounds like you will not have much money so make sure your basic needs are met before putting any money in. Only put in what you are willing to lose, as in if you took all the money you were to use to buy BTC and then start 90% of it on fire, you should still be able to support yourself.
