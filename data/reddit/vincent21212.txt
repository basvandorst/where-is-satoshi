@_date: 2014-01-30 02:27:48
the reason investing in btc companies makes a ton of sense over investing in a specific coin is that if another coin other than Bitcoin reaches  btc companies dont have to do much to incorporate the other booming coin.
in the meantime BTC growth would be either slowing down, losing market share or even trend negative.

No. Because I do believe that Bitcoin in the LONG TERM is dead or everything.  It is either superior or inferior to the dollar.  
My belief so far is that bitcoin is superior to other currencies because of its structure.
Do not forget this:  Every currency has an exchange rate for every other currency on the planet, regardless of whether it's listed on a FOREX index. So for all intents and purposes, there is already a one-world currency; it is just a very inefficient system.
 You can take that to the bank.

I don't know. Whether bitcoin is held in coin form by hedge funds or as an ETF doesn't seem to matter to me.  The ETF shares would never surpass the value of the basket of coins covering them. Plus, if they create derivative products based on bitcoin, who's going to pay bitcoin for a derivative of bitcoin? NO ONE!  They might pay USD, but that system will probably collapse anyway.
 People with billions are going to get their hands on bitcoin in greater numbers than the average Joe at this point, so long as the current holders sell it to them.
Is there anything realistically we can do about that?
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:59:04
so you're implying we're at the halfway mark of transaction capacity? That would mean that the backlog of transactions will grow faster than the network can process. Surely, this concern has been addressed, especially at the current level of activity.

So in my example, the grocer will get immediate confirmation that the transaction is invalid?
The reason I believe bitcoin can either dominate completely, or perish, is because until we get rid of exchange rates, bitcoin will experience higher volatility than what a centralized currency would, since there is no price fixing for bitcoin (which instills confidence in a currency as a store of value).
Also, I define double-spending in an additional way:  I get to keep my bitcoins since I move them to an alternate address, and keep the goods and services I scammed.

This is why bitcoin is so risky and is always cited as a "new paradigm".  It doesn't simply substitute one asset class or another, instead it consolidates many asset classes, (in it's ideal iteration, which to me is being technically feasible to be used by billions of people), all the while providing brand new services.
How would you define today's smartphone back in the year 2000? Is it a phone? Two-way pager? Mini-laptop? Camera?  
It's actually more than the sum of its parts: a camera and two-way paging equals services like MMS and Snapchat.  A camera and phone equals handheld Skype or Facetime.
 
That's how I view bitcoin, it is more than the services and asset-classes it replaces, simply because adding them creates more than 1+1
It is an all-inclusive, voluntary, value-tracking ledger, measured by consensus of the participating agents

Then I'm assuming this protocol can be overruled once it's determined that the network is healthy enough with legitimate transactions to be expanded?  I'm trying hard to grasp what the limits of the network are.  This transaction limit is fatal and self-defeating. It surely has to change, or Bitcoin is deader than dead.  
Who wants to fuck around with this kind of volatility for the long-term?  The hope, if bitcoin is the real deal, is that bitcoin will reach a market cap of which it will be stable, but in this case the transferabililty of this currency seems to be a huge hurdle for bitcoin to reach a stable point in it's life.  
At 1000 transactions per block limit, we can expect to see exhausting levels of volatility given the potential holders of BTC (6 billion people) in the world for such a small transactional cap

the chart-believers who are failures (most likely outnumber you old lucky ones) are usually quiet or have moved on in life.  Chart analysis is rooted in big shit.  For every chart theory of a price due to move down, there is an equivalent chart theory that the price will move up; selecting between them and coming out ahead is just a matter of luck.

@_date: 2013-05-09 23:35:04
There's no telling how this will play out.  I don't foresee a smooth transition from dollars to BTC regardless of the adoption rate.
An adoption of bitcoin devalues the dollar.  The more bitcoin is accepted in any capacity in the US, the more bonds the Fed is going to have to issue to withdraw dollars from the economy to keep the dollar stable.  However, this issuing of bonds will not come cheap.  People are going to want a high rate of return on these bonds to beat back the USD inflation rate that the growing BTC adoption is causing. In return, this will cause the US government to eventually default, unless it begins heavily taxing the USD (most likely at the corporate or cap gains level) which will incentivize these entities to switch to BTC. I see it a bit more chaotic than this description though.
I don't think BTC is as non-threatening as most people write it off to be;  I feel like BTC is more of an unstoppable cancer to the current financial system.  If the government regards it as benign at this stage, it will eventually kill the current financial system if left unchecked, all technical hurdles aside, however.

Remove the "Bitcoin" label from what it is and what do you end up with?  Bitcoin is more of a behavior, not a product that requires almighty competition.  Saying "Bitcoin" needs competition is very much like saying the internet needs competition.  I promise you, this is true.
Currently there are more than just one internet (think private networks).  These ultimately are inefficient, since they lock others out of those sources of information,

Bitcoin doesn't need competition if it is always evolving to become the perfect solution.  If you end up having a perfect currency, competition becomes an inefficiency.
EDIT: Bitcoin's competition is built into its open-source nature. The collective competes and approves the best ideas for improvement. If you don't like how bitcoin is coded, you can actually influence its change by getting involved in its development.

Also, it needs to be backed by gold, which is backed by trucks and sticks of dynamite. Hur.

The hope is that speculation and today's desire to trade bitcoin for dollars will eventually spread bitcoin in everyone's pocket.  Dollar to BTC speculation is essential for the early spread of bitcoin.
Let me ask you this:  Do a shitload more of people own +1 BTC today than they did 2 weeks ago by a factor of 2 or more? I believe so.   This is part of implementation.

Do this:
Say: "I want a bitcoin".
Stare at the exchange price for bitcoins and when you see a price you like, say: "I will buy this bitcoin at x price".
Pretend you bought it. 
Now wait.
Watch the live price on the exchange go up or down.  
Now here is the tricky part: pretend reaaaaal hard that you actually bought that bitcoin earlier, and if the price goes down, try to get in touch with your fake emotions and see if you're willing to sell before the price goes any lower.  If you weather the storm, you stand to make a lot of fake money, or you could go bust.
If the price goes up, kick yourself in the ass for not having gotten in for real.
This is about the same experience as a simulation, but you only need a pencil and paper.

The price settles for 5-9 months at 3-5x the previous bubble high.  So if the previous high was $32, the price of the next bubble settling will be around $90-$100.  The previous high (April) was around $250, so you can expect the price this time around to settle between $700-800 for a couple of months.  
Now, the peak of bubbles are around 6-8 times the settling price of the previous cycle.  So expect the next peak in around 6 months to be $5-8k.
Very predictable given the exponential nature of groundbreaking technology adoption.
Ceteris paribus, of course. 
Notice all the newbs on the front page saying they're in it for the long run?  Those guys will be holding the price until at least some of their expectations are met. Their expectations are 10x in the next half year.  They paid a lot for their coins and they are going to make their mark

But the amount of resistance you put up for no gain whatsoever to yourself (bitcoin fails, your life doesnt change) is going to kill you.

Of course a lot of people have "ideas" with little execution. It's regulation.  If it weren't for regulation, there would be no hurdles from a business standpoint.
You talk about the bitcoin ATM idea as if it were idiotic and not worth the investment, without mentioning the only hurdle: REGULATION. 
So it's not a project that a layperson can take up; it's not feasible.  But we must show our demand for it (enthusiasm) because that's the side of the transaction that really drives entrepreneurs to get things done and maybe regulation can change. That's our part.  Your part is to just sit and bitch for no fucking reason. What I don't get is that if it is a successful idea in the near future, you look like a jackass, but if it doesn't succeed, what part did you play? The piece of shit guy with little imagination and risk-averse business sense (yawn).

My concern is that immediately prior to me reaching the coffee counter, I transfer the .004 BTC to another address right before I pay for my cup of coffee, increasing my chances that every time I make a purchase, I walk out of the store with a free item (because the transaction that occurred prior to the coffee purchase was the one to eventually confirm).
If everyone did this, we're talking high rates of loss for merchants of low-priced items.

Algo trading works virtually off of tiny, tiny arbitrage opportunities through massive volume trading, NOT TECHNICAL ANALYSIS.

But I'd gladly have the businesses figure out what the cost of their plates are, rather than live with the reality that the sap that's bringing me my food (and the bus boy, and who knows how many kitchen staff) needs to cover most of his/her living expenses based on what I deem their service is worth, which is an extremely difficult task without knowing ALL the fucking variables that go into running a restaurant (e.g. Did the waiter have a slow day or a good day? How much of the tip will be shared and how much do these other people make?)
Fuck that. The nature of the tip should always have remained what it was intended: service above and beyond expected, you condescending fuck. Not "The customer needs to make up for the wage shortfall and deal with fake customer service as a result".

You know, I would love to see BTC take over the entire economy, and I do understand these tradeoffs, but we're talking a long time before people become hip to what risks they can take based off the price of their goods or services.
It's easy to see how a tire shop faces low risk of BTC fraud, because by the time the tires are mounted, the transaction is confirmed.  
But if we're talking .15 - .25 BTC movie tickets, where the box-office cannot wait for confirmation before moving to the next customer, or 2 BTC worth of groceries, there is incentive to perform this network analysis, or at least just take a shot at moving your money elsewhere prior to paying.  These are transactions that require high turn-over of customers through the cash-out line that are attached to high-value transactions.
I'm not saying that I'm trying to make out with free groceries at a 100% success rate, but if I were a scammer, I would definitely take a shot at moving 2BTC elsewhere to see if I get lucky.
Am I still off?

In the same amount of time (it'll take me roughly a week to get to Seattle)  and without the convenience of familiarity, I'd like to demonstrate to myself that bitcoin has come a long way in such a short amount of time (e.g. Gyft wasn't accepting bitcoin at the time Hill's experiment was underway) as a viable means of exchange.

By the way, there's no fuckin way you can get 1billion+ people to simultaneously agree to adopt a new form of currency all at once, especially in a pre-crypto-coin world. Bitcoin was launched organically and some of us knew about it long before we decided to invest in it, simply because we either didn't do the research soon enough or didn't believe in its power.

bitcoin isn't about saving a couple of pennies in transaction fees.  If you want to tone it down for the little lambs, then so be it, but truth is much larger.
The reason you see this over-whelming outpour of "fundamentalists" is because after so many years of railing against the enitity they despise, a way to take it down has been devised better than any before.  If you spend years dwelling on how to make the world a better place, rather than the mundane shit most of are usually concerned with as important, then you become hyper-sensitive to solutions to change, especially non-violent ones.

It's poorly thought out considering the real bitcoin economy (merchant trade) is growing at who knows what rate.  If you peg 1 btc at $100 USD, that's roughly a 1.1Billion USD in trade. I'm hoping that will be blown away by the end of the year. 
Plus, who's to say that the US is going to be BTC's main market in the next year?
BTC doesn't play by centralized rules, everyone knows this yet they keep trying to fit this square peg in a round hole.  The fact that we're still talking about solutions on how to stabilize its current volatility shows how narrow the vision is of those who are talking about said volatility.  It does not matter.

someone correct me here but I believe miners can set whatever fees they choose. The forces of market equilibrium should allow us to send for smaller fees so long as the block-winner lets our fee through.
Miners will not want to set their fees too high, since they will be left out of all of the valuable lower fees that they could've picked up at no extra resource cost.

Precisely. The fundamentals that back the rise of a company's stock price and the forces that cause demand for a highly liquid medium of exchange have to be wildly different.  Bitcoin is global liquidity unlike anything that has ever existed before. The USD doesn't even come close to what this is.  Bitcoin is a truly free-floating asset that can only be predicted by understanding the collective psychology of all potential spenders of bitcoin.  Something that is impossible to know.  
A company's stock price is driven by financials which are themselves backed by questionable accounting sometimes, and the belief in the ability of the company to penetrate the market and not fuck up.
Bitcoin suffers from only the flaw of the whole system fucking up or getting shut down.  Otherwise, it's positioned to grow forever, unless a more appealing cryptocurrency beats it out.

[According to this article]( it is estimated that there are close to 400 trillion equivalent pennies in circulation around the globe.  
By the time bitcoin is done counting, there will be 2.1 quadrillion satoshis in the market.  That is around 5 times as much divisibility.  
If we were to consider the nickel as the smallest **functional** unit of currency (and therefore comparable in utility to the satoshi at a point where BTC has eroded, through loss, to a value of 1satoshi=1nickel), then we are talking about 25 times more money supply than what is currently available, since there are only 80 trillion equivalent nickels in circulation. 
There will be an inflationary effect in play as BTC erodes through loss, however for 1satoshi=1penny, BTC supply would have to erode 80%; for 1satoshi=1nickel, 96% of all BTC would have to disappear, since 4% of 2.1quadrillion equals 84 trillion, which is the current money supply in equivalent nickels.
In other words, by the time BTC erodes 96%, I predict something better would have come along (transcendence, maybe?). 
Edit: this is a hypothetical scenario where BTC comes to replace all other currency.  In a situation where other currencies still exist, the concern for erosion is smaller.  
Final caveat: the 400 trillion penny figure sustains a 2009 global economy. Implying that if we are looking to expand global economic activity several multiples past 2009ish numbers, then fixed BTC may not be a good solution.

he may have been wrong about the cost to mine an oz of gold, but gold does have [velocity]( attached to it, just like fiat.  Every ounce of gold traded above the cost of the initial mine creates wealth.  So if it cost $1500 to mine an ounce of gold, and that ounce of gold changed hands 5 times at $1600, that's $500 dollars (not $100) that was created.

This Mt. Gox lag may be staving off panics, allowing people to take advantage of small dips.
For example, in a perfect execution, people might sell, sell, sell after -10%, plummeting the value, but as soon a panic kicks in, Mt. Gox lags, and buyers just see an opportunity to buy at -10% discount instead of a dud.

People who would not bother understanding the basics of holding bitcoin or undertaking the security risks of bitcoins will do well to invest in the paper market.  That's who the ETF is for.  
ETF is all good and ZERO bad for bitcoin.  You guys are very stupid around here.  Those who are interested in holding actual bitcoin will do so, those who want more liquidity in the form of speculative instruments deserve to have it.   BTC will always be BTC; not some digital representation of USD.  That's not its long-term purpose.

It's unregulated, dipshit. So it cannot be a method of payment without having some market value denoted in whatever asset the market is willing to tie it to (e.g. in the US, that asset is mainly the USD).

@_date: 2013-07-03 04:26:57
Yes. And when demand goes up for this btc ETF to the point that the price of the shares represents the underlying btc, other ETF'S will follow, causing a run on btc purchasing to back these new ETF's.  Existing ETFs will see a jump in price, while btcs themselves experience the same.  Bubbles may ensue, but awareness and accessability is what's important here, and those will skyrocket.
Oh, the possibilities.

Bitcoin is an infinite supply of money distributed to a finite number of people. 
It's the distributed **ratios** of total bitcoins per person that drives bitcoin purchasing power, not some arbitrary number on the price tag of goods and services.  Even if gold were super-portable it wouldn't have these qualities.

I'm willing to bet that there is an equal or larger amount of speculators losing money.   There is no problem going long. The whole reason you go long is because you have a different belief of what the timeline for benefit looks like.
Speculators can make several grand today, but risk losing a lot of it if they never go long and keep playing BTC short.  BTC will only get more expensive in the future (if it holds) and playing it short is going to cost a whole lot more. Meanwhile, the one's who were patient had very little work to get there. It's an attitude thing, I guess

@_date: 2013-05-09 23:52:09
I dont think it needs to be said anymore. 
Bitcoin's volatility is not hurting adoption at all.  It's almost as if people who adhere to that argument are really saying: "Bitcoin's volatility is preventing it from being adopted faster".   How fast should bitcoin be adopted? Do you expect such adoption to be relatively stable? Do you expect instant, universal adoption? Of course you wouldn't.  Not if it's decentralized. 
A growing market like bitcoin (whose lowest customer base is anyone with a computer and access to an exchange) needs to find its price.  Its volatility is a direct reflection of people trying to peer into BTC's future based on present events, so talking about its volatility at this point is really a waste of time and breath.
By the way, long-term, BTC's volatility against the USD or any other major currency is supposed to be N/A.  You're either on board with this idea or you're not.  There is no middle ground on this issue. Side-by-side currency is only a temporary phase.

You have to keep in the front of your mind that people bought bitcoin at $1 or so and hoarded a lot.  When the price shot up, they let some of it go, spreading it among a lot more people.  The volatility will dramatically be reduced the more the currency spreads out.  **These bubbles are essential to entice early adopters to let go of their hoards**. I welcome the bubbles because they attract more users and release bitcoin from others' stashes to those users.
Repeat the cycle over and over again and you'll realize that the volatility disappears because "everyone" has bitcoins, so they are no longer looking for more (as compulsively).  At that point, merchants will undoubtedly have grown to accept bitcoin, since it will be so easy to implement, plus the volatility has reduced since "everyone" has them. When holders no longer see a large return from bitcoin (or fear they might even plummet in value), they will spend them.
 Why would a merchant refuse an easily implementable bitcoin payment system that offers them the ability to immediately exchange into another currency (if they wish), reduce transaction fees and other risks, and forego potential sales?
This is my rationale for the success.
