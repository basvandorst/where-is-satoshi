Just keep buying! Every idiot unite and buy more when price is above 10k!

Just buy some popcorn and prepare to watch drama. Idiots buying BTC with ridiculous prices are gonna lose a lot of money once few whales decide to sell their positions. This crypto game is all about following whales and their trading decisions. BTC itself is just a trash coin without any purpose in the future. Those who hold too long will lose most.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:07:28
All idiots unite! Now it is time to buy overpriced BTC and hold! All your money belong to those who bought BTC 3k-5k price! Buy high now!
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:28:36
It will crash again. Its the nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's only purpose is to pump money from those who hold it too long.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:50:38
Absolutely! Now it is time to buy you idiots! Please use all your money to increase Bitcoin price! It is going to be hilarious to see how idiots buy above 10k price and make more profit for people who bought 3k-5k price! Idiots are needed to pay this pyramid profits! Please believe that Bitcoin will be 40k or 400k in near future! Keep buying like retards!

Bitcoin represent antique technology in current cryptomarkets. It has no use in the future. If someone really wants to buy it with these prices good luck :)
FOMO and idiotism are strong with people who invest to BTC. It is only good that they are robbed.

Libra's value is tied for real money and it will be supported by major payment solutions (Paypal, Mastercard etc). You can use it widely for payments anywhere in the world. It works on the platform (FB) that is well known everywhere and it will be protected by financial institutions. Its purpose is to be like a real money.
Bitcoin however is only a pyramid structure that has no real use value (except some rare cases which are already decreasing), because it is too clumsy from technological perspective. Bitcoin's value is based only for FOMO. Idiots believing that it will be something big in the future and pumping its value up. When whales sell their positions pyramid starts again from the bottom and so on.  Bitcoins only practical value is to hide money from government (taxes) and officials (drug money, laundering etc) for a short time before selling them somewhere in the world. Bitcoin won't ever get any legal protection if it is stolen or missing.
These are the basic fundamentals of both currencies.

FOMO is strong!
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:32:15
Insurance when investing to the Bitcoin? LOL! Its whole value is based only for FOMO and money pyramid. At least gold has something use value :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:58:53
Whales need that people go long! Otherwise pumping price up is going to cost too much for them. Just keep hodling and dreaming about 400k Bitcoin! That dream never comes true, but whales will thank your easy money!
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:21:31
Have fun buying Bitcoins! Hopefully you all become rich! I'm out.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:23:22
Libra will be 1000x times more usefull than Bitcoin. It can be actually used for buying things. Bitcoin is only money pyramid where whales pump some value and then most stupid holders will lose their invest.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:43:29
Just buy more and hodl. Whales will need your money when they start selling. You can dream that Bitcoin goes to 400k, but in reality it won't even break 20k anymore. Have fun!
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:00:04
LOL! We need definetily some new memes where some idiots are paying 10k+ prices and think BTC is cheap. 
"YO DAWG! SOLD MY HOUSE AND BOUGHT 10k+ Bitcoins to get rich in the future... it will be 400k soon!" :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:38:31
Yea! Just keep buying Bitcoin you poor idiots! Your money is needed elsewhere! Whales will need your money! Bitcoin price will be 40k and then 400k in the near future, right?!... or at least you can believe so!  In fact there will be no real use case for Bitcoin in the future, because it is trash technology and its values is based for nothing, but you can still keep pumping all your money on it! Just hold and let whales take your money for better purpose!  Trust the whales and their news that BTC will rise to 40k or 400k. You can just keep believing that BTC will go to moon, but in real life that won't never happen! Whales will begin to mass sell their positions in very soon, because they need your easy money! You are stupid enought to buy BTC when its price is more than 10k. You will deserve to lose all your investments for such stupidity. Have fun with your lost money!
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:29:11
Time to sell BTC for new idiots! Its almost one year since last idiots bought it to the 20k.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:55:43
It will be big sell time soon. Idiots buying BTC over 10k price and believing ridiculous future prices. It will be fun to see how they cry when realizing that price won't go so high while taking loans and buying 10k+ BTC :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:06:58
When people talk that BTC goes up to 100k idiots think they will get easy 10x profit by investing now. In best scenario price could peak to near 14-15k but then whales begin to sell their positions. Whales bought BTC when price was about 3-5k. Mass selling will happens so fast that idiots who bought BTC above 10k+ won't get any profit while price goes down under 10k in few minutes and stay there until there is enough new idiots to pay more than 10k+ again. It takes some months.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:07:18
Have fun waiting 40k! Take all possible loans and buy BTC because price under 40k is cheap as hell!
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:46:19
I know that direction will be soon down and fast. No need to be rocket science to see that happening. This is probably last time Bitcoin will be over 10k before new practical cryptocurrencies are starting to come markets (Libre etc). They are actually useful instead BTC which is technologically shitcoin with blockchain 1.0 technology.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:13:02
Sure and the world is also flat.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:17:20
This picture is already more than 5 year old.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:15:36
Just keep buying now! Take loans and invest all money to Bitcoin! It is cheap now when it is under 40k and 400k! Don't worry if there is no use for Bitcoin in the future and it is too clumsy for any real time payment, but just keep buying it and increase its price! Whales will love you when you give them easy money!
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:20:46
Technically Bitcoin is shitcoin when we compare it to against new cryptos. It represents blockchain 1.0 while there is already blockchain 4.0 in development. If you don't know anything about blockchain development I am not going to start to explain it here for you. Just keep pumping your money to shitcoin and post moon and lambo pictures to reddit while keep dreaming your investments rise like a rocket. You will see truth sooner or later.
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:43:19
We won't see Bitcoin going to 100k ever. Not even 20k anymore. We can expect that new cryptocurrencies based on hybrid blockchains are on market before 2024. Then there is no need for useless Bitcoin anymore. Bitcoin had big advance by coming first in market, but it will change soon. Bitcoin can't offer anything technologically same like new cryptocurrencies that solve scalability, performance and stability problems. Bitcoin value is based only for money pyramid and nothing else.
