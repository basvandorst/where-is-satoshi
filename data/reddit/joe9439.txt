You can exercise a futures contract though. That's kind of the point of having the futures in the first place and what makes sure it's tied to the actual value of the underlying asset. If you buy futures in gold you can actually have physical gold delivered to your house if you want to.

The blockchain is decentralized. Many different individual miners control it by processing transactions for the network. If you have thousands of people making sure that transactions go through honestly and fairly then no one person has control.

Yes, you need a wallet program for each type of crypto. Never try to send one type of crypto to an address for another type of crypto by accident. For example, bitcoin and bitcoin cash are two different coins!
Make sure your computer is secure by the way. If you're storing coins in a wallet on your computer and your computer has a virus you money could easily be stolen. Many people have a separate computer they use only for their digital wallets and absolutely no other purpose. Make sure you have a paper backup of every wallet you have also. You need the seed or private key to access your money should your computer become dead. You need a physical piece of paper to serve as a backup to the wallet on your computer.
Do your research and be careful. I see people post all the time about losing tens of thousands of dollars. Take your time and learn. If you're unsure about something learn more about it before you move forward with a wallet or a transaction.

A lot of us are Americans which mean we are citizens of the North Korea of the financial world. It's not worth the personal risk. The IRS operates on vengeance/politics and not on hard law. The financial system, laws, and agencies surrounding it are convoluted and equally as sketchy.
We need some smart Somali guy to open an exchange. I think that's what I'm saying. The exchange could become more valuable than the country it resides in and then bitcoin is basically a country.

Well I see it happening two ways. There could be nodes run by the stores themselves and nodes run by central payment companies that bring different retailers into the network and set them up with payment terminals, similar to what VISA does now.
I think that the disadvantage to a store doing it themselves is that someone has to dedicated a chunk of cash specifically to that store. I could see that being an advantage for the store that they may provide a discount for. If someone throws down $500 in their Mcdonald's account then they better get like a 10% discount or something.
The advantage to a VISA-like node company would be that you can throw $500 into an account that could be used at like 500 different stores. I guess then you may not get any discount on what you buy and may actually have to pay 1% or something like that on your transactions for the convenience of running payments through them.

Buy the bitcoin on Coinbase. After you buy it either leave it at coinbase and run the risk of coinbase going away eventually and taking your money. Or instead of that you can transfer them to your own wallet on your own computer like electrum. There's an exchange and then there's a wallet. If you use an exchange as your wallet you're running a risk that the exchange may not always be there.

I think there's plenty of buying. There's just a lot of people dumping like 100 coins at a time and getting out.
I agree with what you're saying but I think it's not that cut and dry. There is insane demand but right now you're seeing the guy with 100 coins distribute those to 1000 new buyers. 1 holder turns into 1000 holders and there's a potential there for future price growth.

Increasing the number of transactions in a block will not reduce the amount of fees paid. The number of transactions will just expand until the fee is what it is now again.
It’s like when you build a 10 lane road because the 2 lane road was congested. That 10 lane road will become congested also.
We basically need a different system of variable block chain size that would basically tie fees for transactions to the price of buying storage.
Maybe we can have people paid for block storage and that be separate from people being paid for mining transactions. Both groups get paid accordingly.

Yeah basically people will be more secure in making bitcoin business related investments because they will have a way to hedge against bitcoin dropping to $10 tomorrow. With futures price becomes largely irrelevant to investment, at least short term swings. Right now with no futures bitcoin is too volatile for real companies to take it seriously and there's no way to hedge against that.

Could you not set up a super connected node with a bunch of relationships established with different retailers. Then you could charge a monthly fee (or small transaction fee) for access to that supernode?
Basically we are creating the VISA and Mastercard of Bitcoin but I guess the difference is that you can just create your own supernode and compete with no restrictions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:51:56
The wallet on your computer (or paper wallet) is just a way to access and interface with the money you have stored in the blockchain. It's a way of using your keys to send money out of your address. You address can receive bitcoins at any time since the blockchain is always being processed by computers somewhere in the world.
By the way. An exchange is not a wallet. I'm just saying that because a lot of people get confused. An exchange can close at any time and take your bitcoins with it when their website stops opening when you put in the web address. Or an exchange can get shut down by the government. Or they can just flat out decide that having several billion worth of bitcoin in their account is too tempting and the executives take off to a tropical island with the money. If you need to use an exchange that's fine but get your money out of there when you're done with the exchanging.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:13:27
So the way I see it is that we're basically creating a system where a few people with a maximum extended network size are making direct transactions with a few retailers. Then everyone sends money through them. That could be an advantage for marketing. Does the guy settling transactions with the retailer get to charge a fee for doing that though? Maybe I want to charge $1 per transaction to give people the convenience of not having to setting the transaction for $15 by themselves.

I don't think that it's necessarily bad to become a millionaire by paying people minimum wage. They're working for you because you're the best opportunity they have at that time. You can either pay them minimum wage and give them skills while they work for you or they can sit at home doing nothing while collecting government benefits because they don't have a job. I don't think that anyone has an obligation to pay anyone more than the minimum wage and people don't have an obligation to take up a low paying job prospect if they have better options available. With that said, I never pay my employees minimum wage. I do my best to retain good people by paying them above what the market will offer.
To say that business owners should feel guilty for hiring people is a an excuse for deferment of responsibility by those employees who are content with making a meager income and don't push to better themselves and make their skills more marketable. 
The emphasis should be on individuals being responsible for bettering themselves and not on the community being responsible for some type of collective improvement which can't happen anyway if the individual has no interest. College can be free and betterment can be accessible but none of that matters if nobody cares about trying to improve their position in life. If anything those that would like to make it easier to climb the ladder in life take away the incentive to do so because things like free education comes at the expense of much higher taxes which means less of an incentive to make more money. I know several people who have turned down promotions and new opportunities because making more money would just put them into a higher tax bracket which would make them earn less take home pay.

Right, but if you're a business owner there are no exemptions because you either own a business in the US that is taxed in the US regardless of where you are physically or you own a foreign company that is taxed in that foreign country and back in the US if you own more than 50% of that company due to subpart f rules. It costs so much to even figure out the exemptions and do the paperwork if you qualify for them that it negates much of the savings that you may get.

Hong Kong spends less than half what the USA does as a percentage of GDP. Clearly they are doing pretty well.

There's a difference between lawless and a country with minimal government in comparison to the private sector. I don't think that total anarchy is the way to go. The US is very very far from a reasonable size though. I just want a reasonable non-oppressive government, not a giant hulking beast government.
Edit: You may want real numbers. I want a government that spends less than 5% of GDP. The US spends something like 40% of GDP right now. I want a government 1/8th the size of the US government. A government can have laws and function at that size easily. They just can't redistribute what is not theirs at that size.

Right, the IRS doesn't mess around with business owners so I'm squeaky clean. I'm in the process of setting up an accounting system to keep track of every single penny so if I'm audited they can't pin anything on me. 
After all taxes and cost of compliance with taxes and regulations I pay something like 50% of my income out to the US government, state, and local governments here. I've hired tax attorneys to try to find a way to minimize the tax burden but there isn't a way other than to grow the business. Business taxes are essentially regressive here. If my business grows I can pay a lower percent in taxes. Companies like Google and Apple pay like 5% or less while small guys like me are stuck in the neighborhood of 40-50%.
I would do something like open a foreign bank account and not tell them but due to FBAR all international banks are required to report accounts owned by US citizens to the IRS. You can't get away with that anymore. Maybe I could open something with a shady drug cartel bank but I don't want to die.
If I married a foreigner they couldn't get citizenship. I'd probably move to wherever they are instead. If they became a US citizen that would just undo any tax advantage that I gained by marrying them.
I'm spending next month in China and I plan on traveling a lot. I'll find people to meet with about business so I can write the travel expense off. At least I can do that. But maybe during my travels I'll meet someone.

They generally don't want to accept US customers because the reporting requirements will cost them a lot more than the customer will earn in revenue for the bank. A bank employee may have to spend an entire day doing paperwork to send to the IRS for a guy that is going to earn the bank $5 that year with the money he has in the checking account.
Also, if the bank has any US customers they can come under scrutiny by the US government even if they are not in the US. It's just easier many times to not have any US customers and not run the risk of the US government getting involved in their business.
Just recently the US government fined a Swiss bank 2.6 billion for helping Americans evade taxes. Of course the US doesn't have any jurisdictional authority to levy that fine. What they do is threaten to prevent the bank from sending any US dollar denominated transfers until the fine is paid. Since the US dollar is the world reserve currency the bank would essentially be out of business. To avoid the US from having a reason to give a fine in the first place for a bank maybe doing something unintentionally the banks sometimes avoid having US citizen customers.

I'd rather things be blocked and I can get around it than the US where they examine my internet activity and may kill me at any moment for being a "potential future terrorist" minority report style. I'm not even sure that VPN is illegal in China but if it is then they're not going to enforce that law.
And on the currency conversion, being allowed to convert my USD is so great when I can't open a foreign bank account to put that foreign currency that I converted to in and any foreign account that I open is reported back to the US government. A Chinese person can earn money in the US or any country and have a foreign bank account and their government doesn't know or care.
I'll take a $50K USD conversion limit if I can work and do business outside of the US without having to report everything back to my masters in the US.

I think democracy may actually be the issue. The country was not supposed to be a democracy and it was much less so at its founding. It's supposed to be the country of being free whether you like it or not, not free unless you want to grant exceptions to freedom such as wanting to vote for someone who will give you free healthcare, a cell phone, food, and social security. I'll take the true freedom being forced on me by the constitution rather than a crappy form of freedom that is forced on me by the will of the masses any day.

The government can't inflate the currency to pay the bills when the currency is backed by gold. They got rid of gold because it was limiting the growth of government spending.

The market usually takes care of these things. They aren't going to build a giant power plant or factory in a residential area because the power company is not going to pay a billion dollars for the land that would be required when they could just build it a few miles away and pay 5% of the land cost. It makes sense to build factories and things that pollute relatively far away from people.
Houston TX has no zoning yet there aren't really any giant smokestacks in the middle of neighborhoods because that doesn't make any sense from a business perspective. I own a company that makes things. If I built a factory I'm going to build it way the crap in the middle of nowhere because land is cheap and I'm outside of the tax jurisdiction of a city.
I'm in Shenzhen China right now. Pollution is somewhat bad but it's getting better every year because as the city becomes richer factories disperse into the countryside and aren't clustered together in the middle of town. No business owner wants to pay the costs of having a facility in the middle of town and no business owner can sustain those costs without going out of business.

In general I do not eat at dirty looking places and they get less business. Most places are clean not because of government regulation but because they actually want people to buy things.

The USA may be more free directly but we have no escape from the taxes and regulations. Someone in China can open a business, pay very little taxes, and live extremely well.

Not true. If a company is not incorporated you are self employed and taxed as earned income + self employment tax. Bitcoin is not a company but the IRS could deem it his business if he created it and then profited from it. There's a lot of room for them to twist the law and screw him over if they wanted to.

China is awesome. After coming to China I am still trying to wrap my head around just how backwards I was conditioned in the US to think that our country is free and China is just a bad "communist" country. In reality China is much more free and the US is much more communist than China is. Neither country is perfect but I'm amazed every day at just how free China is and how wrong I had it. I never saw myself staying in China permanently but this may be where I end up staying because I have a business to run and the US is not the place to do it.

You actually do get your social security check after you renounce.
Right, like a tax case against the federal government in a federal court ever ends up well for the defendant.
The US government will send the black helicopters out to find you and get their pound of flesh.
The best thing to do is go all cash and bitcoin based in the foreign country. For savings put gold in a safe deposit box. In HK there is a shortage of safe deposit boxes right now and that's exactly why. If you get a job tell them that you want to be paid in cash only. Keep filing income tax forms no matter what.

Yeah they just upped the fee like 430% around a month ago.
Edit: 
Also, if you have a net worth of over $2 million or so they "exit tax" everything you own above that amount as if you earned it again as income. So basically they take like half of everything you own above $2 million when you leave. $2 million sounds like a lot but if you own even a small company you can get up there in net worth pretty quickly without being super rich.

I will continue to do what you do with money. Hold onto it until I need to buy something with it. Price is irrelevant. Trading it for dollars is like exchanging money for non-money which makes no sense.
If it did spike to an absurd amount though, like 10K or 100K, I would sell it and buy gold honestly.

When I think communism I think of the economic consequences of it in the terms of redistribution of wealth. "From each according to his abilities and to each according to his needs" as they say. Yes, I know there are other aspects of communism but I think the economic realities of it are the most significant. For the average guy in China there are almost no taxes and no government assistance. For the average American there is a huge percentage of taxes taken out of each pay check and there is a huge network of "government assistance" programs and agencies. In terms of communism in the economic sense I think the US has China beat. In China they have a saying, "no work, no rice." In the US we just give rice to everyone that makes below a certain amount regardless of if they're just being lazy or legitimately need it. In economic terms I think the US is much more communist than China is. Of the people that I know in China I'm not aware of a single person that pays taxes. I couldn't get away with that in the US.

That doesn't work anymore unfortunately. The US government has figured out how to gain leverage over swiss banks. If they don't report your account balance and transactions they will have 30% withheld from all US originated transactions. Also the government may take away their ability to send US dollar wire transfers which would kill their business since the US dollar is the global reserve currency used in all types of international trade. Finally, the IRS shares half of the winnings of someone who is cheating on taxes with the person that told on you so there are and have been swiss bankers that will turn in their clients to get the reward. The ONLY thing you can do at this point is pretty much put gold in a safe deposit box. The IRS can't know it is there and they can't touch it if they do.
Edit: and of course bitcoin. Save in gold and use bitcoin as cash.

All local debit and credit cards have a pin and my Discover card does not. They do not know how to run a card without a pin because they have never done it. Yes, they probably don't know that it can be run on the local UnionPay network also since it doesn't have the logo. I think I can actually set a pin on my card to be used on international transactions but it's still a big confused mess. I just use cash.

Or just nobody has the power to rule and everyone is allowed to be free like things should be. Democrats are concerned about who has the power to make the rules. I want to make it illegal to make the rules so that people are left with the freedom they had before the rules existed. A true democracy is one where you are democratic through the actions that you take as an individual and not one where you vote as a collective group to press rules with a gun on minority groups that didn't win the vote.

And if they do design one it will become garbage the next time the memory requirement increases which is Feb 2016. Good luck spending millions to develop an ASIC that can only be used for a few months. They've got to hit a moving target. The higher memory requirement already makes it more expensive to make an ASIC for the coin but then they only have a small window to get use out of it as well.

I own a business though so it's a little different for me. The foreign earned income exemption does not apply. I can't just start a company overseas because if I own 50% or more it's a controlled foreign corporation and I'll be taxed with business taxes in whatever country the business is located and then the entire income of the company is taxed as personal income regardless of if it was paid out to the owner.
If I can't start a business overseas I'm stuck paying really really high prices for labor and high business taxes over here in the USA. This puts me at a disadvantage to participating in a global market. I can't sell things outside of the US because my stuff would be overpriced.
I'm trying to avoid renouncing my citizenship but if it comes down to it where there is no good way to avoid paying so many taxes and I'm prevented from doing international business I'll do whatever is necessary to fix that. What I'm considering doing is marrying someone from another country and then putting certain legal structures in their name so that it's not subject to US taxation and regulations. I could own like 49.99% of the company and my SO own the remainder and avoid falling under subpart f. This would allow me to open a company somewhere like Dubai and then route all profits to that company and pay no taxes on the income (legally). I can set it up so that shareholder distributions are paid out only to either one of us depending on which of us pays a lower capital gains tax.
I'll probably will end up renouncing whenever I'm worth 2 million because they pretty much take half of everything you own above that if you ever renounce at a later date. Once I hit that net worth I'm gone for sure.

I'm not saying that monarchy is ideal. It's just better than pure democracy. The USA at this point is on the verge of becoming so democratic that it's oppressive.

I personally think that creating new laws that force banks to charge lower prices is a step in the wrong direction. It would be far better to reduce the laws in place to make starting and running a bank easier. Banks would charge lower fees if they actually had real competition. 
It's just the fact that we don't operate on free market principles at all now bothers me and it will ultimately be our undoing. Interest rates aren't even dictated by supply and demand for money. Banks are just like car dealerships for the manufacturer, the federal reserve. The fed is a manufacturer of debt and inflation and we export it to the rest of the world to support a lifestyle that we don't earn.

Wires aren't that bad when you use them routinely. My company does a few international transfers per week so the bank gave me direct access to their wire system so there is no oversight when I send them. They look it over I'm sure but I don't have to actually go into the bank. I also pay $27 per international transfer because I do them so frequently. $27 coupled with the fact that the transfer amount is usually $10K+ makes it not so bad.
I do run into some circumstances where I have to send like $100 by wire and pay the bank fees on either end. So I'll pay $57 to send $100 which is kind of ridiculous. Bitcoin is way better for these type of transactions because the only other option really is paypal which nobody wants to deal with because it's a risk to the seller. Western union is apparently a thing but I could never figure out which form to fill out and the clerk never knows what's going on either.

I think if we (USA) had less banking regulations that would actually be a good thing. More competition = better for consumers. Why would they screw you over if they know you have somewhere else to go? Right now Bank of America, etc. can do what they want to. Most banks are forced to be practically the same by the regulations they have to follow. Banks aren't allowed to differentiate themselves like they should be able to in a free market. If I go to one bank over another they all offer the same services, fees, interest rates. It makes me sick man.
