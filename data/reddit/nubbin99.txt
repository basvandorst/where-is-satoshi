I'm super interested in this. Any books or articles you could point me to? I've seen a few docs including The China Hustle, but I'm hungry for something meatier.

Can you elaborate on this? All I can see is the bad BTC being used in the black market at a price similar to the good BTC, but never crossing back over to the original market.

I read the white paper back in 2010 and been obsessed ever since, but for the longest time had no one to talk to about it IRL.

So much this. If we make sacrifices on the decentralized front, chances of government/banking coercion increase. To the extent that they are successful, we are left with a profoundly inefficient version of what we already have (PayPal, Visa, banks, fiat, etc.).

good question. I will say Tesla, because America/democracy didn't arrive by Jefferson's effort alone, he didn't invent it, and I would say democracy is not what it could be today, nor America.
Telsa's inventions however still affect us today, and their impact is felt everywhere around the globe. (3rd world still gets 1st and 2nd world products)

not so in poker, if the noob gets a good hand, the pro will see that in his behavior bc that is what makes him a pro.

it's ok though, we can just go "secure" some more "interests" to pay for that new debt

I am studying programming, and hope to become freelance some day. Are there many out there paying in bitcoin?

It's true that solely blaming mtgox is unfair. But their influence in this drop is so much more than a snowflake in an avalanche. I think this is a fair analogy:
The fire was likely started by sellers, but mtgox's influence is like gasoline on the fire.
We NEED to diffuse to other exchanges to prevent this from happening more.

just FYI, you should [reconsider]( the Government services point.
It's just one company now, but it's a start.
