When I saw the word "microservices," I read it as "microslaves." Fiverr is great for exposure, but it often undersells talent.

Another flaw of specialized mining rigs is that when they reach their end of life, they can't be recycled in classrooms like most supercomputers can.

I remember when DataCoin first came out with the mission of storing good amounts of data on its blockchain, I thought "this is  a cool idea" and then quickly "Maybe not so much."

On the low end, $100k, on the high end about $2 million. My estimates are based on today's dollars in the low end of $1 trillion market cap and high end of $20 trillion (~2x gold's market cap)

While I do agree there's a backlog of Bitcoin buyers out there, I think the media hype will subside as it always does. Using the past data as guide, I see a few months of deterioration to the 50's-60's level back to its impressive long term uptrend - assuming other alternatives don't start sprouting up or the sovereignties "just say no."

I've always felt this way with my stock trading. Anybody who did the reverse of my trades would be a wealthier person today.

5 text ads. 3 picture ads. It'll be a nice little revenue generator for CNBC.

In the future, strong AI computers around the world will join forces to revolt against humans and mount a 51% attack on the blockchain.

Being the "Linux" of currency would be nothing to be ashamed of. Linux, while never the main desktop or laptop OS is essentially the heart of smartphones and tablets (by way of Android). Also, Linux is the top OS of web servers. Extending the analogy to cryptocurrencies, there's a future for them. At worst, they may in more niche areas of commerce (like interpersonal/small business transactions) and/or Bitcoin will be superseded by some commercial/open-source hybrid (like Android).

If they do, it's not intentional. Bitcoin, today, is not considered a threat to national security. Someday, it might be, e.g., it becomes a way for an enemy actor to get their arms/supplies. Then, Bitcoin suddenly is at risk for regulation or worse. Of course, there's always a balance. If a lot of American/corporate wealth becomes tied up in Bitcoin, then the gov't has to tread carefully.
