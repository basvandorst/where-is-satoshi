Well done! I have the same goal buying small amounts every day. Still a long way to go for 1 BTC

Sadly I lost some funds I had in a Electrum wallet due to some hack. Can’t remember if I updated the Electrum from another site or weird things happened when I swiped my private keys from Multibit HD. At least it was a small amount and not all my crypto. 
I learn the hard way and now I am buying a hardware wallet.

That sounds great! Definitely this is what I need, I want to be more careful for every transaction I make. Thanks for explaining it.
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:58:47
Sorry, can you elaborate more? I have never used a hardware wallet before.

A good lesson is to diversify and never put all at once. DCA is a good strategy. I don’t know how much you put but if you buy now at 5K then you will have an average of 12.5K. If you sell at 20K not only you will recover your original investment but you WILL make a profit too. It’s only a loss if you sell. Good call holding all this long. Next time average your investments and set a clear exit goal. Good luck!

That’s good I will also buy for $40-$50 each week till the end of 2019. Hopefully this way I can get to 1 full BTC at the end of 2019.

I have been DCA since a few months ago. It has been the best stress free strategy for me.
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:03:29
I have been following this and is the best stress free scenario. How much are you buying weekly? And, only BTC or also alts?

I am using Coinbase Pro (don’t buy with the regular option), dollar cost average everyday $10. Fees are 0% for the maker and 0.30% for the taker very low. Also I use Kraken and fees for $10 buys are usually between $0.00 and $0.01.

25 cents or nothing.

Too soon to talk ATL for 2019. I think this year will be like 2015 and be lower than the previous year. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:42:30
Me 5100. Getting there!
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:23:59
For me the same, but doing it daily.
