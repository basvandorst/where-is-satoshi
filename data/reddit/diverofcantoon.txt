Nationalism isn't right wing.
Examples of left wing nationalism include Maoism, National Bolshevism and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Hitler was a fascist so no, he wasn't far right. He was staunchly anti-capitalist. The Nazi party nationalised most industries and created a centrally planned economy where the state had control over most businesses.

ETH grew more than BTC did in 2017.
I don't have much faith in BTC's future, I suggest 85% ETH 15% BTC

Uh... they already had paved roads for horse drawn carts and carriages when cars were invented.
If they didn't then cars would have been utterly useless.

Sorry to interject but what is your opinion on ETH vs NEO?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:37:01
Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum all have different purposes. You're comparing apples and oranges.
Bitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency, Ethereum is a distributed computing network and Ripple is a centralised crypto intended to facilitate bank transactions.

Nice strawman. Nobody said that gun control caused the Holocaust but you can't deny the fact that the 1938 *Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons* prevented Jews from arming themselves.
