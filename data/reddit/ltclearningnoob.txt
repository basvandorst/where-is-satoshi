Touché sir! Lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:36:44
Anything on website can be bought with crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:39:36
Coinbase should work ok?
Here's a tip
When verifying amount the bank sends, DON'T include the decimal points
Just enter the numbers, took me forever to realize this and they don't let you know so it's even more confusing lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:58:29
This 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:51:50
It's going to the moon.
If you purchased on Coinbase, you wait for coins but get the coins at the price you initally bought. Is that your question?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:34:36
Made separate account to post this? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:24
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:58:21
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:13:58
It will hit above 30 easily 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:55:32
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:35
Right. This is just the beginning, so crazy
Guess we just wait till the next wave haha
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:14:34
Probably just taking profits, we will head back up soon!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:29:45
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:52:05
Correction will be temporary 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:10:19
That sucks, but in a year or so you probably will be thanking them! Hah welcome! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:38:47
I got in way low, it could crash 50 percent from 14k and I'd still hold, probably would buy more
I'm holding for years, guess that's my plan 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:58:28
no dumb questions! 
Oh i know its going up.. Probably will hangout for a bit at this level to create good position to shoot up farther
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:21:14
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:06:26
That's awesome!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:52
How many places you post this haha!
FUD much
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:40
Buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:54:42
Plot twist: they want bitcoin .. 0.0
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:57:16
Can't stop Bitcoin, sorry :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:25
you will remember! power of positive thinking!
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:29:11
Yes, I think it would be better it you added a "d"
Decentralized Money
Why does it have to be a white hand holding up bitcoin bro?
ha just playin
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:17
it will be much higher in a year. look up!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:57:20
good eyes. Be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:11:27
Bitcoin is king
Then put some in smaller cryptos
Note- I invest in smaller cryptos for better gains maybe but ultimately I want to get more BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:24:08
swoop, don't mind if a doop.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:52:13
I would check this sub out, litecoin, cryptocurrency etc
Youtube a great resource, heres a few I love to watch:
Coin Mastery
this is Bitesizebitcoin's website and fourm, I love it when I dont want to hear all the FUD that reddit always provides plenty of! haha
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:27:43
How you find this sub? Just curious looks like your first post here
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:56:31
You should take the 100$ then just take 10% of the bitcoin instead of fiat :P
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:45:46
They are getting a shit ton of new users, heard like 100k a day? nosourse heard from jsnip4 youtube
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:45:25
Over 100 percent gains already
Can't complain about that!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:39:35
I got $1,200 the other day and it was like 40-60$ in fees from coin base so around there
Use gdax limit orders to buy BTC without fees
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:36:53
One year, I'm sure it's changed but gives you a general idea
Your welcome 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:28:33
I've never used Kraken, however I do use GDAX
Go to Bitcoin/USD tab, select Withdraw, then select BTC address.
Go to Kraken, I use bittrex, but pretty much the same. Go to your BTC wallet and select deposit. It will pull up window that gives you a BTC address to send coins to. Copy and paste that address into the GDAX BTC address.
Select amount to send, then your good to go! Search youtube for it i'm sure you could find a couple videos also!
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:25
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:32:06
Coinbase charges fee. Using Gdax does not charge fees with limit order
youtube coinbase gdax limit order
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:51
like 15 min ago
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:15:13
Have you been following bitcoin at all? Or just recently started watching 
Went from 12k to 19.6k in 2 days, a dip to 15k is reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:40
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:58
wait just a couple weeks. you'll be having alot of fun :P
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:55:02
where you going to get it? You must like tattoos
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:52:51
Where is this? Ha that's awesome 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:22:02
sorry guys i think you might like this though :P
buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:48
Hold you will be jumping for joy in a week or so 
It's 15.7k right now hah 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:57:48
Don't be scared!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:36:56
Haha awesome!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:58:49
Hah awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:32:56
I love watching this guys posts 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:27:46

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:19
Do it
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:59
Wait a week. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:11
Good question! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:16:46
great move!
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:15:39
Yes safe to use coinbase app with credit card and bank info
Look into hardware wallet. After you buy transfer to wallet for maximum security
Ledger nano s is a good hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:23
I think it will as time goes on.  Honestly this craziness really just started recently. Give it a few years and we will be nice and steady... in the triple digits :P
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:16:47
hodl for YEARS man.. this will blow over real quick
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:54:26
coinbase app good place to start, I use still haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:26:55
only way to get usd to gdax is to transfer from coinbase USD wallet, or do bank wire from your bank to gdax
Can't directly draw from gdax out of your bank, have to transfer funds over first, that kinda what you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:45:40
I've had that happen. Call, let them know it was a valid charge.
No problems for me after that 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:02
Yeah that's always annoying.
This the Bcash weekend had more unconfirmed transactions and seemed more like spam attacks to slow network and make bcash look better.
I'm not too smart on subject but this doesn't seem as bad. Big price changes so maybe its just people moving money around.  first time bitcoin has fluctuated 6k USD in a day?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:06:15
Let's go! That is so awesome to hear 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:30
Nope 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:03:39
Wait one week. Ask him how that's going., lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:24:27

@_date: 2017-12-08 04:57:42
I'm down. Higher?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:17:13
I watch gdax like tv 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:07:46
Hold on you will be good
Such big money it will go back up soon 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:14:17
Maybe he has fat fingers 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:05:04
20k! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:31:39
Not possible, that I'm aware of ha notice my username still :P
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:21:01
If you buy off coinbase and use yoour bank account as payment, you get credited for the bitcoin at that current price, but have to wait for btc to arrive
If you send USD to USD wallet from your bank to Coinbase you wait 1 week, and then buy Bitcoin one week later at whatever the price may be
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:05:34
think we are about to give it another go here soon
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:45
Ok check back in a month, or year man.
Smoke a bowl or something too, you sound like a tense guy 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:55:42
the dump is over? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:48:26
Ha thanks!
I stalk this guy's reddit everyday, figured you may enjoy. Something to watch over the years. He takes past performance of Bitcoin and charts the trends. It's not a prediction just a result of past performance.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:27:17
why do you think it will go down?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:42:26
this whole thing is nucking futts. i love it lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:55:23
I would just hodl
This just means it will take a little longer for bitcoin to break through 17,250 since some guy posted 19 million worth of bitcoin for sale at 17,250 hah
It will reach much higher!
Buy some now, and dollar cost average every week or so. Best way to get into bitcoin imo 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:09:41
Healthy dip
It will be 20k soon 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:46:55
Nope. Can't stop the train. Choo choo!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:29:44
honestly man throw 20$ in. You won't regrat it. Shills can make money too
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:24
Let's go!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:48:06
Once you get money on gdax you can purchase using all of it, not worrying about limit.
Once you try and pull money out though, gdax limits you just like coinbase i believe
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:33
Yah might be better to buy on gdax to avoid fees. Sometime bitcoin goes up so fast it's worth paying the fees to buy.. then you can transfer to gdax instantly from coinbase from gdax website
Coinbase USD deposits take like a week. Can then defer to gdax instantly.
You can wire transfer to gdax, some say it takes one to two days. I've never done this however
I see a lot of people saying they missed train because have their money in limbo for a week waiting to get on coinbase to avoid fee, and end up loosing way more cause bitcoin went up 2k+ in that week lol
Save 10$ fees but loose a lot more in potential profits 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:35
I'm kinda confused sorry
Coinbase: can buy bitcoin through credit card or checking account. May have to wait for bitcoin to arrive, but you must have funds in your checking or available credit on credit card to purchase through coinbase.
Gdax: need UsD loaded onto website before being able to purchase coins. 
1) send $$ from USD wallet on coinbase to gdax (not credit card or checking) you must transfer $$ from checking to the USD wallet. This takes about a week, then you can transfer instantly to gdax
2) you can wire $$ from your bank directly to gdax. This takes a day or so, but then after funds are deposited to gdax you can buy coins
Hope that helps
Keep me coming if not!! :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:14:16
Hodl. If your holding for years anyway
If you Day trade probably could make little extra selling and then re-buying... good luck timing that though :p
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:39:55
Welcome! Hodl strong
I watch the price like tv now haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:13:27
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:20:43
Way to keep bitcoin off exchange. Good for long term holding. If your trading I suggest transferring to gdax.com exchange from coinbase. You can buy and sell bitcoin for no fees this way pretty much. 
When you sell bitcoin on app, it goes into your USD wallet on your app. You can then send to your bank. 
YouTube gdax.com Coinbase Limit order
YouTube helps a lot 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:56:23
Still hold true moving forward
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:40:47
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:09:44
Can't do that unfortunately. current price for all coins regardless of when they were mined at currently $16,640.99 :P
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:42:00
Congrats! Don't listen to any haters, any amount put in will yield the same percentage as everyone else! Just amount invested varies
Any questions let me know I'm still learning but would love to help
I see you wanna know about gdax.com
Coinbase and GDAX.com are pretty much same, download coinbase app on your phone or go to website on desktop and set up account. Once you load money into coinbase you can transfer to gdax and make limit orders for free
Sometimes it's better to just pay fees, bitcoin is growing by soo much it won't matter in a short amount of time
Will be 1m eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:50:02
do you even bitcoin bro? :P
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:30:56
you will. don't worry. enjoy the ride :P
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:53:27

:( RIP
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:10:51
I'm still new but a lot of people use bitcoin as a store of wealth and don't actively use transactions, other coins such as litecoin would be better choice because of smaller fees
Can't answer about lightning cause I've only heard about and gots no clue!
Cheers! Ha
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:12:59
Dollar cost average, invest what you can each week or so. Good way to get into bitcoin without going crazy right away
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:06:27
Yes, but spread the amount you want to invest between a few weeks
Dollar cost average is your friend :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:57:02
yes and hodl.
you will win. thank me in one year. your welcome

Talks about bitcoin average doubles every 7 months!! Will be cool to watch over years anyway
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:36:32
I can't flip the quote box in paint lol 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:27:32
Load usd onto coinbase app
Once that settles you can transfer to coinbase's exchange gdax.com
I would google or YouTube how to place limit order in gdax, it allows you to put your offer out there then the buyer is the one who pays fees
YouTube is your friend 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:06:22
Buy now
Dollar cost average good way to invest, small amount each week or so depending on how much you can afford
Long term your still in early imo

@_date: 2017-11-09 22:30:14
Me too, welcome!!! 
I'd suggest downloading coinbase and purchasing a small amount of BTC even if it's just few bucks to get in the game. It's fun to watch, and the returns are not too bad :p
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:06:46
congrats! will be fun watching over the years right!
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:15:56

Ty for providing picture
Might be your location? I'm in USA and have no problems with usd wallet
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:04:32
Yes, maybe split between couple weeks in case it dips
Dollar cost average 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:46:39
Dollar cost average!!
Spread purchase out over week or so 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:53:17
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:53:47
give it too her on christmas and it will prolly be like 50$:P
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:40:05
Do it, get in the game
Put 10 in each week or so :) 
For years!!
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:45:04
interesting, I may wait a bit to buy more ty
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:53:47
This last weekend was the first time I felt that, bought a bit more!! I didn't feel good though I was like scared almost hah
Good post ty
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:02:04

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:35:06
Holy crap it sees the future. Much valuable much wow 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:50:33
Buy some now, hodl that shit
Buy more when it dips
Even where we are now (~$6500) better than where some got in (~$7700)
May go down to 5k.. wouldn't count on it  though :p
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:53:32
Yes that must be it . Shucks :/
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:25:27
lol so true
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:34:05
Yes, should be under USD wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:21:07
You can use gdax.com and make limit order for no fees
Coinbase is gdax.com
So you can load your usd wallet( usually takes a week)
Then transfer instantly to gdax from coinbase and then make limit order to prevent fees 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:03:40
to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:08:49
Awesome!! How long was confirmation on purchases like this? Curious as I have never purchased anything with crypto yet 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:08:55
Put 100 in each week
Dollar cost average is your friend 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:00:58
Less than 7 years
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:07:52
A lot can be answered using search function, and YouTube honestly
But coinbase is a good starter application you can use on mobile or computer
You can purchase, check and use their wallet, however it's not recommended to use their wallet and a lot of people eventually get a hardware wallet
YouTube trezor wallet or ledger nano s. Both are good choices to store your crypto instead of leaving on an exchange or software application
Check out some good youtubers, I learned most from their videos and this sub
Crypto park
Crypto news
Coin mastery
Should be good starter :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:53:35
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:57:18
Coinbase app
Buy bitcoin, buy at cost
Hodl that shit 
It's just begun
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:16:01
I would buy more if it went down... don't get me excited now..
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:11:14

Buy some each week :p
Dollar cost average helps! 
Oh and buy the dips whenever they do come haha
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:07:42
I just started too few months ago
I suggest dollar cost average.. spread purchase out over weeks or months
Also. YouTube bitesizebitcoin. Your welcome, get comfy you don't need to speed up at all we are HODLin to the moon

Amazon Prime link. They are fun !
same one?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:59:31
No wai!!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:39:25
Any amount invested helps.
I am in same boat, try not to let the price of bitcoin discourage from investing small amounts
It's all percentage return!! Yes 1k invested gets more returns than 100, however the percentage it gains is the same!!
Today BTC is up 5-6%! That is great returns for anyone let alone one freaking day!!
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:03:36
Buy the dip
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:06:25
- yes
- send back to coinbase instantly
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:04:03
I purchased mine and it did not have seal
I believe the way ledger is set up it doesn't need physical seal
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:21:33
Good question, I'm curious on this also!
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:59:02
Use coinbase to purchase to begin
Eventually you should get a gdax.com account. It links with your coinbase account and can allow you to purchase BTC without paying fees by placing a limit order
I recommend YouTube! A lot of great channels out there to get you information
Crypto news
Crypto lark
Coin mastery
Are some I like, plenty more though!!
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:00:13
Overstock.com takes crypto
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:03:45
I recently found this website it's fun to watch the Bitcoin ATMs grow! Never used one yet
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:04:55
Go to gdax.com, then view the exchange. You don't need an account to view what I'm talking about 
Once you click view exchange it will open the exchange where you can select BTC ETH or LTC.
When you buy regularly through coinbase you pay a fee, same if you use "market" order in gdax.com. It will immediately purchase your order and charge fee
How to get around fees: you'll see a "limit" button. Click that and then enter how many shares you want to buy and the cost. When you submit order it will put the order out there. It will wait to fulfill order until someone else picks that order up and THEY pay fees
Advantages: no fees
Disadvantages: doesn't buy right away, waits for other party to purchase and pay fees. This could take few min or so depending what price you put it at 
I've had no problem using limit order to avoid fees
Any other clarification needed let me know!!
