I bought $100 worth at about $19k. I’ll HODL and profit from that investment in a month or two. No worries.

10,000 
When 100,00

Like any investment, the more you invest the more you gain if it goes up and the more you loose if it goes down.

If I ever get time travel I'll go back and sell a pizza for 5000 bitcoin and be rich ��

Just because you are paranoid doesn't mean that someone isn't out to get you ��

You fee was 50 sat/byte and the current fee to get included in a block is about 70 sat/byte.
The best advice now is to be patient. You will either get confirmed or refunded. Either way you won't loose your money.

I love my Bread wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:59:08
I am content to invest $100 a month in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 12:12:40
Cash purchase at a bitcoin ATM if you have one in your area
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:38:25
After 2 weeks I e-mailed support and mysteriously my account review finished less that 12 hours later. 
I initiated a second bitcoin purchase with Airbitz today.  Maybe this will work out and I can use them. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 16:50:58
You can use bread wallet with the 12 words too
@_date: 2016-11-07 06:03:22
This is likely a scam
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:41:26
I agree, don't store anything on an exchange. My preference is for "Bread Wallet". 
@_date: 2016-11-05 09:38:21
Just spend you $100 and buy bitcoin on an exchange.

Once the Rare Pepe block chain opens I'll be mining Rare Pepes for insane profit ��
@_date: 2016-11-13 18:51:35
I am a n00b in Bitcoin. I have never downloaded the chain.

I really like the Bitcoin customer loyalty rewards angle. And to claim their rewards they have to get a wallet. Once someone has a bitcoin wallet with anything in it you are halfway there in converting them.

The reality is that the rupee is crashing on the black market due to the government killing the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 22:58:36
Here an example from earlier today. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 10:21:23
Got some bitcoin using circle and moved them into Airbitz. In the process I learned quite a bit. Now I just need to find some opportunities to perform bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 21:44:55
Took your advice on Airbitz but it is giving an error when I try to load my name and address in the screen where you buy bitcoins ��
@_date: 2016-09-25 13:02:29
I live in the US. 
I was reading some reviews and I downloaded bread wallet and I'll check it out as an option too. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 11:58:50
I would like to spend bitcoin when possible to support adoption. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 01:00:20
Awesome �� 
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:29:42
So, in your world the value of bitcoin doesn't fluctuate... the value of fiat fluctuates?
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:00:00
52GB sounds like a lot till you realize that a 1 TB hard drive is about $100. So for $100 you can hold almost 20 years worth of block chain and with internet speeds increasing all the time you will be able to download the full block chain faster 10 years from now than you can today.  
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:56:14
Circle allows $300 a day by default and it can be raised. I don't think they charge a fee if you link a debit card. 
Edit: you have to say what country you're in circle does work everywhere.

A bank run happens because a bank doesn't have enough cash for everyone to withdraw their money at once. People can't withdraw their bitcoins from the block chain.  So, technically no there can't be a bitcoin bank run. 
However, if everyone decides to sell their bitcoins all at once the price could collapse and they would become worthless 
@_date: 2016-10-15 19:15:01
I use circle, but then immediately transfer my coin to a bread wallet. I wouldn't let circle or any other exchange hold my coin. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:34:21
I started using "bread wallet". Look for it in the App Store 
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:23:24
You mean $10 worth of bitcoins or 10 bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-10-14 23:31:08
I didn't realize that,but it makes sense. They have to make some money to run a business. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 10:37:35
I use bitcoin for everyday transactions when I can, but that isn't that often so I end up holding 
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:33:12
HODL your rare Pepes !!!
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:31:58
Definitely the rarest of the rare.... so rare they are only rumored to exist. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:55:16
If only I had known the buy $10 worth of BTC back in 2010 ��
@_date: 2016-10-15 19:13:42
Did you include a transaction fee?
@_date: 2016-10-04 22:21:45
Dear Nigeria Price,
I only have 5,000 bitcoin but I would happily send them to aid in your recovery. All I ask is that you send the $100000000000000000000000000000000 check quickly because there is another Nigerian who needs $100000000000000000000000000000000 and I want to rescue him too. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:42:26
Can someone explain the benefits of this release?
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:19:22
How is the hash generated that all of the miners are trying to find for the next block?
In other words, does someone somewhere know the key to the next block because they generated it?
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:15:50
Thx, I wasn't sure what circle uses
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:11:21
I agree on Circle to buy but for a wallet I prefer bread wallet 
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:01:10
What platform? PC? Mac? iOS? Android?
