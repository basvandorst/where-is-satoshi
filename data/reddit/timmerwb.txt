Progress is happening, but elsewhere in the crypto-sphere, just look around. Nothing is happening here - there is no dialogue, no community, just people trying to justify how ridiculous BTC has become. Posts questioning this routinely get deleted etc. BTC used to be the future (and it was great) but it has already been left behind and isolated. LN might happen one day but by that time there will be several alternatives already in place.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:23
What I mean is, get educated in crypto in general. Around here you're not likely to find much objective information about BTC, if you know what I mean. Looking at the mempool and fee situation is a good place to start :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:39
Anticipate what?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:40
I suppose I reminisce...
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:24:57
No, for usability as cash (i.e. its only use case), it doesn't work anymore. Fees are enormous (like $30 for a $30 transaction). Please look around the Internet for alternative sources of information and get educated.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:43
Crypto markets are highly volatile and largely tied to BTC price. However, no one knows what will happen. BTC is breaking down right now - it is unusable as a transactable currency unless you want to pay $30 fees. Will its price continue to rise? Maybe, but you can't spend it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:52
Errm, why don't you ask the bar to accept a usable crypto currency with (nearly) zero fees? There are plenty of them. BTC is not going to improve any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:11
So a question or two then. What do you think is the probability of BTC dropping below $6k? And if it does, how high a fee are you prepared to pay to get your BTC back to the exchange to transact? (Or are you going to hold even if it crashes for good?). Have you seen the mempool btw?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:10:49
Good news, its already here!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:55:45
Entire crypto is experiencing massive demand, ETH processed &gt;1M daily tx recently. Usage != attack
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:46:52
You cannot have used Paycash because the service is suspended. I believe the only way to get GBP onto Kraken at present is via a currency exchange to EUR. It is a SEPA transfer but you will probably have to pay currency conversion costs via your bank. Dealing with GBP and USD in / out of Kraken is almost impossible at the mo without incurring (fairly high) transfer costs.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:06:29
So a key part of this amazing plan is that you need to convince all the exchanges to "pick a side" and get embroiled in the biggest mess ever? What makes you think Core could convince exchanges to be involved when they've failed so spectacularly to build any kind of working relationship with so many miners?
This plan is ludicrous.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:33:11
This is confusing to many. There is distinction, is there not, between a "simple" block size increase that can be done by changing a single parameter in the existing code (allowing up to 32MB), and Segwit, that implements a block size increase in a different way, by introducing more complex code and block structure? That is my understanding, please correct as necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:13:10
Lucky you :) GBP sucks
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:42:48
You're patronising and pompous and your opening sentences were indeed pretty hostile.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:20:52
Well put
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:14:59
So what motivates such immense opposition? Has Roger Ver pulled off some kind of epic coup?
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:09:44
It's interesting you're so keen to avoid a hard fork. Do you envisage never having to go through one? If not, wouldn't it be easier to attempt it now, before Bitcoin grows even further?
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:52:55
It's a shame you chose to be patronising and miss the point of my question. First, note the quotes around "simple". Second I said nothing about a hard fork. In terms of the code, is the block size configured using a parameter in the existing code? This is different to Segwit right, which as you say uses a more creative approach.
And if Segwit is so easy, why is it still sitting on the shelf?
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:59:50
I see, thanks. Given the current impasse I don't have much confidence BTC folks ability to coordinate a strategy involving exchanges - even Huobi and OKC? But I guess there is incentive.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:22:15
You talk about this like it would just happen in one nice easy move. Some miners are currently unhappy and you have faith that forcing this complicated and unprecedented move upon them is somehow going to help Bitcoin "in the long run"? (Even if it worked). I think it sounds complicated, highly unpredictable, will be drawn out and is bordering on insane. Why not simply start by gathering the community and rebuilding things a bit?
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:27:54
Well he seems to be a unique individual. But seriously, given their long influence, expertise and quality product, why can't core push things forward? Their business relationships must be appalling...
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:22:30
Fair enough.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:47:49
You seem to be a fairly moderate voice in the middle of what seems to me to be a total mess of Bitcoin. I'm not expert on BU, and perhaps it is not the right solution, but as far as I can see a blocksize increase is not just necessary - it was part of the original design and the 1MB only exists as a relic from the early days when people used modems (if you take my meaning). So Q1) why is a block size increase simply not implemented immediately, and Segwit etc can follow in an orderly manner? Doing so would show that the BTC community can at least make some kind of progress (and I suggest the price would explode as a side benefit).
Secondly, Q2) Why hasn't Segwit activated? By all accounts it is a technically clever and robust solution, backed by a large team of experts. Not only is it not implemented, according to the voting rules (as I understand them) it has a pretty pathetic level of support which has not grown, and is in fact now exceeded by BU - who, if you read this thread for example, are depicted as some small band of lunatics. It doesn't make any sense. A great product will sell, even if its rough around the edges, but yet after months Segwit, is sitting on the shelf.
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:27:42
I don't really care which solution we have but why has SegWit not activated? All I hear from this forum is that the devs are better, they're well funded, there are more of them, they've been testing and bullet proofing the code for ages (years?), they fixed loads of bugs and Segwit is technically very smart (and I believe it is generally regarded as such, even by many in the BU camp), opening up new options.
And yet here we are. Segwit has been around for months and seems to have gained no more traction than it did in the first few weeks. If it is so great, and all of the above, what is the problem? Am I seriously supposed to believe it is being "blocked" by a small group of "BU supporters" who cannot even spot basic errors in their code? How can such a great solution be so easily held up? I mean Windows (95) was utter garbage in terms of securit and reliablity and was full of bugs but it still took computing by storm.
Core and Segwit have only one feable competitor, who, under the current rules is now "winning". How??
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:32:04
I agree. I know and work with intelligent technical people. Some of them have heard of it, no one has the slightest idea what it is, how to get it or what they could use it for. It s a pain to use and manage, and the average person is years (or even deceades) away from becoming a user.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:52:30
This sounds like a cool development but I'm still struggling to see the overall impact. Specifically, payment channels are fine, if you want two way trading (e.g. BTC / LTC exchange sounds very useful). However, regardless of currency, most transactions people do are not trades, e.g. I buy food, or gas, from the store once a week. In this case, both me, and the store want the transaction settled on the block chain immediately - there is no advantage to two way trading or keeping a channel open (if I understand correctly).
Is there decent reference for LN and its operation (like a web-based demonstration or something)?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:13:09
Thanks, will need to find some time to play with this
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:21:38
Ok thanks, I see what you're getting at. It sounds like it has interesting long term potential (that could be great, but lets see how it develops :). You have to admit it seems a bit weird though - a system predicated on the (merely circumstantial) existence of an underlying ledger system that is expensive. With competing block chains and ledgers that are essentially free, I'm not sure it will ever seem worth using. But time will tell of course :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:03:03
No, at present BTC is at capacity. If you need a fast and cheap transaction at present you'll need to do it on the other chain or use a different coin. Scaling is planned but there doesn't seem to be any hard info on when that will have a measurable impact.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:00:28
But the worst thing is that this sub in particular is encouraging people to put their hard earned money into a monetary system which is currently unusable. Think of how many noobs are crpping themselves right now and trying to send money. I've heard of people paying nearly $50 in fees! It's a broken system derailed by idiots.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:37:04
So why bother?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:17:31
Seriously this is painful to hear. I hope for your sake things work out but honestly you are playing with fire. Many people in crypto-currency were in from earlier times and have some sense of the dynamics, politics and so on - but more importantly the cost basis of their holdings is tiny compared to the current market price, so even in the event of a massive crash they can ride it out, or cash out at a profit. Buying at peak prices today is about the highest risk investment you can find, and you are not going to find much useful technical, political or investment advice on this sub... Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:03:34
No it isn't. I've made huge profits this year, almost none of it from BTC. And if I was out to make profits I wouldn't waste my time with 10 to 20% on BTC. However, that is not my objective, which is to support the future of money. I want a coin that works. BTC is like opening a bank acount that is only accessible by Western Union - same fees, same speed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:59:22
Sure, sorry for the frustration, but some of the language around here is ridiculous. Many people suggest that anything other than buying Bitcoin is an attack. I suggest drawing information from other sources.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:56:39
What are your objectives? If you simply want return on investment, BCH went up over 4x in past two weeks or so. To get the same ROI from BTC, the price would have to hit $25k, which is obviously isn't happening any time soon. If you just want to own BTC, then buy any time.You might also want to consider actual usability and that to "spend" BTC at the moment you have to pay more than Western Union if it works at all...
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:09:44
BTC offers neither
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:50:32
Depends what you mean. Unlikely that BCH will take the BTC ticker. Will it become the dominant used coin? AFAIK its 24 hour price volume has already exceed BTC. On chain scaling will provide more capacity for the time being which will keep fees low and confirmation times fast, I suspect adoption will be widespread. BTC may continue to rise in price but it seems fairly irrelevant as digital cash at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:12:05
wtf are you talking about? An attack? It is just market trading. If you're referring to the technology, why don't you ask the developers why there is a 120,000 tx backlog at the moment and why BTC is useless as a currency that is was supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:30:40
Well right now is a very volatile time so be careful, and you won't be able to move BTC for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:56:37
Sadly I left BTC long ago, writing was on the wall even then. The bottom line now is, whether to invest in a system that is no better than western union that might improve based upon little more than rumors? No thanks. (100 bucks says fees, tx backlog, usability etc. are no better in 12 months).
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:29
A lot of people want i) on-chain scaling and ii) a coin that works for payments without having to negotiate fee calculations, massive delays etc. BTC does not provide either of those things right now. Now that the S2X debacle has finally be closed, BCH is the original Bitcoin that people wanted to see and so money is moving into it. The market is speaking. Nice way to make 4x your money in a couple of weeks...
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:13:32
Earliest adopters mined it for fun (and it was basically free), plus back then BTC worked like it was supposed to and there was no competition. Even later on that was the case.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:56:08
Regard investment in crypto-currency like any other (extremely) high risk investment. The market is highly speculative (to the point of absurdity) and do not underestimate the risk of a severe and sustained market crash. Sure, times are good and everyone will tell you how great it is, but so will any stock broker when markets are high, until they lose their job. Learning is a good plan but aiming to "convince your wife to spend some of your money" is probably not a good place to start... 
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:22:02
You sound like a mad person.
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:36:58
Some sort of agreement on Bitcoin will ultimately be good news for crypto and any legit alt coin I expect. I've just moved a fair chunk back to BTC but I don't see the ETH surge stopping for long. ETH will hit 500 long before BTC hits 6000. (I wish I had the balls to hold all my ETH :)
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:24:08
This post is absurd. You cannot possibly make a judgement based on "analysis" because the whole thing is completely unknown.


Where did you get these numbers from? BTC gains $1000 from what price? Zero? you're just babbling nonsense. If you're worried about profit, move to altcoins - ETH just did nearly 100% market shift in two days. Bitcoin ain't going anywhere for a long time. If you think the Ethereum hard fork was a mess and caused damage, just wait for this shit show, it's going to be a clusterf**k of epic proportion.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:40:44

Estimate the probability that the ETH ATH is the highest price it will ever reach. I think it is small.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:28:43
I was just going to write a similar response. Why do people insist on attempting to push ridiculous simplifications? (That in fact just serve to reinforce tribal mentality).
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:56:49


Sewit was activated weeks ago. Why is it not being used to demonstrate the potential improvements? Why are transactions not all now Segwit? What's the delay? So what if blocks are not full - surely there are some improvements anyway? Also, when will LN be implemented for LTC? What's the road map? For something so important, there seems to be little interest in it...
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:07:02
A few weeks is nothing in terms of widespread adoption - fair enough. It will take time. But in terms of demonstration of benefit - and at least some usage - I don't see any reason why it can't be showcased now. Far as I know there have been virtually zero Segwit transactions to date. If Apple roll out a new product, people line the streets to buy it before the shop has even opened. Doesn't look like that's the case here. Segwit has been lying around waiting for activation for nearly 12 months - you'd think people would be falling over themselves to demonstrate its value now that has been activated on something.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:38:46
I really don't think I am the one who is deluded. As I say, good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:42:52
Well I assume she doesn't read Reddit or it won't be much of a surprise will it....
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:22:37


In a multibillion dollar global market based on monetary trading and exchange, you think the risk of a forced and drastic reorgainisation of the system, which could involve loss of funds, and massive damage to its function and reputation, is well mitigated because most users "won't have their heads in the ground?". As in, they (millions of people around the world) all routinely come to obscure reddit forums to listen to cheerleading about poorly understood and contentious initiatives that remain shrouded in uncertainty?
Good luck with that...
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:59:28
I'm pleased to see some kind of progress but I've yet to see any empirical evidence that: 1) The "increased" blocksize with Segwit will have any meaningful impact on transaction speed and costs in the current situation, 2) Segwit will not result in some kind of complicated implementation that will limit (positive) impact on the average end-user experience , 3) LN will be useful on timescales relevant to the rise of alt coins.
For example, given Segwit activation on August 1st, what is the projected transaction fee and confirmation time by January 2018, and what is the anticipated state of the LN by then? What percentage of total transactions are expected to be off-chain by then? (Evidence and reason, rather than wild opinion, would be great).
