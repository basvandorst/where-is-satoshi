No way to really know at this point due to the pseudonymous nature of the blockchain.

It's great for investors to get the clarity about capital gains, but when using bitcoin as a currency I will report all my transactions next April as capital gains. This is unlike any other currency. If I invest in another currency (Euro) in a brokerage account then it is treated (correctly) as capital gains. But if I fly to Europe and exchange my USD for Euros and use it to pay for admission to a Zoo, I don't have to pay capital gains on that. Accounting for every cup of coffee, tank of gas, meal at a restaurant, etc... I buy with my bitcoin is not reasonable, and the pages of transaction history I supply the IRS this year will be cumbersome for the IRS to process. We want clarity. We want to pay our taxes.

I understand, but the problem is, when I give bitcoins to people to show how easy it is, I usually use blockchain.info because it has been perceived as safe and secure, and is the easiest for new people to use. How do I assure them their coins are still there, when that is literally the only way they have access to them? They don't believe me when I explain to them that blockchain.info is really just a fancy front-end and that their coins are still available.

Stop comparing Bitcoin to gold. There is no similarity. Here are a few reasons bitcoin is compared with gold.
1.) Scarcity. Bitcoin is truly limited to 21 million coins. Nothing can change that and still be called "Bitcoin". Gold, on the other hand, is nearly limitless in the asteroids surrounding our pale blue dot.
2.) Deflation. With gold, once it reaches a certain high point in price, it becomes impossible to use in every day life, say, to buy a candy bar from a vending machine or to use for a cheap cup of coffee in a diner (maybe not the 30 dollar coffee people buy in starbucks these days...) Bitcoin does not have this problem because being digital allows it to be divided into smaller and smaller pieces without losing its practicality. Unlike gold or modern paper currency, adding more liquidity into the system by further dividing the unit of currency has never been an option before. Instead, the supply of money was often manipulated like with Fort Knox and Gold or the Federal Reserve and Dollars.
3.) Nearly instantaneous transfer of ownership anywhere in the world. Gold cannot be traded as fast as bitcoin without a centralized third party controlling everything.
So far, I have yet to see one thing that Gold has to do with bitcoin. And that is not a bad thing. I have absolutely no problem with gold as a standard, since it was a much more austerious system than we have in place with today's government backed currencies, but Bitcoin is even better.

krugmanites, keynesians, big government supporters, etc... all want to see bitcoin fail, so they criticize it more heavily when it is "down". They know it takes a while for a new commodity/currency to be valued at proper prices. Bitcoin is a parabolic trend and its use multiplies exponentially, but markets are emotional.

They would have to spend more money than they do on defense SOLELY for the purpose of building mining hardware powerful enough to perform a 51% attack on bitcoin...
One of the things a 51% attacker can do is prevent any transactions or new blocks from anybody besides themselves from being accepted, effectively stopping all payments and shutting down the network.

2.) Has features that could NOT be easily added to the existing bitcoin protocol

I for one do not think there is a way for an altcoin to meet all three of those requirements and topple bitcoin. For instance, an inflationary algorithm might still be able to solve the byzantine general's problem, would be completely seperate and by its nature not be able to be grafted into the bitcoin protocol, but it would (fortunately, imho) have trouble becoming as popular.

Because faster confirmations lead to problems in the event of a fork. Can you imagine having fork after fork after fork? It gets pretty crazy.
This is already solved, it just doesn't get used very much because the need isn't there yet. bitcoinj has already implemented a mode setting that, when enabled, does not verify everything, it simply connects to a trusted node to watch the transactions.
You don't need more protection than that unless you are selling something worth more than 25 Bitcoins, since the attack requires the latest mined block to succeed. An attacker who has recently mined a block and is preparing to double-spend will use it on something worth more than the block reward he/she/they just mined.

What do you mean? Bitcoin is already regulated! 
6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
= 210,240
~= 210,000
Sum all the block reward sizes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
Multiply the two:
210,000 * 100 = 21 million. 
The reason governments regulate their currencies, is because there is no limit to how much they can print, and only a tiny minority of people have any say in the matter.
For bitcoin to change this fundamental protocol, a hard fork would have to be made and people would have the ability to vote with their wallets...literally!
If only we had learned this lesson before the internet, TOR or something like it would have been built into the http protocol. As long as we learn from this historic mistake and hurry up and get off our lazy asses and implement zerocoin into the underlying protocol of bitcoin itself, then all the government should be able to do is regulate businesses around bitcoin, they would not be able to fuck up bitcoin like they have the current banking, judiciary, legislative, executive, and monetary systems.

I flip flopped on bitcoin too. A lot of us scoffed at the idea of a "Digital" Currency. I didn't bother to read the whitepaper until January 2013. I read the whitepaper, and as soon as I finished, read it again. I was absolutely floored! "Wait a minute...this isn't a currency...this is a protocol, and not just that, it is a fully DECENTRALIZED protocol, which securely and accurately facilitates the transfer of property!" I immediately bought coins.

Nazi is literally a shortend form of the german word for "National Socialist" and started as a movement by a workers union.
Socialism and communism are alike in that both are systems of production for use based on public ownership of the means of production and centralized planning. Socialism grows directly out of crony capitalism; it is the first form of communism. Full-blown communism is a further development or "higher stage" of socialism.

Here's all you need to know about the code (in layman's terms):
6 block rewards per hour(one every 10 minutes). multiplied by 24 hours (one day). Multiplied by 365 (a year). Multiplied by 4 (the amount of years before the rewards halve) = 210240
Multiply 210240 by 100 (the added reward amounts [50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + 1.5625 + ... ]) = 21 million bitcoins.
The rest of the code sets up rules for a publicly shared ledger authenticated by the entire network and protected by ECDSA and SHA-256 encryption, which provides proof of which address coins are coming from, and which address they are going to. This is why bitcoin has come to be perceived as having value.

That's an unfalsifiable statement. I could just as easily say the same thing about any other currency. For example, "Until Dollars aren't judged based on their value tied to oil, they are a volatile investment".
People in America compare the price to dollars, people in Europe compare the bitcoin price to euros, and people in China compare the price to yuan. This is just an easy way for people to work out in their heads what a bitcoin is worth. As adoption increases, and less people feel any need to convert their bitcoin back into their local currency, this will change.

Answer 1A: Remember Target? Those kind of thefts cost everyone money, not just Target and Credit card processors. Those costs are passed on to you. 
Answer 1B: International. I can send money to anyone in the world in under 10 minutes. This amount of time is the same for people sending 0.0001 at a time, as it is for huge global corporations moving 100000.0001


Answer 2A: The blockchain is 100% transparent, as long as you know who owns the wallet address. People, or organizations and companies, can show the world (and auditors) what their cash on hand is, where the bitcoins are going, and where they are coming from. **In realtime.**
Answer 2B: It might not matter to you, but in some parts of the world it is a matter of life and death keeping your political affiliations and ideas private. Providing these oppressed people a safe-haven is worth it, whether or not it doesn't help or hurt you directly, the world is improved by privacy.


Answer 3A: These aren't "Given up" anymore with third party services like NeoBee and Coinbase, but even if they were, truly savvy customers do not need these protections. These protections are for the otherwise distracted or unscrupulous customers.
Answer 3B: On the flipside, why would savvy merchants give up benefits like non-reversable transactions, little to no transaction fees, proof of payment, and other perks not provided to merchants by mainstream payment options?

The problem is the economy that is driven by people who have not been taught how to manage money properly.. It is not "People live paycheck to paycheck because the economy is poor." but rather "The economy is poor because people live paycheck to paycheck." 
Throw in the folks trying to get rich quick taking loans out to buy copious amounts of bitcoins, and you can bet they will start trading out their bitcoins faster than they will take them in, regardless of it being "deflationary" money as is often claimed.

Ah yes, poor Morgan Robertson  To be fair, he at least tried to correct the mistake he caused without further creating a space-time paradox. You can even see his desperation in the title of his novel "futility". Those of us in the know wish it could have been avoided. Unfortunately, the guilt is eventually what caused him to claim his own life. He was found dead in his room at the Alamac Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. They assumed he was only 53 years of age, but he was actually much much older as you and I know. It is believed that he died of an overdose of paraldehyde, but toxicologists in this universe didn't have the knowledge to dig deeper to find the true cause. I was worried when it was revealed he died standing up, but luckily the public consciousness is quick to forget. At least some good came of it, he did succeed in preventing the Japanese from attacking San Francisco.

Makes sense... on paper, but you are forgetting the human factor. Humans are impulsive. We like to buy shit we don't need, even if it means we are missing out on having more money in the long term. 
I buy crap with bitcoin all the time. 3 days ago, I bought a 3DS XL Yoshi edition from Overstock.com with my bitcoin. Yeah, I could have spent less if I had waited, but I really want it now. I have no regrets, and I still have more bitcoin than I started with, and the thing cost me less than if I had saved my money in fiat instead of saving my money in bitcoin these last 18 months.
Again, a deflationary spiral is avoidable when everyone knows they are using a truly deflationary currency. Also, never underestimate the power of impulsive human behavior.
Bitcoin encourages people to save money, and unlike many people today, I don't think vilifying savings is a smart idea.

Sure, I mean, if a FIAT currency is deflating, it usually means way too many products are flooding the market and not being purchased. This makes sense for a currency that is SUPPOSED to be inflationary, if it deflates, it is unexpected and a sign of very bad things... Bitcoin is the opposite, it is SUPPOSED to be deflationary. Deflation of bitcoin represents growth. If Bitcoin becomes inflationary, that would be bad and unexpected and represent a slowdown in growth.

I think you are forgetting the fact that Bitcoins, unlike other currencies, can be divided into smaller and smaller units, and that these divisions are practically unlimited. The entire world population would be just fine dividing 1 bitcoin amongst themselves. In practicality, that means that the 1 trillion dollar platinum coin is already here, and it is the Bitcoin, and it is fungible. What makes Bitcoin better than the 1 Trillion dollar coin, is that, in the bitcoin market, there will never be something more valuable than the 21 Million Bitcoin in existence.

Volatility is historic, it is a sign of a healthy free market. A natural system always attempts to reach equilibrium.

Bitcoins do not need a "Silver" to their "Gold" since, unlike gold, Bitcoins are much more fungible. There is a reason there are 8 decimal points under a bitcoin.  
This brings us to your second question about prices. Bitcoins are worth what people are willing to pay for them. The thing is though, there are only 21 million bitcoins in existence, not all of them will be available until they have all been "mined", and hundreds of thousands have already been lost to carelessness or forgetfulness. There is a very limited supply, and the usefulness of bitcoins as a quick and easy way to transfer funds anonymously has great value to many people. The more people that find Bitcoins valuable as a means for storing or transferring funds, or the more people find them useful for making anonymous donations or purchases, the more scarce they become. Should bitcoins ever get to the point where 0.00000001 BTC is valued at a price equal to or more than a penny, then a single bitcoin would be valued at over $100,000 IMHO though, if it ever does get that high, we would no longer be comparing it to a dollar, and there would be plans underway to add more decimal points in order to better accommodate small purchases in the economy. 
Nobody knows if Bitcoins will succeed or fail, but if they fail, I find it very unlikely that it would be replaced by a different cryptocurrency, since most of them are simply cloning much of the code that makes up the Bitcoin protocol. If they succeed, they will be extremely valuable.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:53:49
Why do you say it is expensive? This mindset has to change. People need to get over the fact that 1 BTC is going to be worth way more than 1 Dollar, or 1 Euro, or whatever is the top-level denominator of your country's currency. There is nothing preventing you from paying 10 bucks for Bitcoins on an exchange, you are still getting bitcents, which are definitely not worthless.
I love bitcoin because I have been a huge proponent of ending the Federal Reserve here in the USA. There has been talk for decades about ending it, but little in the way of action. A good, decentralized crypto-currency will end the Fed much quicker than any of the rhetoric in congress.
BTC actually gives freedom to people where they might not had have freedom before. Hate that your tax dollars go to fund wars abroad? Can't tax bitcoin. Hate that your tax dollars go to abortion? Can't tax bitcoin. Want to buy or sell a 2 liter coke in NYC? BTC allows it. Want to sell CBDs to people suffering from diseases where the side effects of the medication they take outweigh the benefits? BTC allows it. You have the chance at true freedom and capitalism in BTC. Something that hasn't been available to us in the US since the Revolutionary War. 
Cryptography and P2P technology has arrived at the point where we can invent a truly open market where we no longer have to rely on oppressive governments or religions to tell us what is valuable and how valuable it is. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:32:47
Wait, and it could climb beyond $100 USD / BTC... Or it could drop to below $5 USD / BTC... Nobody has a chrystal ball to see the future. You can make educated estimates based on a few things like market interest, news articles, mainstream acception, etc... It is like gambling. Never invest more money than you are willing to lose. Great risk sometimes rarely means great rewards. BTC might be one of those rare things, like Microsoft stock in the early 80's. Then again, it might not.
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:08:39
I find it hard to use my bitcoins as currency since the value of BTC is so volatile right now. I would rather not spend any because the only way for me to get any is to trade on Mt.Gox or sell stuff on Bitmit, and unfortunately bitmit is hard to sell on.

According to Wikipedia, 5.3 billion troy ounces of gold have been mined in human history, with most of that production since the 1800's to present. 
Since there are only 21 million bitcoins possible, it stands to reason that, if successful, 1 BTC could possibly become worth more than 1 ounce of Gold, which is currently worth over 1600 USD.
Or everything could crash and exchanges could be outlawed and raided, or a better cryptocurrency could scoop up all of BTC users. Nobody knows. Don't gamble away anything that will jeopardize your life if you are wrong, but do invest a percentage of what you can. That's my advice.

But the market value would take time to change, it wouldn't happen instantly like the decimal shift would. Think about it, right now a bitcoin is at 230 dollars and you have 10.

With Dwolla you send it in through email to support Once I finished that I setup a transfer from my US Bank to Dwolla, then from Dwolla to MtGox. From there MtGox makes it easy to set a price-point and see if you can find a seller.
edit: you do need a client if you want to transfer your bitcoins from mtgox into your own wallet. For your PC I suggest you download the bitcoin client from sourceforge. I suggest the blockchain app for your android or ios smartphone.
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:36:44
I did it. No problems. MtGox is no more likely to breach my personal info than all the other dozens of companies that have it. Schools, banks, government, insurance, employers, etc... none of them are any more or any less likely to breach my personal info than MtGox. But do whatever you feel comfortable with, don't go by what strangers on the internet tell you.

Because the value of the currency goes up just by sitting there. Why would you risk losing bitcoins in a loan? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:39:35
I guess, but if a bank put out title loans, mortgages, or deed loans in bitcoins, and they were using other depositor's funds, to make the loans, I do not see that bank being very popular with bitcoin holders. I would be scared that my funds would be locked up in the bank... Bitcoin was designed to not need a bank, why would I use one?

The computer hardware industry operates just fine in a deflationary market. If everyone kept holding their money because they knew that they could buy a better computer cheaper, the hardware industry would never have made it. In reality, people spend money on things they need, regardless of whether the price will be lower or higher in the future. If you really need/want something, you usually get it regardless. Bitcoin growth and smart investments will lead to a functional productivity-driven deflation that is impossible to imagine in other currencies because they have not been truly limited in the way bitcoin is.

You're equating greed with Jealousy. They are not the same. Who cares if they own so many bitcoins when it is not impossible to add more spaces past the decimal point? Bitcoin is not communism, it is pure capitalism. Therefore, there will be no government or religion forcing redistribution of wealth. Yes, there will be huge differences in the amount of money held some, but it is not a big deal. If you don't like it, buy a bunch of bitcoins and give them away. No one would stop you from redistributing your own wealth, just as no one will force you to "give" it away. It is a libertarian utopia.

It would be pretty easy for a socialist or communist nation to create their own cryptocurrency, then decree one wallet per head of household, and then evenly distribute the coins that exist. They could even make sure everybody started out with the same amount of commucoins. Late adopters would receive coins equal to the current median household "savings", however, since keynesians despise "hoarders" that median will be very small anyway, due to the fact that if your wallet gets too big, the government can just redistribute it to everyone for "the greater good" with a few keystrokes on a keyboard. Heads of household get paid weekly based on their size of family, disabilities, etc... Have fun with your immense and oppressive government, worthless economy, and lazy workers though...

I think I am not being understood here. I'm not saying they make a centralized cryptocurrency. I am implying they would run a shadow operation where they start the ball rolling on developing many different cryptocurrencies at once to lure away miners. Once they flood the community with too many currencies and lure miners away from legitimate ones like bitcoin, it will cause the community to collapse on itself. The beauty of this, from their perspective, is that no one can tell if a cryptocurrency is started by a hacker or group of hackers, or if it is simply a honeypot to lure resources from the currencies they want to destroy.

Just think about it though, banning cryptocurrencies in laws makes them more well known and is counterproductive to the goal of destroying them. The governments of the world already know a better way to destroy a currency, flood the market with it. It would be measuably easier for them to make the leap to creating so many cryptocurrencies that no one cares about them anymore, as opposed to trying to generrate or purchase 51% of them. It is the perfect solution, no one expects it, people would shrug it off and blame the community itself for flooding the market with different currencies. The small amount of tax evasion, money laundering, etc... occurring as a result would be considered a worthwhile risk to take. They don't even have to take credit for the cryptocurrencies they create, just make it seem annonymous and post on a few forums and it takes over for them. Minimul work on their part to get the desired result of destroying cryptocurrencies for good.

You receive an upvote for bringing discussion and at least trying to lay everything out in a logical manner.
* What happened today, may bolster future confidence in the currency.  As bitcoin was skyrocketing yesterday, many of the opinion posts here were definitely turning sour. People I talked to not involved were more afraid of the skyrocketing increases than the decrease and corrections which occured today. I have heard many people comment on how well it has held up so far. Really, we are right back to where we were a day ago.
* The lack of infrastructure is a huge bottleneck, I give you that one. This is a free and open market. Manipulation will definitely occur and there is nothing that will be done to stop it. What we will not have, however, is government backed manipulation, which in my humble opinion has actually left us worse off than those trying to game the system illegitimately. I would rather not have any manipulation, but the world isn't perfect. Between the choice of having crony-capitalism due to the state sponsored "legitimate" manipulation and an anarcho-capitalist market where ALL manipulation is considered equal I would like to choose the latter. 
* The pseudonymous nature of bitcoin will finally return us to sound economic principals we seem to have cast aside in modern times. No longer will theft through taxation be tolerated simply because it is the will of the majority and the elite. They may yet try and stop it, but I do not think they can stop Bitcoin any more than they can stop TOR or P2P file sharing.
* It is true that bitcoins have no intrinsic value, in the numismatic sense, in other words, value in any realm outside of being used as a medium of exchange.
However, while some tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof.
While historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins lack 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.
Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand. They can try to use the threat of violence to prop up their dollar, but in the end they know that would fail. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:59:53
According to Wikipedia, 5.3 billion troy ounces of gold have been mined in human history, with most of that production since the 1800's to present.
Source(s): 
Since there are only 21 million bitcoins possible, it stands to reason that, if successful, 1 BTC could possibly become worth more than 1 ounce of Gold, which is currently worth over 1600 USD.
Or everything could crash and exchanges could be outlawed and raided, or a better cryptocurrency could scoop up all of BTC users. Nobody knows. Don't gamble away anything that will jeopardize your life if you are wrong, but do invest a percentage of what you can. If you do invest, hold for the long game. If BTC is not successful by 2018, it never will be. That's my advice.

The ones flooding the exchanges were not the "joe plumbers" or the "Sandra Flukes" of the world, they were speculative daytraders and rich-quick schemers. 
I give away bitcoins for free to my friends, family, and coworkers. I show them how to install a client, teach them sound security and backup practices, show them how easy it is to send coins to and fro. 
Sometimes, if one of them have something I want to buy, I buy it from them in bitcoin. These people have never touched an exchange, they probably never will. I can only imagine that I'm not the only one doing this, and that they aren't the only ones with no plans on trading on an exchange. Yet they are now a part of the economy, and who knows what they will be able to do with the knowledge I have given them. 
You shouldn't think of Bitcoin economics as a pie, if you take too big of a piece, there might not be enough to go around. Instead, think of a Bitcoin economy as you would a flame. When you share a flame with someone else, they benefit from it, and it grows brighter and brighter, and you have not lost everything in the process. Traditional currencies were not as "share-able" as bitcoins or a flame, because they could not be divided infinitely and shared.

Right, but back in 2011, some of the exchanges were compromised and private keys were stolen.

I think it is easy for this community to seem to have an almost cult-like following. For me, Bitcoin fits so many of the ideals I hold. It is stateless, its truly limited supply and deflationary nature flies in the face of Keynesian economics, it is open source, it is pseudonymous, it is free-market anarcho-capitalism at its best. I want it to succeed. That said, I think it is easy for onlookers to look in and see all the praise we give bitcoin, and assume that we are all 'drinking the kool-aid'. Too much good news makes people vry skeptical, which, to be honest, is not a bad way to be regarding risky ventures and new markets. I do think that the more people can see us actually discussing the true pros and cons of the system, as opposed to talking about skyrocketing gains, or giant bubbles, will allow o\more people to make sound economic decisions.

People buy what they need/want when they need/want it regardless. By your logic, nobody in a inflationary currency would ever attempt to save any, they would be able to buy more now with their money than if they waited. We haven't experienced a truly deflationary currency since the 1800s. Keynesians basically argue that if government prints money, that new money will then increase the production of goods more than if the money supply had been held constant.  But clearly this is illogical!  Producers inherently try to maximize output and price levels to return the greatest profit.  Pouring new money into an economy does not generate more demand for products than already exists within the public consciousness.  New money can only alter the structure of production, it can not magically create the available resources to expand production. People won't care that they are making 10 mBTC less than a week ago, because the 90 mBTC now have more purchasing power than the 100 mBTC they used to make.

It is easier for everyone running bitcoin clients and miners to update from a POW to a POS version of bitcoin, than for them to switch to PeerCoin and abandon the bitcoin protocol.

I can set my fees in Bitcoin-qt to 0.00010000, and most of the time this works just fine. The problem I've run into is that a wallet that combine lots of tiny previous transactions will contain references to all those tiny transactions. These transactions are from things like reddit tips and so on.  Now, even though I'm only trying to send 0.15 BTC to my bitcointip address, which is a “small” amount, the size of the transaction is very large as far as bandwidth is concerned. Bitcointip is how a large portion of new users are introduced to bitcoin, so this problem needs to be fixed sooner rather than later imho. It doesn't make sense that someone can move thousands of bitcoins for less than a penny, but cannot move 10 bitcents for less than 7 pennies...

I explained all the technological aspects to my grandma over the course of two days. Only after she grasped that it was real and asked how much they are worth did I tell her. That's the key.

It was now an established thought in her mind that all of the advantages to using it has got to be worth *something*.

Make sure you sleep as normal, eat normally, work normally. Do everything you have been doing. Once you have your bitcoins, keep them secured in an encrypted OFFLINE wallet (DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD!!!), or print out your wallet.
It is important to keep a sense of normalcy that is separate from your financial investments.  Things can go through crazy gains, and crazy losses, and you do not want it to have a significant impact on your psyche.  People who made that mistake in the 1920's, started jumping off buildings when it came crashing down. There's no need for that.

With 99.99999% of the mining power offline, blocks take days or weeks instead of minutes. Transactions cease.

In Keynesian economics, inflation is expected. It is a natural result of interest rates and cash reserves. If deflation happens in a Keynesian economy based on inflationary currency it is VERY bad news for that economy.
Bitcoin is not based in Keynesian economics. It has a truly limited supply. Market corrections directly affect the price, because there is no way to dump more cash into the market or to adjust interest rates. Because of this, Bitcoin is expected to be deflationary, and as adoption and growth increase, deflation is expected to occur. While this is the first extremely fungible deflationary currency, there have been deflationary markets operating within FIAT economies. For example, technology has traditionally been a deflationary market, and it has worked just fine.
Recap: Deflation and Inflation mean different things in different markets. You're comparing apples to oranges.

Deflation is a terrible thing...in FIAT currencies. This is because a FIAT currency is normally inflationary. Deflation in Keynesian based economies and inflationary currencies indicates that something is terribly wrong in the economy. This does not apply to bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to function as a deflationary currency. Thus, deflation in bitcoin represents adoption and growth.  Will there be swings in the market, that may even swing 25%-50% ? Of course there will. This is a truly free market with no central controls, so market manipulation can and does happen. The beauty though, is that it is ALLOWED to attempt to reach equilibrium without any third-party influence.

The OP's post is stating that we are at the cusp of a new bubble, which means we are at the bottom in his opinion, and it is about to climb up drastically.

I like the three-layered approach of hiding the encrypted truecrypt container in a high-quality .JPG
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:57:05


1.) There should be no online savings account. You store your own wallet locally on your computer. You should encrypt and backup this wallet, protect it like it is real money. For example, your hard drive dies, your money is gone. There are online wallet stores, like brainwallet, but it is safer, and more liberating, to store on your own in my opinion. you are storing the private key to your address, the balance of which is stored in the P2P blockchain. There is no built in conversion from bitcoin to other currencies. If you want to convert your country's currency to bitcoin you must exchange it, there are many ways to exchange bitcoins.
2.) Everyone has access to the blockchain, which lists addresses and balance amounts. Tying those addresses down to a specific person is easy at first, but as money is moved from wallet to wallet it can be difficult to prove who owns what without plausible deniability.
3.) Any time you cash out your BTC at an exchange to a currency, you owe taxes base on the laws of your government. As with any currency, there are loopholes and ways to hide these earnings from the government. Granted it is often easier to get away with in Bitcoins than other currencies.
4.) Bitcoins are not backed by anything other than what people value them as. As other countries' currencies collapse, bitcoin, and other things deemed more stable by the public at large, become more valuable.
5.) 21 Million bitcoins divided by how ever many people are interested in holding them. The more interest, the more valuable. Bitcoins are more scarce than ounces of gold. The more popular Bitcoins become, the more rare, and by supply/demand economics, the more valuable they become. If (this is a big IF, but I am hopeful) it becomes a global currency with a large enough market base, large transactions will be handled in Bitcents, small transactions in milibitcents, small fortunes in Bitcoins.
I hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:42:18

The government won't force it, the miners and the clients will all agree to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol. Adding decimal spaces isn't really "adding" them, they are already there, we just have no use for them yet because they are so miniscule as to be irrelevant. 
For example, 1 USD is $1.000000... to infinity, we just happen to ignore anything under $0.01 (except for gas prices i.e. $3.389) and there is talk about removing pennies, and nickels, thereby ignoring anything under $0.1 USD. 
In bitcoins case, we simply stop ignoring the already existing decimals. Instead of gas being 0.00000438 XBT, it would then be listed as 0.0000043890000000 XBT. As more people are born, the cost of gas drops because gas is more prevalent than the XBT. We change from an economy of scarcity, to an economy of surplus.
edit: I feel compelled to point out, that before a truly digital currency, this concept was completely impossible to carry out in the real world, which is the only reason we haven't seen it played out in a large macroeconomy before. You can only divide a physical object to the point where anything less would be extremely impractical.

The bitcoin protocol was not built with "Distribution of wealth" in mind. Rather, it was envisioned as a way to distribute trust away from central authority to individuals, prevent quantitative easing, prevent reversable transactions, and prevent theft.
Voluntary distribution of wealth is great in Bitcoin. If you are looking for forced distribution, you need to look to the use of force provided by governments, because forced distribution of wealth is not a part of the protocol.

I sent this:
Hello [name],
I was wondering if [company] would look into accepting Bitcoin as an additional payment option? Looking at the list of payment methods you currently offer I, believe the accepting Bitcoins would bolster the revenue [company] could take in from Bitcoin.
 
Bitcoins have been steadily gaining popularity and value. There is a slight learning curve but when you grasp the inner working of Bitcoin you can see why it is gaining acceptance by merchants and users alike.
 
Bitcoin is an online, digital peer-2-peer crypto-currency. The fees are magnitudes smaller than credit/debit cards. Bitcoins are stored in a user (or merchant's) unique wallet and transactions are authenticated by the Bitcoin network. Once a bitcoin is spent, the sale is final, it cannot be returned to the same person unless the merchant returns it themselves.
 
There is a lot more information, which can be found here:  many processors are setup to easily allow bitcoin acceptance without you having to purchase any additional services or hardware, but I will leave it up to you to decide how, if, and when is best to accept Bitcoin. I, and other customers, would appreciate your consideration.
 
So far I get responses like: "I’m looking into this, and I’ll let you know what comes of it."

Ok... I get that, but say a user wants to trade FIAT cash for a cryptocurrency to make purchase online or in person with. What incentive does a user have to go with bitcoin if they can do the same thing with a hundred other currencies, and if these other currencies have more miners and less traffic and there is a closer 1 to 1 conversion rate with whatever FIAT currency they are trading for? The limits on the amount of bitcoins or lightcoins or terracoins are no longer relevant when there are trillions of coins accross hundreds of currencies. The exchange value between cryptocurrencies and FIAT money goes the other direction and the cryptocurrency is practically useless from an investment standpoint.

I sent this:
Hello [name],
I was wondering if [company] would look into accepting Bitcoin as an additional payment option? Looking at the list of payment methods you currently offer I, believe the accepting Bitcoins would bolster the revenue [company] could take in from Bitcoin.
Bitcoins have been steadily gaining popularity and value. There is a slight learning curve but when you grasp the inner working of Bitcoin you can see why it is gaining acceptance by merchants and users alike.
Bitcoin is an online, digital peer-2-peer crypto-currency. The fees are magnitudes smaller than credit/debit cards. 
Bitcoins are stored in a user (or merchant's) unique wallet and transactions are authenticated by the Bitcoin network. Once a bitcoin is spent, the sale is final, it cannot be returned to the same person unless the merchant returns it themselves.
There is a lot more information, which can be found here:  many processors are setup to easily allow bitcoin acceptance without you having to purchase any additional services or hardware, but I will leave it up to you to decide how, if, and when is best to accept Bitcoin. I, and other customers, would appreciate your consideration.
So far I get responses like: "I’m looking into this, and I’ll let you know what comes of it."

Download the coins into your bitcoin-qt wallet. Encrypt and backup the wallet.dat print out your private key. copy the wallet.dat on a few cds. store copies of it and the paper keys in separate safes, preferably in multiple geographic locations. Repeat every payday. Resist looking at your wallets for 2 years. If you see a vendor that accepts bitcoin, buy enough to use and use them. Don't dip into your savings. 2 years from now you might be able to buy yourself something nice.

I am open to altcoins, I just see them more as a testing/proving ground for updates that may be added to bitcoin down the line, or as case studies in what to do or what not to do in the event of an attack (i.e. feathercoin).
If a truly different protocol arises that is not simply based on Bitcoin, and it is somehow more secure/better it MIGHT have potential, but I don't see much of the current clones lasting very long.
Basically, Bitcoin seems to be as robust, if not more, than the standards of the IEEE 802.3 (ethernet) protocol. And we have used that same protocol in communications for almost 35 years with no catastrophic failure. The altcoins are simply variations, just as Token Ring(disbanded) and WLAN(active) are variations of IEEE 802.

Note: While the last "balance" is the accurate number of bitcoins available to this address, it is likely not the balance available to this person. Every time a transaction is sent, some bitcoins are usually sent back to yourself at a new address (not included in the Bitcoin UI), which makes the balance of a single address misleading.

That's not the problem, [you can set transaction fees in Bitcoin-qt]( The problem is that now that bitcents are worth more, you tend to have multiple small transactions you receive from people in bitcents or less. This increases the size of the transaction. Apparently when you hit a certain arbitrary size limit in a transaction, the bitcoin-qt client automatically hard-codes a 0.0005 milibitcent fee. This used to not be a problem since the value of a millibitcent was fractions of a penny, but now that they are worth more we should have the ability to change the fee.

I know right? They see all the failures of today, but they don't make the connection between their failed ideology and the failures of Keynesian economics. They think the problem is deregulation. They see bitcoin as a way to pay for drugs, avoid their tax dollars from going to fund wars, and help fund things they like such as wikileaks, but at the same time they want people to pay for failed social programs and wealth redistribution. I'm fine with them jumping on the BTC bandwagon, but I don't understand why they want to change it so much.

I am waiting for a truly alternative currency, not simply a tweak. In my opinion, there is no real alternative to the Bitcoin protocol.  
That is not to say that I think the current deluge of bitcoin based alt-currencies have no value, I think that the small tweaks of the other alt currencies have made are useful to test game theory and test possible new upgrades we might want to add to the existing bitcoin network, but they are in no way immune to any unforeseen problems to the underlying protocol of bitcoin, nor are their so-called "solutions" all that difficult to add the current bitcoin protocol.

The "Value" of a bitcoin dropping like that would cause mass media hysteria.

Because, unlike gold, bitcoin is easily more fungible, and does not require a central banking agency. If bitcoins had the tendency to be stored in one exchange or one organization or bank, then yes, this could be possible. But it isn't and it won't because it is extremely easy to send and receive coins without a third party. Try weighing pieces of gold, or using them in transactions overseas and you quickly see the advantages bitcoin has over gold.

This is definitely a non-issue, and frankly I don't think anyone should care. Consenting adults voluntarily offering their goods and services, illicit or not, have just as much a right to benefit from being early adopters of a paradigm shift technology as any other individual out there. 
Besides, the amount of profit granted to a minority of "illicit actors" in the Bitcoin market is infinitely miniscule compared to the amount of profit made by "illicit actors" in the gold, silver, USD, etc... markets.
You can "feel" bad all you want about "illicit actors" profiting more than you. You can "feel unequal" or greedy for not catching on to the technology sooner than these enterprising "illicit actors", but it doesn't mean people should feel bad about using it simply because the "bad guys" may have profited too.

As the other commenters have pointed out on that link, I see myself using bitcoin more and more next year, so why would I ever need to offload into other non-virtual currencies? As long as I can use bitcoin to buy things, and as long as I can get the same amount of stuff or more for my time than I can in other currencies just as I have in 2013, why should I worry how much a bitcoin is going for on various exchanges?

I like to buy things with bitcoins. What I do, is figure out how much something I want to buy costs in bitcoin, then I add 10%. That's how many bitcoins I purchase. After I make my purchase, I store the remainder in a savings wallet. I don't worry about money I "could" have had if I didn't buy the thing I wanted/needed.

Technology manufacturers operate in a deflationary market, it works just fine for them. Also, places that accept bitcoin do not appear to be struggling. Most countries in the world follow the keynesian economic model. Bitcoin operates in an austrian economic model. Both have experts who are for and against one or the other, and have theorized why one works and the other doesn't. I would point to the current global economic crisis. How has keynesian economics worked so far? IMHO not very well.

Same risks in all other markets, minus the added risk of state sponsored manipulation in other markets.


see above


Bitcoin ATMs should eventually solve this problem.


Free market will weed those places out. Same thing happens in regulated markets. There are always crooks and loopholes for them.


Maybe if you keep your bitcoins in a bank or an online wallet... Offline wallets would be immune to this. There is no easy way to steal bitcoins from a wallet, unless actual extortion and violence is used.


Same risks in many other currencies.
As a recap, most of the risks you just attributed to bitcoin, are no worse than any other currency or commodity, with few exceptions.

I use a photo-ID and electric bill verified dwolla account to transfer from my US bank account to my ID and Bill Verified MtGox account. After about 2-3 days the transfers are verified and I can use the money stored in MtGox to buy bitcoins. After that they go from my wallet to someone else's when I use them to buy stuff... Or they go into someone else's wallet on a TOR proxy that may or may not be owned by myself... ;-)

the wallet.dat is just a private key. It doesn't actually hold your bitcoins. The blockchain is what shows how much your wallet.dat is worth. That's why you can print it out and still put money into it.

Cash out? Why? Bitcoin has all the signs of being on the verge of a huge leap in adoption. Take the ATMs for example, which are really nothing more than mini-exchanges. Should a debit card type system that ties into the blockchain without exposing your wallet.dat come into play it will grow even faster. Bitcoin is the P2P PayPal. Once you can use it everywhere, it will be foolish to convert back to FIAT currencies.

So basically at some point it will be more profitable to facilitate these transactions than it will to receive the last fraction of a bitcoin? I suppose if enough people are using bitcoin there would be a way to profit by facilitating the transaction. I do hope it lasts that long and becomes that popular. Would be great if a few countries decided it would be OK to use it as a national currency, even though they would have no hope of controlling it.

Let me flip your argument to maybe help show you how absurd it sounds. It seems as if you believe, that with deflation, nobody will buy anything because it will just be cheaper two weeks from now. 
If that were true, than this would have to be true: In an inflationary economy, people spend their money as soon as they get it because if they don't, things will become more expensive if they save their money.
Your argument is faulty. 
Also, Electronics like computers and smartphones are already deflationary, that hasn't prevented people from buying them even though it will be cheaper if they wait a while.
@_date: 2013-03-17 21:19:55
I'm holding on for the long haul, so those suckers are transferred to my wallet as soon as I have them. If things look really bad, I'm going to wait for the crash to slow and then buy more. I'm in until I see a slowdown of ATM adoption and a slowdown of vendor acceptance in addition to a market drop. Right now, BitCoin ATMs and vendors accepting BTC are increasing, so a crash at this time only means I need to buy while they are low. If the currency is not taking off and we are still in this position by 2016, I'm going to weigh my risk/reward options at that time. I would not speculate on any commodity, much less one so new as bitcoin, but if that is your thing, good luck to you...

In Keynesian economics, inflation is expected. It is a natural result of interest rates and cash reserves. If deflation happens in a Keynesian economy based on inflationary currency it is VERY bad news for that economy.
Bitcoin is not based in Keynesian economics. It has a truly limited supply. Market corrections directly affect the price, because there is no way to dump more cash into the market or to adjust interest rates. Because of this, Bitcoin is expected to be deflationary, and as adoption and growth increase, deflation is expected to occur.  While this is the first extremely fungible deflationary currency, there have been deflationary markets operating within FIAT economies. For example, technology has traditionally been a deflationary market, and it has worked just fine.
Recap: Deflation and Inflation mean different things in different markets. You're comparing apples to oranges.

They can't tax if you keep it in bitcoin and don't convert to their silly monopoly money. In your car example, all they could tax would be the estimated market value, probably based on KBB. They would also be able to get tax revenue from merchants. Sales tax would probably be the only way for them to operate, since most people would gladly work for minimum wage as long as they were also compensated in bitcoins. 50 years from now the keynesians will destroy themselves anyway.

Be careful about those backups. If you store your password in a password manager of some kind, and change the password on one of your wallets, make sure you keep a backup of the old password too. I had a friend who overwrote a wallet.dat a couple years ago that he thought had the old password on it, when in reality he had overwrote the one with the new password. Since he changed the password in his password manager, he had no way of accessing the new wallet.dat since it had been overwritten by the old one, and no way of accessing the old password for the old wallet.dat when he realized his mistake months later. He has bitcoins in there protected by a randomly generated 32 character string he has no way of cracking. The lucky bastard didn't lose his largest stash though.
Always test your backups frequently.

I think the problem here is you are looking at Bitcoin as a debt-based currency. Bitcoin operates under the premise that all currencies are in actuality already "debt", since all a currency truly boils down to is a promise of sending or receiving goods or services in the future. There is no reason to create more debt on top of the fundamental debt a truly limited currency represents. I find it extremely unlikely that people will "lend" bitcoin in the same manner that FIAT is loaned. If any lending does take off the ground, it will likely be P2P, rates will likely be set in the algorithm, and somehow overcome the problem of how to handle defaults. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:59:18
Because they want to encourage loans and credit. They feel that if the economy is slowing down, creating more credit and debt is a trick they can use to fool the people into thinking the economy is better than it actually is. That way, when the economy actually does get better, they feel like they can slow down the boom to be a more steady increase in an attempt to control and stabilize things artificially. If they would just let the market work, the downswings and upswings would be more noticeable, but would not last near as long as they do now. Also, by doing this, they can claim that their political party "saved" the economy. Doesn't matter which one, both parties do this.
@_date: 2013-03-23 03:36:59
If governments can hack Bitcoin, it means that rogue governments such as China can hack our large central banks' ledgers, since similar encryption techniques are used. The kind of technology it would take to crack the kind of cryptography we are talking about here would require more energy and mass than exists in the universe. What is a problem, are large exchanges like MtGox and Coinblock. If they are lax in their security, the wallets in their possession are at risk. But individual's who keep BTC in their own wallets would not be affected. The price might fluctuate, but in the end it would correct itself.

Market manipulation can and does happen. But what do oyu think Bitcoin is worth? Do you think it truly is the future of currency and economics? If so, you understand anything under 1,000 USD per BTC is cheaper than dirt. If not, then sure, keep trying to game the system at sub 100 USD levels. Volatility is normal for any new commodity or currency. Just buy and hold. Buy and hold. Or don't. It's your money after all.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:27:04








1.) You can work for bitcoins, sell things for bitcoins, provide a service for bitcoins, or convert your currency to bitcoins at one of the ever growing amount of exchanges. It works because of its market cap and the difficulty in which to mine.
2.) CPU mining is inefficient and a net loss. GPU mining is decent. The better your graphics card, the better your ROI.  ASICS will theoretically make GPU mining less and less profitable, if they ever ship out.
3.) Risks: Too many speculators who do not understand the technology and are only here because of the high gains see a sign of slowdown and panic sell. Not enough merchants accept bitcoin. Government intervention. 
4.) I got myself a verified Dwolla account, send money from dwolla to CampBX and exchange my USD for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:32:39
Even so, the risk of never being able to get lent coins back I think will prevent fractional reserve style banking as far as bitcoin is concerned. Is debtor's prison still a thing? That would be the only way I could see to have any hope of being a deterrent, and not a very efficient one at that. How could we stand to place people in jail for having their loaned coins stolen? It would have to be a currency backed by bitcoin, not a bitcoin itself, and then that currency would have to be accepted by holders of bitcoin, which I do not see happening...
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:00:21
They still think bitcoin is farmville dollars. They don't realize there is a finite amount, and even if they know bitcoins are limited, they claim since anyone can make another competing digital currency, that it is somehow the same. Sure, anyone can make an alt currency that does the same thing as bitcoin... but they are not as secure (hashrate), there is not as much faith in them, and acceptance is orders of a magnitude less as there is in the bitcoin economy. 
edit: Also, anyone can (and often do) make a competing paper money currency, so I'm not sure why they ignore this fact.
