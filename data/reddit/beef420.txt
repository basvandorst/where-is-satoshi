Thought I would mention that I accept Bitcoin,  Litecoin, Ethereum, and pretty much any altcoin listed on Binance (as well as traditional payment methods)! Just send me a message on Etsy and we can work it out :)
Keys are created securely offline and are covered by a holographic scratch off sticker. I will be releasing a DIY version soon as well!
Please let me know what you guys think!

I appreciate you keeping newbies safe by spreading knowledge about the importance of keeping private keys safe. That’s awesome!
That being said, I don’t appreciate you insinuating that I’m going to steal funds :( I’m just an honest guy/graphic designer who thought his idea was cool.
Maybe I’ll just stick to selling blank wallets, not pre-loaded, but I feel like that degrades the user experience and the whole idea in general.

Provide the coins as a service. Customers are purchasing the paper wallet itself - the coins are provided as a service free of charge. One of the important things about being a money transmitter is that you charge some sort of fee for the transaction.

I suppose I meant in the thread in general, assuming I’m scamming right off the bat like that
I actually do have one of those blank coins! I totally wasn’t aware that they were once sold pre-loaded. I suppose I would have been what, 13 years old at the time? Thanks for the info.
Also, being a money transmitter isn’t illegal. Otherwise there wouldn’t be an MTL. Getting that is annoying and costly, of course. But there are some gray areas and ways around that as well. The laws about it are pretty old, if I’m not mistaken.

SEC? Did you see the news today?

Dang, lots of hate going on! Could you explain to me how this is illegal in the US? I’m legitimately intrigued.
As for a guarantee that I won’t keep the private keys, over $1500 in revenue and over 100 wallets shipped during my time on Etsy can attest to that. I wish to build a legitimate business here and the trust that’s associated with that. All of the private keys are generated offline. I guess you can take me at my word or not. Had a 5 star rating on 311 transactions over 6 years on Etsy.
