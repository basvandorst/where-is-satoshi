Simple works for me. It's an online only bank but I have mine linked.

Ease of access trick requires local access to the machine and booting to the repair environment. Try again.

Hindsight is 20/20. I personally will never invest in bitcoin because the stress isn't worth it. I play with some of the fiat currencies because they're fascinating but never put actual money into it.

Oh give me a break. There have been vulnerabilities and other things for every single operating system and there always will be.
Windows just has more exposure due to market share and enterprises just doing it wrong (Eternal Blue relied on open RDP) and Linux had it's fair share with Shellshock and associated exploits.
Point is, every OS is vulnerable in some way. Want your coins to be safe? Guard it like cash and keep a hardware wallet. Properly securing your system as much as possible goes a long way.

It doesn't mean Windows is less secure.
Anyway, no sense arguing. Use whatever OS suits your fancy.

More than you realize is powered by Microsoft tech.
If you want to talk kernel architecture, see how easy it is to bypass SELinux (spoiler: most people turn it off instead of understanding it). It's extremely easy to set up a *nix based server and screw it up. The wonderful world of SUID is dangerous to those who use it incorrectly.
Why, you ask? Say someone gets in by exploiting a web application. They're jailed, right? In a secure environment sure they are. Now, the admin thought it was a fantastic idea to set the SUID on vim so he didn't have to sudo first. Guess what? That's the easiest form of privilege escalation because vim runs as root without a single peep from the system. As root you can cause disastrous results in a single command.
Windows is more difficult. Before UAC it was laughably easy to get SYSTEM and therefore full control. Now, UAC blocks many attempts to gain access without bypassing it first (which is an area of penetration testing I'm not as familiar with). The user would have to disable UAC and click past the "this is a very bad idea" options to remove this protection. In *nix, a simple command exposes the entire system. 
I've done plenty of pentesting on both systems and Windows is more challenging to break into even when set up by a novice user.

Yes, the wallet's stored in the blockchain as well so that's where the seed words come in handy. Using those you can recover a wallet using either one of the online wallets or an offline one you download. I don't really know enough to explain specifics but the seed words are the "keys" to the kingdom so to speak.
The ledger just makes it easier than an offline wallet (which requires syncing the massive blockchains) and more secure than an online one where your money could go "poof" if the service goes under.

Yes, good luck getting verified anytime soon though. It keeps failing for me even though coinbase took the same information.

First off, insulting my intelligence doesn't make a good argument. As someone in the profession of protecting users from themselves (IT), the whole "Microsoft versus Linux versus Mac OS" is flawed in its own ways and it's wrong to discourage the use of one or the other based on your own experience.
All three have their merits, security wise and usability wise. The vast majority of the market share is Windows. People getting into crypto will use it, period. You can say "use Linux" until the end of time but people use what's most familiar.
Windows has made security easy for the user. Install the OS, install a ad blocker, don't visit shady stuff, and you're fine. Those who enjoy putting together their own OS the way they like and who aren't intimidated by a command prompt enjoy Linux and its huge number of options.
You can be just as insecure in Linux. Leave SSH open so you can access your PC and you'll get pwned without a secure password or using key authentication which the average user doesn't know how to do. Fail to update and you'll get pwned by public exploits just like Windows.
All I'm saying is that the age old battle is dead and all three have a place.

The recovery words are the "key" that decrypts the wallet that's stored on the USB. It never talks to an outside source. It's very much like the recovery token on most 2FA implementations.

What's in the case?

Ride the waves and make thousands if you have at least one BTC worth invested. If you hit the market at the right times you can easily double it.
At the same time, you can also lose it all in one trade, so there's that.

They don't, though. You need to borrow to get a credit file. If you ever want a mortgage or a car lease you need credit to do so.


Credit cards help against fraud because of one very good reason: it's not _your_ money that gets siphoned away if it gets stolen. If your debit card gets cloned and someone walks away with the contents of your bank account, you're screwed out of that money for weeks while the bank investigates and eventually returns your money. Meanwhile, bills don't pay themselves. Credit card companies will simply lock down the card and eventually reverse the transaction without you needing to do anything. Some banks will issue provisional lines of credit in the case of debit card theft, but not all do.

Older phones were throttled so they consume less power and thus extend battery life.
People got their panties in a twist over it. It's the same people who probably still use Windows XP and moaned at Microsoft when support was discontinued.
