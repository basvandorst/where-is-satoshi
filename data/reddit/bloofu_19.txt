Yeah sockpuppets at work here. Just goes to show what a few million bucks can buy you.
I am surprised you havent been downvoted more - maybe he doesnt pay as many shills to downvote comments - just pays to keep them in the negative?

Unfortunately for the Bcash crowd, this does not seem to be helping BCH market price at all... it's been bleeding all day.

Actually, if you look closely you will see his influence on this sub as well.
Look at the number of highly upvoted comments in this very thread saying "Report them for what?" as if this is totally appropriate posting coming from the Bitcoin twitter.
See, the thing is, Roger can pay for sockpuppets, he has a certain power in the centralized nature of his organization. He can pay for the bitcoin twitter account, he can spend money on his website, and he can go on CNBC and talk up his agenda.
Noone really 'holds the torch' for BTC - no one is responsible for it - it just has to stand on its own merits, and the belief people have that hold it.

Who the fuck would walk around with $2,500 of gold in their wallet?
What vendor would take little pieces of gold to put in their cash register? Sure, they should accept it, but does every retail vendor keep a gold test kit in their store?
This is ludicrous. And his enthusiasm about it is highly comedic.

Really should not have a huge impact. It was not hard to trade bch for bitcoin in the past, some exchanges already have this pairing.
I wouldnt be surprised to see another attack from massive BCH whales around that time, however.

You think it would be hard to cash out 600k worth of bitcoin? This market sees billions fly around a day.
Depending where this was stored, you would have to take out your maximum per day on most exchanges, a max which ranges from 10k-50k. So, you're looking at between 60 and 12 days to take this out.
As far as what "flags" it would set off... pay your fucking taxes. 
Do you think any bank is going to be "upset" to see more than half a million dollars being deposited into an account? It's not like bitcoin is taboo, or unknown about by financial institutions at this point.

Jesus christ, you're right.
We should have banned cameras and the internet, before it was too late to allow this epidemic to continue.
The world is fucked - we should have all continued to live like Luddites.

Let's be serious here. Transaction fees have never been so high as to cost $250.
Some people may have paid up to $40 for a transaction, but it was never necessary to pay that much, unless you needed it done quickly.
At the peak of the issues we had with slow and expensive transactions, I was still able to send a tx for about $27 and it took about 35 minutes.
Earlier today, I was able to send another for about $12, and it took less than 20 minutes.
I think we all can agree that tx fees and time are a problem, but you're just spreading FUD and completely full of shit suggesting anyone ever has to pay $250 to tx. If you did, you are very stupid and it was very unnecessary.

Are you saying it is easier to track a suitcase full of cash than it is to open a public blockchain and investigate the wallet a transaction was sent to?
Bitcoin is transparent, and not truly anonymous.

I sent a bunch of transactions on christmas day and spend about $12 per tx, each took 15-30 minutes.
Unless you were trying to get the xmas gift to your friend/family member in seconds, I don't understand why you opted to spend $42 on the confirmations.
Are you unfamiliar with bitcoin? I would recommend some basic reading to understand how the technology works.

Explain to me how the state would "seize" Monero..
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:52:02
Just like any time you spend USD or any other fiat currency.
We should all live with our heads hung in shame. 24/7.

Adoption is estimated at about 1-2% currently.
Most people still do not even know how to buy bitcoin.

Considering exchanges profit from fees, not from holdings, I'm not sure why they would be concerned with the market dipping.
Bittrex has been making millions every day for years skimming trade fees, with their only real cost being employee payroll and server/bandwidth costs. It is doubtful they have any financial issues.
