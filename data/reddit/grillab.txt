thanks I'm using bigCommerce.. the only one I know of is bips.me. I tried it and wasn't happy with the result. Here is my write up

Good idea though it it would take some extra work updating orders when confirmed etc. And it would hard to know which customer paid if all the payments are going to the same address

thanks yeah I've been looking into the Trezor... looks like it's not available until March?

ah cool thanks for the reply. I think it's def worth experimenting with. Thanks for the input!

Thanks for the detailed answer! Sounds a little over my head for sure. I might look into a Trezor wallet

Sorry for the delayed reply. Will you took great care of me. There was an issue where my deposit didn't post until the next day after they had run out of coins. Will made it right even though it was the banks fault

I placed an order online 1130 pst and deposited right after ( before they posted the warning of delay on the site). Then they listed on their site that they were behind. After 6 hours I was a bit nervous since that was the first time I used the site... I emailed Will and after a few hours he got back to me despite his being slammed... and sent me my BTC shortly after that... and at the price BTC was at when I made my deposit earlier that day
I'll gladly recommend cahintocoins and do business again!
