Didn't intend for it to happen, but investing in May and doing some smart trend trading will do that. 
I'm young, so it doesn't matter.

To have that kind of bitcoin back then and the drive to do this could of meant he had a nice stash when he did it to the point where 8 bitcoin wouldn't hurt him.

Used to play on just dice alot. Now they have their own PoS currency called clam which isn't the worst coin out there actually. 
This legend of the community, Likashing(the name he went by), would martingale whole BTC on a 50/50 dice roll. Sometimes doing up to 200+ BTC in a single roll. He had easily 4000+ BTC during the 2013 boom. When he'd win(he always did), hed make it rain in the chat. Giving out .1337/.2337 to the next ten people who commented with their address. 
He ended up giving me 3 whole BTC during his time, he eventually lost, but man. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be where I am now. Saved me during my depression and got me some food.
