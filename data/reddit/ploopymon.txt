So I got my Trezor, I'm gonna set it up tomorrow after work to get my coins out of Coinbase. When I transfer my coins from Coinbase to my Trezor will it be a segwit TX? (Sorry I'm still a greenie at this )
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:56:13
Nah the Trezor straight from the website is like 160 
Unless you get it from amazon (which is stupid btw)

Hehe, well what also freaked me out was the fact that equifax got hacked, can't trust anyone but yourself now (at least in the US)

How long have you had bitcoin? This drop is big but we were all expecting it buddy, I'm betting it goes to 8k which would be the correction we've all been waiting for
