LoL. Taobao doesn't get to its position by being stupid. They rely on customers and in a market of well over 1billion potential customers you don't want to help set up a new competitor to wipe you off the face of the map.

"Bittorrent's fate is in the hands of the MPAA/RIAA..." see that doesn't work either. Everyone that really gets Bitcoin already knows those 'regulators' work for and are paid for by the banking cartels.
 
The Bitcoin protocol sees corrupt regulators and routes around them. That's what it was designed to do.

Bitcoin has the potential to change the entire world for the better. Don't think the powers that be that have killed and clawed their way to the top will allow this to happen. World Bank, IMF, European Union, Fed Reserve Central/Big bank cartel etc. Satoshi Nakamoto has given us all the perfect tool but don't expect them to go quietly thats all I'm gonna say.  The best slaves to them are the ones that don't realize they are slaves.

A vote for bitcoin is also a vote against monopolistic corporations and multinationals and corrupt governments that are essentially partners in crime with the big banks.

Which came first chicken or the egg. Their suppliers still take dollars so you have to start somewhere to help build the bitcoin economy. The rate of growth is huge compared to where it was just a few months ago. If retailers/traders/suppliers agree to a price floor maybe ath minus approx 15% a rate they will not drop below to fill bitcoin orders that could add stability and not rely on exchanges alone to set price. soon I expect suppliers and employees will be paid in bitcoin allowing them to hold more and more.

I was referring to something some one said about wages. In a bitcoin economy you are compensated more fairly because you get to keep and control what you earn. I maybe didn't word that as well as I could have. I am not talking about early adopters or speculators but people who will earn bitcoin in a developed bitcoin economy.

This is bull shit. mtgox has been dieing for months and only greed made people continue to use them and prop them up. if mtgox scammy behavior can kill Bitcoin then Bitcoin isn't nearly as strong as people think it is. There is no too big to fail in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:32:35
Exactly. Once you have experienced 'the bitcoin' you can not un-experience it. Crypto currency is here to stay. It can only get better and stronger especially when you look at the alternative. Doesn't matter what any centralized club of crooks says about it. The cats out of the bag. The genie is out of the bottle. The horse has left the barn. 
The current system is built on centuries of oppression hate and blood. bitcoin is built on math and science. I choose math how about you. The other 6 billion will make this choice too everyone gets a say. That's the beauty of Bitcoin a truly democratic system who would have thought.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:16:45
I respectfully disagree. I think that once the yoke of the current Credit/Bank/debt_to_survive system is lifted from the back of the builders and service providers - combined with Bitcoins other attributes including its deflationary nature - people will stop being robbed of their labor and creativity and savings. Resulting in a better more evenly distributed compensation  for their hard work and ingenuity. 
 Easily secure-able in the sense they don't have to worry about stuffing money in a mattress and also in the sense they don't have to worry about being indirectly taxed by their government printing more money and devaluing their savings and transferring that wealth directly to the plutocracy in the middle of a recession.

As long as you keep paying that cabletv bill and signing up for phone contracts to get that over priced idevice or galaxy device for the 'discounted' rate you deserve to have no net neutrality. You are essentially paying for your own oppression. Do yourself a favor, cut the cord get a cheap android phone and pay that etf and ditch your contract plan and pricing. 
Otherwise please stop complaining because you are part of the problem. The FCC and government is bought and paid for with your money you pay every month to the telco/cableco cartel make them dumb pipes and only pay for the minimum and cut cable tv completely or keep bending over. 
If you already cut the cord then good for you because you are saving a ton of money not paying for the 'privilege' of being advertised to and also doing your part to starve the beast - now if only the sheep realized they could kill these scamers instantly if they all started making phone calls to terminate and disconnect.

You yourself said people were mostly 'dumb'. I submit to you that if people were better educated facebook wouldn't be worth anywhere near what wallstreet  have valued it at today.

If your only measure of success or 'great'-ness of a company is how much profit in dollars they make then that is your right. But not all people use your standard to measure success.

You are right some people probably will say that.

One key difference is with Bitcoin the rich can't just print more forever even if they have a short term mining advantage. The federal reserve chaired by the CEOs of banks print more dollars just see Quantitative Easing. This inflates the currency taking spending power from the bottom and feeding it back to the top. Not to mention other government sanctioned fiat manipulation schemes.
Bitcoin overtime however will even out as their adoption will greatly surpass the rate of creation (mining). That is why getting bitcoin and supporting small business that keep their bitcoin in the bitcoin ecosystem (pay wages and suppliers in bitcoin) will be key.

One of the things I love most about bitcoin is it lowers the barrier to entry considerably.

They had tons of paper work, limits on what you could and couldn't sell, credit checks and application fees just for the 'privilage' of being considered for approval, not to mention the hefty fees to process transactions. 
Bitcoin really is incredible. True monetary freedom for the world.

If i was in the UK i would buy into BTC and just trade in that eliminate the banks completely.... That is what Bitcoin is designed to do anyway.

EDIT to add: I don't live in my mothers basement as some one suggested not that there is anything close to being wrong with people who do... downvote all you like I'm not here to preach.

You're not a religious zealot and besides being a millionaire and being relatively new to bitcoin I know exactly how you feel. The current financial system is a scam -  banking, corrupt politics, greedy corporate cartels - on a huge scale. I hope people like you, that were able to benefit from being early adopters, invest in making bitcoin stronger and better for all. I have a feeling that a large percentage of the mainly self interested have already 'cashed' out by now.
Under all the speculative bullshit lies something that could transform the entire world for the better.

Bitcoin puts the power of finance in the hands of the people where it belongs. Banks HATE this. It's just getting started ladies and gents.

When I buy bit coin I just save it spend it or gift it. I never go back to fiat because I actually think bitcoin will save the world. No more VISA MasterCard monopolies and barrier to entry. No more capital controls designed to keep wage slaves unbanked. No more federal reserve printing press. No more spending huge sums to transfer your money. No more rediculous wait times. The list goes on and on. The speculators can enjoy ripping each other off during every market correction I just wait for price to stabilize and go about life as usual.

Well we need to build and support and trade with each other for bitcoin to sustain growth and become true winners... 
buy with fiat spend in bitcoin and replace spent coin by converting more fiat. This will protect investments and savings and we can benefit from bitcoin's true value. even if value drops I'm never going bitcoin to fiat ever! ill hit 0 first!
Viva la Bitcoin! Viva la digital Revolution!

what stops them running off with your bitcoin anyone know who runs this exchange?
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:52:56
The host like all fox talking heads was pretty dumb but the man makes a good point most people don't realize there is an added 3% tax imposed by visa mastercard etc and the banks every time you use your debit or credit card. 
Not to even mention the barrier to entry to just be able to accept payments using those services.

Uh doesn't this only work with their proprietary centralized servers? just asking... if so I wouldn't be able to recommend it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:35:38
Need some bitcoin literature in their native language so they can learn more about it. If there is a run on banks or the government tries to shutdown banks to control them they will have tools to protect themselves.

thanks :) will pay it forward

I love how not getting screwed by coinbase falls under special treatment now...
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:54:41
dude you should have gone a different route. Just like with spending cash research before you buy... look at gyft like some one suggested or anyone with accurate rates.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:07:43
yep I say the same about blockchain.info why anyone would rely on a ***closed source*** website so much for their decentralized currency is beyond me. 
And just count down the days before big sites run by unknown groups  walk off with alot of people's bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:05:54
This site is currently the 16th Ranked site in the World! A brilliant idea sells itself Bitcoin really is something special.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:01:14
yet not a single tip given in whole thread?? I call FAKE!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:11:46
exactly i dont know why they are so eager to give up control of bitcoin to blockchain.info ... These guys are out for themselves they are not open source.
