Eh, it has its moments.

If the US government we're to totally collapse I don't think that I'd be in a situation where digital currency would be of any help, the reasons being:
1.) Chances are I would not have access to internet or electricity needed for transactions.
2.) The world would have probably gone to such a level of shit that no one would see value in anything other than physical goods.

And back to 15...

There is a difference between banks needing to be bailed out because they gave out huge amounts of shitty loans and and investment firms that act as a pass through for futures trading that just take a portion off the top. 
For the most part these big firms are just taking a short position and a long position that nets them a small amount of money in between.

Feel free to see my other comment on this.

Non-currency store of value with a limited availability. Similarities end there though.

I'm not saying a crash is inevitable either, but the longer it becomes a tool used for speculative trading and isn't used for actually buying things the more it reminds me of Dutch tulips.

If people are not spending it then it is inherently not a currency.

I stand corrected. I should have inow someone would have started doing it.

I'm saying that when an asset is shorted it will start to take on certain behaviors, regardless of whether it is stock, commodity, currency, or crytpocurrency.
I'm not trying to be profound. You said BTC won't act like stocks. I'm saying that the more trading tools, such as shorting, that get introduced to BTC the more it will act like a stocks because of the affects those tools have on the market/underlying asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:55:30
The big guys on Wall Street don't gamble, they use tools like options and futures to either hedge their bets or make a little bit more money on the top of what they already have in a safe way. These firms are well oiled machines meant to manage risk and use tools most individuals dont have to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:26:25
It was still due to them being wrapped up in shitty loans and not due to their investing in stocks or commodities. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:12:30
I would never say that bitcoin is ever going to act exactly the same as stocks or other commodities, but if you think that introduction of trading tools that are used on stocks will not make the behavior of the two more similar you are mistaken. It has less to do with the underlying asset and more to do with the mechanics of buying/selling/shorting and other trading tools/methods. Bitcoin is different than any other commodity, that is for sure, but it is not immune to supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:50:25
I'm pretty sure it will just be used as a tool for individuals who what to gamble with their investment and massive investment firms who what to hedge their bets while the take money from the first.

Rome took centuries to collapse. How long do you plan on sticking around?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:02:51
Okay, poor wording, but my point stands. They minimize their potential loss or even eliminate the possibility of losing money by using tools available to them. Futures will probably be used by large firms to make relatively small amounts of money by coordinating transactions between smaller groups or individuals. That is how "market makers" work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:07:46
Just because bitcoin might someday be worthless does not mean it cannot act as a store of value. It is just a riskier store of value. Just because two commodities/securities are not identical doesn't mean you can't draw comparisons between the two. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:04


Not everything can be considered a store of value. For instance perishable items are not a store of value because they inherently lose value over time.


As far as I know there were never any beanie baby futures sold, so for the sake of this discussion it would be a poor comparison. Additionally, there were not a limited number of beanie babies as they were always able to make more, whereas gold is limited by how much there is on earth and how much we can extract from the earth. Bitcoin is also limited, but in an artificial fashion. So, while gold and bitcoin are far from the same, for the sake of discussing the introduction of bitcoin futures gold is an apt comparison while beanie babies is not.

Can't short it *yet*. It actually would not be very hard for the exchanges to set that up just like stocks.

Financial institutions: "Well they're spending all their money on Bitcoin now that the price is up. Two months from now they won't be able to pay their loans because it will have crashed again. Shit."
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:58:49
