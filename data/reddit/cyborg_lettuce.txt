The source you cite does not mention Belarus, so we actually don't know.
That purported 2.9% fee appears to be credit card fee for countries which Circle doesn't have bank transfer working yet.
Suppose bank transfer works in Belarus. The fee for "uploading" money to Circle would be 0%, and the fee for withdrawing from **Coinbase** (read OP's description) would be 1%. Oh, and a bank fee of 0.15 which is truly negligable. I don't know what the fee for the alternative WU way is. Do you know? Oh wait, you make up numbers...

I don't understand why people see purchase times as a problem, as if we were short of bitcoins in our accounts at any given moment. We've all been keeping a bunch of bitcoins from when it was ~$1200/BTC and haven't had the heart to sell them, right? ...right?

We are jealous of your SEPA so let's call it even.

Have you considered Circle? Coinbase is a bit slow in processing, plus they take 1% on the exchange both directions.

It was obvious to me too, but only because I already knew transferring bitcoins is cheap.

I think you got down voted for tone but you bring up a good point. If I can buy more bitcoins for the same buck, it sounds like Circle is a better choice.

Wait is stock and ETF the same thing or not?

Wouldn't a Google Wallet, PayPal, etc. option avoid the credit card fee issue? I don't see why people think it's either credit card or bitcoins, when CC alternatives have already existed.

Probably makes sense to store as a long at the smallest unit possible (0.00000001 BTC).
IEEE 754 also supports decimal floating point nowadays...

FYI a new wall went up with 22904 BTC @ 300 on the second dip below 300.

But that's goxbux, as in imaginary money.

I think it's a positive that Bill pointed out the cheap transaction nature of Bitcoin, but I know he's been working on his own micropayment solution to help the poor and he is looking at it from that comparison perspective. ("Cheap transaction" = hey this is something that we have going too, and "drug dealers find it convenient" = this is how our micropayment solution can be distinguished from Bitcoin)

Many banks can do external wire transfers for $20-$30 bucks, which can be much less than a 1% Coinbase fee, so I can see Coinbase+Bitcoin not being the ideal money transfer solution for some, but I'm glad it's working for you. Good to hear you having more choice and being able to get rid of poorly performing middle men.
