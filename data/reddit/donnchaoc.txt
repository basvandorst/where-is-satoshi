Yep thats the idea. It will be have a fairer distribution when more people begin listing bitcoin addresses in their Tor router 'contact' or 'X-bitcoin' field.

The site is backup now. Please let me know if anyone sees any issues. I want to try and improve this so it can help the Tor network grow. Issues can be filled at

Sorry about that downtime, the nameservers responsible for the domain were experiencing issues.

Down at the moment, I'll have it back up on another server real soon

Thanks for the feedback. I'll put up some proper information on the site for relay operators. I'll move it to a proper server too, that instance seems to be dieing with even a small amout of load.
A bitcoin address listed anywhere in the ContactInfo line will be parsed and and displayed on the site. 
Sorry about the confusing references to an X-bitcoin field. There is a proposal to allow X- fields in the config file/server descriptor but it has not been implemented by the Tor project yet and so will give errors. I've just added that to future proof it when that new proposal gets deployed.

Good catch! I have fixed that mistake now

Thanks a lot for the generous tip! I really appreciate all the positive feedback here and I'd just like to thank Fred and his team for running their service so well

Thanks CocoDaPuf. At the moment I'm still only half way through my undergraduate degree studying Medicinal Chemistry. For now infosec is just a hobby for me, but I'll have to wait and see where it goes in the future. It's definitily something I would be interested in getting into more.
