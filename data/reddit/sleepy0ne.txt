What problem do you want it to solve?  Despite the "spam" (as you call it), BCH fees are still only 2 sats.  I guess you don't want a usable currency?
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:39:31
It does work.  BCH fees are still 2 Sats.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:35:58
That's incorrect.  Comcast has a 1TB monthly cap, and 4320MB is roughly 0.42% of that.  So who is paying penalties?
And I just assumed that you favored LN, since that is the only proposed alternative to increasing the block size that I have seen.  I apologize for making assumptions, but I'm curious as to what you do favor?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:33:07


Well, at least you are keeping an open mind.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:22:48
These idiots don't get it.  They've been brainwashed into thinking that transactions which don't pay $30+ fees are spam... LOL
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:48:00
So transacting is now "abusing the blockchain"?  Open your eyes.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:30:31
How is that working?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:32:45
Oh please.  That is a ridiculously low amount of bandwidth.  And please explain to me why you feel that lightning network is decentralized.

Agreed.  The US will never ban crypto because they know that Russia and China would simply take full advantage, and vice versa.  The superpowers may not like crypto, but they are kind of held hostage by that fact.
I'm sure it is very worrying for governments, however, as crypto is going to be massively empowering for the people.  For the most part, governments will no longer be able to force people to pay taxes.  Instead, people will pay taxes because they *want* to pay them.  As a result, politicians will have to get off of their asses and actually deliver results.  Just imagine how much more efficient our governments will be when we can finally hold our politicians accountable with our wallets...

No worries, I think we've all done that before ;)


My quick math tells me that we would need ~3.5GB blocks to reach Visa levels (27k Tx/sec).  But I do agree with you.  Blocks of that size are not definitely not realistic today, however, they may be 5-10 years from now.  It's crazy to think about, but the first 1TB hard drive came out roughly 10 years ago and now, we have [1TB SD cards](
You may disagree, but personally, I don't think Bitcoin needs to be at Visa levels today and I would rather it grow slowly as technology improves, instead of taking short cuts and sacrificing decentralization.  I'm not sure the world is ready for Bitcoin yet anyways.

Even if you have 15 million, buying a lambo is stupid.  Exotic cars are like a stupid tax on the rich.

Where do you find these mythical $13 transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:55:28
Not true. Dorian Nakamoto lived in the same city as Hal — they weren’t neighbors. Craig Wright is probably Satoshi, despite what Greg Maxwell and the other core devs want you to believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:37:42
Satoshi sent an email on August 15th 2015, almost 1 full year after Hal passed: [link](
That email came from Satoshi's main email address (satoshi and is proven to have not been spoofed.  It's possible that his email was hacked, but the tone and writing style match Satoshi's.
Hal may have been Satoshi, but why would he use both an anonymous alias and his real name?  That has always seemed odd to me.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:02:04
Ok, glad I'm not crazy!
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:51:24
Hm, I wonder if I linked mine to my SR account.  If I did, then it would explain why I can't find them.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:04:48
And had they bought after he crash, they would be up 1400%. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:04:19
A mass exodus of miners would be a big problem.  Transactions would slow to a crawl and it would take 2016 blocks for the difficulty to adjust.  2016 blocks would normally take 2 weeks, but without miners, who knows how long it would take?  Maybe months.  In the interim, Bitcoin price would likely tank.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:38:53
BTC market cap has dropped by $1.5 billion or so today, so it's likely that some big investors have moved a portion of their investment over to BCC.  Probably just hedging their bets in the event that we see a BTC death spiral.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:22:19
Every time a bubble happens, people think 'this time is different'.  It's not.  BTC will likely crash down to 1.5-2k in the next couple months  and that will be a good time to buy.  I feel bad for any idiot who buys in right now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:19:14


If a death spiral does happen, then it will need to be fixed with a hard fork.  If the exploit isn't fixed, miners will just jump back to the BTC chain once the difficulty corrects itself, pump the difficulty back up again, and then leave to induce yet another death spiral.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:14:19
The FBI had a difficult time because the terrorist had his phone set to erase itself after a handful of failed logon attempts.  So, not really.   If you do the same, the only thing you'll likely succeed at is making your coins disappear.  
Paper wallets are the best way to go, by far.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:44:47
Don't feel bad, I did the same thing lol.  
I bought 100 coins for $30 that I planned to use on silk road and then I chickened out.  I forgot about them until I saw Bitcoin in the news recently.  I've searched everywhere for those damn coins and I can't find them.  I make a good living, so I can't complain too much, but having an extra 400k would be nice... Oh well, that's life I guess.

Wallets can be cracked -- there are services for it.  PM me if you're interested.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:11:13
This.  The entire point of bitcoin was to remove the need for banks.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:52:04
Or he lives in an expensive area.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:50:26
But blockchain isn't unique to Bitcoin, nor has it stopped bubbles from happening in the past. To believe otherwise is just foolish. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:02:11
What a waste of taxpayer dollars.  I wish this guy the best of luck.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:52:34
Yeah, it just doesn't make sense for them to target this guy for no reason.  This is pure speculation, but maybe he was scamming people and this was an easy way for the feds to get him.  Or maybe he was regularly selling BTC to criminals.  Hopefully we will get some more information.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:27:09
You guys have it all wrong.  You see, this is just Dimon's way of snarkishly admitting to pumping and dumping Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:41:38
Both sides are doing it.  This should not be a surprise.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:18:25
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:54:11
What you just described is called "speculation".  Do you understand how bubbles work?
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:35:20
I'll do it for 10%. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:34:44
Damn. And I thought my losing 100 coins was bad.
