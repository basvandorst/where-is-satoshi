Hey thanks and forgive my brashness if I was, lots of people seem to have a problem with someone trying to set up a system unless they're an expert first. Perhaps they don't think I deserve it despite the fact I paid for it.

The bot is indeed new to me. I set the mining farm up myself. The bot configuration is more complex

Re read the comment, thought you were referring to that. Apologies. 
I've approached my ventures in this space with lots of different strategies to hedge against the rest and evaluate what is workable and what isn't. Unfortunately it changes so rapidly its tough to come up with a silver bullet strategy (besides holding). I'm of the opinion the music will stop soon now that everything is so mainstream which will surely lead to heavier regulation. Now, the regulation is easy enough to circumvent by those who would do such a thing, but the market's reaction to it is another story. The trading bot was simply another project in a long list of various projects in this space. I'm not a crypto "person" by trade but I did see a great opportunity. I understand the crypto community has mixed feelings about outsiders such as myself, but thats their problem to deal with. I, like some 90% of people in the space, are here to gain.

I run a trading bot with my masternodes and mining rigs in a warehouse. I don't have access to the trading bot remotely. Came in this morning and found the DCA settings were too......aggressive. My steady 1% per day off the bot were wiped. I guess its in line with the rest of the market though.
My bags....they are heavy. 
Jesus christ you guys are harsh.
Im well knowledgeable about mining, but the bot config is a bit more complex so i'm learning as I go. I've only had it a week. yes, I will set up remote soon. No, i'm not learned in this area. My sincerest apologies for not detailing everything out.

Im certain the markets are manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:09:28
I can access everything remotely except the trading bot

You win. I do not deserve to have this technology, nor do I deserve to be involved in your sacred space. Until I have a doctorate in computer science and cryptocurrency I am not qualified to inhabit this space.

A basic understanding of computers includes remoting in to manage a linux based cryptocurrency trading bot? What is this elitist shit?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:49:46
Dude, I clearly said i'm not as learned in these areas. Sorry for not being an expert in these things before starting. Excuse the fuck out of me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:10:40
not the trading bot. I run it on a dedicated machine. I just havent set up remote control on it. Its not built into the bot itself.

I consider myself more in line with libertarian ideals than anything else, but I found this unbelievably hilarious. 
Brb investing in quarter validators that attach to guns.

I can access everything except the trading bot as is pretty clear in the comment. Just not the way it's designed and I dont run it on a VPS
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:25:00
Oh shit I better cash out RIGHT NOW huh?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:51:59
This is nothing like gox. Nobody hacked, the market shows this behavior 20-25 days before chinese new year. I just need to tweak the settings and use less DCA. 


laughable 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:11:25
Time. Ive had the bot for about a week and still tweaking. Additionally, when I leave the farm, I rarely check on things as they run. Leave me alone I learned my lesson. Sheesh

It does if the rent is paid in full up front, which mining contracts are.
