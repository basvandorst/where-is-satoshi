wtf is happening?! why the sudden surge?!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:36:44
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:51:06
Gdax will also use it in january.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:52
ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:32:10
yeah I am not sure either, but so far so good.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:35
what's so special about Bitstamp? why would one choose Bitstamp over Gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:35
haha ok, yeah but why today you know.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:58:23
how about the app overall?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:06:07
yup, I don't know if you ''create'' them, probably choose from a variety of words. Have to check it out my self.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:54:01
€500*. Why "only". That's nothin to you?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:01:00
I see, makes sense. but the price of multiple coins is higher on GDAX though. Which is pretty cool/.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:52
hasn't been updated for iOS in almost a year, so I am going to skip that one. on android it's great though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:12:36
Fuckin idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:41:47
okay fair enough.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:26
how does one transfer btc from their LNS to say GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:37
at 9.480 now
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:10:41
hodl till at least end of 2018 when it hits 40k
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:29:50
how are the fees with hardware wallets? The App mycelium asks for about 6 dollars when I wanted to transfer to a different wallet. Does a Nano Ledger ask for fees when transferring crypto from and to the device?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:49:30
What about the ledger nano s?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:27:05
dude why post this, the more people make use of this the more GDAX will be inclined to raise the fees. Believe me somewhere in Q1 GDAX will have higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:33
Awesome thanks, how do you find electrum as a wallet? Do they have high fees?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:14:25
3500 euros in 2 days is major yes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:47:00
This sounds weird but does the Nano Ledger ask for any fees when transferring to or from the ledger like certain apps do? (hot wallets), if so how do you know the amount?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:33:13
Thanks, I forgot to ask whether there are any fees involved to withdrawing and depositing cryptos to GDAX. (from and to my wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:05
I know that you can buy and sell with no fees on GDAX by choosing limit orders, what about depositing crypto to and withdrawing crypto from GDAX (or Coinbase) to/from a hardware wallet /app wallet? Can't find anything on GDAX or Coinbase about this.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:43:17
Oh I see. Yeah that's true, but if the gain in money is instant (within half an hour) then I would take that risk (if I had such capital that is. )
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:13:05
any recommendations?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:50
awesome! I assume that you can transfer via the same app back to your LNS from GDAX? Does one also get to see the fees that are related to the transfer from and to the LNS?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:09
fomo? :P
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:02
did the transaction eventually complete?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:51:13
okay I see.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:49:44
Haha exactly my thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:42
does bread crash a lot? I read that it does.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:51:01
awesome, thanks bud.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:50:53
tell me, I live in Europe so would like to know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:45:09
just figured it out. You don't store the coin on the wallet. The wallet stores a key. No actual funds live on the hardware device. Bitcoin lives in the blockchain network. The hardware wallet contains the key to access your funds on the blockchain and that key is encrypted via the seed words. So, if you have the seed you have access to the key which in turn gives you access to your funds on the blockchain network.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:34
I still don't understand the whole wallet thing. From what I understand you don't really ''store'' your coins on the wallet, but why would you need a wallet if you don't store it on there anyway? let alone a hardware wallet. ELI5 anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:14:36
Would you recommend breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:36
anyone know how many fees GDAX asks for BTC/LTC/ETH deposit and withdrawal?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:17:10
okay and if I use a hardware wallet? does that let me choose or show me the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:29
transferred 0.1 btc from mycelium to coinbase. Took 30 euros fees from me. Normal speed. Yet not even 1 confirmation has been completed. It's been over an hour. WTF? They take 30 euros from me and not even one confirmation!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:03:40
you already know how much btc you stored on your LNS. So you can basically check the value of your coins by visiting coinbase or gdax, shouldn't be so difficult right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:24:41
what kind of effect can the bitcoin futures have on sunday? (or after sunday?)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:26:45
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:16
gdax probably
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:19:32
How am I supposed to find a fork wallet
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:15
how to know what the amount of fees is? hot wallets show you the amount but don't know how it works with hardware wallets
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:32
why do you ask these kinds of questions. How would people know how much it's going to dip. It can even go above 17k. No one knows.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:21
from coinbase to GDAX indeed, but I want to know the fees when I deposit crypto to or withdraw from GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:37:47
oh awesome, I was thinking of mycelium, but they do charge fees. Will check that out. thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:34:31
so it doesn't happen too often?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:04:29
How has the price been in the christmas and new year period in the last two years? Does anything special happen to the price during that period?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:33
I see, and does the user get to see how much that fee is?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:12:47
haha yeah but I read that it is not really safe, don't know how true this is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:54
What happened, everything is on halt right now, No buying or selling on GDAX, goes for ETH too..
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:53:04
Have had a limit order on there for 4 days now, no problems yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:03:03
oh cool, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:39
true, might just go and buy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:23
cool didn't know, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:44:07
dude wtf, why would you try to correct me. Are you dutch?
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:33:24
what do you mean by transfer coming through? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:25:35
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:49:16
Ok cool, will check out the options.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:09:25
quick question, say I buy BTC today and it rises with 500 dollars by tomorrow. Is it possible to make 500 dollars that way (buying and selling on GDAX.com) Sounds to good to be true, hence my question.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:16:14
Don't know I didn't have that option in GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:01
hmm okay, guess I'll need to read up on that, still confusing. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:40:02
ok thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:17:18
what are limit orders, excuse my noobness.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:22:55
ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:05
Makes sense thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:55:59
looks pretty good, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:02
oh ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:47:39
Kraken €8370, GDAX: €8889. Does this mean if I buy from Kraken for  €8370 I can sell it for €8889 at GDAX and make crazy money? Also, why the crazy difference?!
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:53:31
cool, what about selling?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:24:46
cool thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:20:29
Ok cool. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:31:19
When I click on deposit I see: Sepa, coinbase account and BTC address. Where do you get the card option?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:24:44
is buying and selling usually from and to your own country? on sites like gdax, coinbase, kraken etc?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:51:03
Is it possible to buy 0.1 BTC and then later on another 0.1 BTC and store them separately. I want to use the same exchange platform though. I want to buy one 0.1 BTC as a longterm investment and the other 0.1 BTC to buy low sell high.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:45:32
Damn. Don't even know what that is. Got a few things to learn hah
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:40
what's a hot wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:17:50
yes, yes and yes. Probably a glitch on their end.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:51:19
how so, you could always sell and buy a little higher next time. Make profit every time. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:55
Nice. It's €851 now. Can't wait to buy when the dip comes. Hope it comes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:46
any europeans here that use GDAX? is there a way to use a creditcard? I can't see an option to use a card.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:30:27
damn never thought of it that way. Indeed the purchasing power goes up quite alot
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:58:59
not clear enough?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:02:50
Where can one make an exchange, simply on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:42:34
You mean coinbase has high fees?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:34:43
why the sudden drop? what happened?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:13:37
should one also invest in Ethereum and/or Litecoin while it's affordable??
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:37:23
Ok cool.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:14
okay cool, are there fees involved if I transfer from coinbase to gdax? also I registred on gdax, do I automatically have an account at coinbase? thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:12
I see. Will the value of GDAX and Coinbase get equal again?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:55:02
Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:16:37
seems everyone is. Might do that
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:48:42
exodus and Jaxx seem to be good as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:26:48
Did you use your bank or card, if you used card, did it transfer directly? I used my bank to send money to my GDAX account directly (have to wait 2 days now). Thought that's better because fees might be involved (just registered an hour ago).
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:02:22
have you done any transaction via their platfrom? I mean is it legit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:37:49
so basically, you use Coinbase only for transactions. Correct?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:09:46
Which wallet(s) will give me both a new version of bitcoin and let me keep bitcoin once a hard fork comes. Do apps give me that possibilty? Or do I have to go for hardware if I want to benefit from the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:42:14
yeah but when is the next dip. DOn't think it's coming any time soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:09
Just registered to GDAX and sent €10 to my account (for testing). Will take 1-2 business days for it to arrive. Does this €10 euro go to GDAX or to coinbase first?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:28:11
Any alternatives to coinbase. One with low fees?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:17:11
Do those store multiple coins as well?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:58:00
interesting, want to know too.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:42
yup, me too man.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:59
Any wallet you recommend besides the obvious hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:16:31
oh ok thanks, what wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:29:54
can't I create an account on GDAX right away instead of coinbase first then GDAX. Also how about kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:18:40
what about a long term investment? buy now and see what happens in 6 months/a year. Also just your reply, you say that monero or litecoin are better alternatives to diversify. How is that?
In terms of buying low selling high, bitcoin would make more indeed. Just waiting for a bitcoin dip.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:22:06
want to know too
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:11:19
How come the price on GDAX is €8838 and on Coinbase it's €8201??
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:49:33
You don't need to correct me, if you look at my post history you could easily notice that I don't make such mistakes, because I know the difference in usage of those. Nevertheless, thanks I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:05
awesome thanks. What walles do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:01
haha spot on
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:01:29
those are all online wallets right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:46:53
Which wallet allows me to store ETC, BTC, LTC and other altcoins all at once?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:33:08
True, but on GDAX it's free I believe see [this]( post and the first reply
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:52:46
how about the fees?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:15
I see, makes sense now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:21:51
the difference is major though. Sounds to good to be true in terms of making money.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:30:24
how much $ worth of btc/eth/ltc is okay to keep on GDAX servers? I can't decide what app to use for my iPhone so I though I might as well keep it at the GDAX server.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:21
just a few? and the rest on exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:38:16
Best iPhone app or windows program to store my coins LOCALLY. Preferably an app that supports BTC, LTC and ETH. THanks. Note: I am a noob.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:28:50
What's ACH and CC?
So it takes 2-4 days before you get your money from your sold amount?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:30:35
I'm gonna wait a little more, hope it indeed hits 20%.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:47
damn, never heard of xrps. Those are quite affordable. Wonder when it will surge in value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:00:55
is the dip happening now? Still at 9600, I just checked.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:29:53
an iphone app will just do.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:34:45
Ah ok makes sense, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:04:59
what do you mean by left with no order. So your order won't go through until it hits your desired number right? (which may or may not ever happen)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:03
Ok, I'll check out exodus. Can I use exodus without an internet connection? Sorry for all the questions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:18
usd's value was the same though?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:59:22
awesome thanks
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:38:48
Quick question. I see a lot of people making profit within a week. Some guy ( a total noob like me) bought 1 bitcoin two weeks ago and made 1000$ profit in a week. Is it really that easy? I want to buy 0,5 or 1 bitcoin, can I do the same thing. Also daytrading looks really appealing because it's really volatile. So a lot of profit is to be made, right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:42:06
ok cool.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:39:00
okay, I am planning on using GDAX anyway. btw what is a stop order, saw that as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:47
no it does work in Europe. Via Sepa though. So I have to wait a few days for my money to get to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:51:09
Isn't that the same as a limit order
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:19
ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:35:22
will the fee really be greater than the price difference? Don't think fees would amount to +/ 500? I googled it now it makes more sense, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:44:43
ow ok I see, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:40:48
me too, so fuckedup
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:15:09
YEah but when is the fucking dip, this isn't a real dip. IMO
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:39:34
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:58:21
did you get it for the price you bought it at?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:14:14
true. It's very interesting. Need to hop on it when it's in a dip again.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:42:49
yeah difficult to know whether it will ever dip.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:37:35
are iPhone apps considered as a good wallet for when a fork happens. (So I get all the ''fork money'')
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:42:35
ok I'll check it out, what about gdax or coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:33:59
well you're still one of the few that could be considered one of the early ones. Next year everyone will say: damn wish I knew about it last year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:14:33
Oh, so it depends on where one is. Europe
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:38:08
how much did you buy? 1 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:22:06
I see, ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:28
Guess I'll have to
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:48:11
fair enough, but it was for a reason though.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:47:57
I HODL, because Crypto is all about HODLING!!
