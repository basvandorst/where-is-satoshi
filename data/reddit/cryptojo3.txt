A good example for me to use to combat your argument is Venezuela.
Even though the country and its currency is going to the shitter, a massive influx of Venezuelan value has yet to trasfer to BTC. Why? Idk, it should be spreading like wildfire, but it has yet to happen.
I think the reason is three fold.
One (my argument all along) is that they are simply not adopting the tech for logistical, legal, and cultural reasons. All of which are apparent to you and me, but Bitcoin has been around long enough for the people of Venezuela to understand and use, but again, they are not.
Two, the other ways currently available for preserving value are working just fine. i.e. Buying gold and capital flight to other S.A. Countries.
Three, Bitcoin is still relatively hard to use and explain to the lamen.
Long story short, BTC is amazing and I love it, but like all fiat currencies it requires lots of people using and believing in it to give it value.
If it is not adopted and not enough people use it, the banks will do just fine.
I think a black swan event is the only way BTC will hit critical mass in the short term, at least in reference to "killing the banks" and displacing them.
The world is/are experiencing the events you're describing now and in real time, but yet BTC is still a nothing burger with a market cap of less than $20B. It needs something serious to sway the masses.

Adoption, adoption, adoption.
None of this speculation will matter unless there is a super strong and compelling reason to switch to crypto.
Bitcoin needs a black swan banking catastrophie or a rapid increase in usable applications. This is what concerns me the most, that Bitcoin is moving too slow.
