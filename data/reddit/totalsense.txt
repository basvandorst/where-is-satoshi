I've updated to the new release.  Seems to be working fine.

They all suck for US people if you want anything other than BTC.  Most don't allow account creation and if you live in WA or NY you are even more limited.  Coinbase likes to do a 2 week or more hold on funds.
Banks have put so much pressure on the government it's ridiculous.  All while buying up bit chunks for themselves.

I would not recommend it. 
Coinbase now holds your coins for 16 days.  Unless you put a credit card on file and of course none of mine were accepted.
If you are going to buy BTC just use the cashapp.

In other words: "We won't allow anything to interfere with our printing of US Dollars and will back it with force. All countries must comply."
No wonder the U.S. is hated so much.

What would be the best way to upgrade a RaspiBolt setup?

I had some I stored for a few years on paper wallets.  I bought waterproof paper brand "Write in the Rain".  Put in a ziplock in my fireproof safe.  Recently pulled them out and are doing just fine.  Printed with a lazer printer.  Don't really recommend inkjet.
Was just looking at a lazer engraver, doing a paper wallet on a piece of metal would be cool.

"Bitcoin goes up and down and the dollar is always a dollar".  Just shows how ignorant people are to their own money supply.
A dollar is worth less every year.

They left something very important out of this.  If a bank has assets of $100 they can create loans for 10 times that amount.  It's where the term fractional reserve banking comes from.
Each of those additional loans also gets multiplied.

Iran has stated they are going to dump the dollar.  Keep in mind that the USA has destroyed every government that has attempted that.
Just ask Muammar Gaddafi how well that worked out for him. Oh, wait, you can't.

Have tried again?  It's possible they may not have it available.  If there was a buying spree they might have had supply issues.

Interesting article.  Taken as a whole the methodology sounds good.  But, the 2 big items that stand out to me:
1) The money used to buy in is used for investments by founding members.  Sounds like a nice cash grab scam.
2) It is 100% custodial wallet.  You think facebook jail is bad, wait until you piss off someone and they close your wallet.

Probably not.  Another article stated that they were sized from Mosques.  Mosques in Iran get free electricity and miners are banned from them for that reason.

Anyone who thinks the US Dollar is backed by GDP is delusional.  It is backed by guns.
Want to create an alternative currency?  Liberty Dollars, e-Gold etc.., Feds just lock you up.
As a country want to dump the dollar?  Time for regime change.
Cryptocurrencies are surviving because of a lack of central authority.  Nobody to lock up.  The more people realize this the stronger it becomes.
FYI, Iran announced they are dumping the dollar.

You should treat it like any other cash asset.  Save 10% of what you get securely, every time. Buy $200 worth, put $20 in an offline wallet.  Speculate with the rest if you want.
