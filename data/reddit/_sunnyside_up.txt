I would like to know this too.  An inside job is all I can come up with.

I wouldn't be so sure.  They are still closely tied but the separation has begun.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:09:53
Monero, Stellar..  is where I'd place my bets anyway.

so not so good for hodlers, but good for frequent trades or transactions.  Thanks

people were saying "bull trap" yesterday when it came back to 11+.  Seems to have stabilized and is inching up, but who the fuck knows.
But, I'm going with it's already happened.

sounds like a good time to buy and setup a mining rig?

he probably sold when it went sub 10k.  Now he's just trying to justify his decision most likely.

How many trades or investments do you need to make before getting the $500?  I seriously doubt that you'll just login and there will be a free $500 sitting in your account when they launch.

Only if ETH went down with it.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:20:26
ok then sell?
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:42:55
You might want to stop the predictions, unless of course you have some reasoning to go along with it...
so, what makes you think so?

yeah, it took mine a week, but I bought bitcoin with my bank account instead of just transferring the money.  It locks in the price at the time of the buy no matter how long the transfer takes.

looks like there is a small fee to buy on gdax.  Maybe 0.5% or something
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:39:04
If you *know* its going back down, then sure.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:25:09
Well I think you are right.  There is no better time to buy then when the market is down.  If you believe in bitcoin, now is the time to get in and definitely don't sell for a loss if you've been HODLing.
I'm no expert but there have been several TAs for a while now saying that a drop to the current levels (7-8k) was needed and would happen before we would be able to go back up to ATHs.  So this drop is really not all that surprising.

nah, its blasting/squeaking through 8,6 now.  Looking like 8,7 may be a fight though

140.0 Bitcoin sell order at 8700 on GDAX.  Couldn't break through.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:55:28
nope
