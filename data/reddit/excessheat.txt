Pretty decent payout, 10$ for every 1000 visitors you attract, paid in BTC.  Google adsense is something like 25 cents for 1000 impressions I believe, but that depends on the keyword.

This is the million dollar question.  Bitcoins can be taxed like stocks, as capital gains.  But unlike stocks it is not easy to prove how much you paid for the bitcoins originally.  This is one factor which will become a problem and a driver for more regulation.  
Option 1 is to treat bitcoin holdings as untaxed, only dealing with the issue when they are converted to cash.  This is what is happening now and is not necessarily a good long term solution.
Option 2 is to treat bitcoin holdings as taxable, but then the financial system will have to admit that bitcoin is a legitimate asset and will have to deal with further issues.

That is an interesting point.  I don't think that contributors necessarily need to shed their identity to work with us, but I see where you are coming from.  It may be a good idea to implement a profile page as well as make sure that authors include their name, qualifications and contact information.
I think that our approach will actually attract MORE qualified bloggers.  Public opinion will be the determining factor in how much you get paid, therefor low quality posts which may traditionally work well with pay-for-content models will actually not work in our model.
Also, a lot of professional bloggers support themselves off adsense income, while often paying domain and hosting fees and having to maintain a website.  Since our service is free and infrastructure is already in place this will greatly simplify the process for someone who wants to get into professional blogging but does not want to deal with the logistics.

what subjects do you think would lend themselves best to this system?
I hear what you're saying, sensationalist news articles seem to be the most popular.  We have a screening process for our system and obviously will only select educated members.

This is a website I am collaborating on, the aim is to be the central source of bitcoin tax and regulatory information.  We have developed a platform which uses bitcoin to pay bloggers for writing content for us.  Instead of being paid a few dollars per article like some other services online, our framework keeps track of the visitors brought to the site by a bloggers content and pays them per visitor.  There is no upper limit, if your content is attracting visitors 2 years from now you will still be compensated.  
What do you guys think of this idea?
