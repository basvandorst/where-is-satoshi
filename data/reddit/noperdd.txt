So around 2013, Andreessen Horowitz is one of the biggest investors of startups [Coinbase]( AND Robinhood? This guy is nuts.

I agree. When I say some inflation is good for the economy, I should have said it's "good" for the economy. Because there's a lot of debate what is actually good.

What gets censored here? Didn't realize that was an issue.

Thanks for that. I've been using r/bitcoin as my only place for news and don't know anything about bitcoin xt. You make it sound like it's bigger than the other alt coins. I'll check out some articles to find more.

But what if the price goes up? Wouldn't more miners start mining? And every additional miner uses more energy right?

The FED actually wants some inflation. They try to print just enough money every year to have like 2-3% inflation. It's because they want you to spend your money and not hoard it. As long as they do a good job, it can help the economy. It's just a major problem if they screw up and inflation goes out of control.

If anyone is in Minnesota, check out Elevated Liquor in South Minneapolis. Good prices and accept Bitcoin!

Went with a refurb GTX 780. One problem is you can't buy most of the new Nvidia cards because they come with the free Watchdogs game. The bitcoin discount doesn't work when it comes with a free gift. I'm happy with this deal though. $395 after the discount.

You don't want a community, so you come into the comments section to discuss it with the community. Makes sense.

You might want to go somewhere else for news if you don't want jokes and discussion along with the news. That's basically what reddit is, News+Jokes+Community

Just combined my 2 favorite subreddits. Bought a new video card with bitcoin to use with my Oculus DK2 coming next week.

I don't know why people on here are treating him like a saint. Sounds like he helped run an worldwide drug ring, then hired a hit man to murder his partner.

It's not always. For about 30 years it's been great in the US, but almost every decade before the 1980's has had major spikes in inflation.

Volatility is a downside because it is new, and there is no value people can agree on what a bitcoin is worth. To me, it's about buying into a currency that's protected from inflation. We can either trust in the belief that bitcoin has value, and hope the world feels the same way. [Or we can trust our government will not devalue our currency with hyper inflation.]( In Venezuela, your $20.00 in 2013 is worth $0.06 today.

Even though it's taxed as property? I wish it was clear like that, but it's frankly not.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:07:34
Sure. I'm just making sure people know that there's not a clear legal definition like you implied.

The part about being a bubble may or may not be true. He has a point about volatility though. It's still not stable. It could be 1000 or 3000 in a month and no one will be that suprised. It's not stable enough to give the same ability as the dollar. Can't schedule monthly payments in bitcoin. Can't have salary based in bitcoin. Still need the dollar as reference.

True. I just thought it's cool that there was almost an international currency called the "bit". And now, 70 years later, we have an international currency basically called the same thing. (And can be used for the original purpose, trading currency without using the USD)
