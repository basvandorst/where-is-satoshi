Both of those countries are/would be ruled by thugs. America **was forced** to stay to prevent both countries descend to hell the same way Afghanistan descended into hell of Talibans after Soviets left. 
It's was a very bad example. Muqtadā al-Ṣadr would likely become warlord of entire Iraq and Taliban would be back if Americans left. The anarchistic society wouldn't last for one month. 
I study CS, but a friend who has a degree in political science personally said that Anarchy never existed and can't exist and frankly, outside small communities protected by democracies I can't think of a single anarchistic society that flourished. Name just one. 


Yes, banned.

Yes, it is your responsibility to influence the government. You are arguing for establishment of government even if it will result in greater evil? Everyone hippie likes to dream how anarchy would be perfect, but it is a lot harder to try influence current government. It takes balls to do that.
In my country, Slovenia, during 40s anarchists, then named communists won. People fell for lies and after the war, instead of democracy we had 45 years of communist dictatorship and economical ruin. That's what happens when instead of fighting for reforms you abolish government. The populace is so easy to fall for it. 


Can you give me an example of anarchistic society that existed for any prolonged period of time without being pillaged by neighboring societies. You can't name one. ;)
**ALSO: My account has been banned, nice to see "anarchists" have to resort so heavy handed tactics of the establishment to silence dissidents. **
