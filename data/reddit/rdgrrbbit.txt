Someday there will be a whole shelf devoted to Bitcoin under finance/investing, another shelf to Blockchain in technology.

Price continues to go down, finding less volatility between $100-$300. Price stabilizes within this range. (small possibility of price reaching all time high in the event of another recession or depression).
Hash rate continues to grow, reaching 500,000,000 G/Hash p/s somewhere in the second half of the year.
Ethereum receives a lot of press coverage, further fueling interest in Bitcoin/Blockchain technologies for those that formerly thought Bitcoin to be 'nerd money'. 
Openbazaar launches with some initial success within the Bitcoin community. Full potential not realized in 2015. Silk Road 3 taken down. Silk Road 4 up and running within 28 hours of take down.
A new service announced to reward bootlegers and seeders with a decentralised blockchain based file sharing service. (it's been speculated before, i'm saying someone will start working on it.)
Capital venture capital/start ups continue. Optimism remains high for Bitcoin both as a long term store of value, and as a technology. Winklevoss twins make a public statement that gets over 1,000 upvotes on Potential for international remittance still not realized in 2015. More infrastructure needed ie ATMs/fiat exchanges needed in developing world before $40,000+ per Bitcoin reached. 
Bitpay (or other) will continue with new TV adds that will go nation wide (USA). Most people will not think twice about it, give it no attention, but hey it's there, it's in front of them, it's resonating in the back of their minds. Heaps of people search "What is Bitcoin" as a result.
Bitcoin community growth continues to grow slowly, outpacing the number of subscribers the average niche fetish porn community has.

If you do go through with it, pass your private keys onto someone you love. They could still be worth a lot more than your break even some day, so there's always hope.

Sounds like a plan.

Can you link to where he says this?

I like Andreas Antonopoulos's way of comparing Bitcoin's volatility to be like a blow up boat bumping up and down in the waves next to the giant US dollar - the Titanic. What happens when more capital is invested in Bitcoin? Over time as early adapters sell out, it becomes more stable. In four years of trading Bitcoin has gone from .08 cents, to the current value of around $300.00 USD. Up, Down, vertial, what-ever. But likely someday to be a lot more.

Yeah I'm considering sourcing out a good Latin or Spanish restaurant if it comes to it.

Maybe someday we'll have a $10,000 bubble, then a $100,000 bubble, then a $1,000,000 bubble. Early days.

With the price declining again overnight, I was a bit nervous. But after you said they taste kinda meh it's not so bad. I've eaten raw eggs so many times I've lost count. Surely they can't be much worse than raw eggs. Raw eggs are like runny snot gushing down your throat.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:44:26
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:48:45
If I can a restaurant somewhere that will accept BTC, then yeah alright.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:47:56
Nah, cooked.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:49:27
I haven't given it that much thought. Any idea?

It is possible to own two addresses with 100 BTC in each of them.

I'm curious to know what county you live in?

I saw this a few weeks back and thought it was pretty impressive. Hopefully some day devices like this one, combined with an incentive to offer unused bandwidth for Bitcoin will allow for secure inexpensive bandwidth on a massive scale.  
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:28:31
Fair point, but some day it may be worth $10,000 dollars

If meganet doesn't work on ip addresses and you pass all internet traffic through a proxy I'm not so sure how they'd track you down or censor such a network.

Thanks for that. They seem to have a range of top end products, not cheap junk that is commonly found on ebay. I'm still hoping to find some all inclusive guides with a DIY wiki of some sort. 
I realise meshnets are not widely used. I'm interested in their potential and hoping to prepare so that when these services are launched I can service a 5 or 10 km range. I have no intention to make money and even anticipate I might lose more than i'll get back, but it is fun to explore and play a part in this. I can see myself easily spending $500 on gear if someone can point me in the right direction.

A closed system not taking advice from industry lobbyists, refusing to take into consideration the long term implications this will have on Australian infrastructure, jobs, and the economy because the traditional 'reserve bank' and other key players want to see it gutted, double taxed, and forgotten. 
When will the ATO realise that they're pushing Australian Businesses to go with overseas exchanges, rendering any attempts at taxing Bitcoin meaningless. No one is benefiting from this outdated model, it's not working, it's re-routing capital overseas. This will never work.
@_date: 2015-02-04 10:40:06


Yes there is, the Bitcoin Association of Australia

Thanks for the link. I've had a quick browse of your webpage before, easy to navigate and colours that aren't too overwhelming to the average consumer. Your buy rate is on par with coinjar. I'm curious though, does your service keep any record of phone numbers or email addresses associated with a buy order? And will you be integrating bpay options in the future?
edit: If you're looking for new Aussie customers to interact with, keep tabs with @_date: 2015-02-05 11:11:09
Nope, that's the whole point.
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:29:09
I've been considering booking a one on one with my local MP, but am quite sceptical as I doubt it will amount to anything. If enough people actively pursued this though, rather than rambling on about it online, change could actually happen. If politicians understood the long term implications this Tax will have, they'd have every incentive to change the ATO's ruling.
As we are seeing now, business in the Bitcoin industry is moving overseas, any tax on Bitcoin is having a minor dint on the consumer because all the business is moving to overseas exchnages. Australian jobs, and our place in an industry that is comparable to the internet of the early 90's - that's the real concern. How many millions, hundreds of millions long term, is going to be lost?

-everything he has predicted in the past has come true.
-on twitter he said: 
2016 $1,000+
2017 $3,000+
2018 $10,000+
2019 $25,000+
2026 $100,000+ or $0

I googled and came up with this: 
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:49:24
Do you have any concern about people using the Bitcoins you sell them to do illicit activities online? Do you mix any coins before selling?
Edit: great article, you had me on the edge of my seat.
