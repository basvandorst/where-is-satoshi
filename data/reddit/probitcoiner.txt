Bitcoin provides a system for electronic transactions without needing to rely on trust between sender and recipient or a third party to mediate. The coins themselves structure around digital signatures that ensure strong control of ownership. 
A peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work builds a public history of transactions to prevent double spending. Robustness is guaranteed from the cooperation of all nodes on the network working together with minimal coordination. Backing the incentive for cooperation and honesty is the required cost of CPU power to generate the chain of transactions. 
If someone unscrupulous meant to try and defraud or double spend, they would need to be able to muster a greater amount of CPU power than all the other honest nodes in the chain put together.

This is why we suggest you roll a die or dice and record a 62 number sequence of the roll results.

edit: Do you trust yourself or Coinbase?

I think there is a lot of helpful bitcoiners here. I dont mean to be a self promoter but I run a fairly new blog called [Probitcoiner]( and my goal is to help as many newcomers as possible.

I asked the question Why do people not put their Bitcoins in Cold Storage? [
