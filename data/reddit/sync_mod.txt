[We]( added Bitcoin as a payment option a few years ago and the response we got from this very community was amazing! In fact, we didn't anticipate how popular Bitcoin payments would be - we had months where over 10% of our transaction volume came through Bitcoin!!! We can't thank the community enough.
**As a privacy-focused cloud storage company the utility of Bitcoin for our users was / still is:**
You can purchase from us with Bitcoin, which means that you don't have to provide your address / billing profile etc. We don't know who you are, which is great from a privacy standpoint (you don't have to trust us with your personal info).
Unfortunately, over the past year or so, the number of users reporting issues with Bitcoin payments has been on the rise. Mostly due to slow confirmation times (which has been sporadic), and more recently issues related to high fees (considering it's only a $49 product people are purchasing). 
Our problem is that internally, we all love Bitcoin (proper), the alternatives are confusing, and we're hoping that Lightning and Segwit solve these problems. But the reality on the ground is that Bitcoin in it's current state is no longer usable (some days) for the simple utility of purchasing a $49 product. It's not as reliable as it was a couple years ago from this standpoint.
We've got our fingers crossed though. Hopefully these issues will get resolved soon!

We use our own hardware and data centres.

Thanks for the feedback. We're planning on it, but still a long term project.
