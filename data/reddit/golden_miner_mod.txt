Is this tip bot running off LN?

I don't care about mooning overnight. I'm regularly buying in $50 every day or 2 for over a year now and will continue until my portfolio reaches 1mill.

Long term cap gains under 39k iirc are tax free if you file single

Behind 4000
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:16:07
Step in the right direction, boys.

Because at that time, bitcoin being so infant, all of those prices were overinflated, so it did PROPERLY, that being the key word, correct itself.

I say HODL always, but if short-term profit taking is your venture then, yes sell on start of crash and buy near where you think the bottom is. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:53:53
I think we have a strong 300 resistance due to how much the infrastructure has grown (allbeit still lacking) since last year of the 200-300 range for most of it.

Wait till correction by end of today and further correction into next week. This volatility will again slow down and pick up as it always does.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:57:01
OK? This was a while ago....
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:39:20
Nice $228 for your last input.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:16:21
Broke the psychological barrier of 1k
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:20:07
So how much did you buy? :)
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:58:41
Does PayPal automatically convert to your selected currency?
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:40:36
In my school days, flash cards were the 5x3 note cards so this was initially very confusing.
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:36:14
So a Bitcoin referral pyramid scheme? How do you make so much if they only get $7x125 plus a bit more. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:52:25
Is this bot LN powered?
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:53:20
You can tip individual Satoshi? How would that be extractable even with, say, 1sat/byte tx fee?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:48:13
Per sat? That's fine
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:06:16
Also, you DONT HAVE TO BUY 1 FULL BITCOIN. Coins break down I to 100million parts
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:26:32
@_date: 2019-06-03 07:25:43
Good. I want to buy more for cheaper.

Put electrum on a pc of his and when he wants to do something, send it to him.

Trying to make it more political than it needed to be. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 07:34:02
5 bucks? Damn dude you're very generous. Very nice to have you in the community
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:40:52
Trump lowered the tax to 21% from 35%.
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:41:26
But that's a small business so falls under the Trump tax cut from 35% to 21%
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:00:58
Either this "bubble" will correct 50% but still be bull run long term or we are seeing phase 2 of adoption and price won't look back much below 2k ever. Who the fuck knows.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:01:23
3000 or don't even inform me
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:33:57
If you could at least disable that popup from coming up every five seconds I'd at least use it as a price ticker.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:10:41
Moving average Trend line is your friend. Dollar cost average and just always buy
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:15:19
Price would correct itself down 50% if the recent gains. That's only if this is a bubble and not mass new adoption however
@_date: 2015-10-30 11:06:59
Would it have to do with different exchanges fees? I'm relatively new but I think that's at least a possibility
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:06:56
because vtc is immune to ASIC? maybe thats why? Don't talk shit unless you know what you're talking shit about.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:11:30
How is it just a shitcoin? I can understand if it was a btc copy exactly, but it, as I said, is only cpu and gpu mining so it cannot be controlled by chinese warehouses unless someone wants to build pcs all day 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:12:28
Especially since that's what we're trying to get away from haha
