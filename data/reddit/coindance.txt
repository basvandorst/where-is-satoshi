We just added tracking for this [here]( to get a better idea how many nodes have been updated and how many are still vulnerable.

It had not yet been approved. It was approved about 4 hours ago.

We made a number of infrastructure changes over the last month to allow us to more easily add additional currencies as they are requested.
Feel free to let us know if you have any questions.

The reward halving should actually happen [earlier than that]( (after you take into account that blocks are not actually mined every 10 minutes but slightly faster).

We take concerns of bias very seriously. Our goal is to simply provide access to information that the community deems critical for the growth of the ecosystem.
EC had originally only existed in a single (Bitcoin) implementation. Fast-forward to today and it now exists in several. Because of this, it makes less sense to measure support in that way. This is why we've been rolling out this change.
We have had discussions with the community on wording/terminology and are doing our best to make things as clear and coherent as possible.
The 'blocks' page will undergo similar changes, although we still need a bit more feedback from the community before those changes will be ready.
Although we do have plans to overhaul the 'nodes' section as well, keep in mind that it will not be impacted by this terminology change as the focus is on the implementations themselves, not the proposals/features within them.
As always, feel free to let us know if you have any comments or other feedback.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:53:07
Please clarify.

Refer to my reply.

Clarifying what each option means in as clear way as possible has been something we've been wanting to do for a while now but hadn't prioritized as it had not been explicitly requested by the community yet.
In addition to this, we feel that it's important to describe how re-using a bitcoin address impacts security and fungibility.
We'll see what we can put together in both of these regards.
Feel free to let us know if you have any additional feedback as that is the primary driver of change across all of our services.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:15:09


Great idea! We'll definitely look into our options and see what makes the most sense here.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:53:57
If there is a business that you see missing, don't hesitate to add it.
We do, however, prefer sources that come straight from the companies themselves rather than through a third party (regardless of how reputable they may be).
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:54:36
We have a number of submissions that we've put on hold due to conflicting sources. We're working to implement something to handle this.
The list is otherwise up to date with any submissions we've received.
We have had issues with submissions including implicit "proof" which has been a problem. We'll be putting something in place to make this more clear.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:22:01
1. Enter desired key prefix.
2. Enter public key of a private key (that is kept secret).
3. Merge secret private key with the private key provided by Coin Dance (once it has been generated) to produce your trustless vanity address.
More information: 
We do have a plan in place for making this process easier as we want to encourage not having to trust anyone.
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:12:56
As [mentioned previously]( (and as we've done since inception),  we only display the last network scan of each day.
Very seldom is this ever an issue but this past week has been an outlier.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:13:06
As correctly assumed, we do only count listening nodes.
We do, however, reduce these numbers further with our own set of filters with the goal of getting a better (but not perfect) picture of node ownership.
We'll definitely see what we can do about clarifying the first point as this question does get asked on occasion.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:16:16
Each submission was reviewed and companies who's support/opposition was ambiguous after the change were contacted and those adjustments have already been made.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:50:18
We expect the option to update/edit will be ready later this evening.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:28:29
Yes, our address generation server is a separate machine with dedicated hardware. This, in combination with some of our own custom software, is what allows us to generate keys very quickly.
We do also plan on increasing the total compute throughput of the system by 50% in 2017.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:53:29
1. The planned v2 refactor of the Nodes section covers this. We were not properly setup to track every different node implementation but this will be changing this year.
2. Both of your points will be addressed over the next week or so.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:13:24
This has now been updated. Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:52:15
Always appreciated!
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:09:58
Fixed, thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:24:00
That has always been the goal, although it can be challenging due to the always-shifting technical landscape.
If you have any specific suggestions, feel free to let us know any time.

We're now temporarily hiding a number of previously accepted submissions with conflicting sources while we sort it out.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:31:17
Over half of the SegWit-supporting companies listed all use that as a source reference.
If you see a company that is missing from the list feel free to add it as it, like most of our data, is 100% community-driven. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:22:33
We're going to see what can be done about conflicting sources as this seems to be a recurring theme for a couple of the larger entities.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:24:29
The discrepancy comes from the fact that you're only seeing v1.0.1.2 nodes in the screenshot.

We reached out to you on Twitter a few months back. We will be in touch.

This is currently part of our development backlog... we expect it to be ready sometime in the next few hours.
@_date: 2016-06-19 07:42:52
We've updated the global LB volume chart to display in either USD or BTC.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:33:57
This is currently on our development roadmap for early Q1 2017.

We take concerns of bias very seriously. Our goal is to simply provide access to information that the community deems critical for the growth of the ecosystem.
I'll try to address your concerns:


Any changes to 'wording' present on the site either comes from our team adding additional clarity where data is ambiguous or directly from the community (after having been reviewed for validity). If you do have a specific example of something that you feel should be re-worded or otherwise changed, please let us know.


The SegWit column had been removed while we upgrade that section with generic support for BIP 9 version bits (which is used for SegWit voting). ~~We expect this to be back in place within the next 24-48 hours~~ this has now been implemented.
We take feedback seriously as much of the community has come to rely on us for accurate, to-the-minute information on the current state of the bitcoin network, community, and ecosystem. If you have any concerns, please let us know via the feedback button.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:47:36
Part of the issue here is that the global USD volume is a day-by-day BTC-&gt;USD conversion (actual BTC values, converted to USD).
The problem with this approach is that Bitsquare transactions typically occur well above market rate on the fiat side.
We're considering our options to try to make this more clear.
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:59:55
References to individual implementations will be removed and each proposal will have its own dedicated section (with a support summary left unchanged at the top).
For example, references to 'Core' would be removed and dedicated sections for each actively voted-on proposal would take its place (both BIP 9 and non-BIP 9 compliant).
We'll be updating the Nodes section later this year to focus on the individual implementations, but that won't be a focus for us until this is done.
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:34:27
In general, 'support' means explicit support for the proposal. Companies that indicate that they support a proposal wish to have it activated and are likely also prepared for it to happen (although that is not always the case).
In general, 'ready' means that the company is prepared for the proposal to move ahead. This typically means that the company already has code running on their system that can handle the expected impact of the proposal in question.
It is possible to be ready for a proposal but not explicitly support it.
In general, most companies who wish for a proposal to move ahead AND are ready for it will mark themselves under 'support' for that proposal although this is still up to the company to make the distinction if they so choose to.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:04:20


We had originally linked to both, but the lack of responses on \r\bitcoin made it redundant.
We were hoping for some good discussion here as this is where a lot of bitcoiners go to discuss issues, but that didn't end up happening.


Why don't you read our post? This is exactly what we said we planned to do from the start.


Again, read our post which explains why we're changing this. It's the equivalent of claiming that SegWit (the set of BIPs) === Bitcoin Core (the poroject/implementation), which is incorrect.


We have a note to add additional clarification on this, but you can find an explanation in the comments below.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:09:02


Simply not true. Perhaps you can [confirm this for yourself]( Up until earlier this year, we were not recording more than one data point per day. We are now recording 15 minute snapshots and will be attempting to incorporate that change in with our nodes page overhaul sometime later this year.
Perhaps you missed the discussion that took place here: 


Although the numbers still fall well within our models, we do see a small deviation of about 60 nodes starting around March 18th which is of note. We've made a note to review it.


Although not a perfect solution, weighting is currently based on web traffic. Keep in mind that exchanges such as Bitfinex are not available in every country as they typically deal with fiat currency, which limits their reach. Weighting is automatically refreshed every two weeks. If you have any specific suggestions, let us know.


This section is completely community-driven. The only thing that we do is confirm that submissions are explicit. If you see something out of place, feel free to update it (with a proper reference) or flag it for review.
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:52:49
Perhaps additional clarification is needed.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to let us know.
We've made a note that this is still an issue.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:18:33
As explained below, weighting is currently based on global web traffic.
We realize that there are issues with this approach but believe that this is a good first step (note that we don't plan on making it the default view at this stage).


If you have suggestions for how to improve this or anything else, the team can be contacted via Reddit, Twitter, or through our on-site feedback form.
Please be aware though that we receive between 25 and 100 content &amp; feedback submissions each day which requires us to prioritize which sections get immediate attention and which have to be put on hold. This should become less of an issue over time as the team continues to grow well into 2017.
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:44:05
Refer to our previous comment.
Perhaps providing us with some context on this would be helpful.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:21:44
Definitely reach out to us if you have any questions about our process or suggestions for how we can improve it.
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:27:16
We posted to both r\btc *and* [r\bitcoin](
The suggestion you outline was what we had planned to do internally, but we wanted to first see if there was a better approach that the community thought made more sense.

We take concerns of bias very seriously. Our goal is to simply provide access to information that the community deems critical for the growth of the ecosystem.
Keep in mind that the site is not run by a single individual like you seem to assume and that almost all of the data presented is submitted by the community, not us.
If you have a problem with the data, let us know so we can review it and adjust as necessary rather than making extraordinary claims about intention ([as you have done in the past](
As always, feel free to let us know if you have any comments or specific feedback.
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:05:46
There's no ambiguity. We list support for BIP 148.
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:41:39
We're going to review our European numbers shortly to see what happened here. The [BTC values]( do look correct.
[edit] The volume numbers were processed correctly coming from LB, so we'll see if they have any insight as to how that ended up happening.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:42:32
Yep. We're actually working on implementing split key generation so trust is no longer required for users who choose to provide their own public key. 
We expect this to go live sometime in Q3 of this year. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:49:04
The nodes page is currently undergoing a number of changes that will include this as well.

The second green bar on the right is based on the hashrate over the last 144 blocks, which gives us the expected total when added to the actual for the period.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:28:04
We've added a projection marker, which is more accurate for telling whether or not lock in will occur for the period than a simple %.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:30:23
We've updated our tracker with a projection marker, which is going to be more accurate than using a simple %.

I'm just wondering/suspicious how many "companies" are basically skeletal webpages set-up or re-purposed to game this metric.
We had [answered this one a few comments down](
In short, it's difficult to know where to draw the line.
We typically discourage submitting projects especially if they're run by a single individual (these are often rejected).
The hard rule we do have however is a company submitting projects managed by that entity in addition to the company itself, resulting in the same group of people being counted more than once.
Oddities like this are usually flagged by the community and subsequently removed.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:01:36
It's a challenge for sure but we do think what we have now is a good start.
But due to it not being a perfect science (ie. not having direct access to each company's balance sheet &amp; revenue numbers) we agreed that it would be best to require it to be toggled on manually.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:41:34
Blocks marked as supporting BIP 91 are assumed to be in support of SegWit2x as that is part of the execution roadmap, which are shown in the Block Details.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:42:18
Can you clarify what you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:05:53
~~Should be corrected shortly...~~
[edit] Corrected.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:51:13
There were a number of data issues that arose today that ~~will be fixed later this evening~~ have now been fixed.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:50:47
Often times we'll receive multiple submissions for the same company &amp; proposal that conflict. It usually takes longer to process these or revert previous submissions.
We do our best to catch bad data / poor references but sometimes mistakes are made or companies change their mind, which is why we rarely accept references that don't contain explicit statements of support/opposition.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:30:37
We generally accept projects if they're large enough although where to draw the line is a bit subjective (hence why we added the option to view with weighting).
We do try to remove projects if they are run under a parent company as to not list support from the same people twice but this is an ongoing challenge.
Definitely let us know if you see anything that you think should be changed.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:35:33
We left un-weighted as the default because company weighting is difficult to perfect.
We do plan on adding an explanation to clarify how the weighting is done.
