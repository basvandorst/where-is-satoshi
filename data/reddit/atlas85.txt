I'm trolling with my upvote because it believe in Bitcoin and want the price to go up, but credit cards are my better for charge backs and fights with hosts.  It's like having a bouncer on your payroll and not bringing him with you to the party.

I told me friends three years ago, protip "buy Bitcoin" at $700.  Don't think theybdid, but they'll be kicking themselves soon if hey didn't.
@_date: 2017-01-23 04:26:43
This is entirely correct.  Viewing the quantity of Bitcoin produced as the only meaningful determinant of price is naive at best. The same rig will have 15% less production capacity after the change.  The price of Bitcoin will go up as a result.

I think this is a great concept, just haven't seen too many options for paying for goods, services etc... in a way that's different than traditional business models.
I want to break the current business model of minimums for content/payments so we can see more businesses get traction with news and other content for pennies.

Resurrecting this thread to highlight this article - 
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:58:41
I think there is still a way to avoid blockchain bloat.  Plus, aren't we already moving towards a system where there will be lots of commerce on bitcoin?
I keep seeing figures like "if only 10% of all commerce was conducted in bitcoin, X trillion would be bitcoin's percentage of the market".  If we're moving towards this as an ultimate goal, why are we scared of having tons of small transactions?

Agreed.  I want an exchange that can handle the volume!
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:54:47
Sure, check out the information on the right side of this subreddit. 
In addition, basic info:
1) bitcoin = virtual currency invented in 2009;
2) you can buy bitcoin to use as a currency or investment using an exchange such as coinbase.com (USA);
3) you can use bitcoin to buy goods or services listed here:  and elsewhere such as through gyft.com
4) teach yourself how to use different kinds of wallets before you start messing around with a ton of money on bitcoin (understand all the risks and rewards) :)
5) prof$t

Are there a lot of sites that rent apartments or weekly rentals using bitcoin?  I.e. when will air b-n-b accept bitcoin?

Too low.  I gave my friends a "beer" in .04 btc worth approximately $6 back a few months ago.  They're all now waiting until the BTC rises to millionaire levels.  You'll be waiting awhile given even a 10,000 % (100x) increase will leave with about $3000, which is a lot but not really that much in the grand scheme of things.

Is anyone else using this as an opportunity to buy more BTC? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:01:27
CampBX trades for significantly less than Coinbase for some reason, so this could be very good news for a second easy-to-use exchange!
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:46:04
A general question, do donations count as a realization event for tax purposes?  I.e. should I not be donating in bitcoins so I avoid taxation on capital gains?

It's generally recognized that the stock market does fantastically well in January. Hopefully this applies to bitcoin as well!

Hmm, very interesting.  I'm here in the states, and I'm doing my part to educate or debunk misconceptions.  
Is one of your points in explaining bitcoin that no one controls the price, quantity or supply of bitcoin?  I feel like it's deregulated nature must be innaposite to understandings of money where your president prints pesos like it's her job and artificially limits incoming FOREX.

You have the cost basis in the BTC of the FMV of the car.  My guess is that is $14,000.  The $12,600 is irrelevant since it's really a proxy for the bitcoins (around 12.6). 
So your cost basis in those 12.6 bitcoins would be $14,000.

There's an initial hold at BTC-e on withdrawls after you are a new registrant I believe.  However, once you deposit with them, you can trade right away, but you cannot withdraw right away.  It's been awhile since I first signed up, but I think this is the case.  Also, if you forget your pword and reset it, they put a hold on withdrawls for awhile.
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:57:24
Right?  It's seems like business models just don't account for the fact that volume can generate huge revenue as long as there is little overhead.  Just think of credit card signs in small shops that say minimum $5.  
I want to think up business models that say minimum $.05

There are two kinds of things you can buy:
1) in person
2) online
Both are listed here: 
Also, check out gyft since you can convert BTC to almost any merchant's money!
