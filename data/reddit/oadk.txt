People rave about alt coins all the time because they have low fees specifically because they don't have enough transactions to result in any fee pressure. The average person doesn't seem to be technical enough to understand whether a technology scales or not, they just look at the fees immediately in front of them and use that as a basis of whether something is good or not. Therefore lightning will have the benefit that technical people know it will scale into the future and the average person gets to obliviously enjoy low fees hopefully without needing to know about the future optimisations that need to be done.

As an Australian, I was confused to see you write 'OZ' and didn't understand it until your explanation. Generally we write it 'aussie', not least because we pronounce Z as 'zed'. The only time 'Oz' is used is to refer to the country, but in this usage you say it as as word instead of saying the letters, i.e. it should rhyme with the first syllable of lozenger.

You could run electrum inside docker using a base image of another distro that you trust. I wouldn't use any pre-built images specifically related to electrum for obvious reasons. I don't use Gentoo but I'm sure you could rig it up to be managed by the build system. Another option is to use Nix, because then you won't get any package conflicts, but that might take more time to get used to if you haven't tried it before.
Or just try a different client as you suggested. I personally like electrum enough that I would fix the problems on my own machine before switching client.

My preferred algorithm would be similar but only count transactions with some fee paid towards the block size increase. I would even go so far as to say I would like the mining transaction fee system changed so that the money of the current block can only take half of the fees from that block, the other half would go to the miner of the next block. This would mean no miner could fill the block with transactions to themselves. This would make the block size dependent on real transactions with fees paid in a way that is costly for miners to inflate.

Does this approach have a way of dealing with nodes being able to prove that they are full nodes but without contributing anything useful back to the network by choosing not to transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:48:42
The top comment exists because this approach uses the blockchain to prove that the data existed before a certain point in time by including a hash of it in the blockchain. It still can't prove that the data only existed after a certain point in time unless you can include a hash of the most recent block in the data itself but inseparable from the data (most easily conceptualised by requiring that your photo would need to include someone holding up a print out of the most recent block hash, but even that isn't sufficient proof as photos can be edited).
Your original idea fundamentally doesn't work as you suggest that hardware signing an image and timestamp is sufficient proof, but you don't take into account that hardware can be hacked as well. Your idea is really no different from the days when photos taken using film cameras came back with orange timestamps in the corner. You'll find most people didn't configure this properly after the batteries in the camera had died and so a lot of these dates are incorrect, I know some of my family's photos are like this.

The opening and closing of one channel per month is just an estimate of how active the settlement layer on the Bitcoin blockchain would be for the average user. It doesn't need to be "fixed" because it's still an obvious improvement over the current situation.
Lightning Network would allow 9 million people to send thousands of transactions every month and give them some flexibility in opening and closing channels. The current Bitcoin blockchain can only support *two* transactions every month for the same 9 million people. So Lightning Network doesn't need to be "fixed", it just doesn't give us infinite scaling either. We need to keep searching for more scaling solutions and have sensible debates about increasing the block size in the future.

If the two chains can be merge mined then you well be earning reward from both chains simultaneously. To attack one chain means you will be foregoing at least part of your income, so the attack isn't free.
The only scenario I can imagine this being a problem in is if the reward of one chain per unit of hashing per dwarves the other chain, meaning you could attack the low reward chain without worrying too much about the partial loss of income.

A lot of people seem to be questioning how more than 50% of the miners could shut down their operations. In order to make it clearer I will use hyperbole, but it gets the job done.
Imagine there were no capital costs involved in mining, similar to the days when people used their own CPU. Imagine that all miners run at incredibly slim profit margins. This would mean that the cost of electricity is virtually equal to the value of the bitcoins received through mining.
The block reward now halves, and for every bitcoin you receive you need to pay for two bitcoins with of electricity.
50% of the miners shut down their operations. This means the network has half hash rate and the revenue of the remaining half is back to normal, right?
Wrong. The difficulty takes around two weeks to adjust normally, but now it's going to take four weeks. But it gets worse, the remaining 50% are still spending two bitcoins in electricity to generate one bitcoin for the next four weeks. They're businesses, why would they want to donate money just to get the difficulty back to a realistic number? This is how it is possible for more than 50% of the miners could shut down operations, which could result in the next difficulty adjustment taking more than a month.
This argument isn't completely valid because capital costs of the hardware are a big proportion of the mining costs and miners run on sensible profit margins. But who has done research to find realistic numbers and estimate what the true impact might be?
Now the important debate is firstly whether the proposal addresses this issue sufficiently and secondly what negative consequences it may have.

What do you mean by "added"? Does it actually appear anywhere in the codebase? The only place I've ever seen it used is on a table of the units, I haven't seen it used once in practice.

A "fin" in memory of Hal Finney. Doesn't sound like a shortening of a term that is a million times larger (e.g. OP got confused by this in the title) and is a reference to someone who was critical to the development of Bitcoin in the same way that the unit "satoshi" is.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:48:13
Not trying to be rude, but through the usage of the term "bits" you've even managed to confuse yourself in the title due to the similarity between "bit" and "bitcoin". mBits would be a thousandth of a bit or a *billionth* of a bitcoin, so we're not exactly skipping that are we? It's not even able to be represented by current implementations.
Combined with the fact that bit is already a unit in computing, it is an absolutely terrible word to use for this unit. I have no problem with standardising micro bitcoin as the unit of transaction, but can we just call them anything else.
How about something like "fins" in memory of Hal Finney? I realise some have already suggested this for 10 satoshi or 0.1 micro bitcoins two years ago, but I haven't heard it once in practice, so let's just say 1 fin = 1 micro bitcoin.

I'm agreeing that using a unit equal to a millionth of a bitcoin is beneficial. I only take issue with calling it a "bit" because:

We already have FIBRE to relay transactions while minimising bandwidth, so I would have thought the main thing we need is a way to quickly communicate the exact contents of a block once it is found so that nodes can verify it.

It's the economic power that users hold that determines which chain is the real Bitcoin. Any miner can fork the network at any time, but it doesn't give them any guarantee that users will want to own the asset on that other side of the fork (see Bitcoin Gold, for example).
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:43:30
My understanding is that segwit is incompatible with ASICBOOST. This means that if a large proportion of the mining hash power is reliant on ASICBOOST in order to be profitable then they will have an economic incentive to oppose segwit which is a very beneficial protocol upgrade.
Generally, the rate at which miners can generate hashes should be completely independent from the protocol so that we don't get any perverse incentives like this. Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in the existing PoW algorithm that has caused this situation.

I don't think they're evil, they're just trying to maximise their profits. All businesses do this.
However, the important thing about Bitcoin is that the economic majority can decide what protocol they want to follow *including* the PoW algorithm. For this reason, if a miner wants to exploit this bug and oppose segwit, I don't have much sympathy for them if the economic majority decides to fix the bug in the PoW algorithm.

The real question is: do the people who own the hardware actually get the benefit of the 20-30% speedup or does AntPool pay an artificially lower rate to make it look like a regular pool? This would mean they're just skimming money off the top of the people mining in their pool. It would be exceptionally profitable as well considering pools would normally only make 1-2% from which you should also subtract whatever their costs are.
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:37:51
It's not just segwit, covert ASICBOOST is incompatible with many future upgrades that require block headers to be a certain way. Miners who implement that are restricting the ability for the Bitcoin protocol to be upgraded in the future. They should be entirely unsurprised that some people want this fixed, they were simply taking a gamble that they could block any fixes.
Also ASICBOOST is patented, and it appears that any miners using it right now are doing it without having paid for the rights to do so.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:13:33
That's correct if multiple companies are using ASICBOOST and competing with each other. However, if it's just a single company or a cartel doing it then there's nothing stopping them from being near 100% of the hash power and just keeping the difficulty at a level where it is unprofitable for miners who don't use ASICBOOST.
It's worth mentioning that this technique is patented and so far hasn't been licensed, so it limits usage to miners who are willing to break the law or who exist in jurisdictions where the patents don't apply or are unenforceable.
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:27:12
Eventually, one miner creates a single segwit block. All miners then need to decide whether to mine on top of this segwit block or not. If they think that the economic majority will follow the segwit chain then they are probably better off mining on top of that segwit block.

If you look at the "previous block" you'll see that blockchain.info received it 7 seconds after the block from F2Pool (i.e. out of order). That means that, by chance, the block was mined almost immediately after it's predecessor.
It's reasonably normal for these blocks to be empty because there may not be any transactions left to process or it simply may take a bit of time for the miners to figure out which transactions to include next. They don't just stop mining and wait until they've got this all sorted out because it means they would miss out on the 12.5 bitcoin block reward if they get lucky like F2Pool did here.

The second layer isn't independent of the base layer, in fact it only delays the point at which the transactions make it onto the base layer.

Actually the Australian government doesn't directly control the actions of the Reserve Bank of Australia which is the organisation responsible for setting interest rates which is what really controls the monetary supply.

Segwit fixes transaction malleability. This means it won't be possible to tamper with someone's transaction in a way that results in a different transaction ID.

The sha256 part is there. It fully explains the abstraction that you hash some input and to get a seemingly random value out. That's all you need to understand a Bitcoin. The mathematics behind the hash function are much too complicated for a comic. You can find a version of how the hash works on [this Wikipedia page]( but that doesn't cover why it's secure. I don't think there is such a thing as proof that it can't be reversed, the only thing we can do is say "the best known attack compromises x of y rounds". These attacks are entire academic papers which again don't fit on a webcomic.
The end result is if you're not willing to trust that sha2 variants are hash functions with no known practical attacks on its collision or pre-image resistance, then there's no way you can securely use the internet as TLS is dependent on them.

I'm sort of with you here, I don't think OP has justified why Schnorr signatures would affect spam. My own possible justification would go like this:
Users who are willing to pay current market rates to include multiple inputs in their transactions will be given a way to reduce the number of bytes required for their transactions. They will benefit from cheaper transactions, but assuming their transactions still provide the same utility they probably won't expect their transactions to maintain the same fee per byte, therefore it's reasonable to assume they will be paying slightly more per byte than before. More transactions that were previously borderline viable would now have sufficient fees per byte to make it into the blocks, increasing the number of legitimate transactions.
However, this has nothing to do with the cost of filling up the rest of the block with spam. Since the viable legitimate transactions now require less space, it's quite possible that there isn't much competition for the remaining space and it would be cheaper to fill a greater proportion of the block with spam.
This would mean the important part about Schnorr signatures helping with the problem of spam is due to making more legitimate transactions viable rather than making it expensive to create spam transactions.

1) It takes a lot of in depth knowledge about how the Bitcoin protocol currently works, what its shortcomings are, understanding of modern research in other areas of computer science and good programming skills to be able to implement this sort of thing. Miners are overwhelmingly not that involved in the technical side of Bitcoin. They're good at acquiring necessary funds to purchase mining hardware, renting or building large facilities to house these and negotiating cheap electricity to give them a competitive advantage over other miners. It's a completely different set of skills. This is why it's strange to see people listening to miners over the core devs when it comes to the scaling debate which should be a technical debate (but unfortunately has turned political).
2) FIBRE Network will decrease centralisation as it allows smaller nodes to receive large blocks more quickly and makes them less likely to mine on top of other blocks before (or without ever) verifying that the block is valid.

No, we should probably just skip straight to uBTC already otherwise we could just have the same problem again in a few years. Dogecoin has demonstrated that people are perfectly happy using large numbers for transactions (it's fun, it makes you sounds richer than you actually are).

Interesting, I'll have to go read how it's done with lightning network and fill both gaps in my knowledge at once.
