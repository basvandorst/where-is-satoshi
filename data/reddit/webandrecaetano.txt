NICE QUESTION
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:33:36
Where's The other 667 forks ?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:35:43
I did not see it on CORE
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:36:11
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:30:58
we're all bots.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:31:54
This used to be a "HODL" sub
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:30:00
Just the  fork
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:37:07


BIP 216 ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:25:20
Because... the code is open!?!
Anyone can see if there's a malicious piece code.
Anyone can see the parts were changes by fork comparisons . 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:05:12
violencequalsbad: because the "hashpower is the law"
right? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:49:43
Miners will sabotage bitcoin because greediness. 
They might pay the price later when it collapses  
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:45:23
A expensive mechanism. 
We're already paying half million dollars per day in fees.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:36:10
Ripple is very nice alt-coin. 
But it right now is indeed a bubble. It raised nuts in last days.  
But his liquidation is very low. (average 10 mil per day)
Anyone that sell a small amount of millions there would throw the price down
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:26:50
agree. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:24:31
under a place supposed to be tax heaven 
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:37:06
Oh, you are using a wallet that does not allow using unconfirmed founds. 
That's sucks.
Consider change your wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:53:08
Right? Anything that have value less than 50 bucks ... will have at least 2% fee on it.

expedia only does hotels.
And not every hotel.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:24:46
"help reduce".... -.- 
It's only this price because people are buying in this price.
Get over it.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:16:56

I have interest in start a fullnode for signaling UASF.
Someone said to do not create more full nodes, because is easier to change the percentage by changing the existing ones.  
I'm confused 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:12:17
get out
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:17:55
Good point Paul. 
But back here in the real world, less then 0.1% of the places accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:41:35
Nice game btw.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:22:52
they will get. And we dont. :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:44:11
why they keep doing it? Stahp 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:01:42
we're fucked

How about business that sell multiple low cost products? 
At this point they should be thinking in quit
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:56:31
Can we stop to talk about BCC here? 
It does not matter at all
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:14:49
Consider change your wallet.
Blockchain.info use hard tx fee at 120 sat/byte. 
You can use the CPFP (child pay for parents) method.
Is basically move the funds again with higher fee.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:52:31
Bip 148 is not a mining/hashrate btw. UASF =/= MASF
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:52:37
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:55:08
Nice idea.... gona copy that
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:00:01
who made this don't understand segwit.
Recommend delete it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:55:28
let coinbase keep the new coins, 'right'?
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:18:59
Core don't want do that for a good reason. 
It have more political value this way.
I agree with them.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:45:59
It have 2 outputs.
One is probably youself.
Just spent the rest with higher fee 
It's called CPFP (Child pay for parents)
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:17:54
I did not removed the credits. 
Still on bottom left.
