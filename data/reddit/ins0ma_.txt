India has been a democracy since 1947, and somehow that hasn't resulted in much "spreading of wealth." India is also, as OP described, very much a connected country, where even the very poor have access to the internet via cheap cellular plans.

Cashing out means you're liable for tax, either income or capital gains, depending on how long you've held. For people wanting to reduce their tax burden, cashing out before filing would seem to make little sense.

It’s smart to invest in anything, as opposed to spending what money you do have on consumables. You’ll learn something from the experience, and you might even profit if you can stay in for some time. 
What else do you plan to spend your cash on? You’re at a great age to start doing stuff like this, go for it. Later in life when you have real bills to deal with it’ll be much harder to take chances.

Interesting that he said Coinbase will be adding more currencies to the platform in '18. If there was a way to know which ones ahead of time it'd be really advantageous, as there's a good chance that millions of people will immediately buy whatever shiny new thing is offered on the existing platform.

With Coinbase (CB), if you deposit money via a bank account you can avoid paying fees. The catch is that it takes a few days. 
Example: I deposited $ to CB from  my bank, waited 3-4 days, and it appeared in my “USD Wallet.” No fee. Transferred to GDAX (no fee), bought BTC, then transferred out of GDAX back to my CB wallet (no fee).  Several days earlier I made a purchase for the same amount using the instant credit/debit card option on CB and paid a nearly 5% fee. 
Days like this, when some currencies aren’t moving a whole lot but you still feel the itch to buy something, are a good time to load some funds into your USD Wallet so they’re available the next time opportunity knocks.

Wikileaks and Assange conspired with Roger Stone and God knows who else in the Trump orbit to help Russia subvert democratic norms in the US, and was involved in the disinformation campaign that led to the current state of affairs in American politics.
Assange, wittingly or not, has been acting as an agent of Russian intelligence services, and now that he's overstayed his welcome in the embassy, will be punished accordingly.

Trump lost the popular vote by around 3 million. There were a lot of shady people and circumstances surrounding Trump, and many people in his direct orbit have pled guilty to a variety of charges, and there are multiple investigations still ongoing.

"Special counsel Robert Mueller explicitly stated in his Russia investigation report that he and his team had **not cleared President Donald Trump of accusations of obstruction of justice**. 
"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state," the report read. "However, **we are unable to reach that judgment**. The evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
The special counsel found that Trump was mostly unsuccessful in influencing the investigation — but only because key aides and advisers stopped him or refused to carry out his orders. 
Mueller's team declined to make a "traditional prosecutorial judgment" about whether Trump obstructed justice, citing **current DOJ guidelines** that say a sitting president cannot be indicted. Apart from that, they also said a criminal accusation against a sitting president could impede his ability to govern, and that **they did not want to get ahead of "constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.**" 
Ultimately, Mueller's team found that "**while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him**."
