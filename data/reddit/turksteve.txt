The only long term solution is a good support structure.
start here 
move your bitcoin to an insured vault like  Explain your situation and give them written instruction not to release your bitcoin unless  X &amp; Y conditions are met

if it weren't for gambling sites....would Bitcoin be where it is today?
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:50:34
that's ridiculous, what incentive is there ?
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:24:11
much better idea 
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:16:41
well put

discounting stock based on payment method is only for people accepting cash and dodging tax. 
i would support merchants giving rebates when receiving payment via btc, in $ £ or whatever currency value therefore putting more emphasis on the "payment system" component of the Bitcoin technology....

hi Baron1703
i am not sure i understand the logic for down-voting. Maybe you didn't have all the information before taking action to down vote.
You can review the whole treasure hunt on the bitcoin talk thread.
I really do not think the terms and conditions are unfair or misleading. We have put in quite a bit of effort to be different with our marketing and to provide added value for NaSCasino members but also the general bitcoin community as we are against blast marketing and spamming. I really feel we have created an engaging game which may also teach a few people something new :)
Anybody is free to participate and do not have to be members of NaSCasino to do so. You only have to be a member of NaSCasino to CLAIM the 1BTC that is locked in the vault on the Isle of Man. 
Should the person that figures out the puzzle first not want to claim the prize themselves they can find someone on bitcointalk that would be willing to claim it on their behalf, increasing community involvement. 
I also don't think the amount is much, but welcome comments. (To  clariy, Treasure Hunters can only claim the prize if they have made a minimum of 0.001btc deposit and wagered a minimum of 0.000001btc (you can instantly withdraw the balance again)).
I hope you will reconsider your opinion and maybe even join in the treasure hunt. (we have tried to make it really interesting so no answers or clues have been found :).......YET
