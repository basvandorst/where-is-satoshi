So at this point, who is still paying 250+/byte!? At time of writing, there's over 2000 transactions paying this.

Weight is defined as:
* non-segwit: 4 * tx size
* segwit: (tx size without witness data) * 3 + (tx size)

Just re-installed it and found the location to do this and indeed it does. Thanks.

This seems very suspicious to me, though perhaps I'm misreading this:












So you must **have** reused an address in a certain time-frame to get the coins, which I read as, we need to know your public key to get your coins. That sounds very suspicious.

Half the problem with so many exchanges and prices, now also at all time highs on Bitfinex too at 17500, but not too hyped yet because my Aussie exchange is still well below its 25.5k AUD high

I would guess that with little to no hashing power, it could be several hours before the first 2x block is found.

Depends on who owns the private key to the bitcoin cash address. If it's you, or someone you know, or they're a business, then you have a chance of recovery. If it's some unknown, then no.

No, or at least I haven't been able to. As soon as you click on withdraw, it always redirects to verification.

OK cool, I found that option, so that at least gets me part way there as I can import one public key at a time. No way to import an MPK (xpub) though by the looks of it.

Looking at  30/byte should get you in pretty next block or two.
That would be roughly (30 * 250 * $8000) / 100000000 = $0.60.

excellent, glad i could help. :)

If prices stay as they are, and no amount to hash power added to BCH can decrease block times from 10 minutes (due to the new DAA), aren't miners then losing money by continuing to mine BCH. Surely they'd only do that for so long before coming back to BTC.

So your friend tried to send you Bitcoin (BTC), and you gave him a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) address. So now it's not showing in your BCH wallet.
What you need to do is get your private key from your BCH wallet, find a BTC wallet you trust and import that private key. That will give you access to spend the BTC your friend sent you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:23:35
What I was thinking was that, according to fork.lol, BTC is due for a ~12% difficulty reduction late next week.
This might entice some miners back on to BTC from BCH whilst it's easier to mine, whilst BCHs DAA does it's thing with the loss of hash power.
This may lead to quicker BTC difficulty adjustment to the upside, and those miners might then choose to leave BTC to go back to BCH leaving BTC with a higher than expected difficulty and slower block times. Until of course, the next difficulty adjustment and we start again.
I guess over a long enough period the swings will reduce, and maybe the swings aren't even too bad to begin with, but I was just curious as to how it might play out.

Some miners threatened to carry out the fork anyway. It makes sense for CoinBase to make sure there are no problems. With only a few miners, it could be a while before 494784 is mined on the 2x chain if at all.

A quick Google around suggests that the Litecoin/Bitcoin public/private key setup is the same (Litecoin was taken from the Bitcoin source I think). So it you own the private key for the Litecoin address you sent to, you really own the private key to the Bitcoin address too, so you should be able to recover the coins.

$9600 crossed now on Bitfinex :)

Bitcoin cash and bitcoin addresses are the same, controlled by the same private key. Get your private key from your bitcoin cash wallet and import it into a bitcoin wallet, your funds will be there.

Glad I'm not the only one, I read it exactly the same and was expecting "change" from the fee. Oh well, only used it once as a tester to see what they were like. Will try to stick to purchases which go straight to my own wallet from now on.

Also a user of bitcoin.com.au, longest i had to wait to see the transaction to hit the mempool was an hour. They email you all the details so you know where you're at.
