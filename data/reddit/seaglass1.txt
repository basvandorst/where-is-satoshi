I think Antonopoulos answer is a bit "glib". 1st, I think he's wrong on the cost at the moment, based on what the current network hash rate is compared to the state-of-the-art mining rigs cost/hash. 2nd - how rapidly could the network respond to the double-spend? What I think we would see is a new longer chain which includes one transaction vs. a different one. Only hours/days later does it turn out that this second transaction was a double-spend. But perhaps I'm wrong about how obvious this would be. 
Still, I don't see a government as HoB - on that I agree completely with Andreas.

Well, I'm a fan of evolution. When I look at Bitcoin I'm unconvinced that it has met the "fitness test" yet. 
Personally I think Mr. Schwartz's critiques of Bitcoin from 2011 are still cogent:
* The mining algorithm is only computation hard. It is not memory hard or decision hard.
* Anonymity is limited by the inability to publish a receiving address without revealing how many coins are transferred to that address.
* There is no good way to prune the block chain.
* There is no good way to reverse a transaction or indicate acceptance of a transaction.
* Transaction fees are not predictable long-term.
* Mining pools have centralized the decision of which transactions to include and which chain to work on, defeating some of the protection diversified mining was supposed to provide.
* There is no way to recover lost coins.
* There is no good way to manage the currency if that turns out to be needed. For example, the block payout algorithm is all but fixed in stone but may make no sense in a decade.
* There is no good way to pull coins out of the block chain such that they can be put back in.
* A 51% attack can revert as much of the chain as desired, up to the last checkpoint.

I've read Gavin's possible strategy for dealing with it. A) Seems pretty darn fundamental as a change to be a "soft fork", though he knows the code and I don't. B) If it is a better solution than current, why not make the change now? I suppose the theory is: the 51% attack is just too unlikely to make it worth changing the system. He's willing to make that bet. I'm less sure.
