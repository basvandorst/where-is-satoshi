Actually by blocking their user the "I was able to access your website yesterday but it's blocked now, how will I get my bitcoins?" is exactly what they are looking for ! Do you realize how contradictory  your statement is ? It seen you want to give huge bold lessons but you arn't able to see your own absurdity.

Coinbase is aware about Mike's plan to short sell the shit out of the coins with their bankers friend and their infinit amount of fiat.
They are preparing for the fat finger when the CNY exchanges are going to sell lower that the USD one by keeping the price low.

How they lose money ? If the losing chain hashing power decrease the difficulty will adjuste and remaining miners will have more chance to find blocks. So they will make more coins. Their profit depend only the price they are selling the coins.

What they have told ? 
"We have not been officially notified of the reason for this action, which we view as unjustified. "
Bullshits anyway if they know something valuable they will keep it for them. But but but there are no smoke without fire.

Or maybe that juste the plan of his bankers friends for dump the price because they want to short sell the shit out of the coins with their infinit amount of fiat. In this case this is just the begining and we will see a price lower than $150.
Coinbase is aware about that and keep the price low. They are ready for the fat finger when the CNY exchanges are going to sell lower that the USD one.
