Guy is hilarious. I've used his peeing in public tactics on multiple occasions.

Awesome. Isn't Bald Bryan into sports betting? We should encourage him to bet with bitcoin.

I think a lot of people play fantasy sports because it approximates sports betting. I've convinced multiple friends to try bitcoin sports betting and they've all become hooked--friends who never used to bet on sports but who now have multiple bets going every single day, even if they're just small bets to make things entertaining.
But the low transaction costs could completely revolutionize our current gambling culture. Think about how businesses do promotions tied to outcomes--like if Taco Bell said that everyone in the stadium gets a free taco if the Broncos score 3 touchdowns in the first half, or something. A business could place and distribute hundreds or thousands of promotional micro-bets and print them on coupons or ticket stubs (in theory). 
For example, UConn was 120-1 to win the NCAA tournament. Essentially, someone could've handed out promo materials or something with a private key printed on each one for a 50 cent bet: "Good for dinner for two at Joe's Diner if UConn wins the NCAA Tourney." 
That's 1000 pieces of media printed up for a total of $500 wagered. Possibly worth the publicity by itself, but the best part is that the cost of fulfilling the obligation would take care of itself...since every piece of media went from being worth $.50 to $60. 
Lots of problems to iron out, but it's crazy to think about.

Made me remember listening to this [song]( back in high school. Good tune.

Here's a [link]( to their menus. It's a great spot.

Yeah we set up our online store with Big Cartel and they don't have a way to integrate with Bitpay (which we use in the shop) with their system--we'll probably re-do the online shop with a retail friendly Wordpress theme.
So far, zero bitcoin customers!

For starters, the Grill at Henry's uptown. I think he's close. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:01:24
No shit. Have an upvote.

Love it. I'm close to getting a few other New Orleans businesses to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:00:09
I'll ship up there. Just temporarily cancelled my international shipping in a moment of panic after someone ordered something from Norway... until I can figure out how to calculate it better. 
Thanks for checking out the shop! The cutting boards and rollers are gorgeous.

Good lord Austan Goolsbee is insufferable. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:27:06
Oh yeah! 
Well we're happy to take second. Thanks!

bitbook is back up.

Thanks, guy.

NYT's scathing critique of bitcoin: the evil twins from that Facebook movie own some of them.

Just opened a small retail store and have been reluctant to put the Bitcoin sticker on the window just yet. 
Timing was definitely a concern for me but I did a test purchase with Bitpay and it was pretty much instant. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:38:53
Awesome! Just saw that. 
They're beautiful but definitely don't put it in the dishwasher. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:54:45
I'm not sure but I'd imagine they accept it for both food and drinks.

Just added it to Coinmap. 
It's called [Homestead]( Sort of a modern take on a general store... some clothing, some home goods, decor, and accessories. Just opened about a week ago and am in the process of expanding our inventory. 
Did I just become the first retail shop in New Orleans to accept bitcoin? I think I did. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:37:17
Yep. And it seriously is comical. 
Like, someone just purchased a cutting board from a small New Orleans retail shop all the way from Norway... Amazing.

Whoa I just realized Bit365 is down too.

Just came here to post this. Absolutely lazy writing. 


How do you write a sentence like that? Like, even if your argument is that bitcoin is a fraud or whatever, you still kinda have to admit that it is in fact an alternative currency. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:39:31
Thanks for the kind words. 
I love your neon signs. That might have to be the next step...

I can't wrap my head around this claim. Discuss.
