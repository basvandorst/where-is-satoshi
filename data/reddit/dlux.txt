They just misunderstood you. Then got angry.
@_date: 2015-12-25 08:21:02
Sorry but this sounds like covert advertising. Or maybe you're just hoping your investment will increase? Monero's 5m cap is pretty damning at this stage ...
@_date: 2015-12-07 06:26:49
But there's no cancellation or refund with btc.
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:23:25
Source? Reasoning? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:12:28
Seconded. Nicely said.
@_date: 2015-12-25 08:14:01
Nice argument.

In this thread, we witness the development of a paranoia, followed by the introduction of the confrontation, followed in turn by the successful resolution of said paranoia. Please now turn to page 6.

Wait, do you literally ride a horse around?
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:10:56
Shareholder appeasement?

Presumably she is a real person. And presumably she is working to help solve a real (pr) problem of bitcoin's.

Does beginning a response "Whatever" constitute "politely-framed"? This is a politely-framed, substantive question.
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:50:46
This ...
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:11:45
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:24:48
Right then. Let's all leave now.
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:47:02
I agree completely. Nicely said.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:55:22
Good read - thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-07 06:19:34
Another way of looking at it: with DISapproval, bitcoin needs a hell of a lot more time.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:55:26
I agree.
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:41:29
Great -- thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:51:49
Well, they were two different articles. With opposing viewpoints. You're surprised that opinions on the two articles may vary?
@_date: 2015-12-31 08:20:42
Burdened with addressing their constituents in an intelligible manner? ... This isn't some private game they're engaged in.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:27:19
Upvoting this politely framed, substantive question. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 08:50:53
"I think there's this false urgency about a potential flood of pent up economic activity that would be released if only we would increase the blocksize to 8 MB. There isn't."
How can you deny a potentiality?
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:57:54
Thanks! The very fact that the question alone was downvoted may say something ... Hold fast!
@_date: 2015-12-08 05:45:31
Sorry I don't understand. Please clarify.

All I'm saying is there's a difference between 5 and 50 years. -meremortal

I guess you'd have to choose your transaction carefully.

They're like kids playing with their toy trucks. Someday they may learn to drive, but just not right now.

@_date: 2016-01-07 07:50:23
Congrats to Gem! They've been doing some pretty amazing work in the space ...
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:59:29
Can you please explain why? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:44:50
A good question to ask yourself is, Why?
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:52:48
You're the CEO? ...
@_date: 2016-01-05 10:29:08
Woot woot! Nicely done.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:45:53
That's the spirit. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:33:48
I don't know if he has quite that agenda, but he certainly has an agenda, and he's pushing it forward in a way that is directly antithetical to the principles and values that have always underlied Bitcoin. It is dangerous. It has already damaged Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:02:53
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:28:30
Long overdue.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:05:07
Can you explain why? Thx

I think some people just can't bring themselves to challenge authority.

Big upvote for wiki-bit idea.
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:33:16
Is it a matter of attacking bitcoin, or of providing protection to the banks? Yes they result in the same thing, but govts are not just surreptitiously attacking bitcoin to attack bitcoin, they're attacking bitcoin to strengthen the hold of the beneficiaries of a monetary policy that they -- the governments -- can control. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 07:13:00
You rock.
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:49:14
iw a lot - thanks for info.
