The putative increase in suicide rates during the winter months is a commonly held misconception. Just throwing this nugget of knowledge out there.

Don't forget silver in May 2011! (I made and then lost 10K in short-term call options!). [Ouch](
And the archetypal example of tulips in Holland! ~1637

...and you should follow every law because it is the law and the people who make the laws know what is best for you and me (there is never a moral/ethical justification for civil disobedience...particularly economic civil disobedience). I mean investing in the "regulated legal securities" markets has worked out so well for the average retail investor over the past couple of decades. No risk there as long as we keep bailing out (and now even bailing in!) our corporate banking overlords who know what is best for all of us (I have a good feeling about these shares of Enron that I have been long on for the past 15 years!). Why would you ever want to invest in some sort of alternate vehicle that is not backed by a (bankrupt/debt-laden) central/government banking authority? They would never deem something illegal because it threatens the status quo. They are just trying to protect us from the evil that is digital currencies (I heard that you could even use btc to buy drugs, guns and prostitutes...no other means of exchange would ever allow you to do that. I tried to slip a single into a stripper's g-string the other night and she said that she only accepted unregulated illegal internet securities!)
