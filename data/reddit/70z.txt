There's no such thing as a "closed bitcoin address".  If the person no longer has access to the private keys of that address, then they can no longer access the funds.  But there's no way to prove that to Coinbase, so there's nothing you can do.

Yes, Bitcoin is not mainstream yet, and that's what makes it exciting.  People invest because they believe it will (i.e., to the moon).
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:00:00
I had a similar idea a few months ago: 
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:41:56
How do you get a fiat user to spend money at a particular online store?  By offering quality service, an easy to use website, low prices, good refund/return services, good customer support, have good feedback/reputation, etc, etc...
If you have all of the above, then throw bitcoin into the mix, you will have good bitcoin sales. 
E-commerce is *highly* competetive.  It doesn't matter what kind of bitcoin incentives you have.  To be successful, you need to be better than the rest.

@_date: 2015-02-16 03:52:42
The real answer is that there aren't very many choices for people who trade altcoins.  There are some altcoins that are ONLY traded on Bter, for example.  
A better question is:  When will people stop trading shitcoins/scamcoins?

Thanks.  I'll suck your dick again tomorrow night.
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:01:19
Because you guys don't pay money that you contractually owe people.  Why is Xapo so deceptive, greedy, and dishonest?  I mean, setting personal issues aside, just look at what happened with that whole credit card fee debacle.  Talk about shady!
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:09:00

@_date: 2015-02-02 14:52:12
I'm so confused.  Wouldn't this only work for people and merchants who re-use the same addresses?  The vast majority of people don't do that, and certainly won't in the future.  Seems like a terrible waste of money to me.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:27:27
Pardon me, I didn't mean you *personally* owe me money. Xapo does.  However, as a representative of Xapo, you personally declined payment that Xapo contractually owes me. I have already contacted you directly regarding this matter to no avail.
When I read that the author of Sarutobi is doing business with Xapo, I felt the moral obligation to warn him, and others, that Xapo is conducting dishonest business. Most people here know that already (just read this thread or search the word Xapo), but the newcomers deserve to be warned.  
This is a public forum, and I believe in freedom of speech.  The founder of Xapo comes from a country where libel is crime, but such nonsense does not apply to most of us here.
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:48:19
Nobody is going to buy something they don't want.  You're focusing on the wrong idea here.
If a bitcoiner is in the market for soccer shirts, yes there is a likelihood that they will pick a store that accepts bitcoin.  Maybe they were an early adopter and got their coins dirt cheap.  Or maybe they bought at $215 and it's now worth $230.  For obvious reasons, they would rather spend their bitcoin than use a credit card.  Hell, maybe they bought at $600, but they want to support the bitcoin community by spending their coins.  
If store A and B accept bitcoin, but store B offers a 5% discount, they are going to buy from store B.
Now lets say someone who has never heard of bitcoin is in the market for soccer shirts, and they come across this store.  Before they buy, there's a good chance they are going to shop around.  Maybe they check out 5 other online shops that sell the same products, for around the same price.  THAT is they type of customer that business owners can reel in by offering a bitcoin discount.  The buyer may be inclined to buy bitcoin in order to spend it at that store.  Store owners save money by avoiding credit card fees, so they can afford to offer a small discount.  
In both examples above, the business owner has the potential to win over customers that could have easily purchased from one of their competitors.
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:28:15
What's in it for them to return the coins?  Absolutely nothing.

They could send the BTC to a different address that you don't control.
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:45:38
Yes, but if you have tracking info and require a signature, you would win the dispute and get the BTC.

See you're missing the point.  It's not about the money, it's the principle.  I already reached out to Xapo in a respectful manner, and you refused payment.  Why?  Because it was only a few bucks.  
Of course you guys are going to offer to pay me now.  This is a public forum and you don't want to look bad.  But this is what it took for you guys to finally offer to pay me.
Why don't you keep the money, and instead, promise to start conducting business in a respectable manner, treating everyone equally.

To maintain anonymity I can't give details, but he made a lot of empty promises and he owes me BTC.  
The only reason Xapo still exists is because of heavy capital funding and aggressive, false marketing.

Your call.  I just cant wait to see that broccoli shaped penis of yours again.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:27:06
Already emailed Fernando.  You know what his response was?  "Oh, you haven't earned that much, and it's a hassle for us to process such small payments."
If you had competent software developers, the payment process would be automated, and there would be zero hassle.
I'd rather slander Xapo than waste time attempting to get my few dollars worth of bitcoin from you guys.  I've moved on to better companies that keep their promise.
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:14:00
You may personally not have had any issues, but others have.  They have a capitalistic mentality that I personally do not think is healthy for the Bitcoin community.  It is great that you are giving people a choice.

Yes I think bitmarket is a good place to start.  Also try the marketplace at bitcointalk.org.
Here's how escrow works.  The buyer sends BTC to the escrow website.  Then you send the gift card to the buyer. Once the buyer receives the gift card, they notify the escrow site, then funds are released to you.
