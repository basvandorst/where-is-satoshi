Too expensive for their look, much better girls you can get in Eastern Europe for tenth the price, but definitely its the great step for Bitcoin. Acceptance by sex business will open us market larger than drugs, and probably more socially accepted after all.

No, actually its quite perfect. The very idea of bitcoin is to have money system which doesn't need any kind of trust, any kind of laws. In the first step we need to sidestep laws, in the second step - completly abolish them, to find economic freedom.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:28:57
Well, I am sure your tax office is happy when every sheep thinks that way. 
But cryptos give us unique occasion to abolish tax system. And to leave goverment without monies. As the guy from Ukraine I can attest that poor goverments are better than wealthy goverments. On Ukraine there are almost no photo-radars on roads, speeding is fun. In Russia fun is no more, wealth brings more oppression.

I am curious what chinese black market thinks about bitcoins? Do they even know this exist?
On Ukraine most guys in that business don't even understand what bitcoin are - and even that we have a strong and healthy black market, nobody uses anything else than cash there.
I think bitcoin community should start with ad campaign adressed towards movers and shakers of the underworld. These guys, even if quite simple, know where business is.

I never sold under buying price. Remember when btc went from 250 to 120 and everyone shouted PANIC PANIC SELL EVERYTHING INCLUDING CHILDREN AND WIFE. I bough then few bitcoins  
Everyone today would be happy to buy 
The same will be with  price. Everyone would cry how cheap it was.
The problem is I have a normal job and invest money I can lose without pain - while the lot of day traders have no job and invested a lot. For them PANIC is real. They sell like there's no future, because they have no future, losing everything.

They should look to scale their business internationally. I would happily pay premium price for high quality weed, in my country we smoke shit usually.

Become a local dealer for coins. BTC needs more cash-coin personal exchanges.
In the good old soviet days people in my country (and probably in the whole eastern block) did that with dollars, deutschmarks, suiss francs. Nobody was allowed to hold capitalistic currencies, and the black market was thriving.
In these times I am afraid people love too much being fucked in the collective assess by goverments, and this brings all this panic after some sucker declare bitcoin "illegal".
OMG, illegal... deal with it. Cocaine is illegal too, yet it is a hell of the drug. Like bitcoin is a hell of the currency. Have fun, fear not.

Only with state-gang. My uncle has spent few years in a prison for listening to Radio Svoboda in good old Soviet times. You know, we people of East Europe don't believe so much in law or our goverments, like people of West. We just see rulers more clearly and don't have much hope for anything better from them.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:14:51
Well, the state-gang doesn't like competition. You can use all these nice words about "legality", but essentially its all legal only because the state has guns. 
From my point of view, alternative gangs provide a lot of useful services, denied to the citizens by the ruling gang. Money spend on drugs aren't spend on state-approved and state-taxed vodka. Money spend on whores aren't spend on state-approved wives. Its all about high-ranking suits controlling the choices of citizens. Law is their weapon. Its cheaper than guns, but without the threat of guns - its worthless.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:20:19
We shouldn't use the term "seized". They were just stolen. People who handle stolen goods are real criminals. The bitcoin community should just ban stolen coins, deny doing any transactions with their holders.

If you earn nice money, have stable financial situation, and like porn, why be sordid and regret few dollars for your favourite porn publisher? Its not like spending these money will make me poor - by paying I just show support to the professional porn vendors.
And I really don't like free amateur porn. I have amateur sex in my own life. What is the point of watching on the monitor things I can get in almost any time? But contemporary porn with movies like anal acrobats - this is definitely out of my real reach, so I am glad to pay people, who do such awesome things for mine enjoyment.

You know, there are millions of people using illegal drugs and buying illegal sex completly outside of the approved legal methods, with the risk of jail. 
These people are quite average. Not exactly your typical high IQ geeks. Yet they do what they like.
Similiarly its with movie piracy. Even my mother knows the internets are for the free movies, and while she can't get them herself, she has her children to do torrenting for her. We burn them on DVDs and mother is happy. You know, quite normal lady is my mother, not some geeky type.
Average people aren't against black markets.

Bitcoin has already filled this void, also this is most important application for coins. Stupid little things you can always buy for fiat money, often in better quality than things on coin market.

I don't understand why people are so afraid of banned things. I live in country with a strong, healthy black market. I remember times when US dollar was banned, yet almost everyone had some USD, nobody panicked "oh no Soviet Goverment has banned US dollars, sell sell panic!"

So this treatment isn't free, its paid from the money forcefully taken from the people not interested in such schemas. 
Don't be so sure it will remain in that way. Free-as-in-beer social services have one thing common: terrible ineffectiveness in management of resources.

Gold is unique in its properties. Bitcoin isn't. Only thing Bitcoin has now is popularity. But its just a technology, not some natural resource. It will be replaced by better technologies.
Because everything can be used as token of transfering value if it has somewhat stable exchange rate. Even now, where it matters in cryptocoin transactions, the value of stuff is pegged to dollars. 
But similiarly you can transfer this value in LTC, NMC, PPC - if only both sides agree. Better - they don't have to agree if someone will start providing some kind of universal cryptocoin exchange, with automatic swap of currencies in background through common API.
