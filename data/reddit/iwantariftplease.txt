Work at a startup incubator. Had to have the conversation today when someone wanted to "convert to a blockchain" and asked what would happen if "Google took control of authorizing the blockchain." 
Me: "... no. No without bitcoin incentivizing, then the blockchain is meaningless. No you should not/can not punt responsibility to verify the blockchain to Google."

This guy gets it.

So... "In Satoshi we trust"?
No thank you. I'd rather use a system that's *trustless*
edit: replaced "design" with "use". Brain fart.

Yeah. "Naggers" is definitely a word that's commonly used in parlance and not AT ALL associated with the South Park episode linking it to the n-word. But go ahead and call me a racist, w/e. Don't care. 
Edit: AND I should add, "Naggers" wouldn't even apply here. People aren't "nagging" anyone about Coinkite, they're skeptical of them - "naysayers" you might say.

W/e. Not having an argument here. Not tense actually. I've never in my life heard someone use the word "naggers," but hey, whatever you say. I'm sure its "very common" wherever you are.

Yes.

"Naysayers" is probably the word you want. Unless you're trying to surreptitiously slip in some casual racism.

Pablo Escobar never had a libertarian/philosophy book club. Just saying, there's a reason DPR had such a good reputation when SR was around - all evidence seemed to indicate that he was a peaceful crypto-anarchist hacktivist. Which is why the people that were following the SR news *before* the msm latched on are so incredulous about the supposed murders-for-hire.

Haha, touche. Shot that off in a rush, but obviously I mean that I would rather use/support/endorse a trustless system. Because that's actually what bitcoin is designed to be. If we're going to give that up, we might as well just be using Visa.

"I'm not claiming any special authority"
"This is *my* policy"
Those words.. I don't think they mean what you think they mean.
