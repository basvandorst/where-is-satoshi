Congrats man,  have a question...about 7 years ago I heard about this interesting place called "the silk road ", even though I don't do drugs I found the idea of it very interesting. One day I browsing their site, while checking out everything that was available to buy, I noticed that the only way to purchase a product was to use bitcoin. I have never heard of bitcoin before that...which I also found very interesting. I researched the heck out of it, and decided to buy some. I remember having to send money via western union, and getting some sort of number/letter combination emailed to me from the person who I sent the money too. I ended up buying a small bag of weed for my pot head brother in law, just to see if it could really be done...the purchase and delivery was flawless, I proved it could be done and that was that. At that time I think one bitcoin was worth around 40 cents, so when I was done with my little experiment I really didn't care that I left around 75 bitcoin in my wallet. With the prices at what they are today I would really like to get my hands on that 75 bitcoin, the problem is I moved several times since then and can't find my number / letter combination, I don't even remember what wallet I used. All I have is the old laptop I used for everything.... So my question is, is there any way of extracting the data of the laptop to find the information needed to recover my bitcoin, and even if I could, is it still available​. At around $750,000 that would be life changing, if anyone could make this happen I would gladly pay them , very generously at that. Please help.
