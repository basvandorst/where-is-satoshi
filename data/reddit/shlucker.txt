Honestly, I would probably immediately trade it for a stable coin. Tether or something like that on an exchange that would keep its value for the time being. Then I would take increments of tether. (Like $30,000 or so) and trade it into bitcoin and send it to a fiat ramp.  You can only trade so much $ in bitcoin at once on some fiat ramps.) Something  like coinbase or any other place and do it that way. You may pay fee’s but at least you don’t lose the value you earned.

Sell it on an exchange instead?

The Bitcoin Galaxy Llama (BGL) will only appear, to warn people that a bull run is near.

Make an account on a ramp site. For example, Coinbase. Then literally just sell it for $. And deposit funds in your account at the rate you feel comfortable or know that your bank won’t freak out. There’s no reason to sell it “in person” and take a huge risk. Especially if you don’t really know the person. That’s what I mean.

Well now a days tech is on the Japanese dudes side...and I feel like that’s worth a lot more. It’s like who would win the war if a million person military in 1913 fought against a 1000 person military with today’s tech....i think it would be close.

Yea exactly. But as a rule. Always send a test first to make sure it works.  Also keep in mind that you have a limit to transfer to your bank. Something like 10k or 1 bitcoin worth a day - I forget.
