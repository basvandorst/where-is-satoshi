I would also add that the fact that bitcoin can be used for illicit activities is also a feature. Sadly, most people seem to think that sacrificing their freedoms is justified if there is some chance that "bad guys" can be caught. 
It might seem a bit paradoxical, but you don't want the police's job to be too easy. If police can sit behind a desk, monitoring people's purchases for contraband before giving the orders to arrest then that is exactly what they will do. At the same time the real bad guys, who have the resources and connections to bypass all of these measures, will keep on doing whatever they like without consequence.
People should be free to trade without the government being involved.

Power can be generated locally. A car battery would be more than enough to power a cellphone charger and satellite radio.
Internet is harder, but still possible. Satellite comms is one way of doing it, if the satellite infrastructure is still in place. Alternatively, conventional radio can be used to communicate bitcoin transactions over long distances in the event of local or national internet disconnection.
Even in the worst case scenario, since the blockchain is distributed worldwide, in the event of amajor conflict or natural disaster, there is a very high chance that an intact copy of the blockchain exists on a hard drive somewhere in the world. Once civilisation has somewhat rebuilt itself, the blockchain can then be reconstructed.
This is a lot more resilient than conventional electronic payment systems like Visa. As soon as your bank's central datacentres go down then no record of your bank account and balance will exist. Banks these days are reasonably good at having multiple data centres in different locations in order to combat this risk, but a determined group or government could still take out all data centres simultaneously, as could a natural disaster.

I do think Satoshi will be the world's first trillionaire and therefore become the richest man alive (1,000,000 BTC @ $1,000,000 per coin).
I also think this is why he chose 100,000,000 Sats per BTC. A $1M bitcoin equates to 1 Sat being worth 1 cent.

This is slowly happening in the west as well. There has been a continual push by banks, governments, businesses to favour "pull" transactions (e.g. automated debits, card payments) over "push" type payments (cheques, cash, etc.)

Actually there are quite large security concerns with cards. Ask any retailer that has been subject to a "Chargeback"

Paper money is not the enemy, it is electronic fiat (aka banking).
PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, World Governments would absolutely love the idea of abolishing cash, which is why they are pushing for it so hard.

But, China - your social credit score is too low: "sorry, your account is no longer approved for that purchase".
This is why cash (and Bitcoin) is so important. No government or bank can completely stop an individual from earning, spending and holding their bitcoin / cryptocurrency / cash. However, they can (and routinely do) prohibit individuals from using banking services or from spending their own money.

Not to mention the increasing trend of governments and banks to apply censorship - your bank no longer likes you? That rent payment is no longer authorised, and there is nothing you can do about it. Maybe you will get it sorted in 6-8 weeks time, but by then you are homeless. The government deems you to be a "money launderer" (no evidence required)? Same thing, all cards frozen. You will just have to go hungry until the powers that be deem you are worthy enough to be able to spend your own money.
With cash and bitcoin, this type of censorship is impossible. Which is why both must be protected.

1) Send tip amount (e.g. $1) to multiple new wallets
2) Print QR code with wallet address / private key onto paper slips - you now have the equivalent of $1 bills (or whatever you sent to the wallets).
3) Tip with paper as normal.

You can make up your own mind whether this is a good thing or not. However, these institutions hold great positions of power and influence.
In terms of payment processors, Visa and MasterCard are operating almost as a duopoly (there are some smaller processors out there, but they are much, much smaller than V/MC). Visa and Mastercard also share much of the same infrastructure, meaning that the companies are much more closely tied than people realise.
Not to mention that both organizations are answerable to US and world governments. So if the government tells the card processors that they want something blocked, then the card processors are going to do it. The consequence could be unfavourable legislation being passed that will cut into their profits or harm their position in the market - i.e. costing them much more money than they stand to gain from merchant fees for some niche service. Plus, anti money laundering legislation gives the government significant powers over banks and card processors, and the scope of the legislation goes far beyond money laundering. So if some foreign government wants to shut down your business, they can do so very easily.
Of course, these concerns do not apply to bitcoin.

One difference - tha bank has the ability to choose whether to allow you, as an individual, can access your deposited funds. In fact, it is incredibly easy for a bank to freeze your account - all the bank has to do is declare you as a "money launderer" and you are completely locked out, all perfectly legal for the bank to do.
This is different to paper money and bitcoin, where the ability to control an individual's finances is removed. The only exception is if your wallet address got linked to your real identity somehow, and even then you could set up a new wallet instantly. Cash has a similar limitation with serial numbers on bills, but someone would need to be extremely dedicated to track someone this way.

Only to merchants that Visa approve of. And even then, in the majority of cases the supplier is losing money as the fees are fixed around 10 - 20 cents. There are exceptions for large volume merchants that can negotiate special deals however.

Great, so I need to give my address and personal info to Visa in order to spend my own money. Just so that my purchasing history can be given to the Canadian government under the guise of "anti money laundering".

I was in this situation around 9 years ago when I first heard about bitcoin. I was considering investing a small amount, around $200, as a novelty / just to hodl. At the time I was struggling to get by and had debts / no savings, however, chances were that spending the $200 would not make that much difference to my financial situation. I ended up doing the "sensible thing" and used the money to repay a small percentage of my overall debt instead.
The $200 at the time would have bought me around 200BTC, equal to $800,000 now or $4,000,000 at the ATH. Although, I'm sure that in reality if I did buy the Bitcoin, I would have sold much, much earlier.

As you pointed out - the issue is that one address is tied to your identity. I gave the example of Coinbase/drugs as that is a pretty obvious example of where transaction tracking is already happening. (I believe they also track beyond the first hop as well).
The issue is, now that your employer has your wallet address, what is to stop them from monitoring what addresses you send your money to. It doesn't even need to be illegal for it to cause you problems at work - e.g. you could be spending money at your employer's competitors, or donating money to a political candidate that your employer does not agree with. If they can work out what some those destination addresses are, they can find out where the money is being sent.

Some addresses are already known to be "undesirable" - e.g. those used for buying drugs. Conbase has been known to lock peoples accounts and prevent withdrawals if money has been sent to one of their blacklisted addresses.
