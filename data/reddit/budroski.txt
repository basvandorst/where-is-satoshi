Hey this may be a stupid reply, but why not just use a remittance company.  I can send bitcoin to the Philippines to a bank account with no fees. The bitcoin is converted automatically to Philippine Pesos and deposited directly to a bank account of my choice to any major Philippine bank. Just a thought
@_date: 2015-12-04 13:56:48
I have bought all my coin through coinbase with no problems.  I was excited to hear about the Debit card and the ever expanding world that allows the use of using bitcoin with my coinbase account.  I still think that in the ever emerging world of bitcoin = Coinbase could one day be a world bank!  Able to accept &amp; exchange bitcoin where ever you spend money.  So long story short = no hate here!!

Sad we have to give a Sh*t what the chinese say or care about.  I am in favor of the PBOC taxing miners to drive mining out of china!!!

Things will keep progressing and coming together.  Thanks for the news

Hello, thanks for the comment, please tell me more.  I would love to run a node here in the Philippines on a Rasberry Pi.  Please tell me more
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:54:38
Couldn't care less.  Any bad news about Ver, Hearn or BTC in China is good news for Bitcoin. HooRay
@_date: 2017-02-18 03:25:29
Coinbase gets so much bad comments.  But that is how I accumulated my BTC and never ever had any problems with them.  Don't have experience with Gemini
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:20:20
I bought 2 of these.  I put a little coin on it and then did my best to f**k the device up.  I don't trust hardware wallets yet.  Well I erased the device and was able to back it up, But something is not right = The little USB device got very hot!  This can't be good.  I won't use or trust it and if I lived close to another BTC fan I'd give you a hell of a deal on 2 (1 slightly used) bitbox's = free!!  Oh don't ask, I'm in the Philippines.
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:28:54
Good now close down the miners and BTC will survive.  F**k China
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:30:50
Thanks for the information.  Gives me something to go on
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:38:11
Here is the way I look at it.  I have 101 bitcoins.  I can live with the chance of loosing it all, but I can't live with Bitcoin going to the MOON and I wasn't along for the ride!!!
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:24:31
My guess (for what it's worth) = If a BTC ETF is to be approved - it will be approved by default so no one takes direct responsibility.  Seems to make sense to me.  So this means after the March 11 deadline!
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:45:53
Sorry, can't agree with you all.  I love the way the wallet works from my desktop.  I only wish it was still easy to import from a paper wallet.  Now, please let me say this that when it comes to actually knowing much about wallets, I'm about as uneducated as it gets.  So I believe in the complaints that you all say, but just wanted to let you know that there is one dumb ass out here who does enjoy the service from this company.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:24:05
I'll admit the thoughts of selling any coin was out of the question a couple of months ago, but with the BU hardfork crap and the China news = I have sold some of my holdings and put the money towards a new house I'm building in the Philippines.
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:04:35
That is why I hope the next news from China is a big TAX% on miners to even the worlds playing field and drive mining out of China!!
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:06:41
All altcoins are BTC's test net
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:58:08
Yeah, I'm doing what I told myself I would not do for several more years = SELL!!  Happiness is being able to sell some of your holdings to recoup your investment and not be totally screwed when the militant fork either destroys BTC or brings it to its knees, taking years to recover if ever.  Dam you F**king BTU guys!!
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:43:20
Hmmm, they may secure the network but they are out of touch and I would like to see them cut down to size.  Any bad news in China is good news for BTC.  So shut er down Luke were pumping mud!
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:55:40
You know, Cryptonaut420, even though I may not totally agree with you.  You are on the right track and we all need to be a little flexible or BTC will never evolve.  So I think your right, my only input would be allow plenty of time before activation of the hard fork so enough of the community is running the right software!  Right On!! Now why can't Core and the powers that be make this a reality?  Come on we have to be able to bend a little or it's never going to be a go
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:09:01
I can relate.  i live in the Philippines and the internet in rural areas can no way support a node.  Oh and like in your area, I don't know of anyone around me who could afford one.  I wish I could run one, maybe one day the internet speed will increase so I can help our cause
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:55:44
Wow, wouldn't surprise me but at the same time would not bother me either.  The Chinese in the end will eliminate themselves from the BTC world

You have a lot more faith than me.  I'm selling some of my holdings so when Bitcoin forks into 2 coins.  I won't go down like all the miners who caused this problem.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:11:07
yeah really why 50%, I don't know.  Looking at the way they have done the exchanges it would probably start at 10% and then another 10% and so on, anything to put a little disruption into the mix.  Like I said it was just a thought
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:47:04
To the Core Devs.  Thank you, Thank you and Thanx again for all you do
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:04:44
Technology is the only way forward and it will have to do it without a majority!  There will be no more forks for BTC.  That window has closed.  Technology and the forces that be will create the solutions that BTC needs or BTC will remain as it is forever.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing.  BTC is a great store of wealth and maybe never to be the worlds paypal.  Just thoughts from an old holder.
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:04:46
Congrats and thanks for the updates!!
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:24:48
Cool and good advice.  I'm on Mindanao and a long time hodler.  Sold some to help pay for a new house but holding bulk.  As for buying now or holding.  The Chinese are always good for causing dips, a little here and there is good advice.  I am happy where I sit now and will just do a wait and see.  Good luck in all you do
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:22:26

Across many paper cold storage wallets.  I still don't trust hardware wallets after my experience with Digital Bitbox.  And thanx to others on here, I found it very easy to move from cold storage paper to an Electrum desktop wallet
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:03:56
I have an electrum wallet to clear paper wallets and it works easy and good.  But and this is a big buttt for me - I don't like the way Electrum wallet handles the fees and uses milibits in the display.  This may be adjusted but I love the way my blockchain wallet is so easy to send the exact amount and the fees are so easy to adjust to what is needed to get the transaction confirmed.  But thank you and like I say the Electrum wallet is great and easy for sweeping paper wallets
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:07:16
This is a post I am happy to see.  F**k China, now if they will only clamp down on mining = BTC can become decentralized around the world.  So, I am happy to see any bad news from China!!!
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:45:03
Hey I agree with your comments.  I am afraid the window for change has already closed - will never get enough of a majority.  My feelings are = I believe technology will be what allows Bitcoin to live, scale and move forward.  Leaving the SegWit debate long behind.  Oh just for myself = Segwit all the way - makes to much sense and seems like a win win!
@_date: 2017-02-18 03:14:33
The PBoC has to have the miners tops of the list of targets.  I think a good tax on miners will go a long way to force decentralization of mining to the rest of the world.  PBoc - bring it on!!
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:26:46
I felt that too, but not now.  Litecoin is a great test for SegWit and I think a stepping stone of importance to bring the miners on board.  Just my thoughts
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:45:53
Charlie you are the only bright spot I can see in China.  Thank you for all you do and good luck in your progress
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:33:19

What is with the negative words!!  People out there just sharing news that may or may not come to pass, but positive none the less.  So thanks for the news and keep us up to date.  Oh and good luck!!
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:10:23
Everything is cool.  Miners are becoming desperate along with Ver and that is very good.  Core is keeping BTC safe and sound.  Love it
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:58:24
Anyone who thinks that this is OK, no problem is a F**king BU idiot.  Just one guys opinion

Yep, you are so right.  Sold 60% at the highs.  Leaves me 40% and now playing with the house money.  Couldn't risk it all.  So if it goes down = OK.  If it goes up = to the moon hooray!!
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:27:06

Hey my friend.  I am living in the Philippines and I just feel lucky to have internet.  I am able to get online with a little wifi device = my only(only) option for home internet use.

I don't trust this F**ker any farther than I can throw him!!
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:07:31
A compromise seems so simple.  Why can't it be?  A 2MB hardfork with SegWit with plenty of time after 75% approval so as not to harm the system.  Do you think that will ever be a popular option.  I don't think so.  But only time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:52:39
The advice is the same now as it always has been.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose!

Yeh really,  I'm building a new house here in the Philippines and a crew of 20 laborers, skilled carpenter and the contractor cost $200 per day on average
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:02:46
I trust the core and will just see how it all plays out
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:12:05
I feel the same way.  A couple of months ago I told myself that no matter what - I would not sell any BTC for another 4 years = full retirement age.  But I'm building a new home and life in the Philippines and thanks to the rise in BTC I'm selling 60% of my coin.  This means profits are great and the 40% left is - like you say - the banks money.  So now I can ride out the next few years and be happy either way.  1 the BU hardfork causes a BTC meltdown.  2 - all works out great and BTC goes up, up and away.  HooRay
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:47:02
No way, not all!!  I sold some to build a house.  I'm now playing with the house's money.  So I'm OK with 2 futures, 1 Segwit is approved as is, 2 Fork it with a POW change.  Force those that want to support BU to put up or shut up!!!  Let the little guy mine again.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:14:03

@_date: 2017-03-18 08:40:13
Wow, that's got to be my F**king problem.  I want to fight so bad and run a core node, but my internet is so flaky = I'm lucky to just be able to read your post.  So all i can say is please keep up the fight!!!
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:26:22
you are so right, others may not want to hear it.  Tough shit!!  Sold 60% of my holdings and may sell more!!  until the BTC world says F**K the miners
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:04:24

Oh why don't you do us or at least me a favor and post this compormise option (pardon the spelling) on both subreddits and see if anyone even cares to solve the issue or just wants to end up destroying the coin they have worked so hard to support.  I would like to see the results of your posts.  Thanks and good luck

Just chill out (that's what they had to tell me not long ago).  It's not killing me, oh, but then maybe that advice = "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose is working.  Really, I know it's hard but we are already on an upward movement that may be a telling sign.  This is BTC, enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:16:56

@_date: 2017-03-21 00:21:27
Luke, thank you for your comments and participation on this reddit!!  Please let me know if my thoughts are correct or not.  It is my understanding that you all and the miners had come to an agreement to proceed with 2MB + Segwit at a HK meeting.  Then things changed about the 2MB.  Can this not be the starting point needed for the new core software and move forward with what was already agreed to as a workable solution.  I realize the proposed solution may not have been right at the time and with the time that has passed can whatever halted the release be corrected to meet the goals of the many.  Thanks again and just one old dudes thoughts
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:14:05
Wow, dam, you need to be a moderator.  People are surprised when I posted that "Thanks to the recent rise in BTC" I sold 60% of my holdings and now enjoying something I have never been able to do = Play with the house money.  I thought it would be years till I sold any, but the lack of being able to move forward with the scaling issues and or anything else is too much politics so I had to sell some, rather than take a chance on losing it all.  You are right and it is really obvious to anyone who has there eyes open that "ALT's" are really coming to life and nothing helps them more than - stalled developement in BTC!  Thanks for your post, hope we can move forward. But for now I am on the sidelines only hoping for the best.

@_date: 2017-01-27 05:24:12
Thank you and I love what you say.  But am I wrong in that if enough miners (and it seems that all new mining pools) go against core that they can in fact force the issue of a hard fork?  If so we may all be Forked!  Tell me I'm wrong, please!

I can relate to what you say and thanks for the reply.  I am in an easy position in that whether it goes to "0" or to the moon = I will hold.  Good luck to you, I may be wrong but I think in a couple of weeks you will be glad that you did not sell.

First = Thanks luke-jr for all you do!  I'd be for a hard fork that activates SegWit now and gives till 2019 to activate the hard fork.  This should give time to prepare.  I like the idea of the block size to increase as you said - Start at the present 1MB + 17% and increase 17% per year
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:45:24
Yep, a very different story when in the Black.  Very different indeed.  Time for some PopCorn
@_date: 2017-01-01 01:15:35
I wouldn't worry about speculators - that makes me think about the fruitless effort to time the market.  I truly believe that the ETF (more than one) will be approved in the 1st or 2nd quarter this new year = a massive injection of Capital.  So anytime prior to the ETF is good.

Your right, I look at the whole China thing as a necessary evil.  They plow in so much money that it really helps us, time will level out the playing field as the world catches up.
@_date: 2017-01-07 07:13:31
True but when 90% or so of the trades are from one country - things happen.  One thing that I think will help this kind of action in the next couple of years is the growing popularity of Bitcoin around the world to help spread out the action.  Just me talking
@_date: 2017-01-31 04:33:23
This idea sounds great!!!  The ability to take back some of the power of miners - we need that to give the network a voice of reason.  Now if I only knew enough to use this software.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:24:05
I think you will find that if you activate Segwit = you will see the technology bring about innovation that may delay the need for a hard fork (hopefully even eliminate the need).  Bitcoin is pushing tech limits to the max and it will continue to push with ideas not yet even thought of.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:52:43
it's not that easy.  But there are countries you can buy a citizenship for not too much expense.  On my radar!!
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:01:45
1 BTC = 178,000 Philippine Pesos.  
@_date: 2017-01-10 10:15:19
Dam, I wish I could run a node but my internet in the Philippines is so slow - I'm lucky to just be able to keep up with the BTC news, so thanks for everyone out there supporting the network
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:24:04
You know what?  It is fellow bitcoiners like you that always help bring me back down to earth.  Thank you for your calm perspective.  Oh and thanks for not jumping all over me
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:39:09
Wow, I can just see it in my mind.  A PC full of boards with mining chips crammed on each one of the boards.  One thing that worries me of the thought is INTEL and AMD may tie in hardware for the NSA to keep track of all newly mined chips or who is doing the mining.

This dude was probably just "Hearny" lol
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:42:30
I bet you didn't have to wait long for the confirmations?  I wouldn't activate SegWit either if I could accumulate fees like this!
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:23:54
activate SegWit and I will care!  I'd rather go through a mining failure in China than a hard fork!  Mining problems are temporary - Hard forks are permanent!  So miners need to get real or get F**ked!!!
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:59:22
I'm afraid to sell only because i don't know enough about it and worry about losing my BTC

Thanks for the comment, just goes to show how little I know.
@_date: 2017-01-11 23:31:48
Coinbase is how I was able to buy Coin.  Never a problem
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:26:17
Now that comment did make me laugh and I believe that comedy is true genius!  Way to go.  From what I have been reading on the current stats is BU is gaining momentum?
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:16:10
Good question.  I am 62 now and will start using some when I turn 66.  Don't want to wait too long.  Just want to enhance my retirement.  Who knows maybe an ocean front place for me and the wife.  Now if I was younger = I'd agree with you totally
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:38:04
You know one article I read lately that really seemed to make sense was that countries like the US which are very strong in banking and most of its citizens can have easy access to banking and credit cards as well as debit cards don't really need to use alternative currencies as of now.  But over 1/2 the world don't have access to these banking options so it only makes sense that they will drive the BTC forward.  But my fears are the momentum will grow to rapidly and the minors will not bring BTC up to standards in time to handle the needs of the many.  SegWit allows the strength to handle the needs while technology improvements will handle the rest.  Lets move forward or the time for BTC may pass to another that can handle the needs of the many.  Just my thoughts on the world of BTC.

@_date: 2017-01-03 04:30:41
I agree that you should move your coin off any exchange, but Coinbase always did me a good job and I only stopped using them when they started asking for SS 
@_date: 2017-01-16 08:41:26
This isn't bad, if you play with fire!!  Huobi is doing what needs to be done to be a reputable player in the exchange community.  Sorry for the loss but don't blame the internet or market actions for your poor decisions.  Dam, from the headline I thought there was a problem
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:53:31
that's what I think as well.  1/1/18 =5000, 1/1/19 = 20,000, 1/1/20 = 50,000, &amp; 1/1/21 = 100,000.  Hope so!

That is true and a real possibility.  But at my age and playing this one last hand, only time will tell.  I almost bought some ether, but I'm going to ride this horse till its dead or I am.  Good luck to you

wow, thanks for sharing - nice to hear from an American miner.  All I can ask is that you use all of your mining resources with a pool that supports SegWit.
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:15:51
I am still on the fence on Circle.  I am going through the photo ID process which is supposed to take a few days.  I will know then more or less whether this is an option for me to buy more Bitcoin if I wish.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:44:33
Hey your right, at least as far am I'm concerned.  I can't go to the other sub without wanting to do something I'll regret, so I never go to the other sub!!

I love it, keep me and the others strong!!  And I hope you are right!  Dam, I hope so
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:52:33
just google something like "easy 2nd citizenship" and you can research several options.  You can buy a citizenship or you can move to some countries for a couple of years.  Lots of options
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:04:04
When it's needed they will consider it.  No need for it now
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:08:32
Yeah, but as you have seen in the past - it can go down a long way only to come back even stronger.  Here is the way I see it (first my other investments are firm)  this is my only risky investment.  I can live with losing all of my Bitcoin as a failed experiment, but I can't live knowing that I had one more chance at a good investment only to let it go by the wayside - like Walmart, google, Microsoft and on and on.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:27:59
wow, what can I do for you my friend.  I grew up in California but now live in the Philippines.  I am so proud of what you are doing, I only wish my internet here was strong enough to power a node.  But I am just glad to be able to do what I do.  thank you

Hey no problem and thank you for your reply,  I was just upset by Coinbase and their new demand for buying bitcoin.  I have always been very happy with the service and ease at using them for all of my bitcoin purchases, but now they want my SSN for any new purchases and that aint gonna happen.  The government can do as they want in trying to track bitcoin activity, but I'm not going to help in anyway to make it easier for them.  
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:08:54
That is so good, thanks for the reply
@_date: 2016-11-27 02:09:21
I love it.  The first 2 Bitcoins I ever bought I sold for a little profit.  Then I started accumulating.  I remember when my goal was 21 then 50 then 100 and finally topping off at 125.  Come on $8,000 per Bitcoin.  So to answer your question.  I don't sell. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 05:51:57
Really, thanks for the info, I will try and see.  That would be more like it

Right ON!!  That's why my BTC is not for sale
@_date: 2016-11-29 05:39:42
I agree, this does seem to be the best solution to the evolution of Bitcoin.  It keeps the ball rolling.  As Bitcoin gains in popularity around the globe - it will and must advance (Scale) just as the internet had to evolve.  But it must evolve.  I can't help believe that miners who love to say how many millions that they have invested in this experiment will jointly stand by and watch their investments go down the tubes = That would be just plain "STUPID".  So my quote for the miners from someone I do trust = Do you feel lucky?  Well do you PUNK!!
@_date: 2016-11-11 09:16:23
Wow, first what is a large amount.  10, 100, or 1000
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:14:29
I never heard of that strategy.  Sounds good and I may regret my decisions on Bitcoin.  But I am a firm hodler at least for a few more years.  Thanks for the info

Yep your right.  Here in the Philippines 1 Peso (their Dollar) is worth 2 cents US.  And they have change starting at 1 centavo (I never have seen one), I have seen the 5 centavo coin = worth so little it is hard to figure out.  Just some info
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:00:49
Hey, I'm a Hodler and I'm OLD.  But I truly believe that anything you do now is going to be well rewarded in the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2017 when the long awaited ETF's go live!!!

Great Info, thanx for that very much
@_date: 2016-11-17 00:34:04
I am happy for you, I waited only to be declined an account.  It was a wake up call and a reaffirmation that I have enough BTC = now just sit back - relax and wait for the price to reach a level that works for me and enjoy!!!
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:38:43
Well that is a good idea and I have used coinbase in the past but once they asked for SS# - I had to shut them off.  I have a good stash.  I am retired now but will wait a few years to see what we are all looking forward to seeing.  Thanx

Great read, thanks for sharing!!

For me = talking about Bitcoin is like telling someone to quit smoking!!  One day, One day
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:10:06
Well the way i see it is if you give the exchange or seller of Bitcoins your SS# then you better know they (IRS) are going to keep up with you
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:41:55
Sounds like the advice I can live with.  Thanx for the post
@_date: 2016-11-28 08:14:01
My closest friend (who has plenty of FIAT) never would part with a single $ to invest in Bitcoin.  I don't remind or talk to any of my friends or relatives about Bitcoin anymore.  What will be will be

Stand up to the IRS or fall on your Sword!!
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:14:05
Hey call it what you want.  This is just an effort for the IRS and US Gov to track all Bitcoin activity for future taxation.  You can comply if you want but I won't.

The fees are decided by the business you use for pick up.  If the recipient picks up at the Rebit office in Managua they say there are no fees.  I chose the business most convenient for pick up and the fee for the $20 was about $2.20 or close to it.  I didn't mind = it was so easy and it worked.

@_date: 2017-04-27 22:59:16
Dam, so is there no way to keep mining in it's simple form without proprietary hardware?
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:02:19
Wow, I can only imagine how much you were paid to make that change.  
@_date: 2017-04-21 07:21:21
Sure thing, that is what we have now!  One central entity who is trying to control everything for their greed and power with no respect at all for the community as a whole.  
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:45:41
Wow, several things for sure.  1 - 1,000,000 bitcoins would be created each day to feed the war machine. 2 -  You have to spend and receive your bitcoin through a Federal Reserve server for tracking.  3 - You would pay negative interest to the state for any of your bitcoin holdings.  4 - Any off network transactions would be prohibited with felony charges filed for violations.  Dam this could go on and on.  Just wait till there is Fed Coin and lets see.
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:47:16
You have valid comments.  I have 1 question for you.  In your opinion is there anything Jihan can do to save face and benefit bitcoin as a whole and help us all move forward?  What do you think?  Oh Luke-Jr if you are listening, please chime in!
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:33:46
Wow, I just wrote a great post and erased it all, because what I advise and what I do are 2 different things!  Only you are you.  Just remember what I tell friends = Bitcoin only has 2 options for the future - 1 = goes to "0", 2 = goes to the MOON!!  There is no option 3 unless you consider 1 or 2 dollar bitcoin as being an option.  Good luck, oh, one last thing that I must say = Bitcoin has been great for me as an investment.
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:53:29
Sorry for the delay - it was Palawan express, I just sent another remittance for 50 dollars worth of Bitcoin and the fee was a couple of dollars (about the same for the 20 dollar remmittance with Palawan)  but this time I used Cebuana Lhuillier.  
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:49:51
Buy it through Local Bitcoin and keep in a cold storage wallet.  This way in 20 years the money is yours and Uncle Sam won't be there with his hand out demanding his cut!!
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:55:42
It makes no sense unless the miners who are pushing BU are so fucking stupid to see the light.  With the adoption of Segwit and all the improvements and tech advancements that it unleashes = will bring about a BTC price increase that will far and away dwarf whatever small incentives they are being bribed to resist the inevitable!!!
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:41:56
It's always supply and demand.  With bitcoin you just have so many different reasons for the demand side of the equation.
@_date: 2017-04-16 03:08:48

You are very welcome.  I am just glad to have this option available = couldn't be easier
@_date: 2017-04-22 04:23:58
Interesting idea.  Hmmmm, 
@_date: 2017-04-27 04:48:15
Yeah, I wish so much that the little guy could mine again with his simple pc and play a part in the big picture.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:52:49
Can you say UASF?
@_date: 2017-04-21 07:19:09
No way dude!!!  The worse thing is having some fucking asshole think he is the bitcoin God and we will bow down to his wishes.  Whatever it takes to bring him down is GOOD!!
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:34:49
Oh we will help you and Jihan.  Your problem is that you are trying to think and your thoughts are screwing up your job which is to process transactions.  We will help you understand this with our UASF.  So carry on and understand that your days of having a say are about to end.  Now go process and stop trying to think!!!
@_date: 2017-04-27 04:55:06
Dam, that is awesome!!  But with all my heart I don't give that second chance solution a prayer of happening.  Am I wrong in thinking that if we change the POW to GPU mining (I am thinking that that is an option) then anyone with a pc can mine.  Sure someone with a 100,000 pc"s can mine more but the mining can be easily spread across the face of the planet without the need of proprietary mining equipment.  If Jihan can't see the light - we must help show him the way.  Thanks for all you do.
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:31:57
Well written but I do not agree.  The harm to bitcoin is from the mining cartel.  Delays only aid their goal of centralization to an extent that they control bitcoin.  Give them the needed time and we are pawns to the miners.  I'd rather see bitcoin go down in flames as long as the power grabber miners go down with it.  
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:50:36
The more we find out about the main mining pool of bitcoin, the less I trust that a UASF is enough.  A malicious attack by Bitmain on active miners hardware - no matter the way, shape or form must be removed from the equation
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:20:07
Great news!!  Do it, let's get this show on the road!  I have faith in BTC and just can't wait to cram any kind of fork up Jihad ASS!!
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:55:21
I would only use localbitcoins or any way that is and can't be reported to the IRS!! Be private but also be safe
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:38:59
Good luck, a win for you would be a great boost for bitcoin.  Something that would be neat to know is how are the odds of you mining a block opposed to you winning a lottery
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:24:33
I agree with this at a doable compromise.  If you all don't upvote this and give a little then why should they?  And if and when BTC is remembered as the myspace of crypto = you only have yourselves to blame!! Bend a little or break, decide or just keep bitching, moaning and whining
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:49:41
Dam, you beat me to it.  That was my answer as well.  Your a genius!!
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:35:26
Yes I do, It's been great for me and my family.  I look at all other altcoins as just test net to see what sticks to the wall and consider the best software worthy of bitcoin incorporation by the core.
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:59:46
Wow, maybe you should login more than once every 3 or 4 years
@_date: 2017-04-22 04:25:44
I can't believe that it is or we would see 50 posts about it.  Probably someone using a Chinese calendar for an April fools joke!
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:51:24
Centralized mining is not good for bitcoin.  Whatever it takes to bring down the powerful and corrupt is good, no matter what it takes.  
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:03:31
I'm open to whatever it takes.  Hey it's OK with me if we go with UASF and cram it up the miners ASS!!  Force their hand, so you can see I just will be glad to see some action!  Just do it
@_date: 2017-04-16 07:01:33
maybe you should ask for your money back?
@_date: 2016-02-07 18:27:44
My recipient does have a smart phone and was texted immediately that the money was available for pick up.  I don't think the person needs a smart phone, I was asked how much to send, what the recipients name was and phone number and email.  I used the bitcoin address supplied by Rebit who also converted the amount of pesos to bitcoin so I could send the correct amount.  All went smooth
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:10:51
By mining empty blocks you keep the traffic on the network high and congested which in turn = higher fees.  Mining empty blocks is a win win for any miner = high fees and bitcoin reward.  How does it get any better for a miner or any worse for the bitcoin network.  Oh, and to think by fraudulently keeping the network clogged up by mining empty blocks, these are the same guys promoting BU because the network is clogged up!!
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:53:45
No you haven't.  I told my friends over and over for a couple of years and never had one even comment on my advice let alone invest a single dollar into bitcoin.  So I stopped trying = one day who knows maybe a friend will share his new found discover called bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:14:59
Hey, sorry for the delay.  I have now used Rebit 4 times and it just works smoothly with no issues.  I am curious if I use one of the banking options if the fees are less or none.  Just very thankful to have this option!!  Thanks Rebit

I hope you are RIGHT!!
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:41:19
Easy and already noted.  Want SegWit = no boost
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:52:54
I am against a centralized bitcoin so anything Bitmain wants I DON'T!!
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:53:24
Nice try!!  What a coincidence that Bitfinex supports Segwit and not BU shit coin!!
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:01:51
Sometimes you just need a pick me up and that for me is watching Andreas on YouTube.  Andreas thank you so much for all you do.  Keep up the great job and like you said Bitcoin will be attacked in every way it can be and now you are part of the attack so feel honored that the weak &amp; miserable low life pieces of shit have included you in the attack. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:36:53
Your RIGHT!!!  The longer we wait = just plays into their hands, allowing them to exploit the network, begin building exchanges and trying to dominate a decentralized network by centralizing it!!
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:13:50
Lets hope so.  
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:40:40
Bye, let us know when you see the light!  I'm all for part of your message = Fuck Wu, Jihad, Ver, Hearn and whoever else you want to toss in there.  I am for anything that brings down the Chinese central cartel!!!  The only reason I try and draw the line is for BitFury and BTCC.  Let's cram a UASF up their mining asses and force them to bow down and comply!!! Oh, almost forgot, I love Bitcoin, alt coins are just for test purposes.  
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:10:35
So you blame core for a group of miners who pride themselves in mining empty blocks to make sure of slow confirmations to keep fees high.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:11:55
Yes you are right.  It will happen and it will happen soon.  Very exciting to hear and read about all the new evolutionary ideas in the pipeline.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:01:02
This is what this thread is all about.  Thanks and I'll save for future reference.  The best description I have heard for BTC is like getting a dividend.  Glad you were able to cash out
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:07:35
I think we will see $500,000 before we see $1,000
@_date: 2016-09-22 00:13:14
I enjoyed the site, but they only ship to Europe.  Enjoy if you can
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:03:01
Only plans are a big celebration party!!
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:10:34
I agree, I think it would be the best way to help keep bitcoin decentralized
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:45:49
See ya
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:38:47
Oh, I think if the amount is small you can buy at most 7/11 stores in the ph
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:04:59
any bad news in China is good news for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:13:40
I sure hope China doesn't let me down.  Ban those evil miners PLEASE!!!
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:09:35
Bitcoin isn't ready yet, but with new tech advances in the near future = Ready, Set, Go!!!
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:20:14
Oh I couldn't let that comment go = What a JOKE!!  lmfao
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:38:13
Use rebit.  Rebit and buyBitcoin are owned by the same group, I think!  I have used both many times.  Rebit is the better option.  I have never had a problem with them but have had an issue with the buybitcoin group which caused my BDO account to be shut down.  I have not used coins.ph but from what I see (I am a signed up member) they seem to be reputable.  Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want more info on rebit
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:33:13
This is great!  You are right Charlie = any bad news for China is good news for BTC.  Now please let them ban mining.  Hi Jihan, lol
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:00:42
Bitcoin is driving tech innovation to the max - Tech will find a way!
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:44:26
Mining will hopefully be banned in China next!!
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:26:15
Man hard to believe that a bitcoin company can be paid off to promote this kind of BS!!  Corporations and Governments of the world are running scared and know this is their last ditch effort to control bitcoin and your money!  I love that saying on the license plates in New Hampshire = Keep Bitcoin free or DIE!!!
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:29:33
Wow, that is really amazing.  Thanks for sharing, will you be leaving it active or is it only for a short period of time?  Thanks again
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:03:42
Not even close!  When every store you go into has a Bitcoin Accepted sticker next to the Visa, Mastercard and Discover Card sticker = Then we are mainstream!!
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:04:41
Any bad news for Jihan is great news for Bitcoin!!  HooRay
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:08:13
You are right!  When every store you enter or website you look at says ( We accept - Visa, Master Card, Discover Card and Bitcoin ) then it is a victory and mainstream.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:45:49
See ya
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:56:05
Wow, good info, sure wish we lived close so you could have helped me sell my bcash coins.  I was just too afraid to do it.  Thanks again
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:33:13
This is great!  You are right Charlie = any bad news for China is good news for BTC.  Now please let them ban mining.  Hi Jihan, lol
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:55:10
Glad to hear! I'd have more faith in the day size increase rather than 2X lol.  Thank you so much for all you do!
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:00:03
Upgraded to Bitcoin Cash = is that a joke?  Thanks for the laugh.  Let's go check out the price of bitcoin cash, lol.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:38:06
You are looking at a very short timeline.  Bitcoin will evolve into a very private and secure network and this is not what the governments of the world want.  Tumbling will become natural in future transactions.  Just one old guys opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:44:26
Mining will hopefully be banned in China next!!
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:55:03
I understand and thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:11:56
You are so right and more than 1 of each preferably in different safe locations (for disaster sake)!
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:04:30
I can send all day long for 5 cents US!!  If you are paying  more = You must have your wallet on "Support a Miner.com" lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:40:26
Keep sitting and it won't be long until you won't be able to afford 1 whole bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:58:31
Look at the bright side = Maybe they will ban mining next.  Hi Jihan
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:37:31
Oh man, if that's what you have to look forward to = dump her
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:58:32
Dam, just realized who sent me the info.  Thank you Luke and now I will dam sure move it off!! Hope you are recovering from the huricane!!
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:57:02
Thanks and I do have an electrum wallet that I use to sweep paper wallets.  Thanks again for the info
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:33:24
Oh nice picture of Mother Forker
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:54:54
Thank you for your reply
@_date: 2015-04-01 12:49:12
Got to be an April Fools joke
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:01:19
make up your own mind so you don't have anyone else to thank or blame.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:49:39
Way to go, dude!
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:39:45
Nope!!  Activate Segwit and you will have more than 2MB!  No compromises with miners!  UASF and you will have the scaling you need and a network no longer held hostage by Jihan!!
@_date: 2016-10-09 08:48:36
My will and needed info is in my safe deposit box to be given to my Son, after all if it were not for him this old Guy would have never known of the Bitcoin opportunity in the first place = another chance missed!
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:24:40
Great way to move money from one country to another.  I have done it many times
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:51:06
I will never buy an alt.  It's bitcoin or bust
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:19:11
Already decided!  Your gonna find out soon enough = on or before August 1.  Jihan activate segwit or we will do it for you!!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:22:47
  Activate SegWit!!  no compromise is needed.  Activate segwit or we will do it for you!
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:39:19
Thanks for all you do, sometimes it seems with very little appreciation from the group
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:12:13
I love posts like this!  Everything has a purpose!  We can take back control!  Jihan signal segwit now or we will do it for you!!! UASF!!  Thanks everyone
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:47:31
This is a great thread!  Seems to be a lot of shill action to discourage the UASF movement!  Fuck You!!  UASF hooray and thanks to all running your user nodes to signal UASF!
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:49:58
Jihan activate Segwit now or we will do it for you!!  UASF!
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:58:35
This whole article skips the one reason why COIN will be approved!  The rich and powerful want the Ether ETF and so as to avoid suspicion it only makes sense to first approve the COIN ETF.  The powerful get their way so this is a slam dunk and no other reasoning will come into play.  Just one old guys opinion and prediction.  Call me stupid or ignorant but we will find out soon enough.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:33:00
Maybe they will thank us when we shove that option down their fucking throats!!!!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:37:50
Activate SegWit!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:17:38
8/1 count the days!
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:20:07
That's right.  I love the concept but it will be several years of watching before I can put my coin into a bitcoin CD.  But if you think about it, maybe this is just another link in the evolutionary chain of Bitcoin.  i at least hope so
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:03:47
Way to GO!!!
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:54:04
UASF =  UP!
Compromises = DOWN!
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:49:20
Didn't I see you riding the short bus?
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:49:04
You can't really believe that.  Jihan wants total control and those he sells his hardware to are puppets, like VIABTC.  They do what they are told and that is why the kill switch is installed in his hardware = for control.  If you think he has the goodness for bitcoin in his heart = go back to the btc thread where you belong!!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:39:30
couldn't have said it better
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:39:50
Yep, no compromises are needed.  Jihan activate Segwit or we will do it for you!
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:24:39
Dam, never thought about being to run a node anyway except at my home.  I'm in rural Philippines with only a very spotty wifi internet connection.  I'm lucky to just be able to get by let alone run a node to support the community.  Man, if someone could pass along any research on the subject of remotely running a node to help the cause = please do so.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:10:58
Segwit fixes malleability, builds the needed tech for side chains giving the network scaling options for faster and lower priced transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:04:31
The Chinese gov doesn't ask = they order!!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:17:11
Right on!!  8/1 count the days
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:21:32
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:27:52
Hahahaha, is that all you lurned en thet message?  Maybe you should of gotten a little more out of it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:09:23
No way!!  I can already see Jihan working with all his pools to mine empty blocks to keep fees as high as possible.  Fuck Jihan and any compromise!!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:24:57
Tech is the true salvation for the bitcoin scaling debate!!  But one thing that needs to be fixed = miners can't control or centralize the network!
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:33:32
Thanks Luke you are the one person keeping me sane!!  So easy to spot paid trolls = just look at any negative comments to this thread and they stick out like a diamond in a goats ass!
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:52:35
Yes, I'm ready for a UASF!  I just wish I had good internet to help support the cause.  I'm in rural Philippines with only a wifi setup to access the www.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:44:17
It allows bitcoin to evolve.  High fees and 200,000 transactions waiting in the pool is destructive for all of the bitcoin community!  Jihan activate Segwit or we will do it for you!!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:48:34
No compromises!!  Jihan activate Segwit or we will do it for you!!  UASF!!
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:21:38
I don't think it will be long when a $1,000 rise in bitcoin is common place in a days trading.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:17:41
I love making predictions and I have been telling my wife that one for sometime now.  I also predict that we pass the UASF to free bitcoin from its current shackles and the price will hit $5,000 by the end of the year!!  hooray for us all
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:58:15
I think the days of price going up $50 - $100 will be normal and the day won't be long that $1000 per day won't be unusual.  It's not hard to imagine if you own 1 bitcoin and think that only about 15 million other people on this planet could hope for the same.  Kind of puts things into perspective
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:30:40
The gloves are off!!  UASF!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:15:08
This won't happen till the network can handle more transactions at an easy to figure fee.  It's very frustrating thinking you have sent money to someone only to check back in a few hours to find that your transaction was cancelled do to the delay in processing your request 
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:17:09
So UASF all the way?
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:18:10
You know what, I may be an old idiot, but you have to trust someone.  I trust that if Core put it in their client = it's good!  That's all I need.  Thanks "Luke-Jr"
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:28:12
Too dam long, what do you expect when miners mine empty blocks to keep the mempool up and fees high!  UASF is the only way to let bitcoin evolve and grow as we all want it to!!  Fuck you Jihan!!
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:45:27
This is very interesting and I can see in the near future that one could live off the interest of their bitcoin savings account.  Hmmmmmmm
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:42:27
As always = Thanks Luke-Jr.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:38:44
I prefer that we make the changes for mr jihan with a UASF.  If he can't see the need for the evolution of bitcoin, then we will just have to help the poor lost soul to see the light.  Thank you bro!
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:46:18
2MB and Segwit seems like a fair compromise.   Segwit will eliminate ASICboost.  The ability to mine empty blocks must also be corrected.
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:26:15
The day is early
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:14:35
lol, I'm trying
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:25:42
I love seeing those who short Bitcoin going up in flames, lol
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:10:16
lmfao, you fucking shill!!  Jihan activate segwit now or we will do it for you!!  UASF is on its way!!
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:01:20
Thank you Luke-Jr.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:45:40
Hey don't be so radical!!  I for a softer approach =  Cram a UASF up that fucking Jihan's ASS!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:51:53
Yeah let me delete it, dam it
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:46:00
Anyone who thinks that one miner should be in control is an idiot!!
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:42:27
Hmmm, I don't trust any of those Son of a Bitches!! UASF!  That I trust.  Pay the miners to mine - not think!  Take back the power, now.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:39:51
You are right
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:02:11
Dam, This site banned me for 24 hrs because of my ranting against Jihan, but I didn't go this far
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:17:33
UASF for you?
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:42:10
I think that's great.  If you remember, Ecuador was going to create it's own crypto and banned bitcoin (made it illegal) to promote its coin
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:14:35
I think this is just the natural rise in popularity, not a bubble.  
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:59:43
Dam could happen.  I hope not for all those who just get by
@_date: 2015-03-28 13:15:08
I expect email will never become a dominant information system.  I expect it will, at most, account for 1 per cent of transcations.  But that is fine.  What a dumb ass!!
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:54:30
No compromise, UASF!  Jihan - activate Segwit or we will do it for you!
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:21:19
Sure - just look at the adds on the right side of the page for "Fire Proof Suits"!  It will help you put out the flames, lol
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:11:28
Luke JR says no to any block increase!!  So I'm all in with core and Fuck anything else.  His reasoning is sound.  So UASF!!!  Take the power away from the miners!  When core changes so will I but not until!!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:17:52
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:05:43
UASF Now!!  Fuck you Jihan - activate segwit now or will do it for you!!  No compromises!  
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:01:07
Not sure, but the COIN will be completed before hand.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:40:15
My guess is $200 if BU should win by corruption and that is the only way they can win.  The kill switch on the antminers is for one reason and one reason only.  Think about it
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:51:44
can it be stopped? And if so wouldn't it be a great addition to a UASF?
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:25:08
Oh man, give it a break! Fuck you!!
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:23:39
It's always supply and demand.  World of bitcoin is going skyward, well there are only so many BTC to go around so the price must rise.  It only makes sense.  If you don't think so, just keep watching and in a year or so we will just see another one of those posts = (Oh I should of bought but didn't, is it too late)?
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:52:14
wow, I do feel old among the bitcoin crowd.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:03:57
Fuck big blocks and Jihan.  UASF up his ass!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:32:18
Thanks Rusty!  I love seeing our bitcoin world come together in support of the future and all that bitcoin with its growing tech evolution has to offer.  Keep up the great job!
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:54:51
NO COMPROMISES!!!  UASF!   FUCK YOU JIHAN!!
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:24:45
Why should it!  It's not a solution!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:43:29
What a dumb ass!  Jihan controls 70% of the mining hardware with a kill switch attached to shut your ass down if you don't comply.  Get real and stop accepting micro payments to support Jihan!!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:49:36
The flags would be jacked up to 1 1/2 times normal.  Rockets would burst into the air and ticker tape parades would celebrate the coming of a new era!!
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:05:50
I mean every word!  Bitcoin has been good to me - UASF is the only way!
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:43:32
Wow, can you say "UASF or AMF"
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:28:44
NO!!  Activate segwit to enable the evolution of bitcoin.  Jihan activate segwit now or we will do it for you!  UASF!!!
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:30:00
Your right George!! So do something to help make it happen, Please!
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:30:32
The users are saying Fuck You Jihan!!! Activate segwit or we will do it for you!  UASF!!
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:04:12
I would love to see our core devs treat UASF as a given and work totally to promote the code to activate it!  You will always have paid shills for the Chinese mining cartel do their best to slow the trend.  Let's just do it for the good! 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:35:02
Yeah he's crazy for sure.  Sure enough to aid the cause and put Jihan back in his place.  UASF!!!
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:53:35
You are right and this is something that will need to play out for awhile.  But I love the idea of living off my interest and still keeping the coin.  This is a wait and see for me and we are going to wait a few years
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:20:00
Tell that to the people who are paying the fees!!  Tell that to the 200,000 who wish they could get a quick transaction.  The time has come for action!  Jihan activate Segwit or we will do it for you!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:29:23
Thank you for the info
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:47:10
You Fucking Shill!!!  I love being able to put your ass down in the gutter where you belong!  Jihan activate Segwit now or we will do it for you!
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:46:12
No, No, No!  I totally understand your comments.  But and this is a big BUTT!!  Bitcoin is just getting started!  Buy what you can big or small from a safe local bitcoin supplier (safe means meet in a crowded area, maybe a good bar and hang out till you get your confirmations = pay a good fee to get it processed (this will be mute when we activate the UASF)!  When Bitcoin reaches $20,000 (my moon price) or $500,000 you won't look back and think what could have been = you will be thankful for what was.  Just an old dudes hopefully helpful words.  Good luck in all you do!
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:39:40
Gavin is a CIA puppet.  So his words mean the opposite where bitcoin is concerned.  Don't ask for any documentation from me, if you need it, check ask Nathan Hunt!
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:20:56
Dam this is nice!!!  A great thread without the paid trolls cutting it down.  They will probably be here in awhile, but just wanted to say thanks and keep up the great work on promoting the evolution of bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:52:44
Thanks for sharing and welcome aboard.  Hell if this group can put up with my crap they will welcome you with open arms.  Lets just work it out
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:14:28
That would be great. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:16:41
Wow, thanks for all the great info
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:49:12
Not sure if this is what you are asking for, but if you look at your coinbase transaction details = price you paid for the btc
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:09:17
Everyone should support Segwit = to promote bitcoins evolution and growth
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:37:03
Thank you very much.  I will send this info to my Son (my computer go to guy) and see if he can help me with this.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:37:02
Segwit2x = Jihan support!  I'm for bitcoin so I'm for core!  Segwit2x = roflmao!
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:15:24
Well put, 
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:00:31
Get rid of it now.  You will only owe a little tax.  Now buy some on Local Bitcoin with no Id info so it is your Bitcoin and not the Feds.  
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:45:47
Just a theory or call it a prediction.  The powers at be want the Either ETF approved so it will be.  To take away some of the suspicion on this approval, the SEC will now approve the COIN ETF.  Hey when powerful people want something = they get it.  Just wait and see!
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:42:40
They are!!  Segwit will give us more than 2MB and with the new tech evolving around Segwit and side chains.  Bitcoin will be good for a long time.  UASF will stop the mining cartel!!
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:16:44
I love it, good!!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:26:43
Hey, it aint bitcoin.  It's a fucker named Jihan!  Jihan activate segwit or we will do it for you!!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:32:08
Thank you for just not calling me a stupid idiot
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:38:52
Jihan = we are going to shove a UASF up your dumb fucking ASS!!
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:30:50
Oh yeah that's the answer Jihan wants to hear
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:04:29
Thank you Luke-Jr.  I am a believer in tech evolution and believe in your thoughts for smaller blocks rather than larger blocks and think with Segwit and the new tech that will follow will make the need for larger blocks to be very far off if ever!
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:49:50
No compromises!!  Next thing we know is all we end up with is a glorified BU!!  Fuck you Jihan!
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:45:35
Solutions for bitcoin are like solutions to the internet = always a work in progress.  UASF to move forward in the evolution of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:43:51
Open up and say Jihan
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:43:57
Yep, it's a miners dream come true.  They will do everything in their power to keep innovation at a stand still!  UASF and the fees will come down!
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:13:11
We need it now, unless you are happy with sky high fees and 200,000 transactions waiting to be processed.  Are saying that is OK?  No problem?  That is why we are taking our time = August 1 = UASF.  No compromises and no delays!  
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:38:26
This 1 is for you Ver and Jihan, lmfao
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:31:05
Congrats!!! I keep thinking I have enough, Just bought 6 on Tuesday bringing the total to 62.  Keep raising my goal - man that 100 bitcoin sure sounds good!
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:20:46
You are either for BIP148 or you are part of the problem!
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:12:15
Do you really think the Chinese care about patents? lmao
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:31:44
That's right, as long as a miner controls the network = this is what you will get!   UASF up his ass!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:54:21
I hope you are right
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:14:26
This is why you need to buy your crypto from anyone who doesn't require your ID or one day the US gov may come for you!!
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:14:55
To me it seems that if you are going to buy = meet at a nice place like bar at Chilis or Outback Steakhouse.  Show the cash, have btc transferred to your wallet with a generous fee so it doesn't take too long.  Hand over the cash when the cheese fries are done and your set to go.  What do think?  Wow just had a bad thought on the future.  One day you will do this only to find out that you handed the money to an undercover cop who places you under arrest for the act of buying an illegal substance - BTC.  What a world we live in
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:16:53
You are either for UASF BIP148 or you want Bitcoin to fail.  Pretty simple!
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:53:51
That's a question for Luke-Jr.  Jihan brags about exploiting the software to mine empty blocks.  And his intention to continue to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:37:26
They should be= Activate SegWit!!
Either activate it or we will do it for you!  UASF
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:08:48
I hate it, but when you think of the financial rewards he is reaping off of any delays to the progress of bitcoin, I don't see any solutions.  Their is a lot of talk of compromises but any compromise only limits the reason for the UASF to begin with.  The ability to mine empty blocks needs to be corrected as well if it can or Jihan and his pool will mine empty blocks till hell freezes over to keep fees as high as possible.  All power needs to be taken away from the miners.  They are paid to mine and that's all they need to be concerned with.  Just one dudes opinion 
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:43:27
Looks right to me! UASF is the only way
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:18:18
With Segwit, Lightening and new tech for side chains is how
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:06:38
And I never will!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:56:57
Jihan activate Segwit now or we will do it for you!!  UASF!!  
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:10:27
I like it!
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:34:58
I agree we need to do Segwit and remove ASICBOOST as well as the ability to mine empty blocks on the same UASF
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:35:27
Man I would love to set up at home, but here in the rural Philippines all I have is a little wifi unit to tie into the internet.  Maybe one day I will have another option.  Never ever thought I would wish for Direct TV internet, but I'd buy it in a minute if that was an option.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:22:15
Dam that looks bitchin!!  I live on an island too!  What is it or custom job?
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:39:05
Dam that one well played paid for message!!  Fuck BU and centralized bitcoin.  I suppose you support ASICboost and empty blocks as well
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:32:27
Thank you and good luck to us all
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:48:00
OK, I keep getting in a hurry.  I guess I worry that things will just remain idle forever with the miners growing more powerful the longer we wait.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:10:01
UASF - no compromises!  Miners have tried their best to put a stranglehold on bitcoin evolution.  Time to put the miners in their place.  They are paid to mine not think!  Jihan activate segwit now or we will do it for you!!
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:34:58
OK, the only reason I can relate to you is if you really have a terminal illness.  If so, = FUCK Yes, why not!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:28:28
Oh yeah its easy to rememer BCC = Bitmain Crap Coin.  Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:19:46
Bitcoin doesn't care about the US gov!!  Isn't that cool!
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:47:52
Activate SegWit!!  Or we will activate it for you!!
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:47:33
Good reply, I come up with some off the wall things sometimes
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:16:00
if it has to go down = I want it to go down so low that the miners cave.  Saves us from a UASF!  So do we need $500 or maybe $200?  I'm a buyer at $200.  What do you think Jihan?
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:41:31
Now that is a true Shill call!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:57:12
Holding till full retirement age in 3 1/2 years.  I project $20,000 at that time = 1,000,000 pesos per bitcoin in the Philippines
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:07:58
Hey, I use Coinbase to buy my bitcoin and then move them to cold storage.  I can trust them that far, but I would never trust them with my private keys.  Might as well just post them all on your tax return so as to make it easier for the feds to track and confiscate them when it suits their whims!
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:48:47
I remember that goal.  21 turned into 50 and 50 turned into 100.  I felt content at 100 but now find myself slowly adding to the position.  This investment has only 2 possible outcomes = 1 - I can live with loosing all of my Bitcoin holdings.  2  - I can't live knowing that such a possible opportunity was available and I let it completely slip away and have to think of the "What If's"  for the rest of my life
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:05:46
Hey I have been so verbal in my support of UASF and dislike for Jihan that this site banned me for 24 hours!  I just want to move on, if there is a way to activate segwit without mandatory block size increase = OK!  But no stalling!!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:46:05
That's good, didn't know they had a separate branch for Canada.  Just frustrated and ready to advance
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:57:09
Kind of a stupid statement.  Depends where you are.  Smart may offer better internet in some places but not where I am.  I wish!
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:41:46
Well at least your honest
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:27:00
I agree totally.  Core please put the software in prospective and make it user friendly to the max.  Your time has come and its ready for you to shine.  LukeJr make sure to pass the news!
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:36:19
When side chains are ready to go.  Just read about Moonbeam, wow, sounds very promising and soon ready to go
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:14:43
The fees are a result of one company = Bitmain!  You either stop your complaining or do any and everything to support the adoption of Segwit and the evolution of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:55:24
That may be true, but the btc thread is too far out there.  I don't support Jihan, Ver or anyone else who has anything to say good about Bitmain or BU!  So I'll hang out here
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:13:30
I don't trust "GMaxwell"  you have done what you can for Jihan in slowing down the progress of BIP 148.  Hope you were well paid!
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:26:00
Wow this is so tough!  Do I go with bitcoin tech evolution and the health of the entire bitcoin network?  Or do I support 1 company trying everything it can to stop bitcoin in its tracks, keep fees sky high and prevent bitcoin from ever reaching its full potential?  Hmmm, wow, hmmmm
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:37:37
I love watching you Bitmain Shills running for cover, but dam there is no place to hide.  Maybe you can have your China coin and your cake too, oh but wait, your china coin will be worthless so you will have to find some way else to pay for the cake, lmfao
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:28:42
Good, another problem solved.  Thanks for the update
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:12:25
Hey you are either for Luke or Jihan.  I'll have to take core
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:57:18
I hope you realize that UASF is the only way that anything is going to get done.  So if it takes 6 months = so what!!  Listen to Jihan and the big blockers and you are just listening to the wind = nothing will ever happen.  So am I for progress = YES!!  So bitch about the fees or do something about it!  UASF solves the problem and come August 1 we will all see.  Thanks for the input
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:42:32
If Bitmain is on board = it's time to jump ship!!
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:00:05
You mean the one that Bitmain signed!  Oh I am behind the "Users Consensus 2017 effort"  = UASF!!
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:00:29
Wow, that's neat!!
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:32:15
Sorry but Gmaxwell has done more to hurt the UASF movement than anyone.  So why would I think any different?
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:08:35
Find out on August 1, just remember a fool and his btc are soon departed!
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:03:24
How cool!  My favorite line from the article = However GPU mining has seen a massive resurgence over the past little while due to the rising popularity of ASIC resistent coins.  Hmmm, seems the whole world is looking at holding back the "Yellow Tide of Bitmain"!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:09:01
Don't a paid shill could disagree with that logic!
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:58:23
Yeah, if it wasn't for my Tatoo I'd be without, so thank you Globe.  Now if only Google would fill the earth with good wifi
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:06:22
Wow, I hope you are right!  But are you thinking that Bitmain is going to fold and start supporting Segwit?  Or are you saying that it will take a day or two to force the corrupt miners into submission?  So you may be right, it may not activate until August 2 or 3.  Either way let the miners be damed!!!  Right On Bro!!
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:30:00
UASF is the only way to put bitcoin back on track and enable tech evolution!  All the negative shill action that is bought and paid for can't stop it!!  Your days are numbered and if you don't like it = GOOD!!
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:22:21
Hey Bitcoin_Charlie, Please give me some more info on this dune buggy.  It is on the top of my want list.  But I really need your help with more info so one day I can make my wish a reality.  Thanking you in advance for any info you will share on your great ride
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:10:31
with fees like this = Bitcoin can never be a true use case for most of the world.  Bitmain must be stopped or Bitcoin will die a slow death.  UASF is the only way to bring forth the evolution of bitcoin and put an end to Jihans greed and corruption.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:06:38
As slow and as expensive as bitcoin has become (thanks solely to Bitmain and their cartel of miners), it is no wonder that this company has done away with Bitcoin as a payment option. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:50:06
Yeh, I have no use for him!
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:17:59
You would prefer "Status Quo"  = you are just as much of the problem with bitcoin as Jihan.  Sounds to me like your a lazy person who just doesn't want to learn how to handle the evolution of Bitcoin.  But you are correct about 1 thing = come August 1 your gonna learn all about it!
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:34:30
I agree with you, but any post like this is going to get a lot of negative shill action.  So just be ready. Maybe we just need a BIP 148 UASF reddit??  Anyway, I do hope that come August 1 we get to find out!
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:58:22
Nope, I see all of the new tech and bitcoin being able to evolve without ever a need for a hard fork.  
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:46:02
In Luke I trust!!  Jihan either enable Segwit or go to HELL!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:20:22
Good point and Ecuador outlawed bitcoin a long time ago
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:06:14
I have to use the "KISS" principle here
Positive = (yes UASF) Robust massive adoption through tech evolution.
Negative = (no UASF) a slow and agonizing death.
All this comes down to is do you support centralized constrictive mining and control by one person and company = Bitmain.  Or do you support Bitcoin and all it stands for.  Plain and simple
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:33:50
I wish I had a choice, but I don't and have to just be thankful that I have what I have.  Can't wait till another option is available, but for now Globe is all I have
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:11:37
Maybe so, do you own any?  Remember your post.  There are only 2 possible outcomes to this story.  1  = Bitcoin fails and goes to 0, 2 = goes up higher than your wildest dreams.  Are you really going to chance it?  
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:13:58
3 different players all trying out for the same job = King of Bitcoin!  And all the users are to just bow down and kiss their feet!  Hmmmm, August 1 you 3 jerks find out what bitcoin is really all about!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:09:15
Your only off about 100 years
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:28:39
No way, tech is evolving rapidly, a hard fork may be in the future but no way is is 100% guaranteed
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:32:16
Are you kidding me!  They control 70% of the mining hardware out there with there kill switch to turn them off if they don't comply!  You are either part of the solution or part of bitmains buddy's.  Take it or leave it!
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:10:34
It goes beyond that!  Look at all the action on the network.  The bitcoin tech can't handle the traffic and the Mining Cartel is loving every minute of it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:36:26
BIP 148 is the only way to go.  I'd rather bitcoin die than to submit to Jihan and Bitmain.  Hey if that's the way it has to be, so be it.  UASF or die!
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:29:43
How centralized can it get when 1 company controls what happens to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:53:01
That sounds good and smart!  I am already retired so I'm all BTC.  When my son told me about bitcoin - I saw 2 options for me = 1 - I can live happy investing in bitcoin and it going to "0".  But 2 - I can't live through another one of those (if only I had done this) opportunities that go to the moon and refused to give it a try.  Hope that makes sense
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:19:15
That's great, thanks for posting
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:44:06
For this to be correct it needs to be dated 3 years ago.  It's so sad when some idiot can post junk like this!
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:06:48
Are you nuts?  With fees and backlog on the bitcoin network the way it is now = no way!
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:28:35
This makes it seem like Jihan has some very powerful and well paid friends on the core team.  If this is true then core no longer cares for the growth and evolution of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:27:07
Doesn't matter what you say.  You have proved time and time again = you can't be trusted!  Your just a loser in waiting!
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:16:26
Good, if your that dam dumb, you deserve to lose it all!!
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:30:13
nothing would surprise me.  I can't jump ship.  But if the negative comments about the UASF from the core team are true.  It may be time for the rats to leave the sinking bitcoin ship.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:35:42
Your gonna find out!  UASF is the only way.  HooRay!!
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:02:48
Wow, so sad, I had some btc and sold it all for a loss as the price went down and now can't afford to get back in.  Good luck to all who held
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:01:10
I love these kind of posts = The shills can't help but try their best to stop "The Crazy Train" to UASF - All Aboard!!
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:00:46
Agreed, miners get paid to mine, not think!!  UASF is just the best way forward in the evolution of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:02:38
I love it!  Top one = Fork your Mother
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:05:25
As long as miners control bitcoin = this will be the norm.  UASF on August 1 will change all of that, one way or another!  Bitmain must be stopped, that's all that matters!
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:45:55
Thank you Luke for all you do.  Greg, jihan and roger are very proud of you
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:29:53
Oh ye of little faith!  Dam you sound like Chicken Little = Oh the sky is falling!!  Maybe you need to chill or shill, hahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:57:14
I love these kind of posts!  I am for UASF and anything that will stop and disrupt Bitmain in any way!!
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:12:46
I love it!!  Give me UASF or give me death!!
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:32:59
No big dam deal!  UASF will be like a dam breaking = everything will change, so these things are only temporary.  Unless you support Jihan = you see the results and are happier every day that Segwit is delayed!
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:36:02
Dam, the shills really came out against this!  They have to do something to earn a few pesos!  Your either for UASF and bitcoin or your for Jihan and Bitmain!!  Pretty simple even for a stupid shill!!
