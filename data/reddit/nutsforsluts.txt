I'm living everyday like a hustle
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:47:01
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:12:59
PM me...I'll tell you where to send your coins to
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:18:39
500 000 by next week! I'm going for that self fulfilling prophecy shit....
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:01:18
Just PM me with your bankaccount number and transfer your coins to my walletcode....I will transfer the cash ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:15:57
Depends...What coins do you own? And do you wanna go mobile, paper or hardware?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:14:34
Store it in a wallet, trade on GDAX, never sell for dollar....it's easy
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:03:39
They can try....But bitcoin is bigger than the US
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:33:50
I don't live in any of those countries....yet when I travelled to australia I didn't arrive there with US dollars.....
If people don't take the time to inform themselves before buying crypto than maybe it's still too early for them to be in the market...
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:54:48
Depends on how fast you want your shit to move 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:03:01
mid 2018? Bitch please....it will be 20k mid next week.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:41:18
is possible english?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:06:38
Fuck yes! At every lame xmas and NYE-party there will be 1 family member talkin bout those internetcoins....During hangovers the next day people will check and try it out....Get ready for 30k before the end of january
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:09:18
The man said HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:26:38
Same goes for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and East Caribbean dollars. Shit just confuses newcomers to the dollar
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:19:07
I have my bitcoins in bread...it's oldschool but I still like the simplicity. Otherwise Jaxx is my pick....Just google around, all are fine...just get your coins out off coinbase as fast as you can and don't forget to write down your phrases and hide em 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:28:51
If you could really predict ups and downs you should already be filthy rich just from oldschool stockmarkets..... don't be naieve....Just buckle up and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:14:20
wisdom of crowds doesn't work if you ask a bunch of circlejerkers I think
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:11:24
HOLY SHIT I completelly forgot I still had bitcoin gold linked to my private keys!! I'm getting crunk tonight!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:42:41
I agree with your point...just felt like it needed a bit of nuancing. I think if you want to get into bitcoin it only takes a 3 minute google-session to have a look at the different cryptos out there....I feel like if you're too lazy to get your shit straight before making decisions about your money...you shouldn't be entitled to easy earnings
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:40:48
Have you tried waiting for the transaction to be finished?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:55:16
Wouldn't work with the current transaction fees...
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:38:17
Just wait till we have 40% dips at 100k pricepoints. You got the balls for that?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:43:05
Don't force others into this. Inform them, help them inform themselves and let them make their own studies. If you have no clue about transaction fees then you shouldn't be getting other people into this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:48:12
She was bleeding a little bit but overall we both had fun
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:52:26
I'm telling you: McAfee is 2 sacks of shit stacked on top of eachother in a suit
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:01:42
Can't really tell for sure...I don't move my coins around a lot so low fees is not a priority for me
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:03:50
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:05:48
As long as you don't look Bitcoin is both up and down
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:50:04
Prices Will rise. My friend told me And he’d like crazysmart
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:45:52
Or send me bitcoins directly...I will activate lightning for them And send you the link
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:58:26
