So... if I interpret something differently from other people instead of engaging them and learning from each other and finding a resolution/compromise... or not, it's OK for me to just enforce my definition on other people? That sounds a lot more similar to government action than taking steps to retrieve your stolen property

You can buy 16.5 BTC for that much no problem.
You could possibly mine 1.7 in a week, but not likely. Optimistically it would take you 5 - 7 weeks to mine 16.5 BTC. A lot could happen. I'd buy the coins

I don't see why that would happen. It's not like people think fiat is the currency of war/bombs

Please read my entire post

I would disagree.
The price of a commodity always moves toward the price it costs to create. 
If the price doubles that does not affect the block space, cost of miners, electricity, etc. Miners will need lower fees to cover their costs.

Because paying people to physically scan documents does not scale. 
See: US medical scanning industry.
Also, it relies entirely on a US Government externality to exist.

Never heard of Outbox.
The idea was poor - opening and scanning letters to digitize them? I would have paid the $5 just to have someone filter my normal snail mail. Yeah, it would cost $60 a year but I would actually see the two or three letters a year that matter
@_date: 2016-05-17 19:53:01
I disagree with this.
Attempting to shoe horn tomorrow's ideas into today's paradigms are wrong. I'm being blunt but we can't look backwards to figure out what to innovate for tomorrow. We're moving away from Democracy - it's already proven to be a failed and despotic system that inflicts heaps of misery and suffering on people. 
This technology was not invented to lift a failed civic up from the muck. It was invented to lift the people who are beaten down into the muck by these systems.

Eh, yeah I appreciate your point. I think that there is a fallacy that sometimes people assume just doing something is better than doing nothing.

Bitcoin does enable you to send money instantly.

Because when/if they try it will fail.
It is a non issue. Blanket wire tapping already dumps most of us in a database. I guarantee you, anything public that is proposed or asking for permission is already happening. Making it 'legal' just makes it easier for Leo to nab you.
Regardless, these people can't even get simple websites correct. Good luck forcing Bitcoin users to voluntarily register. We are smarter than them

Stop thinking government matters
@_date: 2016-07-20 22:49:36
How about this: If you don't understand it, don't put your savings into it.
Secondly, I don't owe you an or anyone else an explanation. Especially when there are people who pursue degrees on this topic and still fail. It's called an externality. At some point I stop giving a fuck about you and you have to do it yourself. Not only did I point you in the proper direction, I set you up such that all you need is a strong password/passphrase and you'll be fine. But fuck you anyway.

Public perception? Who gives a fuck? The majority of people are idiots. They'll never understand email, their perspective on email doesn't matter. Why would Bitcoin magically differ?
Government acceptance as a marketing move is really fucking desperate. And a fucking stupid idea.

I propose a bip to return the network back to when that exploit caused a bazillion Bitcoin to be generated.

Essentially, every number between 0 and 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140 is a valid private key.
There's a really big shortcut hidden in there if you think about it ;)
@_date: 2016-07-20 06:56:19
SHA256(*anything*) = private key
Then all you need to remember is anything. 
Better: Buy a laptop from a garage sale for $5. Install any Linux on a usb drive. Clone a copy of Bitcore. Boot to Linux. 
SHA256(anything) &lt;- this is your private key. Use Bitcore to gen your Pubkey/Address.
Record Address.
If you airgap the laptop the only things that ever knew that private key exists is your mind and that laptop. Destroy the laptop.
You have an Address to a private key that is as secure as something you can remember. It's called a Brainwallet.
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:24:41
Yeah, but you would be better off actually learning how addresses work so you could save yourself a lot of trouble
