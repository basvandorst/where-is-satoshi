I guess I really don't understand.
I thought the purpose was to have coins where the key was on  a device.  I would transmit a transaction that says if coins not moved by a specific date or block height. Then spend coins to this pre-planned address of which I already have the key to hidden somewhere else. That way if I lost the first wallet and key I would just wait for them to be spent to my backup key. 
Do I have this completely wrong?

The difficulty has risen quite a bit since then the miners are not making the same profit that they were then. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 04:11:28
So you have a hardware wallet and a backup key hidden somewhere else. If anyone ever makes a payment to the address of the backup key it would always be immediately spendable  right.?
CSV seems to give you more precision as to when the funds would be spendable by the backup key but you would still know the absolute block height if you used CLTV.

Neither of you understand what a short is then.  The idea is to borrow bitcoin with a promise of returning them in the future.  You then sell the borrowed btc and sell it slowly on the marketto get maximum value.  If you can crash the market to near 0 or 0 then you pay back with now worthless btc and keep the rest.  With the advent of the cash futures market starting this Sunday then the return for shorting while knowing when the market will fail could make you rich beyond even my wildest dreams.

If you can blackmail the Chinese president then we have bigger problems  :)  Your arguments requiring a large miner that is a bad actor does not take into the economic cost to get to this position or why you would waste all of that money to harm the network rather than reap the rewards for honest participation as has been the case for what I can remember of the bitcoin history.  I believe this is also one of the basic plans that miners will do economically what is in their best interest.


At some point the slowest people will have to be kicked off the network or the network would be constrained to the lowers possible denominator of cpu bandwidth storage.  The trade off in kicking off the lowest is economic growth Ie more transaction.  there is a limit though and at some point if blocks become to big then the network will suffer and the market will shift toward some other crypto or the miners will control the growth to maintain their investment.
We have gotten pretty far afield of my statement that BU is not validationless mining.  This I still stand by.  I also believe that using orphaning to punish larger blocks can work.  Luckily there is ongoing simulation by one of the BU devs and hopefully we can have some data to support future discussion.

@_date: 2016-12-02 11:43:51
The miners are free to set a minimum fee.   This should be the cost to them to add another transaction.   The cost is a metric of many things like orphan rate,  bandwidth, storage and many other influences.   The miner is free to make up this minimum fee for themselves and this should cause more competitive fees not 0 fee.  Bitcoin would have more fees at a lower rate. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:04:53


so the attack requires a non trivial amount of the network to collude to preform and only the attacker gets the reward?  seems dubious.


the security of the network is exactly the same as the difficulty has not changed and the same amount of hash power has the same possibility of creating a double spend.  


So if there is a persistent chain split then clients and users should use a higher block threshold for acceptance as valid( during the split).  This has ben the stated by developers in the past when there was a concern for a reorg.


And the 30% miner will be orphaned 2/3rds of the time.  where is the economic use case for this kind of behavior potentially loosing 2 blocks of reward for a single block attack.  And since these blocks have to be sent and published to the chain the bad actor would be outed very quickly.


The small miner is ignoring the large block that takes longer to validate as it is greater than the EB. They are building on the smaller blocks generated by the other 70% of the network.  Again orphaning the larger block 2/3rds of the time creating a significant loss to the attacking 30% miner. this is not economically rational if you have 30% of the hash power.  It is better to produce blocks very close to the what the rest of the network can handle and reap the profits.
@_date: 2016-12-04 03:36:48
I do understand what sybil means.   My point is that this is no different with the current core code modified code or the BU code.   If you control the information to the lite client having partitioned it from the network then you can still send them any information that you want.   Greg tries to equate BU with validationless mining.  In fact BU validates all of the transactions the same way as core.  BU just allows for a larger block and penalizes miners with increases orphan rate due to slow propagation of large blocks if the block is too large for the local settings.   I'm sure that Greg knows that BU still validates all transactions and would ignore a block sent to it with fake transactions.

Since your in med school you are going to make more money in the future.   This will make your tax return have greater scrutiny.   IMO If you file correctly now then the irs will have less ammo if you get audited in the future.   An amended return is not very difficult to file.   Currently you have time and smarts to learn how to file.   I agree with based on your income and stated gains you are unlikely to have a large payment.   I have been in a similar situation and have filed multiple years amended due to irs guidance changing/becoming clearer.   It was painless compared to what I suspect an audit will feel like.

@_date: 2016-12-09 22:59:41
As an example. There is an international bank account rule by the IRS that states something like.  Any foreign accounts must be reported to the IRS if not all tax returns are open to review for all years up from the date they find out about the account all the way back to the opening of the account.    Let's say you traded at bitstamp in 2011 now it's 2028 you have been making a large amount of money as a doctor and have significantly more complicated taxes due to your in reused income.   So a strict reading could be that... If they find out about the bitstamp account because bitstamp applied for and received that bank licensing that they have been wort on.   Then bitstamp opens the books to the government.   Now all of your returns are auditable all the way back to 2011.  How much do you think it will cost to defend a 17 year audit even if you don't have to didn't do anything wrong and have to pay...   Tax people are expensive as you have found out.    My plan is to not give the IRS any leverage if possible.

All mined blocks are moved through the the relay network.   Many of the nodes in this network do not mine and limit the propagation of large blocks thus increasing the orphan rate.   This mechanism is the control.  


Again I ask what is the right amount of security for the network and what metric do  you use to calculate it..   Just controlling the block size and hoping you picked the right amount of control doesn't seem like a better idea 
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:53:22
I am certainly no expert but ill try to explain how I think it is supposed to work.




1:  If a miner makes a block larger than the EB  (Excessive Block size)  then this block will not be relayed to other nodes on the network untill it is included in a chain that is longer than the AD (Aceptance Depth).  If the block is not relayed the the rest of the network will not see this block and build on another likely smaller block.  An attacker is only helped by the portion of the network that follows the chain with the excessive block not the whole network. 




See  above - the block is only added if it is valid and it is either smaller than the EB value or part of a chain longer than the AD value  BU still validates all transactions and is not validation less mining




Since orphaning is such a problem this is a good method to use to consrtain the size of a block as you say orphans ar bad for the network so a miner is incentivized  to not have any orphans.
A miner will make small enlargements of the block to avoid orphaning. 


Only the large miner is penalized with the higher orphaning rate.  The larger block is delayed in propagation thus increasing that blocks orphan rate.  The small miner has nothing to fear as there blocks are propagated fast through all nodes as long as the block is smaller than the EB




Local settings on a BU network do control orphan rates as they delay large blocks ( greater than the EB setting ) and propagate smaller blocks (smaller than the EB setting) as fast as possible.
Hopefully you are still reading and can critique my understanding.  This is a very difficult topic.
Edit formatting still getting the hang of the reddit quoting.

The opposite is also true that the other 7 nodes that this lite client is connected to are giving the line client good information.   Ie the client should compare the multiple nodes and decide if there is a larger percentage reporting information and use the largest percentage of information to base its decision on.


This is already true with the current network.   If a bad actor can spin up enough nodes to sibyl l the lite client the bad actor can send any bad information that it wants.   This is not different to in the current network or a BU implementation.
Yep Greg in your last paragraph...  If you give all of your security to someone else then you should expect your security do be diminished.   This again is not specific to the current network,  the BU network as it might become or just the real world generalized.  
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:13:26






So if the miner is big enough to set up a partitioned network with thousands of sybil nodes.   They can also run code with a difficulty change that allows them to appear as a larger miner and send you any info that they want.   It is still only good as long as they keep up the sybil network and your lite client is kept in the dark.   How is BU  different from the current case in mining? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:06:26
No one knows what the cost is it may  very small but there is a cost.   A very small cost x a large number of transactions equals a security fee.  The security fee will be market driven based on the cost to the miners and the concerns of the people using the network.   If there is a market sense that the security is to  low people will move to another chain or call for higher fees to create more mining and  more security.   The miners have a huge capital investment to  safeguard. Why do you think a fee planned under artificial market force is the right fee.?How much security is the right amount to secure the network.? By what metric do you calculate the security fee? 
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:21:22
I think that in your above example if a 3.5 block is mined it will not be relayed by the other 95% of the network.   The only way a light client will have the wrong chain is if they only connect to this one miner.   Since it is very unlikely that a 5%miner will get 2 blocks in a row let alone 3 the other 95% of the network will continue to mine smaller than 3 MB blocks and as soon as the smaller block but faster building chain has more work then the 5% miner the 5% miner will have his chain reorganized and the light client will see the correct chain.

We are in a thread stating that the op  is priced out of usage due to fees.  The person you were directly responding to is stating that the fees to consolidate many small mining outputs (likely from pool mining) is to expensive. 
 Currently it is more difficult to consolidate these transactions. There are a tremendous amount of unspent outputs that cannot be spent since the fee makes it impossible to include in a transaction,  unless more is spent in mining fee than will be avaliable after the transaction.  Just a little while ago these unspent tiny transactions could be consolidated for a much lower fee or no fee at all.  
Having to use an automated script to resend transactions multiple time with the hope of confirmation but the expectation that it will not is the definition of what I would consider spam.  There are worse versions of spam.

Fractional reserve works because the bank is loaning out money in excess of money that has been received in deposit.  So that money does not actually exist except on the banking ledger system.  This fake money can be spent out of someone else's account and used to buy goods and services.  The fake money circulates through the economy.  
Bitcoin cannot be loaned out as a fake bitcoin, nor can it be artificially generated outside the blockchain.  Since there are a fixed number of bitcoins, a bitcoin servicer could not loan out more bitcoins than it had received.  Therefore there could be no fractional reserve banking for bitcoins.

Please show me a wallet that accepts goxcoins. A store that accepts goxcoins.
If you deposit btc at coinbase there is no guarantee that you can get them back.  Everyone has heard throughout if you don't hold the private ideas they are not your btc.   There are no new tokens if there is a run on a fictional fractional coinbase they fail completely.  There is no bailing out the "bank" because the coins are gone.
A future btc bank with loans could possibly get deposits with a locked deposit scheme. The depositor would contractually locked from removing the deposit for say 10 years with a contractually agreed upon return. Then the "bank" could loan out btc for term and return. The person receiving the loan would need to show a method of generating btc to pay back the loan over the term.  If at any time the loan is defaulted upon the depositor is out of luck.   If the "bank" is large enough it may be able to absorb some defaults from the interest gained on other loans.  At no time is this bank able to create fractional btc.  They may be able to create a "bank token" but this token has no use in the btc economy.  If the bank fails the token fails and the btc economy is not effected.

Ok so at the bottom of the page you linked you can change the time and type of chart displayed.  Play with it.  What I see is that the average daily volume in USD has gone up significantly since 2013 and was up over 2012.  This is the volume that you suggested was the best metric for measurement.  If the year over year USD volume is going up the the utility is increasing. That is what the chart is showing if you pick a longer time frame.

What it shows is that transaction volume in the second worst bear market is flat .  The utility of the network is working better than last year....

I am not even talking about side chains here.  The statement made by Luke up a few comments is "If only miners can run nodes, they would just agree to accept that theft as valid, and there would be nothing you could do about it."  on the original btc blockchain the only way for a miner to steal funds would to be to falsify a transaction and include it in a block.  The statement says that if the miners are the only ones that can parse the blockchain then they can fake any and all transactions. 
I state that if even a single other entrance parse the block chain that entity can show the false transaction,  the community would see the fake transaction and note that the chain was no longer safe or immutable,  and there would be a massive sell off.

This is not a new bitcoin brought into existence. It is either a token at bitshares or It is a loaned btc that is being loaned for interest.
The entire time you have to trust bitshares that their ledger is correct and will be up held.

Why would jihan spam the network to push through segwit if he was opposed to it.  It would seem that if the network was being spammed to force an increase in blocksize and the spam stopped when the scaling solution was locked in then the persons responsible would have been in favor not resisting the block increase. 
 To me I am worried why someone thinks they had to spam the network to push through a scaling solution?

That is the definition of structuring. In the US it will get you into trouble faster than being a drug kingpin. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:07:21
If you ask them about structuring and then do it you are guilty of it.  You have structured your deposits in the past.  If the government goes through your accounts and connects the dots you will be lucky to get away with a fine.   Be very careful about structuring your deposits it is a very east way to get into trouble.  
There are a lot of things that the bank reports that they cannot even tell you about..... By law. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:36:12
It is a crazy law.  [things like this happen all the time.] ( 
If they can show the reason was to avoid the report then your toast.  I suspect your statement here( I know about the $10,000 thing, so I kept withdraws to around $6000 each time.)  would be enough to get a confiscation of your account at the bank if you get anyone in the government mad at you.

Even with pruning some nodes will choose to keep the entire chain.  Esp people concerned with keeping the chain honest and governments so they can get a exact cut of the pie.

Would this not require all of the miners to agree to the theft? If a portion of the miners (or anyone that was validating) would published the theft then the value would plummet thus hurting all of the miners. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:00:29
I agree that they could do it at 51 percent,  but the people unable to monitor the chain in your scenario would be told of the attack (by the percent that is not attacking ) and the value of all coins on any chain connected would plummet. 
Again economic incentives would control miner behavior.

If you are  always concerned about worst case scenarios then you can't fly in a plane, drive a car,  or walk down the street.  These are all dangerous to life today. 
Some company like Google with the resources to monitor the chain and the integrity to be believed will exist long before the chain is too large to monitor. 
This simple fact will keep the chain safe since any concerns stated by this single trusted monitor ( or more likely many trusted monitors) would cause a catastrophic loss of value in the chain. This implied loss of value is what keeps the miners honest.   It has been working for the last few years.

It's nice to see a conversation not stoop to name name calling and remain informative.
