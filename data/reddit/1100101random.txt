There are just a very very very few people in under developed countries that know about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And these people are not the poorest.

Selling today with the actual price wouldn't mean losing money for most people. If you sell with a profit now and it keeps rising now, you still made profit.

What do u mean with worldwide? Bitcoin is borderless.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:21:16
Yes. Stupid, but a winner.

Do you have some examples? This must be hosted wallets then?

What? For an hour? Have you called the Bitcoin support hotline?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:57:29
Or use the Trezor app for your phone:

Mempool got cleaned up a bit. Still 0.50$ isn't that cheap either.

May I ask in which part of the world you live?
Where I live probably 10 places accept Bitcoin, Millions accept just fiat (not even a credit card).
Even if I convince the 78 year old lady selling fruits at the market to accept Bitcoin, she would have no idea what to do with it and where to spend it.
All I could do is to eat at 2 different restaurants and sleep in a creepy hostel.

You can link it and interact with it or just watch it. Afaik with mycelium Segwit is not supported yet, so you might only be able to see the legacy account.

OK, my honest respect for that. But for example in Southeast-Asia, where I live, absolutely not possible.
But yes, here is a small movement trying to get Cryptos in general more accepted. But it's not possible to live only with it. Rent, electricity, groceries, can't pay any of that with cryptos.

Does you computer has wifi? Then use your mobile phone as a hotspot.

Any chance Exodus was installed on this computer before?

What if he has no fiat left?
If you want Bitcoin to succeed, you need people to be able to use it. If you want people to use it, you need to make compromises.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:53:43
Well in crypto-space Bitcoin is more on the comfortable side.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:56:54
That is what I mean. Living in Europe, where Bitcoin is much more accepted, makes it much easier than living somewhere in the province in SEA.

I only own a Ledger and you are right, it could be more user friendly, but I don't really have a big problem with it. I once had problems connecting to MEW, but it might have been a problem with my Mac or cable.
What I like about the Ledger is the development and integration of new coins. I love the Ark wallet and looking forward to Neo and Qtum which should come this month.

Banks will adapt Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
And people might need that.
Right now people that own cryptos are their own banks, but many people don't realise the risk and responsibility they have, because they have to trust themselves.
Just read a couple of hours in some reddit subs or facebook groups and see how many mistakes people do without admitting that it is mostly their own fault.  
Most people don't want that responsibility. They might want to have a BTC account at their bank, where they feel more secure, but they don't want all their money "on some USB stick" and write down 24 words which they will never find again.

Tell him you invest 1000$, but only if he locks up 1200$ for you in case it won't double. So you have at least a small gain.
If it doubles, you will give him 500$. If he is sure that it's working, he would do it and you cant lose.

But he is a friend, so he needs something to convince him. Unfortunately (luckily) I don't have this kind of Ponzi friends.

1. How is coinbase a trusted exchange?
2. How does a hardware wallet protect you from replay attacks?

There is something called calculator.

Have them translated into Chinese as well. It would nicer and gives another layer of encryption.

I guess in most ways you buy Bitcoin with debit?

I haven't checked all 23 videos yet, but I assume.it will be a good selection and definitely a good starting point for someone to get into it.
But... It's not really what I expected when I heard "ELI5". I thought it's a website where you explain in your own words (and pictures) what Bitcoin is.

Compared to 7k it's not high. But if you would buy a coffee for 2$, it would be almost 10%.

Some people also thought it's too late to invest in apple when Forrest Gump got his shares of "some kind of fruit company" in 1994.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:08:15
You might have the wrong perspective here.
If you buy a coffee at Starbucks for $4, it's worth $4. But you could also not buy the coffee and buy for $4 Bitcoin, because in your calculation the coffee would cost $80.
So you should stop spending any money, stop eating, drinking, paying rent, because you could change all that money into Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:28:01
Totally agree.

You don't need to have your ledger connected, after you signed the message (and broadcasted it to the network).
