UFC and a hackathon would certainly target different demographics. Why not both? The more exposure the better

As a merchant, this is something that people often forget. I am trying to integrate bitcoin into my website now because I hate paypal's fees. And yes, ebay and paypal do cost me more, and therefore increase the price I can offer to the consumer!
Bitcoin is much better in that respect

"Let's see here... I've offered to exchange USD 133.50 and in exchange you have offered me one paper clip, a half eaten Kitkat bar, and 25 Yen. I respectfully decline your offer."

Great job Op. Hopefully next week this will be my post! Still working on it
@_date: 2014-09-09 13:55:36
But... I really have had bad experiences with paypal.

Amazon charges a lot of fees. That's what happens when you have the big platform, you get to call the shots

Oh, I thought he was serious. It seems like there is a lot of vitriol in this thread toward China. As a guy living there, I think it would only be good news for the community if more people used Bitcoin here on a regular basis
@_date: 2014-05-18 06:54:46
Exactly. I don't want to use paypal's services if I can avoid it. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:06:34
How did you continue to promote your business to bitcoin users? I haven't made my post announcing my accepting bitcoin, but if you have any tips to offer I am all ears 
I am pretty new to bitcoin, so i don't want to step on any toes

Every time I have cross-border transaction paypal takes an even bigger cut; It drives me insane since I have customers in 50 countries or so.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:12:36
Anyone doing frequent international transactions runs into these kinds of ugly transaction fees and conversion rates. They are terrible.
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:25:36
I agree. They are not 100% bad. And they do indeed offer a service I need, but often with higher fees and more hassle than is desirable. I am definitely not saying they are without value. They have value too. 
In a perfect world, my customers would use bitcoin. In reality, very few do. But it is a slow process of change - will be interesting to see how it plays out.

Well said. The overall point here is to bring better transparency an community organization that involves everyone, rather than a select group of people who control the system behind closed doors

That's what I'm talking bout. Every month I see my international "cross border" just killing me! Almost done with my bitcoin integration on my site

As a guy who lives in China and whose nearest grocery store is a Wal-Mart....damnit.

For me, consumer adoption is key. I started allowing bitcoin on my site a month or so ago as a test, and still haven't had but a couple of people utilize it. Most of my users still use Paypal.
For me, Paypal is much worse, since I lose several % in fees, more if international users buy, and I have a huge amount of international customers.
If consumers adopted bitcoin in a broader way it would make a big impact for me, and I suspect I am not the only small business person out there with this situation.
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:00:16
Not yet, but i have considered it since it might help. But really, it would not be too substantial. Most of my margins are pretty low as is. I would likely be using the extra few percent different from paypal.
@_date: 2014-05-06 04:45:31
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:15:46
I am all for bitcoin, but did you notice the last four decades of relative stability? Bitcoin has difficulty stringing together one year without volatility. And I am not saying that bitcoin doesn't have potential to be stable, just that your argument does not make any sense.
