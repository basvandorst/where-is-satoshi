I do this all the time to send money to Venezuela where US dollars are illegal. 
Just think of Bitcoin as the transfer medium. If they have a way to exchange the Bitcoin to their local currency (or buy goods/services in Bitcoin) then sending the money is essentially an instant transfer. Since it is instant, volatility is not a factor. 
You just have to compare the fees to change your funds into Bitcoin + tbeir fees to change it out of Bitcoin (Bitcoin transaction fee as well, but that is nominal). If it's lower than your alternate method, it makes sense. If not, you have to ask if it makes sense for other reasons (speed, anonymity, etc).

As fun as this sounds, and as happy as people would be to get free money, I'm going to be the contrarian in the group and suggest you do something else.
Try investing your money into a new business. There has to be some entrepreneurial idea tickling the back of your mind you've always wanted to explore. Now is your chance to dive in and try it. For example, I've got an idea for a website using crypto that competes with eBay - but I'd have to pay a bit to get it up and running. Whether it's a burger restaurant or a new startup, I'm sure you'll could do some good with a focus on solving some problem.
Or, find some charities to donate to like the pineapple fund guy a few days ago.
You will always find people eager to take free money. It's a little tougher using money to make the world a better place.
But, it's your coin. If you want to pull off a treasure hunt, just make it awesome!

Sorry, I think I wasn't clear. I meant when an average end user like me ends up finding out they can't do a transaction without getting into the depths of controlling inputs and outputs (which I still do not understand, despite being - in my opinion - well informed on bitcoin for a non-techie guy) that it is not going to be able to be used widely by the average person. 
Say I send a transaction with the wrong fee, and find it is being delayed hours and hours. Right now, there is no push mechanism to increase the fee, or child-pays-parent, or any such mechanism in place. Not friendly to the end user.

That's because of the inflated natures of the currency. Venezuela, for example, has a government mandated exchange rate that is nearly 10x below what dollars are actually trading for on the black market. Anyone who exchanges currency legally automatically loses money on the transaction. Plus, countries like this put controls on their citizens of how much money they can send or exchange outside the country. All this means no foreign investment and no ability of the citizens to adapt. It is reprehensible.

Immigrant in the USA works and wants to send money back to family at home:
Option 1: Western Union with $20+ fees per remittance.
Option 2: Bank transfer with $40+ fees for remittance, plus the recipient needs a bank to receive the money. Not practical.
Option 3: Find someone moving back to the country and send them with cash/goods. Largely impractical.
Option 4: Convert dollars to bitcoin (coinvert?) and send it for a few pennies. 
The only problem with with option 4 is that the bitcoin has to have value for the receiver - either to exchange back into the local currency or to purchase goods with. Localbitcoins can do some of this, but currently this is still a novelty.
However, if what this poster alleges is true, it will become more and more profitable because bitcoins themselves will be seen as units of value, not just the ability to trade them for local currency. 
For instance, phone cards are a huge industry for immigrants in the US - you buy a prepaid card with a code that allows you call internationally, so that you can call weird exotic locations for less than paying for long distance on a phone service. The cards themselves are sometimes traded as currency because they have value to those who make these calls. By more immigrants using bitcoin to send money, the bitcoin itself would gain value in a similar manner.

But this relies on a local guy signed up with localbitcoins. There isn't enough demand there yet to make this easy. What will make more people signed up as bitcoin exchangers? Demand. 
Again, the chicken and egg. It will start small and grow, I hope. But for many of these places it isn't there yet. Another poster here alluded to the crack in the dam analogy. I think that is a pretty apt description. All it takes is enough to get going, then the floodgates will follow. 
Right now, immigrants send billions back to their home countries. Once it becomes practical to do this with bitcoin, there is no reason not to use it: it costs less, it is quicker, and it is more convenient. 
I think the only hurdles left are the exchanges on the recipient side that would make it practical, and any pending government intervention that would look to squash it once it realizes that people are sending money without paying taxes or giving homage to the government somehow.

Can't speak for everyone, but the cloud mining option is the reason I am on CEX.io and then subsequently mine with Ghash.
The BTC to GHs is their best feature, in my opinion. Everything else is secondary. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:15:03
If this is true, this represents the first real competitor to CEX.io that I have heard of. 
Lets say I have 0.07 BTC to spend. At CEX, that currently buys about 1 GH/s of mining, and they charge about $.26 per month for it. You are saying I could buy 15GH/s for that same price, and they automatically reinvest in new equipment? 
I suppose the only thing to wonder about is their hosting fee. Not knowing their power usage, how much of a chunk does that hosting fee eat up?

This is a good question. Thanks for being respectful to a newbie. I'm trying to follow this as best I can. My intent in the "so I won't" comment was to say I'll just continue with them for lack of better options. I like the idea of cloud mining and they are the best service out there right now. My small portion of hash power is not enough to make a significant dent in the likelihood of a 51% attack (I own a whopping 4 USB antminers). The rest of my hash power is owned by them, so it will be mining whether I use it or someone else.
I suppose it boils down to a fatalistic viewpoint that there is nothing I can do about it either way. I tend to agree with the comments here that say the threat is not as severe as it is being made out to be. Like I said, if there was a better choice, I'd use it. Maybe all this fear about ghash getting too big will entice someone to open a competitor, because that is the only thing that will change this trajectory. Simply asking people to change behavior based on a potentiality is simply not going to work, in my opinion...

This is why I mine there. I can put my earnings into cloud mining and increase my hash power. Would be happy to switch if someone pointed me to another pool that can do that.
They also allow trading between the altcoins that are mined.
If you want a competitor to ghash, you need an easy to use system with 0% mining fees, and an exchange with cloud mining services. 
No one else offers this, hence ghash's market share.

Once the prospect of earning interest on money that isn't being used otherwise, I think the community will switch its opinion of banks. 
Imagine if a bank with a good reputation in Switzerland or somewhere declared it would now hold and insure bitcoins in exchange for interest. I would anticipate many would transfer their funds, because earning money is better than not earning money.
Right now, there just aren't practical options for earning interest in a stable fashion.

Actually, this is a good idea (maybe not to him, specifically, but in general.) If all they are going to be doing is sitting around for 7 years, find a way to make them work. Ie, invest them with some way (this is the part you'd have to investigate) that guarantees a payment of your current bitcoins plus a little interest in 7 years time. Think of it like the equivalent of a savings bond... you just need to find someone who can use the money now and that you trust to pay back within 7 years.

Exactly. If 10 competitors each had 6% of total hashing power, there would be no chance of a 51% attack. The only reason Ghash has so much is that there aren't alternate options for people to choose who like the cloud mining service.

You have described the concept of "risk." 
That is the trade off for interest accumulation. Everyone is entitled to choose how much risk they will or will not accept. 
Banks can lessen risks by holding capital reserves, having insurance, or showing a stable history of principal protection. 
Just because you are not willing to accept risk does not mean everyone else shouldn't have that choice available to them.

Imagine that Bitcoin gets widely adopted worldwide, to the point of supplanting more traditional currencies. Since Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, that would mean that as more people adopt it, it would have to greatly inflate in value to replace the trillions of dollars (or whatever) currently in use.
In short, won't there simply not be enough Bitcoins?
Since the script won't be changed to allow more coins to be mined, isn't Bitcoin limited in how widely it can be adopted at a fundamental level?

Yes, but the point of the birthday paradox is that the likelihood of any two matching is much less than you would expect given the number of possible birthdays there are. With billions of humans and multiple addresses and time, what is the chance that we'd end up with duplications in the same fashion?
So "choose" was the wrong word. But the point still stands: when generating an address, the service that does so is not checking against the block chain to verify that no one else has ever generated that address, and so it could be duplicated.

Newbie, nontechnical miner here. I've been mining with ghash because it was easiest to set up and nobody was talking about this a few months ago when I started. It was all "doesn't matter which pool you join, it all evens out in the end..." I'm willing to switch to p2pool if someone can answer a few questions about it:
1) I have only 70 Ghs, maybe 350 over the next year or so. Does it even matter for me at those low hash rates? Would I ever get paid on a p2pool? I am not sure I like the idea of waiting weeks at a time for low payouts.
2) could someone please tell me what a p2pool even is? I've been reading these threads and it just looks like another pool to me- ie, lots of miners pointing to a common pool for greater total hashing power.
3) do they support simultaneous alt coin mining? I like that as a nice bonus with my low hash power...
4) most importantly: how do I switch ?

You have 1 million dollars or bitcoins or Euro's or whatever you use. That is more money than you are currently using or plan to use in the near future. You can keep it and you will have 1 million in the future when you do want to spend it. 
I have an idea for a new type of widget I want to make, but I need some capital to get my business started. If you give me permission to use your money that you were not using in exchange for my promise to pay you back more than you gave me, we both benefit. I benefit because now I can start my widget business, and you benefit because you will have more money than previously. 
Banks are merely a means of capital aggregation and distribution to permit optimal utilization of the resource of money. There is nothing inherently statist about banking if done through voluntary association - which is not what banks are now. 
For instance, a few years ago a website called Prosper.com sprung up - where anyone could ask for a loan and people with money to invest could bid for amounts and interest rates. You only want to risk $25? Fine. You only want to bid your money if the borrower agrees to &gt; 12% interest rate? Fine. The borrower would in turn be offered a loan term made of aggregates of the bids that were collected and could choose to accept or reject the loan. It was an open market and completely voluntary. 
The SEC shut it down for offering unlicensed securities and it reopened a year later, but is a mere shadow of what it once was. All the innovative potential it had was not permitted to continue.
The problem is not the banking or whatever organization uses the capital, per se - the problem is when the options are limited due to government control. 
I have no problem with banks competing to hold my dollars through interest rates and history of stability. Why do you think competition for a resource shouldn't be permitted?

They should just make an offer to sell 50% or some large chunk of their mining operations. It would instantly get them further from the threshold and let another player enter. The solution to the 51% is more mining pools to dilute the possibility that anyone could be able to get the majority of hash power in the first place. It would give them a nice influx of cash, and immediately alleviate all the negative press they have been gathering. Then, take that chunk of cash and diversify operations. That is the only way that allows them to avoid the threshold without limiting their own interests. 
OR, they could just do like they initially planned and let miners point their power at other pools in the first place. Or both.

Except that btcjam allows indexed loans - meaning the amount is paid back in the value of the bitcoin in dollars, not the bitcoin amount itself. This can act as a hedge against the current price volatility, both for lenders (which protects against price drops) and borrowers (which protects against price increases). 
Until the bitcoin rate is more stable, this type of solution will need to be in place.

Exactly this. We can send money via bitcoin to my family in minutes if we want to. However, they can't *use* it when they get it. For every bitcoin we send, someone in that country has to want the bitcoin in order to make it a feasible transaction. The only people who will value that are people planning on travelling and who can use bitcoin as a way around the country's currency exchange limits (few people), or being able to use the bitcoin to purchase goods or services that will make it valued in that part of the world. Again, rare - because of chickens and eggs.

What I mean, is that in order to secure a wallet, you generate a random number, and it is highly unlikely anyone will ever choose that same number.

Ah. there's your problem right there. Any time you have no competition and bad service, that is an area ripe for new entrants into the market. The fact that you don't makes me think that there is some legal system set up protecting their business. Being undercut by the big boys is not some protection against competition (only new startups) because any existing big company could still go head to head for market share. I'm curious what happened to the sprint deal. Down here, Verizon, Sprint, and T-mobile are at each other's throats for customers. Wonder why they aren't trying to get a foot in the door up there? 
In most cases, the absence of market competition is because of laws and regulations set up that protect the existing entities. I'm not familiar with Canadian stuffs so I wouldn't know what they are directly...

Hi there - I'm a lender on that site, I've loaned about 10 BTC there so far.  I'm still far from an expert, but I'd be happy to share any advice I can. PM me if you want to discuss anything in specific. I'm finally turning a profit there, so I can help you avoid a few mistakes I made in the beginning.
In general, its a good way to earn money, and a good way to lose money. The trick is to learn how to do the first one and avoid the second one. 
A few pointers in no particular order:
 Never invest in anyone with more than one active loan at a time. Many people have set up Ponzi schemes and scammed lots of money doing that. 
 Be prepared to lose money, especially at the beginning as you learn the ropes. To mitigate this, I would recommend investing small amounts ( &lt; $1 worth) in multiple borrowers until you find the borrowers and loan types you trust. I invested about $50 initially in dozens of small chunks before I figured out the red flags and the promising candidates. It helps to get advice, but sometimes you just have to learn for yourself.
 Never look at interest rates. Ok, not never, but don't judge a loan by a high interest rate and decide it is worth it. Instead, look at why the borrower wants the money and how they intend to repay. If it sounds fishy, don't bother. Start from the standpoint that most debt is bad and complicates someone's finances - in order to justify taking a loan, they need to have a compelling reason and business plan. For example, many people will borrow coins to re-invest, but will never bother explaining how they intend to repay if their investments don't work out. 
Never invest in people carrying multiple open loans at a time. Wait, did I already say that? That's because you shouldn't. 
They have a [good intro]( to investing on their discussion forums. I'd suggest you check it out. 
Message me anytime you want to discuss the platform, particular loans, or whatever. I love the idea of bitcoin peer to peer lending - it has the potential to be one of them most disruptive implementations of bitcoin that is out there. We need more people using it!
(Also - feel free to use my [referral link!]( Clicking that and signing up through the link will get me a paltry 0.2% of any loans you take out. It looks like you are interested in lending so it may not even matter...).
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:39:04
Wait - that's confusing me. Isn't your balance just the sum of all the coins assigned to an address? 
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:19:29
There's a point you are missing in the concept of lending: the only reason someone will give you money (short of charity) is because they expect a return of that money with increase. 
If you don't have collateral that can be sold if you fail to repay, what is the lender going to use to trust that you will repay? Your reputation as an honest borrower is the only thing left to rely on. If you aren't even willing to share you name, that is a huge red flag in the trust arena because you could simply steal their money and never give it back, and they'd have no way to ever get recompense.
Collateral or trust. You need one or the other.

I meant that flippantly, but I think it is on track for full legalization everywhere. 
Now that Colorado legalized it, all the fearmongering that was previously used to keep the war on drugs going will be found to be warrantless. The apocalypse will not come, and the new market will cause a net increase to government revenues. Meanwhile, the legalizing will reduce the crime rate and allow police to focus on other matters. Colorado even has medical research focusing on marijuana now, which up until now has been virtually impossible due to the prohibition against it. We may even see new cures for disease because of this.
In short, the benefits will greatly outnumber any of the bad outcomes, and the rest of the country will figure it out shortly. Once a majority accepts it, the federal government will change in turn.

Here's my million dollar idea - you can have it if you want:
Do a reverse craigslist. What happens on craigslist is that you want to buy something, say a new kitchen table or a bookshelf, and you look for all the people trying to sell one. The problem is, there is a lot of garbage out there, and you see posts by the date they were posted - so the very item you are looking for could quickly get buried if you don't happen to log on and look at the same time someone lists it for sale. 
Notice how every online retailer works this way: get online, search for what you want. Its the electronic equivalent of going into a store. 
However, electronic media allow us to do a much better version - make the sellers shop for the customers. 
How this would work: I post an "ad" or "listing" on your site looking for a new bookshelf. I say what I am willing to pay, what I am looking for, etc. 
Then, someone who wants to sell a bookshelf, rather than posting and waiting for people to call, can see an immediate list of every buyer looking to buy a bookshelf, including what color, cost, etc. If they are interested in contacting me to see if I want to buy the bookshelf, they can pay a small fee (a few cents, in order to fund the site and prevent spamming). The site forwards the email to me with the offer. 
Why this would work wonders:
Not everyone is an impulse shopper. If I know I am going to need a new _____ in the next few weeks, I don't want to waste my time traveling all over looking for the best deal. Rather, I can let sellers compete for my business and get the one I want best. 
This is also scalable to the level beyond local ads (such as craigslist) to online auctions (like ebay).

When everyone uses Venmo, venmo is easier. I offer bitcoin every time someone tries to venmo and I've never had someone take me up on it. 
And yes nostradamus, I'm completely ignorant about bitcoin and have no desire to learn. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:21:12
So how does that work with the divisibility of bitcoin? Each coin has a million unique serial numbers? Or is it only assigned when I split one? 
Lets say you send 1 BTC to my address. If I split that and send 0.5 bitcoin to another address, what happens to the original serial number? 
If someone sends me a 0.5 BTC transaction so I again have 1 BTC in my address, do I have 2 separate half coins, or do they merge to create a new serial number?
I find this stuff very confusing, so I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me.

This is why people use venmo. It's simple to use and no hurdles to overcome. It's what Bitcoin should have been. Now, whenever we split a check everyone in the group uses venmo - because it's simple. 
Until Bitcoin apps are that easy to use, people ain't gonna switch. 
The worst part is more people use venmo than Bitcoin, so it's not likely to clear that hurdle and out-compete venmo at this point. Market saturation is already happening and Bitcoin missed it in this demographic.

This is a teacher introducing bitcoin to teenagers. I do not think security is the biggest concern here.

Alternate solution to mining centralization:
Capitalize on the increasing popularity of Bitcoin by selling Bitcoin "lottery" miners to the general population. Old asic miners that aren't profitable for pool mining still have the one in a million chance of mining a solo block.
People spend millions on lottery tickets with worse odds. 
If there was a simple USB miner that functioned as a plug and mine solo miner, I bet you could sell loads of them at the right price to people to use as lottery miners. I'd buy something I could plug into a simple desktop that would auto mine to my private address constantly, even knowing the odds were poor.
Any single miner won't make a dent in the overall hash rate. 
But hundreds of thousands or millions of them would start to pull blocks and therefore profits from the centralized miners and move more towards the original goal of decentralized mining.

For a plant. 
That isn't a "totalitarian police state hellhole" as you meant, it's how libertarians define the state monopoly on power. 
If they wanted to make Bitcoin illegal as they did drugs, there will still be black market activity everywhere, because (just like the drug market) they can't control it 100%. But they will certainly send men with guns to lock you in cages if are on the wrong side of the law and get caught.

This is a risk on these platforms, but it is mitigated in 2 ways:
First, loans are only short term, so wild fluctuations in bitcoin's price are less likely to become significant during the loan's duration.
Secondly, loans can be tied to a currency so you end up paying the value, regardless of what bitcoins's price does.
Interestingly, some people spin this risk the other way: taking out loans and speculating on Bitcoin to drop in value in order to pay back less.

Well, if you are someone who honestly thinks bitcoin will go up 400% in 2 weeks, I would advise you not to lend in bitcoin, then. Use a currency backed loan. 
As far as your second question, I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. I was explaining that you can tie a loan to the dollar value, so regardless of what bitcoin's price does you are lending/borrowing the same amount of dollar value - but then you are asking about how the other poster uses that by not investing in currency backed loans? I'm not sure what you mean - could you elaborate?

Peer to peer lending sites such as BitLendingClub and BTCJam are growing in popularity.

Its not just that, bitlendingclub actually lets lenders set the interest rates based on their risk tolerance and how likely they feel a borrower is going to repay. It makes it a market-driven system, which is one of the best things about it. Imagine the day when people can bid for better interest rates on their loans rather than going with what a bank offers them. 
BTCJam has a calculated rate that is default for every loan based on your credit "score," that is merely an in-house metric of how likely you are to default, according to their predictions. Borrowers can't get lower rates for good payment histories or with known lenders who may trust them, and lenders can't ask for more on someone who may not be the best payer. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 06:14:09
I'm also a lender on bitlendingclub. Its awesome. Bitcoin and peer to peer lending are made for each other. 
In addition to what the others have pointed out (yes, loans can be bitcoin only or tied to a currency value), to answer your questions:


BLC does the loan verification in terms of identifying, income verification, etc. Ardeva is a third party that also does verification that some lenders ask for. 


Think of these sites as the payday lenders of bitcoin for the moment. In the absence of traditional banks, the standard lending like open credit lines, mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc all have no infrastructure. Furthermore, the volatility of bitcoin makes long term lending a bit iffy (since not everyone wants a currency-denominated loan). So short term loans are the standard. Interest rates match this, usually from credit card territory around 20% apr up to criminal territory for people with less than stellar credit (over 100% apr)
I have seen people take out loans for a $1, and up to 50 bitcoin at once. The great thing is you can invest whatever amount you want. If someone wants a 1 bitcoin loan, you don't have to have a bitcoin to invest in them. You can chip in a few satoshi, and a hundred other people can and it all adds up to the one bitcoin. 
[Check them out](
Note: that link is a referral link. I get a paltry 0.2% of any loans you repay if you use it. Just Google bitlendingclub and use that directly if you don't like the idea of someone pitching you the idea just to make some money... actually, wait. That gives Google money as the first link is likely an ad. Just type in bitlendingclub.com into your browser... that should work. Anyways, PM me if you want more details about how it works than I explained here.
Just as an aside, BTCJam and BTCpop are the other platforms. I don't like either one as much. 
BTCJam seems too removed from customer service, they aren't doing as much to prevent scammers from stealing the money, and every "innovation" they do seems like a step backwards. BTCpop is just too small to have an effective market at the moment. I don't think they'll be around much longer.

This whole thread is in context of international remittances. 
But if you are going to be pedantic about it, there are lots of other reasons: lack of centralization, no need to have existing credit cards or banking for those who can't use them/don't want to use them, anonymity, etc.
Also, Bitcoin is cheaper than Venmo
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:46:06
Only if you use a bank, which again requires you to a) have one (disenfranchising the unbanked) and b) feel comfortable disclosing that information to a third party. You use any other payment route with Venmo and it's a 3% fee. 
There is no such thing as a free service. If you think something is free, you need to look again at how the company gets its profit. I would not be at all surprised to hear Venmo is selling information about customers on top of the fees they charge. 
That, and Venmo doesn't do international - which is the discussion at hand here.

I meant it would go up now, not when they were cashed out. The uncertainty in them being lost is going to contribute to a decreased price now. 
It seems like my thought here is actually 2 parts - 1) Lost coins are a problem, and given  2) this solution is a good way to fix that. 
I'm not even sure about  any longer, but it still seems like the prospect of someone being able to control that much wealth is not a good thing for a bitcoin economy. Imagine if bitcoin expands and becomes a worldwide currency - Satoshi's coins would give him more wealth than many countries. 
I say, that's fine. The guy deserves it if bitcoin spreads that much. The problem to me is dividing owned vs. lost coins and the uncertainty that brings to the market. I'm not sure if there is a solution, or how bad the problem even is. I'm going to continue learning about it.

If you send a transaction with a fee that is too small (the parent transaction), you can add a second transaction (child transaction) with a larger fee. The only way a miner gets the larger fee from the child is to also confirm the first parent transaction. They would in essence be linked. Currently, there is no way to update a transaction with a low fee in order to change it. Child pays for parent would fix that.

Except that adoption is going to be less when people think that a few bad actors are sitting on a majority of coins and can dump them at any time. Its a problem to solve because it hinders adoption which contributes to volatility.

Not everyone uses bitcoin to be their own bank. Some of us just think it is a better form of currency. 


Unless a change is made in the protocol to permit recycling of coins every 50 years if they aren't moved. Yes, I know that is how it is done now, I'm stating that causes a problem with trust and adoption and therefore should be addressed.

Keep at it for a while. BTCJam can have that rate of return quickly drop to negative if just one loan defaults. Make sure it works long term before you dump to much money in it.
You should also look at BitLendingClub. They have less options to invest because they are still growing, but they vet their borrowers better so they have less defaults.

I agree, but implementing things on a personal level and doing so on a societal level are different. Many communities that have tried "compassionate" policies with regards to the homeless have ended up with worse problems because of it. A "compassionate" city like San Francisco springs to mind. In contrast, a hard-right state like Utah nearly eliminated homelessness by simply giving free homes out.
That link you shared was interesting. Its one of those things that to me says a much better policy rather than focusing on homeless-specific interventions is simply to push policy that has the greatest economic effects - so that people wanting to work can actually find suitable employment. Crime, homelessness, and all sorts of problems worsen in a bad economy.

That was what the time requirement was for. If you don't touch your coins in 12 years they get recycled. If you want to keep them, just transfer to a new wallet every 10 years or so to prevent them from being returned. The time itself could be 12 years, 10 years, or more. It's arbitrary but should be long enough not to be an inconvenience to users.

Then these platforms should disclose the information, not hide it behind a secret scoring system.

This is a complaint of implementation, not of the idea. 
Miners currently get mined coins + transaction fees. The mined coins come from a pool of 21 million bitoins. Recycled coins would just be put back in the pool to divy out - perhaps 1 coin per block or something. The implementation could be found to be done in a such a way to spread out the coins and reduce incentives on miners to try and game the system. 


Yes. That was the whole point of the question. A sudden dump by Satoshi or whoever holds any coins would have the same effect. Recycling coins and reintroducing them slowly as part of the mining rewards would mitigate that. 


That is a problem with this idea that I hadn't thought of. You would have to created a system where the reward for processing it outweighs the incentive for not processing it and then collecting. Distributing the recycled coins over an extended period of time is one way to do that. Extending the expiration date is another - if 12 years is unrealistic, make it 30. 
This also adds some responsibility to the user to maintain ownership of their own coins.

@_date: 2015-03-23 16:52:45


Well, they would lose their money. But people are already losing money in bitcoin - those lost coins are the reason I was mentioning this in the first place. People like to talk about how bitcoin lets you be your own bank - and suddenly sending a single transaction to yourself once every decade becomes a deal breaker? Seems overkill to me. 


This is a valid concern, but could be worked around simply by making it a built in feature - make the 12 year mark an expiration date or something that happens automatically, so that nobody has the power to go in and change it on the blockchain out of protocol.

I wasn't aware of those threads, I'll read through them. 
I don't know what you mean by lost coins not being a problem - I spelled one out in my original question: it undermines trust in the system for average users. In what should be a trustless system, that is bad because they don't have confidence in the system itself. 


Market price of this uncertainty is already built into the price of bitcoin - but how? People who doubt that all coins are lost and could flood the market at any time are going to value coins less - having lost coins affects the market by reducing the price of bitcoin based on the uncertainty. Remove the uncertainty, the price should rise.


Exactly. I'm talking about lost coins and the ability of the average non-technically inclined user to trust a system - its the question of whether a coin is lost or simply being held that this idea was meant to address. 


That's not a feasible scenario. Just make the time limit like 20 years or something. You think miners are going to ignore transactions with associated fees to wait 20 years in hopes they'll recover a coin? 


It wouldn't be "their money being messed with." Rather, it would be a feature of bitcoin. Think of it like an expiration date. People know that to keep their money they have to use it at least once per decade - or whatever. Also, telling people to start an alt is pretty condescending. Not everyone is a computer programmer, and no alt is ever going to supplant bitcoin, because bitcoin has prime mover advantage.

Along the lines of [ideas having sex]( I just wanted to point out that a great way to do this that bitcoin facilitates is peer to peer lending/ microlending. 
I know of two websites right now that are doing a marginal job of it (BTCJam and Bitlendingclub) - but they could be much better and the field is ripe for a competitor to pop up. 
Getting people who could donate a dollar or two from first world nations to be able to collectively give life-changing loans instantaneously across the world - without the interference of government regulations or banking red tape - promises to be a huge innovation. 
Allowing average, every day folks to refinance credit cards, buy cars, or even have a mortgage in a bitcoin based crowd-funded lending scenario means that holders of bitcoin have a great investment, and users of bitcoin have an ability to save money when compared to the existing financial infrastructure. 
I think it is a very neglected part of the burgeoning bitcoin economy.

I've been reading through them, it seems pretty similar to the flak I'm getting here as well. People get very defensive about this. It looks like I'm not the first to think of this, though. 
Whether or not my idea for fixing it is a good one, I'm still looking for an explanation as to why lost coins are not a problem. In bitcoin, so many coins were mined initially that are now presumed lost that they make up large chunks of the total amount in circulation. 
I think the amount of insecurity that introduces into the market is a bad thing.

This is the best response in the thread, so far. People are trying to argue with me rather than explain it to me. 
One problem I see with this analogy, though, is akin to the mutually assured destruction of the cold war vs. modern terrorism. In the cold war, the powers would refuse to use their nukes out of self preservation. Terrorists fight on behalf of no state and will kill themselves to cause damage to an opponent, so mutually assured destruction becomes an unfeasible defense strategy. 
Same thing with gold - dumping gold by a government could be done, but would affect their own currency as well, so they wouldn't likely do it. Someone holding huge amounts of bitcoin could simply cash out and, roil the markets, and end up richer when everyone else suffers from the fallout.

Well, if you aren't in prison for a financial crime where you forfeit control of your assets, then you just move them - get permission from a judge as part of your trial, have your lawyer do it, do it from the prison, or have a trusted person do it for you. 
I think we should not be designing a system that caters to prisoners over the average user. If it is really that big of an issue, just make the timeline long enough that it doesn't matter - such as 30 years instead of 12.
