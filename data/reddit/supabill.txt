Is anything in dollars ever whole numbers? For me I recall everything be xx.99, sales tax making it some other random number, and it never mattering at all when I swipe a cc. A price is a price who cares what is before or after the decimal point.

The psychology of owning whole things is of some merit I do agree, the pricing thing doesn't seem like a problem. 
Most qrs and links have the amounts already built in so typing mistakes are negated.

Assuming you have cash deposited you can withdrawal btc instantly once you hit buy on Cambx and kraken. 
Same for localbitcoin, you can withdrawal cash instantly once you hand cash to seller. 
If you're talking about deposit to withdraw Bitcoin time then Ya, Coinbase was the only solution. I moved on because the limit is so low.

Its the work to secure the network, the more confirmations the more secure because of how much work would have to be done to invalidate it. 
The issuing of new coins is a separate function from confirming transactions and is simply a reward to get the network started

I agree with the sentiment of being helpful for sure, I just don't see negative that keeps getting talked about. It's possible i've tuned it out, or it gets lost in the general noise of internet users in general for me.
IRL at meetups for bitcoin I see nothing but people being super helpful and excited to meet newbies who are going out of their way to answer any and all questions/concerns they might have. The more I see that the more excited I become as well.

Not aware of a clone for it but it's not that complicate really, could probably get it built through elance or somewhere fairly cheaply.
More curious of why you want a clone to represent your area? Why not just advertise or start representing your area through it? They have an affiliate program I believe

Yeah if people are trying to verbally communicate a btc amount or type a transfer manually it helps sort of the have the decimal in a convenient place. I think most transactions will be from automatic qrs and links with the amount already built in though. 
Also given the speed of price changes i don't think we'll ever be stable enough to decide on a single decimal placement for very long.

It doesn't seem to be as big and issue as people make it out to be. Worst case scenario seems to be that it actually makes mining profitable for a while as fees go up. But the network would react by moving transactions off chain or increasing the limits. 
You might get slower confirms for a short while but it would only affect lower amounts where paying the fee would be prohibitive

Do you think they would or could do this with cash?

The meetup group consists of a lot of people bringing/inviting their friends in order to help them learn. It's a two way street as far as going out of the way for each other for sure. But if it goes to far in the other direction we start looking like bible sales people :P It seems less threatening to me when it's open invitation to say "hey, we are here to help with whatever you need, whenever you are ready" instead of going out seeking people to preach at :)

My point is that I don't think matters, hence people mange just fine with dollars that have decimals already. It believe it to be a non issue for adoption and just gives people something to talk about

Curious whether the price calculating the "sent in usd" is at todays price or at that point in time. Either way seems like a lot of doge transactions but not much actual value transferring. Only exception is between  jan 19 - feb 19 for some reason.

Brainstorming ideas to make it more accessible and inviting is definitely worthwhile. I'm interested in doing this for brick and morter retail as well, to find ways that will best get them interested in accepting it.

Mtgox should be ignored or bad mouthed the same way you would a restaurant that serves bad food. I'm not going to quit eating but I'm sure not going to recommend the restaurant either. 
Mtgox or any other exchange failing may affect the price but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself. In this forum we're here to discuss Bitcoin, which Mtgox may or may not have anymore. 
It's sad people might lose money but it's their own fault. The whole concept of Bitcoin is trustlessness. They chose to trust an exchange and leave cash or coin with Mtgox and might get screwed for that.

Trust is the entire problem, no one should have to trust you regardless of what currency you allow people to pay with

Mail was also invented around that time. Still writing letters and putting stamps on them? Old stuff is old and can die quickly regardless of how long it's been around
