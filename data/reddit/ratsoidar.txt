If you could build a bot that’s a golden goose and beats the market, would you share it with others?
If you did share it and everyone used it, there would no longer be an advantage since the bot would be competing with itself.
None of this is new - all global markets are controlled by sophisticated bots already and the major players would never share their code since it would mean going out of business.

I mean, on the one hand it’s definitely FUD, but also not necessarily untrue.
You can’t ignore the fact that drug trafficking, money laundering, and yes, terrorism, have benefited from BTC since the very early days. You could even argue that it never would have taken off without them (like Snapchat and nudes).
So it’s not unreasonable to assume that some of those players now hold an extraordinary amount of BTC worth a fortune. And fortunes make killing people a lot easier.

I just wish I had enough BTC to throw away millions gambling to get my own crypto to take off.

Lots of traffic + platform updates + accusations of insider trading = slow everything. 
I’ve noticed a number of service interruptions on GDAX this week but haven’t had any trouble otherwise.

Makes perfect sense, thank you for that... it seems somewhat strange that someone smart enough to create BTC could not anticipate such a design flaw.
I don’t quite understand why the community wouldn’t just embrace what it has become instead of trying to make it something it’s not by adding layers of complexity. Is it not viable as is and is achieving the original goal critical to its future?
Re LTC, do you believe that being only 4x faster is enough to avoid the same issues at a similar scale? How do you think it compares with similar alternatives and DAG coins?

High fees are not a scam when they are listed on the fees page. Cost of doing business.
Always do your due diligence and understand the fees associated with crypto trading.

Much safer than stealing fiat. They’d be dumb not to.
Some people make, some people take.

Has been a daily occurrence this week.

My premise is that making such a tool public would immediately make it obsolete. You wouldn’t really be helping people at all, just making it easier for them to lose their money.
Competition will always exist - maybe you build the best AI bot in the world and share it, but the next day someone will be working on a better version and they won’t be inclined to share it. If they do, rinse and repeat.
Competition will always exist and there will always be winners and losers.
And as for the long term, there are already index funds that do a good job at minimizing risk and providing stable gains over time.
There are no safe bets in cryptocurrency as of this time and there may never be - that’s sort of the point. An index of all cryptos maybe (BTC?) but even then it should only make up a portion of your portfolio.

Does Bitcoin count as true Fiat even though it’s “mined” via work in the form of computation power and finite by design?
A lot of people refer to it as a value store / commodity similar to gold (albeit without the real world applications gold has).
Is there any actual consensus on this from an economics perspective?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:42:45
This is the case for a lot of exchanges. It’s not a scam if it’s listed on their fees page. It’s just the reality of crypto economics at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:04:00
Got time to elaborate with some cliff notes?
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:28:01
Maybe, maybe not
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:59:20
It would make zero difference. The only sure things in life are death and taxes. Crypto will not change that.

From what I’ve read you cannot withdraw or deposit anything from their Platform except fiat. It’s only for buying and selling in-platform and cashing out to fiat. You don’t ever “own” anything you buy, you are simply given a promissory note that can be exchanged when you are ready to liquidate. 
That’s how they can offer no fees, because they are collecting interest on the pool.
But then again I learned all of that on reddit, so it may be completely wrong. Dunno...

I think if intel says they did something impressive you can take that check to the bank. They’re not an ICO and they have nothing to gain from bullshitting and everything to lose.

I have no idea what this could possibly have to do with black history and also no clue what the message is supposed to be but to each his/her own.

Clever ShapeShift marketing here...

Or maybe they are just going to steal everyone’s money...

Leave your money on an exchange and let it ride!

Robinhood steals from the rich to give to the poor - pretty interesting name choice
