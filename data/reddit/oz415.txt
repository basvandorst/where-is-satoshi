"Bitcoin will be over 100k" dont be delusional dude, sure its possible but dont count on it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:39:57

Dont trade when you have no experience
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:13:52
Trade with fake money for some weeks and see where you are then.

I just bought bitcoins so with my luck they'll prob drop more now ...
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:13:34
I do believe it could be 10k at the end of the year but it could also be 1k :/
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:21:13
yes, but bitcoin is getting so much attention and new people so looks like it might be the better option atm.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:05:25
never :D
