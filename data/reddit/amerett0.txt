And the problem lies in where a real legal defense should've gone after exactly how the prosecution (FBI/Govt) was able to acquire the incriminating evidence, and in that process hopefully would've been exposed some of the less-than-legal manipulative and coercive tactics they used to infiltrate an anonymous network.  But because the defense, jurors, judge and pretty much everyone involved besides the defendant himself live in ignorance to the complexity and implications that are inherent in dark-web systems. 
Our freedoms are continually eroded by the system which is unaccountable and blind to its' own ignorance of what is being truly being argued but rather fall back upon lazier antiquated ideas of morals that drugs are bad and any system taken advantage of by other parties to distribute illicit goods is inherently bad and punishable to the fullest extent of the law.

TL;DR : This most-unfortunate ruling protects the Government's ability to continue their hidden tactics that supercede individual rights.
