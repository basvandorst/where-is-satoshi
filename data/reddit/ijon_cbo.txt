did you mine that one yourself? What machine did you use? Was it calculating the whole time?

Yes, but if you quit, mailbox.org will refund whatever is left on your account.

Some more informations...
I think bitcoin-qt is not working right on my plattform. 
It does not produce any network-traffic, except for some kB (&lt;10), all its processes are sleeping, it does not require any CPU-time and the harddisk sleeps too, although it should be busy reading and writing blockchain-data.
I am running v0.8.6.
It also shows this yellow warning, that the transactions might not be correct, and that my node or other nodes might need to update the client.

other people gave me the advice to just delete whats in ./bitcoin/blocks and to replace that with a bootstrap.dat downloaded over torrent with a mostly up-to-date blockchain (from january)
what do you think? does this advice make sense?

because it might work for some people, but certainly not for all, so some people will still bring the whole blockchain or try to sync it.

Here is a torrent for downloading the blockchain.
the description says that I should not use it, if I have already a non-empty wallet. why is that? what is the risk? 
I dont want to loose my bitcoins. I had a complete bitcoin-qt wallet on my computer, but I needed some hdd-space, so I exported my bitcoins into a local file and deleted the blockchain. Now, about 45 weeks later, I want to do a transaction and need a blockchain. I started yesterday, but is still at 27 weeks to be synchronized.
