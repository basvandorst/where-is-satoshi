Isn't this the very definition of hidden fees?
If I go to currency exchange booth down on the corner, they advertise no fees, but the exchange rate they give me, is worse than any exchange rate I can find online.
I've never used your service, and from what I can hear it seems you guys do a great job, so I'm not trying to hate on your or anything. I just found it an interesting choice of words.

Do you have a source for this? And does this also apply when having funds at an exchange like coinbase? And if so is there a minimum limit?
I'm curious in the context of declaring foreign bank accounts for that other form (forgot the name) which is not part of your tax declaration.

You dark to explain why miners would suddenly start buying bitcoin as a result if rewards halving. A miner is in the business of converting electricity into bitcoins they can sell for profit. When revenue halves, they will need to reduce their overhead cost or face diminishing returns. Them suddenly buying bitcoin has nothing to do with their business, and I think there are more professional miners today than last time. So miner vs enthusiast vs investor is more distinct this time around.

But the point is still that you are using USD as your base. It would be like my contract being in EUR even though I work in the US. So my pay in USD would fluctuate every month.
Your prize should be 30 bitcoin. At the time of the award that may be worth USD 10k, or USD $5k or USD 20k. But the point is the prize is 30 bitcoin.

Why are prizes for an event like this in USD? (I understand they pay it out in BTC, but having it based in USD seems kind of ironic.)
It's like people that talk about being paid in BTC, but in fact simply have their pay automatically converted to BTC at pay time. In such case you might as well just do the conversion yourself.
Going all in means basing amounts, prices, prizes and other values in BTC. And especially for an event like this I don't see why they don't just acquire the BTC and then announce the prize as X BTC. And if they want to clarify the value of that to the uninitiated (why?) add a (~USD Y at tie of writing).

No. Credit card is still easier for you.
While a lot of people will give a lot of technical answers, and while most of those answers are true, the simple answer to your question is "No", for all practical purposes.
You might like some of the aspects of Bitcoin, and you may have technical interest or political interest and so forth, but as "a gamer who bus things digitally for my xbox", switching to bitcoin for you for that purpose does not give you anything.

Your friend sounds a little too much like a mood investor, so I would probably advise against it.
The key question to ask is still this: How will he feel if he loses his entire investment? You say that "It would definitely hurt losing it but it would also not ruin him." Hurt can mean many things, but based on this, going with a risky investment like BTC is probably not the right direction.
The problem is that people will often thing "yeah it could go to zero, "but I am pretty sure it won't." But compared to other risky investments, BTC going to zero is a very real possibility. Don't just ignore the outcomes you don't like, but really ask yourself what you'd do if it happened.
"He strongly believes the US Dollar is going collapse some time in the near future."
While I am sure this can also be discussed at length, this also leads me to believe that your friend is more emotional than rational in his investments. Yes, it is POSSIBLE that the US dollar could collapse, but saying that you STRONGLY believe it will happen in the NEAR future, probably puts you in a minority. Right now USD is doing better than it has for many years.

They are not paid in BTC. They basically have their USD pay immediately converted to BTC, saving them a few clicks of a button (and maybe some transfer fees).
They are paid in BTC when their contract says "x BTC per hour//week/month/year/.." instead of USD X.

If you go to the Bitstamp deposit page for Bitcoin, you now see this message:
DO NOT DEPOSIT TO PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BITCOIN DEPOSIT ADDRESSES. Deposits sent to previous address will not be honored. New deposit addresses are forthcoming.
Still wish they'd post some kind of news on the front page.

What prevents a mass DOS attack on a network nodes by creating a gazillion 0-fee transactions (which will never or only slowly) be picked up?
What would the impact on the network/node performance be if all nodes suddenly had to keep track of 1,000,000 transactions waiting to be included in a block?
Or do transactions somehow expire automatically if not included in before a specific block?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:26:53


This is fundamentally wrong. In this case the miners that stay will be making the same as previously for the duration of the adjustment. Blocks will confirm slower, so total reward payouts as a function or time will be lower, but so will the number of miners sharing those payouts. To the point where statistically to doesn't make difference. It might even lower the variance.
After the first difficulty adjustment, confirmation times will be back to normal, but the number of miners will still be the same, which effectively means quadrupling the rewards.
The above economics are in in BTC. If the USD value of BTC changes, that will of course affect the net value to the miners.

A lot of bad shit can be said of the old banks but this article is really not any more serious than "Bitcoin is dead" articles. 
First of all lumping ATM fees with overdraft fees is just weird.  They are two very different things. 1 is a convenience fee for getting your own money, while the other is a fee for using someone else's money!
As for the first one, there are plenty of options. My credit union pays my foreign ATM fee, and even if your bank doesn't, most banks have networks or otherwise brought access to No fee ATMs. 
"Overdraft fees put people at 'serious risk'"
What a load of bull. The fee is not putting anyone at risk. People spending money they don't have, is putting people at risk. 
I fail to see how it makes banks look bad that they charge you for spending more money than you have and thus putting them at a credit risk. Spend your money more wisely and/or arrange your finances in such a way that you don't have to go -$20.

I agree with the predictability, but I do think that at some point, mining rewards will need to be revisited.
I don't see it changing over night, but consensus could be reached and a plan could be to change 1 or 2 halvings in advance
So for instance at the point of the halving, when the reward is supposed to drop 6.25 to 3.125, it gets locked at 3.125, and all future halvings are cancelled. If this was proposed and agreed upon sufficiently in advance, I think it would overall be a good thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:09:58


Correct. The whole point of my idea is that before EDA, we know that blocks are coming in very slowly, so there's a good chance that no other miner will find another block before the EDA.

None of the 4 points listed have anything to do with the conclusion in the title.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:08:58
 Most of the responses to this question point out that I can't pre-mine because I need the latest block. But my point is that with the chain being very slow (hence the need for EDA), I can be reasonably sure that no-one else will find a block in the time I'm pre-mining based on the lower difficulty.
So if at EDA-6h, the network is still working on solving at difficulty X, but I start solving at difficulty Y and if no-one else manages to find a block (with difficulty X) in the next 6 hours, EDA kicks in and everyone starts working at difficulty Y. But at that point I will have a head-start and can start release my newly minted blocks, as if I am just being very lucky after the difficulty adjustment.
Now, if someone finds a new block before the EDA kicks in, I have to throw avoid my pre-mined blocks and start over. But the same still holds true: I will still have a (smaller) head-start at the new difficulty. With the assumption that EDA will be needed, it must mean that my chance of finding a block at the original difficulty before EDA is very low, so even in the worst case scenario, where someone finds a new block 1 second before EDA, my loss will be statistically very low, compared to the potential gain of having pre-mined dozens of blocks at the new difficulty.

You're rambling. If banks are evil, and banks are behind the exchanges, why do the banks want to close the exchanges, thus preventing their one alleged purpose: user data collection?

Your guess is as good as mine.
I would guess that many have, but in all reality they didn't really give much warning, and I can easily imagine that a lot of people don't regularly log in.

I'll go against every other advice in this thread and recommend you swallow the hefty fees and withdraw USD. 
If you're completely new to transacting Bitcoin, there's a very real chance that you will mess up along the way while navigating wallets, tumblers, exchanges  etc. That could turn out to be a $20k mistake that you would remember for a life time.
Also, don't forget that he will eventually run into fees to get his money out in USD. So the net gain of withdrawing BTC is likely substantially less than $600 if he is planning to get all or most of the money out in USD.

Thanks for the beer.
I think your comment is very black and white. In my view, a reasonable approach would be to have an online trusted wallet (coinbase, but stamp, kraken, ...) for the majority of your coins, and maybe a mobile wallet for your cafe spending. 
If I lose my wallet, it would be a shame but I'll survive, just like in real life where I usually don't carry around the equivalent of multiple Bitcoin in USD. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:36:52


Yes, and I cringe equally every time.
What this statement misses, is the point that not everyone can be trusted to secure and protect their own coins. 
And that's not meant as a negative thing.
I wouldn't trust myself to maintain/repair etc. my car, or do significant electricity work, so why should I expect myself to be competent enough to do this for bitcoin?
When pondering this notion that coins you don't control are not your own, the real question you should ask is:
*Do I trust myself to secure and protect these coins more than a given 3rd party?*
And I would content that the answer to that question for anyone who needs to be reminded about the original sentiment should be "No".
I think a layperson is much more likely to either lose (gone forever) or involuntarily give out (via malware or explicitly without knowing the consequences, etc) the keys to his kingdom.

Somehow the meaning of eli5 has gotten lost in translation. I don't know many 5 year olds who would understood most of the words making up that answer.And while I consider myself fairly intelligent I myself don't really understand the difference either. From a layman's perspective. It's a shame that what was otherwise a very relevant question was met with so many poor answers (btw I don't consider myspacebardontwork'vs answer poor).I think OP is more interested in how any differences affects him. Like.. Is my money more safe with one of them? Is one less likely to get shot down by authorities, is my bank less likely to asks questions if I deal with one of them?

I doubt it legally frees you of the taxes in Brazil, but you'd have to consult a tax lawyer. You might be able to bypass the authorities, but you're essentially smuggling money out of the country. Disregarding how people may feel about such laws, they tend to be rather strict and so could get you into a lot of trouble.
Other considerations to keep in mind:
I recently bought a house and for the down payment I had to move money from a bank account in my native country to a bank account in the US. Since the US banking system is still in the stone ages when it comes to transfering money, I actually considered buying and selling bitcoin to expedite the process. In the end I decided not to, because it would most likely have made the underwriting process a lot more difficult when I would have to explain where my money comes from.
So don't set yourself of for an issue down the road because people might later have a valid reason for asking you for the source of your money.

When I make an international transfer from my bank account, I have the option to 
1) Pay all fees myself (sender pays costs)
2) Have recipient pay fees (recipient pays cost)
3) split the costs with recipient (split costs) 
With both 2 and 3, the final amount that recipient gets will be less than what I sent. So this situation is not unique to bitcoin exchanges.
In my mind the solution is simple: Include a checkbox or similar where use can elect whether fees should come out of the sending amount, or if it should be on top of it.
