Go back to when you came from, we don't want you here. This is the good simulation.

If you use a bank it’ll be hard to understand. Ask people who are unbanked.
People get paid in bitcoin already, you can work and almost live on the blockchain. You will be able to in the next 10 years. 
Important distinguishing word there is “the blockchain”. It seems that if you want to make money on cryptocurrencies look into ICOs. More money was spent on ICOs than in all of venture capital this year (or so I read). You may not use bitcoin in daily life yet but you will use some other blockchain technology. Ben Bernanke is backing Ripple. Developers love Ethereum. There’s a blockchain startup designed at decentralizing what Dropbox does. And some have said that bitcoin may be the gold of the blockchain market. 
Regardless, my point is, a lot of the speculation in bitcoin is directly parallel to the speculation in the blockchain as a whole.
I’m no expert but I’m starting to understand those going dark thing. Sometimes I feel like people will only understand it when it’s been laid out for them on the nightly news.

I bought at 520000 in JPY, which is like right at the top, I bought some smaller chunks coming down thinking it was gonna go up. Dammit. Sold it all for a loss and I'll try again when it hits the floor and sell again before segwit, I guess.

The thing is, I think there is still a lot of people waiting to get back in, then, right? This is gonna be nuts from here on out right. I mean just looking at the pattern, the more people that get involved the faster and further it drops (while still averaging a gain over the long term).
