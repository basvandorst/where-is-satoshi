err decentralized exchanges, err anon coins. :)
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:20:08
it would have to be a decentralized exchange, otherwise it'd be just another red dot on the map. and even then.

Here's a list of violations of the USA constitution that this troll should be focusing on if he gave a damn. 
Confiscation of legally purchased fire arms
Restricting the right of free speech to restricted zones.
Jailing citizens without trial.
Unequal treatment under the law.
Execution of three American citizens without trial via drone strikes.
Kicking puppies.

Confiscation of gold. I could go on. My friends on facebook sure are.

Unless they want to manipulate the market. If you were a very wealthy banker or government. How would you kill bitcoin?
One way to do it is accumulate allot of it slowly over time, and when  confidence is slow hit the sell button. Crash the price, scare people holding BTC as savings away. Start a bitcoin panic run. 
Last year during MTgox, there was some research that showed there was a trading bot buying up allot of Bitcoin. Right? Was all that Bitcoin accounted for? it may very well be related to this. The bot's buying spreees were correlated with the big spikes in btc price.

The thing is, most other financial systems are already centralized and controlled. Show me a fiat currency that is does not have a central bank and does not have a legal monopoly over counterfeiting units. 
Bitcoin does not allow this, is faster and can be safer and more efficient than banks. Particularly as multi signature allows for distributed wallet security both at customer and corporate levels. 
Bitcoin is too small today to threaten the stability of say the USD, but if it continues to grows it will come in conflict with the desperate need governments have to print money and pay off dependants.  If subsidies to dependants slows down enough to make them hungry, like it is starting to happen, than that's usually when riots start and shit breaks lose. 
This is a very complex question and there's many reasons why BTC is not like fiat currencies and threatens very powerful people. To name a few worth exploring: The international war on drugs, funding for the war machine and industrial military complex, welfare and other types of subsidies as well as pay to government employees. All of these depend on governments having control of the money supply, either by high enough taxes or by straight out printing money and robbing all the innovators.

Are the articles on the website going to stay there, or is the site going to shut down? If the site gets taken down, I'm re publishing mine elsewhere.

They have been 'restructuring' and stopped paying for articles. but site had stayed up... until now. They should have said something about it going down. Or does it get such seldom views that it was not worth it? I doubt it. they have huge SEO

Oh, I get it.
Yeah, its about the SuperNET, what it is, why you should atleast watch the video as a great intro to SuperNET and... why Acapulco is awesome and you might regret not buying a ticket to anarchapulco before they are all gone.
Tip: Cory Wilson &amp; Roger Ver will be there.

I'm  a full time researcher very involved in the  NXT community, I expect instant transactions between cryptocurrencies ontop of a decentralized platform to be available latest end of 2015, earliest end of Q! 2015. This trading platform is called instantDEX ontop of BitcoinDark.pw an anonymous 2.0 currency. 
Decentralized exchange with NXT blocktimes of 1 minute is already functional, just needs more altcoin communities to join, see Multigateway to learn more or this article I wrote about it. 
Its happening people and I agree, its time to get away from  Banks. 
wiki.supernet.org has more info.

Wasn't Cody Wilson trying to achieve something along the lines of what this reddit post might do? Seems odd that such a call out would not have happened already.. Anyways, thank you for your courage Oliver.

Great work! can we now maybe turn our research lense towards the hackers that were trying to steal all this Bitcoin? I know its not the same as using a blockchain to find the owner. But my bet is that there are a small amount of hackers and thieves in the Bitcoin space and if we start catching them, maybe this will be a safer space. 
Releasing information about the parties that contacted you would be awesome Dave. 
As a general rule, I say hackers should be doxxed.-
