I'll send you a PM!
Sorry for the wait, I went off somewhere.

Yeah, I read that some people get annoyed when you're using the currency to buy something on SR. Thanks though, I won't mention it but I was just making sure whether or not SR has their own wallet. I guess I shouldn't really use that wallet, though, since it seems pretty risky.
Also, I did ask on SR subreddit but unfortunately, it was removed. I guess dealing with Bitcoins and such over there aren't really "on-topic".

Thanks. I don't mind putting my trust in them as long as there's escrow. There is escrow, right?

Woo, alright. Just need to make sure everything's good to go... would have got things done a lot sooner but you know, the crash and all
I'll see if I can get things done tomorrow. What's the deal with escrow, though? I'm not too sure on how it works since I never did a cash deposit.
I'm afraid of just hitting "Buy" and not being ready to go through with the process (i.e. too confused). Is it really that simple?

And your purchases aren't anonymous, right?  Not that it'd matter if you can just tumble your coins somehow -cough-, right?

So I'd have to get myself a wallet first or a place where they can transfer the bitcoins to...
So would a SR account be considered a wallet on its own?
And are there anything a seller would do to try and scam a new BTC buyer?

Depositing cash, does that require you to meet face-to-face?
I'm in the US, by the way.
These exchanges, how do they work exactly? Cash -&gt; Bitcoins and Bitcoins -&gt; Cash?
