This. 
I noticed that I get these 1 satoshi payments (1Enjoy.., 1Bsmart etc) whenever I re-use addresses. I read somewhere that someone tracked one of those address back to some marketing company. I usually lock the tx and sweep the address, leaving the 1 satoshi. I hope that that will stop the track. Not sure about that though.

Thanks for making me smile on this drowned Sunday afternoon in the Netherlands. Donated.

Will this be broadcasted like the hearings?
Like OP, I'm impressed by the open process and it makes me want to see something similar in the Netherlands.
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:24:17
Refreshing, this voice of reason.
Thank you for putting my thoughts in words.

Do I understand it correctly that that implies a price of $380?
Why so high?
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:09:26
Why not on testnet?

I signed up because it's better to actually have a vote and influence decisions from within than stand on the sideline and just shout.

I'm not an Amazon shopper but I like the concept. Sounds like something I'd sign up for if Amazon were a practical choice in my country.

Roger didn't do Bitcoin a favor in the Netherlands. Over the top emotions hardly ever work out well. Especially with the Dutch people.

You made the right decision. Use your glasses to develop some bitcoin app and earn those invested bitcoins back.

aside from all the other suggestions, as a bank, I'd start with contributing some fte to the open source project, start mining, be a supernode, maybe start a mining pool for my customers and start developing services like btc address to email address translation, mixing service, identity verification, escrow etc.  basically anything that builds upon bank's reputation as a 'Trust Provider'.

This all sounds very sensible indeed.
