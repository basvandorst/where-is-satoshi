I somewhat agree. There is no way he will take decentralization to the heart of Facebook. What would be truly world changing is a social media platform that gave users full rights to their own content, through decentralization and cryptography, but there is no way in hell Facebook would allow this, because it is not their business model. People are giving their personal information away for free, and Facebook is monetizing it. Why would Facebook give that up? Facebook would NOT give that away to make a better world. First priority is to make money, second is use tech to 'help' the world.
A decentralized, 'you own your identity 100%' social media platform would be awesome. I want complete control over my online identity. Open Bazaar, but for social media (if you show me a platform that uses its own token, then you're missing the point).

I could be misunderstanding how it all works because it's not very clear to me yet. If an exchange sends you funds and you have not closed the channel, then something happens to the exchange and they shut down their node, doesnt it close the channel back to the last agreed upon state? Is this a possible exit scam for an exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:31:38
Doesn't this break bitcoins security model? Because if the channel faulters, you lose your bitcoin right?

You know, I thought about it, and it is probable that bitcoin.com paid to keep the link there. I doubt however, that a deal would have been made and reached in such a short period of time. There is another likely explanation that the link was taken down in haste and then put back up for further review. I'm not sure what CMC policy on linkages is? and maybe it's not as robust as we think it is. Also, isn't there a review period before they action items?
In any case, Bitcoin.com should not be a link, for the same reason Satoshi pointed out: .org is usually reserved for opensource projects. You wouldn't link a news-site like coindesk there would you. This reflects poorly on CMC whether they got paid off or not. Look how Ethereum and Ethereum classic are clearly separated.

It's possible, but I doubt it would happen in one or less. I'm not against the vision, just think it is too threatening to the current establishment, and I was partly responding to the original post that coinbase will crumble thanks to decentralized exchanges. I kinda think that's more wishful thinking than anything. They'll be around for a while.
If anything I see nation states creating/running their own digital currencies this generation, until that proves to be a failure. I'm just speculating, who am I to say how things will go, but the objective part of me thinks there's a long road ahead before a decentralized currency is the world's currency.
edit: there's also a ton of infrastructure that needs to be put in place before a large part of the world is getting paid in bitcoin. I think it'll be a generation or two before it's figured out enough to be viable for mass adoption.

Although I agree we could be a short/medium-term bear market, just want to point out that that drop was triggered by the Mtgox fiasco, and at that time, there wasn't much infrastructure, so that was a huge blow to the ecosystem that took time to recover from. I don't see this as the same, and don't expect as prolonged of a bear market.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:55:47
You could monetize services on top of the ecosystem, but the user has full control over what they own or what services they want to use. For example, you could have a service that verifies your real life identity. As a user, if you want to use it, pay for it, if not, don't. You want to provide your info to advertisers? Sure you can do it, but they pay you. I bet it could be built on top of the Open Bazaar ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:22:11

Interesting. This made me think, but I disagree. If I am interpreting this right, intrinsic is of itself while extrinsic is outside itself. Then I would say:
* Code is intrinsic (and probably why it is difficult for someone who does not fundamentally understand technology to not see it that way [Warren Buffet]). Therefor the ability to own and secure your coin without compromise is intrinsic. The 21 million dollar limit is also baked into the code and intrinsic. Transfer over digital space is intrinsic.
* The network itself is extrinsic. Gold serves as a conductor, but if no one needed it, it wouldn't be used.
Am I understanding this right?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:42:56
Storage is probably not the biggest issue. It's bandwidth and CPU usage. The more demand on infrastructure used to run a node, the less chance users will run their own node. Nodes enforce the bitcoin protocol, and less nodes means less security and more centralization (because fewer people are enforcing the rules).
Why are those opposed to bigger blocks? 
* No one knows the ideal block size. So increasing block size *now* would probably have to be done again in the future. There are also arguments that the block size is already too big and if that is true, there is no going back to lower block sizes. If scaling was achieved by block size increase alone, the impact on nodes would be massive, and basically factor most nodes out of the ecosystem. So part of the problem is we don't know how big to scale blocks to yet.
* Increasing block size creates a hard fork, which is complicated because in order to avoid mistakes, issues, problems etc. nodes would HAVE to upgrade or they are no longer on the latest network, and not enforcing the current rules (all upgrades until now were backwards compatible, so no one is bumped off the network since their nodes were still playing within the rules). It takes a high level of consensus to do a hard fork safely.
* there are other developments underway that will improve capacity without increasing blocksize (although imo everything proposed to date does not scale to the size needed for world wide adoption, but I also think that is fine atm)
I personally believe throughput of the ecosystem will reach appropriate levels for world wide use, but it will take time to get there.

Maybe the community is. Not sure about the banks. There are very few exchange options, and try to find a debit/credit card you can fund with btc and you'll have a hard time. Coinbase used to allow Canadian funding, but not anymore. A lot of the innovation has left as well; talk to some of the Jaxx and Ethereum developers.
Edit: Also, Canadians are big internet users, so I'm not surprised.

This is why Andreas and others attending conferences across the globe is so valuable in the space, not just because of what he says, but also because he is privy to engage and interact with developers in real life, and get a sense of what is really going on. I can't count the number of times he or others have cleared up some misconceptions I had, because they probably talked to the people on the ground, one on one. I read about bitcoin everyday and lately a lot about lightning, but I had no idea about BOLT, or that there were six companies developing lightning. I've been very conservative about lightning solving scalability, because I didn't quite understand it, but the more I am unpacking, the better it is sounding. Thanks Andreas!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:38:09
It's included in the transaction itself, so when it's recorded in the blockchain is when you've officially paid your fees. That fee is way to high though. Something weird going on. Looks like your wallet is doing a terrible job at fee estimation.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:10
Bitcoins intrinsic value is amongst other things: security, financial sovereignty, and the ability to be used in the digital realm. All of which are very useful today.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:50:18
Well one way is they'd have to buy billions worth of bitcoin in order to administer this attack and then spend it, continuously, with no guarantee that it will work. Once scalability fixes are implemented, it will become even harder to accomplish. A government would have to be incredibly foolish to administer this attack now, and I suspect it will not be possible in the near future. If anything, I would think a mining cartel would be more capable of administering this attack.
Edit: What is interesting is that this congestion is easier to fix *because* it is concentrated in a few prominent exchanges that depend on user support.
Edit2: The reason coinbase has the power (willingly or not) to do this is because of its users, not because they have a superior technology to attack the network. If users moved to a better technology (segwit batching enabled), coinbase would not have the power to disrupt the network. So the idea that it is **one** entity causing this trouble is not exactly accurate (anyone using coinbase is also guilty).

Well, Mtgox was the catalyst for the collapse. It was a big blow to the ecosystem and there weren't many other exchanges around at that time. It took a while for other exchanges to be built better and take its place, so I think it's reasonable to assume the ecosystem is a bit more robust in that sense. I don't see any reason *why* it would be worse, or the same.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:54:43
I am of the opinion a decentralized money system will be the standard some day because it is more fair than what we have now, and I even think it will be bitcoin (contrary to what a lot of people say to be conservative about it). As far as the technology is concerned, I don't have a clue what it would look like in 30 years, but it's world wide adoption and integration into accounting systems, etc. is a whole other aspect to it. It's easy for a politician to say they support it now, but the implication of that is huge and I don't believe anyone, let alone them, understand the true implications of it. If you draw comparisons to let's say marijuana or stem cell research or LSD for psychiatric use, and many other things, look how many years those have been set back due to horrible policy making, because they threatened the establishment.
I think a fair (more fair than now) monetary system is what will win in the end, but my guess about multiple generations needed to get to that point is based on the thought that older generations will not accept it because it is not 'normal' to them, let alone the amount of work needed to truly integrate systems. The government of canada still runs windows 2003 servers, and are now just figuring out how to use cloud computing (and those weren't a threat to the establishment itself).

It's been known for a while that the willy-bot caused all kinds of price manipulation on mtGox. Here's an article from 2014: 
Unless a Mtgox event happens, I don't see this bear market lasting as long or cutting as deep. It's just not the same as it was back then.  Scalability is the issue now, and I don't see it being a 2 year problem.


bitcoin is still working like bitcoin is supposed to work :)

Doubt it. How do you get fiat in and out of the system? Localbitcoins already exists. Centralized exchanges have their place.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:41:49
Sending. 
Typically, you want to find a wallet that uses segwit addresses, and in addition, has the option to let you manually adjust your own fees. If it does a good job at calculating fees, don't have to worry about it so much.
The network is congested at the moment, has been for a while and probably will be for the next 2-6 months (in my estimation). It is a current issue with bitcoin, but don't let that deter  you from understanding this is the best developed crypto in the space. It's just an issue at the moment, just like when we couldn't send video over the internet, there are solutions on their way that will reduce the fees significantly.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:02:46
No, I wish lol! That was my point. On ramps and off ramps in Canada are not easy which I find very strange. We are very tech literate in Canada and we are on the internet more than most countries, so I am surprised at the lack of exchange/payment processing services available.
I think Andreas saved our asses at the Senate hearing a couple years back and we haven't seen much government intervention since, but on the other hand it seems like the Bank of Canada Governor does not like bitcoin, so that could explain some of it.

I wonder how many transactions in the mempool are small payment transactions. If we assume most transactions (I could be wrong) at the moment are to and from exchanges, you can't use LN for that. Entry to use would be at least three transactions (receive bitcoin, open channel, close channel)
Can you open a channel with 0 btc? Almost like a LN wallet. I think that breaks the security model however.

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:18
I found this today (someone can correct me if there's a better link): 
One thing I'm not sure is being represented here and I don't know enough about is opening and closing channels. This demo shows a channel already open. I believe you require a bitcoin transaction every time you open and close a channel (that's two transactions). So how is that going to work out in the real world, given the current situation? (I am genuinely curious about this issue. It's the last remaining issue in my mind.)

Who pays for paper dollars to be printed and the infrastructure that goes with it? Where do they get the money?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:57:21


Your bank charges you fees. You pay taxes. Part of both go towards keeping the infrastructure for the USD fiat system in place. (Keeping those dollars fresh) I don't see the fees as an argument against the system. Yes I agree, they are too high right now, but it's a new tech. What it offers is worth the pennies on the exchange.


Cash is instant but can also be counterfeit (especially USD, you guys need to get on that!) Credit cards are not instant and you risk identity theft. There is a serious problem with chargebacks. Also, it's not settled for quite some time. Near instant settlement WILL be accomplished with bitcoin, just taking some time for the technology to get caught up to the influx of people.


Well if I put btc in a wallet... it'll be the same amount 5, 10, 20 years from now. Maybe you're talking about the value. Go look up the value of the dollar and see how much it's fluctuated over the years. Food prices actually don't go up, it's becoming easier and easier to produce and distribute food. But the value of a dollar has been going waaaay down, so it looks like prices for food go up (probably worse in Canada than US). Your dollar is being devalued and is deflationary. Maybe you can argue why that's a good thing... but you can't say the value will be the same in 5, 10, 20 years. Also, maybe in the US you've got a better chance in the long run, but what about Venezuela, Argentina? 


Because it behaves that way now, does not mean it wont get there. People used to take photos on film at one point too. Way better quality than digital cameras when they first came out. 
Here is the best video i could suggest about how adoption will happen:

Agreed. But you're saying you don't think it'll get there? Curious why not? 
(There are literally billions of dollars in the space right now. Scalability and fees WILL be solved, it's just a matter of time. And then what? We have a new, viable technology, comparable to the internet. Look how hard the internet was to use when it first came out. You had to use command line, let alone the routers and modems at the time. I know there are a lot of ppl coming to me right now wanting to know how buy bitcoin that have no idea what it is, but it doesn't matter in the long run. They say they missed the boat, but they have not had enough time to understand it.)
edit: They are concerned they 'missed the boat'. but i say it doesn't matter, and you'll get that from a lot of people who have been in the space for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:44:09
You don't need free. Negligible would work. You could make the argument fiat currencies have 'fees', you just don't see them. Someone is paying for those dollar bills to be printed. Fees are integral to the market in this case. This is the breakthrough part of this whole ecosystem. You now have a decentralized ecosystem with a monetary incentive to participate. 
Don't forget about venture capital, literally billions of dollars. Also consider there are a bunch of developers in the space that have sold bitcoin along the way to continue working. See Andreas Antonopolous as an example. He spent his bitcoin so he could continue to work in the space, and it's not a stretch to say others have as well. That is time and effort ($$) in the space. Look at all the ICO's and how much money went their way this year alone. Many of the companies converted to fiat because of bitcoins volatility, of course they would not keep all their funds there. The point is, they have funds for the next couple of years easy. There's still a lot of uncertainty, but its false to say there is isn't a single dollar in the bitcoin space. Just take a look at how many developer tools are being downloaded. There's a ton of people working on this space. That is of value, in the space itself.
Better to hear it from someone else: 
Fees are an issue at the moment, which is a scalability issue. It will be fixed. With bitcoin, or something else just a matter of time.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:46:01
Great article. Lots of good info. I like how he alludes to using bitcoin only if it is the best option for the system, and therefore T0 is built currency-agnostic. It makes needing to solve the transaction rate issue even more real: Here is a product that will use the best option out there, and one of their key requirements is sufficient settlement speed. Good stuff.
Also, interesting to see the system was built to be sold and separate from Overstock. I would not be surprised if it is sold quickly… seems like it solves a real problem and has SEC backing. I want in some how…

You know what, you're entitled to your opinion, but I don't think you are being forward thinking. Amazon stocks when they were only selling books were worth more than if they had sold all the books in the world, so price discovery was way ahead of where they were, because people saw the potential in online purchases. Fees are high atm because the tech needs to catch up to demand on the network. Growing pains. That's all that it is. It is not an impossible situation. Fees exist to prevent spam on the network. Once a scaling solution is found that does not undermine the decentralization of infrastructure, the fees will be minimal. pennies. And people will be ok with spending pennies to be on a censorship/decentralized/resistant currency/store of value/programmable money. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:47:15


You interpret it as crying on the media. Buddy was interviewed and was asked questions that he responded to.


It is still a requirement for that product, one of many, and that is what drives technology. Your opinion is totally valid though. It could not be a good thing for bitcoin. Options have to be weighed. I don't know enough to make a statement on the technical ramifications this would cause. On a side note, I honestly think the technology will evolve that this will eventually be a moot point.
For me, bottom line is his product has a need and he will find the best solution to fit his need. Bitcoin or not, its just what makes sense. Being an open project, anyone can use it, or a derivative of it, for anything they want.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:46:59
I don't see this as corporate outcry. He built a product to solve a problem. The product rests/relies on a technology. The product has a requirement, which looks like cannot be met by bitcoin in its current state. It is a requirement, just like mining decentralization. I agree that we should not sacrifice one for the other, but we should recognize it as a real need.

I enjoyed the book and learned a lot, my only criticism is the part where he says something along the lines of how only good art or good innovation  came out of the golden era. I find this hard to believe (maybe I'm wrong, I'm no expert), cherry picking to make an argument, and sours the argument for me a bit. I would still highly recommend the book as it teaches you a lot about hard money, salability, high and low time preference and the history of money. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:22:30
Don't want to sound like an alarmst, but you are identifying yourself as someone who owns bitcoin. Someone can follow you home or find out where you live from a public place and come find you later. Doesn't matter if there are cameras in that case. Just make sure your stash is safe and you have a plan for a situation like that.

I think if you follow traders to 'know' what is going to happen, you're missing the point of technical analysis. TA is about statistical probabilities, which tries to measure the psychology of the market through price action. It's saying 'hey, there's a chance this is going to happen because it's happened in the past more than it hasn't, so now might be a good time to place a trade'. Any trader worth their salt is always advocating for stop losses or taking profit because they know that they don't 'know'.
You could also say the same about Fundamental Analysts. They don't 'know' what is going to happen either. I think both are great to have in the toolkit, and I'd say TA has made me a better hodler.
I'm surprised how many people misunderstand the premise of TA, and think it's something that it's not. To say it 'can't even remotely forecast what is going to happen' is empirically false.
edit: I should say, I'm no expert, I've just been following bitcoin for a while and this is what I've observed. I am not skilled enough nor do I have the time to trade properly.

Although I agree some inflation is negligible, and despite that inflation in bitcoin would never work because you would just have someone copy it, make it deflationary and it would automatically be more desirable, the fact that a nation state controls a money supply and increases it at will, I see as a very bad thing. Imagine the US could not print the world's reserve currency at whim, do you think they would have been as eager to jump into Iraq or Afghanistan?
Progress despite inflation does not mean inflation is a good thing, or negligible. It's not like it went no where. What is the end game?  Have we seen the full effects of QE yet or is it still to come? Why has gold been around for so long and why has it out performed the dollar over the last 40 years?

Well, I never stated my requirements for what makes money valuable. Scarcity is only one important aspect of hard money. You said 'rare does not equal value', and 'it's the weakest pro points to bitcoin', when in fact, if it did not exist, bitcoin would not exist in any meaningful way. It's one of the most important points!
Satoshi wrote in the original bitcoin block the header: 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
It alludes to why bitcoin was created. Because fiat money gets printed. Printing money is a tax applied to everyone set by those who control the supply. Although Erik may not have phrased his tweet right, that's what he's getting at. Bitcoin is hard money.

One day, when 99% of ico's have failed and the sponsors of her shows are not around (cloud mining lol smh), you'll understand why most of her content was useless and why some ppl consider her a shill. If you can't see the content itself as terrible (useless tokens and icos) then you probably just see a well put together podcast. That's why icos love her, she gives them a high production platform to promote their shitcoins. Kind of like Ran NeuNer.

I don't know if you are saying this for yourself or you mean for other investors, but if you're talking about yourself don't be lazy. Do it right, it's important. The only reason the etf would interest me is if i could save on tax when I sell, and I'm only talking a small percentage of my portfolio.  Don't use the etf as an excuse not to do things the right way, because in the end it could cost you and the ecosystem.

I would consider holding a small percentage (and I mean small) of my btc in the etf if i could buy and sell through my tfsa and save on tax. Actually, I think it would strengthen my hodl game since I wouldn't have to sell as much to offset the tax burden.

Scarcity is not a feature, it is a requirement for sound money. If you could easily make bitcoin it would not hold it's value because then anyone could make it. Your 10x demand wouldnt mean a thing if supply was 10x, especially out of your control. I'm not arguing against fungibility or salability or unconfiscatability, but you are missing the point of why bitcoin was created if you don't understand the value of scarcity. If your boat doesn't float, it doesn't matter how fast it is.

I'm not advocating against stickied threads. I think they're a good idea. I'm saying there needs to be some better outline around what makes it or doesn't. There are over 1 million subscribers. Whatever gets stickied will get more visibility than something that isn't and what gets stickied is based on what the mods have decided (unless I'm missing something). At least have some guidelines to avoid favoritism but still be able to select quality content.


That's not a solution, and actually illustrates the issue. If I have a lightning implementation I should become a mod to push my content get more views than the other implementations.
The size of the community is just so much bigger now, I'm stating my opinion that it's time to better define the rules that govern stickied comments.
Edit: Also, even if they've been quality content, that's not the issue I'm bringing up. If the sticky has been a product or company they are getting more exposure than a competing company or product that may be of quality as well.

I think the issue is if you begin to sticky products/companies, you create a bias, and if the mods have any relationships with these products, it's even worse. I think stickying threads is a good idea, but the guidelines/rules to what gets stickied, or not, needs to be better defined IMO.

At some point you could have said there weren't enough ubers around so it was easier to hail a cab than find an uber. You could have said Netflix was shit because they had shit content. Same with AirBnB. But the difference between all of those and their counterparts? They're all digital. Uber is the largest transportation company in the world, and they don't have any vehicles. Cabbies are trying to catch up, but you know what, they lack innovation, example: ride sharing; it's brilliant. Cabbies would not have thought of that. Uber a tech company is eating their lunch because the cabbies don't think like uber does. That's the analogy I'm trying to make. Visa or MasterCard could even try to use blockchain or btc. but to my original point in all of this: the tech allows for the system to be more efficient than any other system currently in play. key word is allows (potential)

I've been around for a couple years, and I'd say over time you'll start to distinguish who has some idea of what's going on, if you yourself aren't prone to just believing what you hear/read, because you get first hand experience. At first you consume content about what might happen from all kinds of people you don't know and it seems crazy, but over time you see what pans out and what doesn't and who to listen to. I'm witnessing a second bear market and confirming behaviors reoccurring. 
I think there are some really knowledgeable ppl in crypto out there that have some good idea of what is probable to come. I also know the content I appreciate is probably leaning to my biases. There are some ppl that have a good track record of what's going on.

There are perfectly justifiable reasons to convert wealth to crypto, or to earn crypto directly, because it has value. The barrier to entry (the percentage to exchange you stated) can still be worth it:
- As a Greek citizen, are willing to store wealth in btc so the government can't take posterity measures and take a haircut from your bank savings?
- As a programmer in Argentina, are you willing to take on work from another country and get paid in btc? Not only does it hold value better than the peso, you can do it without the government breathing down your neck.
- As a central bank, you do not trust the central bank from another country, so you use the SWIFT system. The SWIFT system costs you money and settlement is usually 3 weeks time. The bank* could use the btc network to transfer value and settle within an hour.
- As an investor, you see the worldwide potential btc has to offer, and you expect its use to grow. You understand there is a limited supply and you believe it will increase in value, that could also be a justifiable means to convert wealth to crypto.


In some places it is less efficient, in others it is more efficient. In the end, it has the potential (technically) to be more efficient than any means used now. You're thinking is short sited. It's like saying netflix wasn't good because it had no good content. While that my have been true at the time, it didn't remain true.


You do for now. If I could receive btc for work done, then use it to pay for groceries, and the grocery store uses it to pay for supplies, etc. etc. The closed loop means you do not need to exchange in and out btc. What is decentralized is the authority to write to the blockchain and agree upon the true version of it. Nothing to do with exchanges. No one can shut the blockchain down.

Your visa does not settle in seconds. It can take up to a month. It may look like it in your end but it is not truly settled for sometime. Visa can chargeback the merchant. Btc is irreversible way before visa is. And what i am saying is there is a usecase for this. I'm not saying you would want that yourself, in fact you probably don't since you would like the ability to chargeback your purchase.


I am not. I never stated that amd that is idiotic. I said btc can exist and do well without taking over the world in response to the thread topic, because there are areas where it is better in doing certain things than any system out there. I think you read further into what i was saying.
I compare to gold because there is a use case for btc to do what gold does, but better, i never implied it was for business use.
Edit: i can see why, i said 'current system' without being specific. I meant it in a very general sense (although i do think it will become as pervasive as the internet, and the internet did not send the world into upheaval)

Btc is less wasteful than gold. It is more efficient/easier to transfer than gold. It settles faster than visa. You gain operational efficiencies dealing in cross border transactions, etc. Etc. In it's complete form it is more secure than CC (push transaction). Etc. Etc.  Maybe 'better' is a better word than efficient (although efficient still applies). There are so many benifits that the tech provides that it will be a no brainer to implement over existing systems.

The bitcoin main chain is transparent in that you can see what address has what bitcoin. If someone can connect you to your address, it's not very private. Some companies can figure out who is likely to own what address by studying known addresses and pattern usage. Transparency is arguably a good thing for the main chain (you can audit for double spend or inflation).
Some second layers offer a level of privacy. Lightining network for example, does not record transactions on a open ledger. It uses a protocol between you and the receiver/sender to keep a record of account. Only opening and closing nodes are recorded in the main chain. So everything in between is private. You can even relay transactions without knowing anything about it. You don't know where it started, where it will end, and soon what the total amount is (you might be transferring a fraction of the total amount from sender to receiver). This will make it much more difficult for companies to track usage and figure out who owns what address.
All that to say, privacy is not a given, but it is an option, and as time passes, I'd guess it'll get easier to keep your privacy (but that's speculation).

It has to start somewhere, until the retailers have options to spend btc for their operations and close the loop. Also, fees are low at the moment, and lightning.

Creating a new fork does not increase supply of bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just the ledger, it's the entire ecosystem. And if it isn't, then it's a failed project. Although I understand what you are trying to get at, there are so many nuances to why your analogy does not apply. The supply of N64 is based on demand and can be increased. The supply of Bitcoin (just bitcoin) is hard coded (for lack of a better term) and will not increase. In fact, it will decrease as coins are lost.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:36:25
A fork is not bitcoin. You can fork as many times as you want, but that does not make it bitcoin. Like I said, bitcoin is not just the data. You can't just copy the data and say you created more bitcoin.  Factor in the developers, the network, the nodes, the consensus, mining etc.. I can verify if you have bitcoin, and a copy wouldn't work. And it's a fallacy to think you can just make a fork that can do whatever you want. Try keeping up with  the 400 developers working on the bitcoin protocol. It would take a massive amount of effort to copy what bitcoin is.
If Nintendo wanted to make more N64s, someone at nintendo can make an executive decision to do so. You need majority consensus in bitcoin to change the supply, and this is what the nodes enforce. You cannot just change this, that's the point.


... if you have a billionth of a unit, you still have a percentage of the total supply, which makes supply completely relevant, no matter how much you denominate it with.

Comparing btc directly to CCs is a bit of comparing apples to oranges. 
If you use Coinbase right now, your funds are insured similar to a CC company. They have bank grade security. Who's payment/transaction model is safer as a whole? 
Your original question is why a consumer would move to btc. Who has the operational advantage to offer a better service to consumers, Coinbase, or Visa? a Crypto bank or a current bank? What is better, having $50 of cash in my pocket, or $50 of btc accessible from my phone (assuming I can actually spend it somewhere lol)?
It's better to compare Coinbase to Visa like you would compare Uber to Taxi companies if you're talking about services to consumers.

@_date: 2018-03-20 16:50:19
To your point, I remember not too long ago a significant number of merchants did not accepted debit or credit card, especially smaller merchants that did not want to pay the CC companies fees for smaller items. I was def more likely to go somewhere that accepted CC or debit because the more times I withdrew cash my bank would tack on fees. It was easier and more convenient to use CC. I'm sure like you said, merchants had to step up and accept CC/debit because that is what consumers wanted.
Now imagine you are a merchant, you don't like to accept CC or debit because of chargebacks and fraud. You still do because the reward outweighs the risk, but what if you could accept crypto, avoid the 2-5% fees CC would charge you for the transaction, and avoid the risks of chargebacks (on physical goods)? You could offer a discount if you pay in crypto, and you're store is better off. Assuming btc is out of it's infancy and is a working currency, it's possible a consumer would be incentivised to pay in crypto. So, are customers demanding to pay in Bitcoin? Not right now, but let's see what it looks like in 10 years from now. You have to have a bit of forward thinking to see my point, or you completely miss what I am saying. I know it's not perfect at this time, but the potential is there. You could have said Netflix was shit when it didn't have good content, and completely overlooked the fact that it's easier and better to get content over the web.

Not sure if you're talking about a physical card, but I definitely used my Starbucks app in the US, topped up in Canada.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:20:01
I agree with that for sure. 
However, if a grocery store / gas station / physical store is experiencing a high level of charge-backs, it could be one of two things happening: stolen credit cards, or the grocery store is being defrauded. There is very little justification for charging back on purchase of physical goods in these cases. Not only can the store reduce being defrauded, btc eliminates the cases of stolen identity because it does not* require you to provide the keys to spend your money (unlike a CC).
edit: and in the case of purchase over the internet, the same could be accomplished with an escrow service, which is in a sense what a MasterCard or Visa are effectively doing with chargebacks. They would probably have to do it less because most chargebacks are due to stolen credit cards. This is the exact efficiency btc will bring, that you cannot accomplish with the existing system.

@_date: 2018-03-16 21:03:59
I added something to my earlier comment about being able to use an escrow service to accomplish the same thing when doing an online purchase. Fraud could be reduced and money saved for the merchant, CC company, and consumer. That's the efficiency that the btc system brings that cannot be accomplished with any other existing system, and to my point originally.
To sort of give an answer to your question: Consumers would benefit by being less exposed to fraud (not having to give CC# away).
Consumers in third world country would benefit from having a banking system as opposed to not lol. There's a good video by Andreas Antonopolous on how first world countries probably won't see btc adoption up front, since we have a pretty ok banking system.
I personally still use CC 99.99% of the time. It makes more economic sense for me to do so, and I feel pretty safe doing so. If you gave me the same benefits but it had better security behind it, I'd choose that for sure.

yeah i see how that can be confusing. if you own your private keys, you own your bitcoin. in the case of trezor, your keys are effectively in the device so rest assured you own your bitcoin. if trezor left the scene, you could recover yoir bitcoin with the 24 phrases your trezor generated and you wrote down.
ppl (mostly hard core developers) say if you don't run your own node you are effectively trusting someone else's set up to be an honest node. nodes relay the ledger so if youre not running your own node someone could fake spend your btc. if trezor did this it would become obvious very quickly because the node would be out of sync with other nodes.
edit:also, trezor cannot recover the private keys themselves. and to be clear, a bad node would not cause you to lose bitcoin if you are sending, only of you are receiving. so for example, if you are a store and you are trusting someone else's set up and their node is compromised someone can seem to pay you when in fact it was not relayed to real nodes and therefore nothing actually happened. they basically faked a payment. but you can see the risk exposure is pretty low.
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:49:07
I do not believe that is true accross the board. There are places where it is less risky, and that scope will increase over time.

Agreed. Until it reaches a tipping point, but like i said, has to start somewhere. It's being bootstrapped to the current system. 
There are use cases where it makes sense. If i was a developer in Venezuela/Argentina I'd keep my btc in btc. Can extrapolate from there for other use cases, until the system becomes more efficient than the existing and that's where mass adoption would come in. Doesn't need to come to the first world first either.

My opinion is, it would not surprise me. If it works out, it will surprise a lot of people who are not paying attention, as it has done until now. I generally accept anything within the same market size as gold is easy to explain/digest and why so many people base their predictions off that. But it's not a stretch to assume (if you believe in btc) it would go beyond that; it is just hard to say why with conviction. If btc is better gold, then those extra features have an implication that btc have a &gt; value than gold. But we don't fully understand what that value actual means, so how can you predict its size?
What I mean is, we can have some confidence in saying crypto will get to the size of the gold market _because it is a superior store of value_. What we have trouble saying is crypto will be bigger than the gold market because ________. We know it has proven to be a good store of value (imo), but it hasn't really shown anything else. Everyone knows the potential, but since it is so new, it is hard to see what it is.
tl;dr something tells me it's possible, but I just can't put a finger on exactly why it would get to that size.

They make money through their own means but have a vested interest in the project doing well, so they support it. Companies could also donate to foundations that support developers. Coinbase is an obvious example. They make money through the services they provide, and they have a budget for paying open sourced developers. Litecoin has a foundation that will pay others to work on ltc projects. I think bitcoin used to have a foundation but there were issues (can't remember the details). It is not uncommon. It is also a way the company/organization can implement what is priority for them. It also builds up their expertise im the project.

No, although there may be some that do, a lot of times with open sourced projects, companies will pay developers to work on the project. For example many developers work at blockstream, i believe coinbase has a few on multiple projects including lightening. Not sure who else but i believe there are a few others included. Greg Maxwell worked for blockstream up until recently (dec?). Not sure if he is self employed now. But anyways, yes many times developers of high profile open sourced projects will have a salary.

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. I'm not quite sure what phenomenon you developed your hypotheses for. You're describing proofing methods used to determine if CW is Satoshi, which in that case, are not hypothesis.
I get the general idea that Satoshi would more likely use a simpler proofing method (because of human behavior, or as Vitalik states, signaling theory), and that assumes something wasn't stopping him from doing so. I just thought Occam's Razor doesn't make sense here. I see Occam's Razor misused quite often on Reddit. Occam's Razor is a strategic way to choose a hypothesis and develop a theory, it is not proof within itself. The 'simpler explanation is more likely to be true' is not even part of Occam's Razor, it is more about the fact that simpler hypothesis are easier to test. Satoshi should use an easier testing method, but he is not developing a hypothesis :).

I think I thought it was just some heavily marketed book, but then I listened to probably one of his first talks (first in his podcast) and decided to buy the book. I thought it was great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to ferment their understanding of bitcoins fundamental value. I do have some criticisms of the book, but would still recommend it.

You mean it's taking that one node operator a whole week to update his node?

Oh wow, ha! never knew there was a ln tipping bot. It's like 2013 all over again.

This is just silly. Of course it matters. Whether you want to value it in dollars or how many loaves of bread it can buy you, it f**king matters what it is worth, it's a store of value. It's job is literally to represent value and make it easy to transfer. Maybe you're trying to say is 'I'm not worried what the price is right now, because the tech is great, and in the long run I expect it to be worth much more?'. Unless you're just using to to transfer wealth? I guess in that case it doesn't matter what the price is, but it certainly does matter if you want to create an economy off of it.

I've been to two developer conferences in the last month, and to my surprise, so many startups and apps being built on ethereum... Ethereum mentioned more than bitcoin... So I wouldn't be so quick to say most people haven't heard of it. I have no favorites, just saying what I've observed. Made me think twice about where investment is going...

How is this upvoted so much? It's the second stupid post this week from this twitter account.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:18:57
I heard it like 'let's not shoot ourselves in the foot'.
I think the next step for the BitCoin community is to focus on the 'product', making it mature. I'm pretty encouraged by what has been said so far.

Herein lies the fundamental misalignment with bitcoin that drives anything the Andreessen Horowitz put their shit ton of money into, and it includes Coinbase and Circle amongst many others. They think bitcoin introduces programmable money, but they don't like that what it actually introduces is a new monetary policy.
They want control, so they don't accept bitcoin for what it is, and try to take from it, compete with it, and morph this revolution into what they want. I don't want what they want.
And when Brian Armstrong says he likes bitcoin, he means it like you would say you like your ex-wife.

Jameson Lopp came out with a great article suggesting the motivation behind all this is to build a narrative around some sort of company or group of assets they want to sell. If it's true, at this point if anyone actually falls for it they have it coming. I can't wait until this is over. Such stupidity and what a waste of time.

Great question about keeping investors in the US. I think that says a lot about the tone of this hearing.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:16:49
Yes, let's throw the entire Senate under what one Senator said before he promptly left the room. Let's build an US vs. THEM complex.

Not that I doubt you, but can you qualify that? I'd love to see some reports or numbers on the start-ups being founded and funded. If that's just your opinion, that's cool too.

So silent this is only about the 100th article I've seen on it this week.

I think there's 10 minutes left (5:30 ET).

Yes, I agree, and on top of that, well put. It can be a scary thing too, given how much power one might seem to have over the other. Thank god cooler heads exist in both camps.
Here is my original point (without being sarcastic this time): Let's not muddy the water with misleading evidence. Let's not build up the idea that the government is against this, unless the testimony supports it. It's not worth the energy. Sure the image is cute and funny, but the post title is misleading. At the end of the day, I want what's good, not what US or THEY want. Let's be clear.
The fact that the original post has so many upvotes does concern me as an investor, but at the same time, I'm glad some rational thoughts made their way to the top as well.

Sure, there is a division of roles. But that doesn't mean we put words in their mouth and create a false/misleading argument. US vs THEM is different than US and THEM. The growth and life of BitCoin is tied to this relationship (whether we like it or not). Creating an US vs THEM on *false pretenses* is not good for the life of this thing. I mean, no one fucking died here, but the clearer we are, the better chance this has, no?

For my sake, and for everyone else's sake, I don't want to take part in this 'complex'. The title of this post is misleading. To give OP the benefit of the doubt, I'm guessing it was an oversight. If not, this post is foolish.

I saw this today and thought it was a great idea! I was about to pre-order, but it doesn't look like you can store a card with a chip. I was still considering it since I'd keep all my point cards on it (Aeroplan, petro points, etc.), but I have a windows phone... :|. now that I think of it... I wonder if I can use it without a phone?
