I didn't profess to know your life but when you start blaming the "racist grannies" for the outcome it shows you have a fairly warped idea of the situation. There are a multitude of reasons why people wanted out of the EU as opposed to your simplistic idea that everyone who voted out is a racist. 
I don't disagree the house of lords is undemocratic hence why they might still veto the decision but as for the EU, just take a look at who elected the current president or what he has to say about passing laws in the EU and what happens if they don't get passed.

I'm 23 and I voted to leave with the main motivation of leaving a completely un-democratic institution. A Visa costs a few pounds for the one or two times a year you actually might leave the country and takes a couple of minutes online to apply for, it's a pathetic reason to vote to remain. Stop with these stupid shaming tactics because people disagreed with you.

Not yet no although I might try them today. I was hoping to buy a couple of days ago and now it's going up again so it's a little annoying.

Was planning on buying from Kraken but I've been waiting for ages for tier 3 verification. Submitted last week and still haven't heard anything.

I'd suggest coinfloor over Kraken, trading is much easier and transparent, it also seems more reliable.

True but unfortunately the only other viable alternative I've used so far that I trust is localbitcoins and the fees and hassle make it less attractive. I advise anyone who wants to buy to save up a decent amount and then purchase through an exchange.
