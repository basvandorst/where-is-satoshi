Dash screwed up all three requirements for mass adoption.
1. actually having mass adoption (see fake KFC News &amp; other Venezuelan Dash PR scams LOL)
2. shipping new features before they become obsolete (Evolution is now 3 years late and still 100% vaporware LOL)
3. having devs competent enought to secure a simple web wallet (unlike hacked/pwned/rekt MyDashWallet LOL)

Uh oh, nobody tell u/h0dl this is happening or he'll reach fresh new depths of denial and crankyness LOL
EDIT: Too late.  Oops.  Now the poor thing is all triggered and irritated, like a mangy old dog LOL

I'd like something akin to the trust system but for whitelisted interactions (aka Default Mass Block).
IE, the option to only see posts from those I trust/whitelist and those trusted/whitelisted by them.
Please sir, when Bullshit Mode On/Off toggle?  XD
The current state of the board is a perfect example of why anarchist ideas, when put into practice, lead to cringey and ridiculous failure modes.
I'd like a libertarian option to enforce self-selected intentional communities, free to develop our insular cultures unbound by the seething masses of drooling one-man-one-opinion all-speech-is-equal types who have made the place a paradisical shithole for unwashed hordes of Dash and other shitcoin scammunities.

To mitigate hardware supply chain attacks, what do you think about multisig/musig using multiple devices?
EG, cold storage coins cannot be moved without 2/3 joint authorization from a Tezor, a Ledger, and an old (Purism) laptop or Blackberry?
