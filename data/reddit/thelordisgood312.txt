I have no problem with coal power. I have a problem with "electric" powered car companies deceiving people into thinking their cars are better for the environment, and the fools that believe them.

Wow. Enjoy driving your coal powered car.

The US economy is on a historic all time high and at the same time as China’s is at a 30 year low. And Trumps not doing a good job? Put the weed down young man.

I think the advantage of BTC:
- very low transaction costs
- speed of payment
Regular people
- low inflation
- low gov't interference
- low fraud
- easy payment p2p anywhere in the world


This is what is happening now. It's just a currency reserve now. When it's just as easy or easier to use btc for all transactions people will be more inclined to use it. I think the wild swings will slow down although it will be on a slower steady rise. If I use btc for all my transactions and I replenish my account weekly or bi-weekly, the change in rate won't be big enough to prohibit me from spending the coins. 
Looking at the big picture, the amount of btc is finite and we expect many more users. So of course it will become more valuable. When millions of people get on board there will be fluctuation for a time.

I disagree. I think goods will always be priced in the local fiat and during the electronic transaction the current rate of btc will be determined and that amount of btc will exchanged. In the beginning the value of btc will keep increasing until most people are using it, then we'll see it stabilize. So people will keep an eye on the exchange rate.
Most likely people will just add funds to their btc account immediately at any time. It's like adding money to your debit card account today. Credit card companies will have accounts only for btc as well so it can be borrowed. The only time is see fiat completely collapsing is when an economy completely collapses.
