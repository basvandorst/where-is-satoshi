Isn't the whole thing with Bitcoin to try and essentially become your own bank 
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:16:51
I thought I was doing a nice thing for my 9wk old in buying one for her.
I'd like to get each of my future kids one.
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:31:51
I'm Canadian
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:40:01
try this place
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:28:49
yeah i think it may have to come down to something like this and go off a trust basis.
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:24:40
someone should test it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:27:55
true. 
I do rely on credibility with this method. 
I am just trying to minimize the off chance of getting screwed.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:35:22
out of curiosity how did you get your bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-01-31 09:31:13
why is blockchain.info bad?
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:34:00
I think this may be my best bet.
Just trying to verify all my options.
I was initially going to try coinmx but I was turned right off when they wanted me to identify myself. In my opinion my credit card is enough just like every other online store in the world i don't need to give this kind of detailed info.

And early Bitcoin adoption had low numbers as well because there were less people using it... it has the potential of growth.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:01:07
And if it goes in that direction and it's positive/cheap enough for the average person than I am all for it.
It shouldn't cost $5 to send a transaction this is getting mental
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:06:49
I agree I we are in the same boat.
We all want to see this go to the moon. 
We just want the best thing for the group as a whole. 
Either way legacy must evolve to grow. The hard forks explain this. Now what the people chose is what we will have to wait and see
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:48:42
either way we need to evolve our way of thinking.
The more adoption and acceptance means the transfer of funds will occur and we will make money and slowly more places will be on board.
Just wait there will be platforms that will accept anything you are willing to trade crypto wise and will convert it to dollars.
Ultimately Bitcoin will move onto one of these chains. It has to be fast, secure and profitable for both miners and cost effective enough to buy small things without getting raped by high transaction fees. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:27:52
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:19:56
He's just mad that cash is worth more than LTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:26:40
People are trying to make sure their transaction goes through fast so they put a high fee on it.
Miners will prioritize the highest fee. So it becomes a dog eat dog rat race to get a fast confirmation and it ends up costing more and more to outdo the previous guy
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:52:23
Terry flaps.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:02:58
There is NO replay protection for 2x
There IS replay protection for BCH
The private keys for legacy/2x chain are shared.
It's a forced upgrade if you decide to use 2x and there is no turning back or downgrading. 
With BCH you have the option to ignore, sell, or use it as. You aren't forced to do anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:25:52
Do realize there is no replay protection.
What this means if you spend on the 2x chain your original BTC on the legacy chain goes poof gone.
Unlike BCH where there IS replay protection and you are able to do what you wish on either chain and it does not affect your overall amount on the other chain.
Make sense?
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:51:53
Have a read
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:44:02
yeah. 
the whole encryption thing is going to get really big in the next little while here. I haven't even read gmails security policy yet. I'm interested in what it says for curiosity sake. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:44:30
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:15:13
2fa in terms of google authenticator is a safe thing.
Not to mention multi-sig wallets are also a smart move.
Heck there will be more things like a trezor to confirm that you are putting through a transaction.
there will be more advancements in security.
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:48:24
there are lot of what ifs.
Make sure you sign out every time. 
Regular changes of passwords.
Lets hope it gets 100 times if not bigger than it is today.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:20:02
thats my thoughts too. 
Where is the line drawn in terms of their access.
Password manager, Email, Banking, Bitcoin, Cloud Drives?
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:40:57
cool, wonder if this will be the new google.
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:16:37
honestly keep a small amount in blockchain wallet, its mobile its easy.
My account requires me to go to my email which has 2fa to even sign onto the email. Next there is a 2fa for the bitcoin account itself along with a strong password. I don't think getting a cell text is that secure for 2fa but its better than nothing if you don't use Google Authenticator. I don't see how the fuck anyone could get onto this. I think i have my stuff buttoned up well.
Keep a small amount 1btc on your online/mobile wallet or less in my eyes.
The rest of my stuff in multiple paper wallets with backups for security with very strong unique passwords. 
 
Cheap, easy and safe.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:14:09
link does not work.
@_date: 2015-03-15 06:41:42
What was the provider lol?
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:09:39
Can I ask why 21 bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:58:59
honestly you don't have any right nor is it any of your buisness with what their intentions of bitcoins..
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:04:20
meanwhile someone has said "Challenge Accepted"
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:25:30
no issues with them
bank transfer takes about 3 days for the money to show up in your account.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:41:42
Does anyone have the address where they sent their bitcoin to the mtgox address?
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:22:07
That is the one that scares me.
Can you enable a double password to access your phone?
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:47:19
heck i am working towards getting 5. Should be there tomorrow:) Next step 10.
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:46:52
parents house.
in a book.
hidden jump drives in obscure locations.
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:12:21
Am I wrong but Blockchain is still safe with things like completely randomized passwords and google authenticator?
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:15:00
I have thought about this too.
Aren't there wallets out there that you can choose the transaction fee? I though I saw this on darkwallet as an example....
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:51:39
generate them offline with a big BIP-30 passphrase.
Print off multiple copies and take a few jump drives and back the up.
Store them in a few locations that way you have a backup if something goes wrong. 
Also my advice is to do paperwallet in 1 BTC sizes so you don't have to cash a big paper wallet and re-distribute it into paperwallets after cashing them...
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:20:49
Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. It's a stock so to speak.
Buy a little and pay for a few things. Say a reddit membership, VPN and a few other things.
I strongly think that our phones are going to be our payment devices in the future. Bitcoin will be a common thing 10 years from now.
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:57:41
why is 21 coins the magic number
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:45:56
thanks, i am pretty pumped and keen to share the idea to people.
I really think this will be a common household name and thing in the next 5-10 years.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:22:24
Congrats to you.
Imagine cashing in those all at once and having an exchange day "we can't pay you yet we don't have the funds"
Since everyone else is doing it.
Maybe one will pay for my infant daughter's education one day. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:01:52
yeah i would probably avoid it all together if the buyer was that open about what he was buying.
I would prefer to just not know then in my eyes your not at fault.
