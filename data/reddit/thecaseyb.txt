You can’t shrug off the current problems by saying that other Cryptos would eventually have the same problems. That’s just deflecting.

Again, you’re just deflecting from the fact that Bitcoin is experiencing these issues here and now and something needs to be figured out. Any other crypto that have scale issues in the future will have to deal with those when they occur and I’m sure they’ll learn from bitcoin and other wary currencies mistakes if we don’t learn from them first. I don’t really care personally about the logistics, I’m just saying you’re using a bad argument to justify the current issues.

I’m speaking in terms of regulation. And, Comparing an exchange to a bank in terms of regulation is silly. In terms of regulation and protection from fuckery, it seems to me coinbase is closer to Facebook. If I’m wrong, please correct me. But as far as my view is concerned, I’d say I reflect the feelings of quite a few average semi-intellectual consumers in regards to the usefulness of bitcoin in every day life, which was its original purpose in replacing fiat currency right? Not to rely on banks and give power to the consumer? Now you are encouraging relying on something even less regulated or insured than banks from the outside. Seems weird.
Edit: sorry for the shitty grammar. My thoughts are scattered today, and I’m just writing stream of consciousness responses atm

You’re saying an exchange should be trusted to hold bitcoin for 15+ years with no issues? Interesting.

IMO trusting coinbase to hold things long term, is the equivalent of trusting Facebook or Twitter to hold your bitcoin long term. ����‍♂️

No, but when you run a business trying to take bitcoin as a payment source or trying to buy materials with bitcoin, and it having zero stability, is pretty inconvenient.

Y’all don’t let this pumping stop, I made some bad purchases earlier this year I need to make that money back!’

Doesn’t have to be the 80s for you to have to call. I think he assumed you were wealthier.

As someone who uses bitcoin as a currency rather than just a trading option, this is actually really fucking infuriating.
