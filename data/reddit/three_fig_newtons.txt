If you have a diversified crypto portfolio you could focus spending on other cryptos for the time being. Bitcoin is beating up the rest of the market for now but once there are signs of a correction from the normies I'd bet BTC holders will spread back out to ETH/LTC/altcoins

There's an opportunity cost in not converting BCC into BTC. 
Back when it was $200 and people thought it was going to implode it made sense to sell off immediately.

In the end who cares. I believe in BTC, I believe in its community, I'm willing to hold it for 10+ years. I don't like BCH, I don't believe in it, I had no intention of holding it other than as a way to hedge my bets.

- BCH is a centralized shit coin, Ver is colluding with Chinese miners, looking to make a quick buck off of weak handed suckers
- Its recent pump was manipulated by one Korean exchange 
- Big blocks are a bandaid that will become rapidly obsolete, BTC's roadmap has much better technologies in its future
- BCH developers couldn't code their way out of a paper bag, all of the best developers are on BTC
- The only future BCH could possibly have is stealing BTC's name. There are hundreds of alts with better technology and security out there, BCH is garbage, the only reason why people care about it is because it was a soft fork that gave away free coins and it's intentionally designed to confuse new bitcoin investors by having a similar name and trying to steal the name "Bitcoin." 
I wouldn't have nearly as much vitriol if BCH didn't exist solely to antagonize BTC and to create a civil war, for fuck's sake you have hundreds of new accounts on Reddit less than a month old with &lt;100 karma either concern trolling or outright attacking BTC holders on r/Bitcoin and r/BitcoinMarkets. Clearly bought off Russian troll shills. r/BTC just needs to stay in its own fucking cesspool of a sub, and also create r/BitcoinCashMarkets so they stop polluting the trading sub.

Dollar Cost Average, if you want to invest $10,000 into Bitcoin but are worried you don't know when the dip is, just invest $1,000 every day for 10 days to average out your initial investment. 
That way you don't get screwed by investing $10K all at once and then having BTC plummet right after.

- Bitcoin Gold will be worth about $3.50, nobody is going to buy that shit
- SW2X isn't an airdrop, it's just a mess that hopefully dissolves before it even happens
Nobody is going to sell off BTC after the fork because these two events will be tiny blips on the radar. Then hopefully, HOPEFULLY we will have a period of healthy stability with no more dumbass fork drama. That would be the best Christmas gift.
