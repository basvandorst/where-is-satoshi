Its own video calls itself a currency. The description of this subreddit calls Btc the currency of the internet. You do not have to look hard to find MANY people who call cryptocurrency a currency. A volatile one but still a currency all the same.

So then the only point in getting it, is to hold it?  If its a currency to be used to buy things. It needs to be less volatile. If I get 1000.00 USD worth of BTC to buy a... computer let's say. Most people do not want to worry it may be worth 500.00 in the morning. Yet the volatility is what makes people trade it and gamble it like a stock. Which makes it more volatile and more apt getting pumped up or down by bigger fishes. This is an inherent problem with most Crypto right now from my perspective. I like it for that same same reason too.  Because I can get it low and get more bang for my BTC if it goes up.   But it's a gamble.

Exactly. I agree. No knows yet. And it is unique and has great things going for it.

This is not surprising nor should it be to anyone is the US. US laws suck. That is not coinbase's fault.

I agree they should talk. It is always best to work shit out rather than what is happening now. Try and find some common ground and work from there.

DONT SCREAM! 
Seriously if your in Hawaii Coinbase is stopping service there due to regulations requiring them to back all deposits with Fiat. So they are telling everyone to move their BTC to another wallet or cash out. I try not to use coinbase but with that said I do use it and over 15K in transactions I never had a single issue. I get half my pay in BTC and now I use a local wallet .

I have not commented in this sub for sometime due to the down voting of anything deemed dissent. I agree with that part of the post. I make half my living in BTC. I love BTC. Freedom to speak ones mind within reason is something I thought the BTC community would aspire to allow, as messy as that can be sometimes.

Coinbase just added instant debit card purchasing. circle is cool too but I personally like Coinbase. I feel its pretty safe.

Amen! Great post and thank you devs. Disagreements are not a bad thing, differing opinions often lead to innovation. It is how we handle and deliver such things.

Thanks. Yeah it wasnt an endorsement but I did check up on it to make sure it was legit. I was just pointing out the BTC acceptance.  Although I may very well use it. Where i am it costs me 65.00 a year. If I use BTC I can get about the same price and never leave my home! Plus my elderly mom could really use this. I am a fan of things being easier like the DMV. If I can pay 10.00 more and not wait four hours at the DMV I will and have paid for such services! Thanks for the reassurance.
