"Liquidity is about how big the trade-off is between the speed of the sale and the price it can be sold for."
I'm going to reread this, but lets says that asset X took a year to sell without slippage and the other asset Y took 5 minutes but had slippage... Anyway. I appreciate you being civil and informative.

Easy ICO creation has just been imported to Bitcoin via Rootstock. What part of Bitcoin or its new sidechain can deter fraudulent uses of technology?
Education is the only thing that can do that. Please don't blame the tools.

I didn't realize that transaction speed wasn't a component of liquidity. I'm not being snarky, I vaguely recall that velocity of an asset was playing some role.
I appreciate your comments, truly.

If you're interested in getting a feel for just how simple it is to setup and operate a hardware wallet, I just published this:
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:48:32
That is *a* point. I agree. (Though if a network under load still outperforms another network sans that load - that's another point.)
**Either way, the claim to which I was responding said, in part, "...allows cat breeding apps to scale..." - which is inaccurate.** 
"It allows the inability of cat app scaling *not* to bloat the main chain," is **your** point. And it is not contentious.

Article, if you want to further educate your friends:

The exchange is where you will likely have bought your crypto. This is warning you that if you leave your crypto sitting on the exchange here you bought them - then you do not control your crypto. You are at the mercy of the exchange. If anything happens to the exchange - your crypto is vulnerable. A hardware wallet is the easiest way to protect your crypto and control your private keys.

If you are daytrading your entire balance, then no - you are trading the risks of keeping your assets on the the exchanges for ready access to trading. There is some unknown risk x and it is hard to weigh against your daytrading returns y, but it does exist. 
Decentralized exchanges do exist (where you can trade directly from your off-exchange wallets), but not for fiat currency trades (afaik).
For people trading only a portion of their portfolios, they might consider moving the idle balance to a hardware wallet. Exchanges are not foolproof, and trust does have its own costs. Daytraders must generally accept these costs.

Excellent, thorough, and informative response.
Really appreciated.

That's not particularly constructive - but I was trying to dispel a very common conception. "Digital gold" is becoming a staple phrase in the crypto space. I believe it may be lulling investors into misunderstanding where the value of a blockchain-based digital asset is actually coming from.
Just trying to promote deep thinking in the community - because I do not honestly believe that everyone finds this as obvious as you do.

I'm interested in this claim. If a sidechain of asset A with liquidity X was compared to Asset B (on-chain implementation of that sidechain of A) and the liquidity of B was also X. Then how would one decide which implementation to choose? This argument seems to basically says: price &gt; (tech x any multiplier) - it goes against my intuition. That doesn't mean it's wrong. Can you please elaborate?
Also, In what ways are liquidity tied to the speed of on-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:42:20
This is an **excellent** consideration! Kinda of grinds against the decentralization ethos, but absolutely something I overlooked.
Thank you for pointing this out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:50:27
I sincerely appreciate the feedback, thank you.
For those of you reading this comment without reading the article **no, I'm NOT simply bashing Bitcoin!** I love crypto.

If nothing else... to scale the EVM upon which Rootstock operates?
*Rootstock is the EVM - Ethereum Virtual Machine* Is this widely understood? Roostock, literally would not have been possible without it. I cannot comprehend why people don't get excited these technologies are innovating into each other for the betterment of the world.

Article here, if you care to read it:
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:33:58
I agree, and that is another point altogether (and possibly less contentious).
**That's not the same point I'm trying to make in the article**, but it is certainly worth noting in the midst of the discussion we all ought to be having.

To clarify: if you set up your hardware wallet, then these words are the only way to recover your wallet and its private/public key. Hardware wallets do not expose your private key (so you might not KNOW what your private keys looks like) - but you are in control of your private key as long as you are in control of your hardware wallet. Hope that addresses your concern.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:50:48
They are as valuable as your keys, though not the same thing. They allow you to *recreate* your private and public keys. As long as you are the only one that has access to those seed words - and the private key that results - then you are safe.
If you've written down those words and now use a wallet that only you can control - then you are doing things the right way.
NEVER share those words. NEVER share the private key.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:26:39
The location of the seed words used to set up your wallet could be shared ahead of time. Or, you could write a note with instructions - and only there disclose the location of the seed words. This way, in case of a tragedy such as you described - your Bitcoins would not be lost forever.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:47:15
Right. Assuming cat app had its own chain. If they were to only ones running their chain to scale their app ... we'd lose some of the decentralization benefits...
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:08:07
This is not as promising as it sounds. This simply means that the sidechain would become backlogged - and the **functional speed of using the dApp** would be exactly the same between the Ethereum and Rootstock implementations. Moving to the sidechain would be limited by on-chain blocktimes, so that getting started with the game would take a little longer to begin with. 
The sidechain implementation does allow the Bitcoin main chain to perform without the extra dApp strain, that is true - but the Ethereum main chain, even under the load of the dApp, has been faster than Bitcoin without the dApp strain.
*Both implementations share the current bottlenecks of the EVM*, which leaves the on-chain scaling of each highly relevant.

ATTENTION Bitcoin Cowards (Hodlers) : If you’re not voting with your assets, then you’re squandering your once-in-a-generation chance to cast a vote for the future of society. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:52:14
What good points?
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:06:38
I know that many people are in it just for the money. I'm trying to remind people that voting with your wallet is the only way the community can ultimately have a say in crypto. Or else the whales alone will decide what's best for everyone - as they have in the fiat systems.
If hodling - hedging - removes all signals from regular people in the community, then the movement won't be able to live up to its world-changing potential.
* Gets off soapbox *
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:12
Yes, this is absolute coming.
I was just saying that Bitcoin's success *up until now* obviously isn't because it's hard to "oversee".
If anything, private transactions will give the government more of an argument than it has now... Not that their arguments will matter much in the long run.
