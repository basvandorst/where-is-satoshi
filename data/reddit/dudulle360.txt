Of course it is. Who would lie on the internet?

You can use Electrum with your Ledger. You'll have more control over your coins.
If you want to try that, install electrum, make a new (standard) wallet and select "Use hardware device".

Haven't you learned anything in here? Butts will put an end to all those evil governments. So if filthy fiat is backed by governments, they'll soon be worthless. Obviously in a year or two.

Now you need to get a birdbath to store your HW safely.

You need to open the correct coin app on the Ledger too.
Then the chrome app will open your wallet.

If you mine with a pool, you might actually make it worse for the pool.
What a pool does is split the work between the miners. If the "winning share" is given to you, most likely you won't process it entirely before another pool solves the block.
If you mine all by yourself, you're very unlikely (like, almost impossible) to mine a block, but at least you don't get in the way of others.
Or launch a gpu pool with millions of miners, then you might have a chance to help the network.
tl;dr: you're just wasting time and getting in the way of people doing real work.

 Next time an exchange tells you you should withdraw if you want some tokens in time, just withdraw and quit bitching.

No idea about aes.json, but the .key file contains your private keys (probably encrypted). that's the one you want. And that's the one you need to import.
If it asks you a password when you import it, then it's encrypted and you'll need to find the password you had setup. If it doesn't, you should be fine.

It also did not reach it's peak price for about 17 years. This WAS a bubble. Everyone agrees on that.
MS survived because of course MS survived.
Thousands other companies did not do so well when that happened.
If the same thing happens to Bitcoin, it could also survive but it would also prove it's a bubble.
You can say whatever you want about public confidence and stuff, but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be so confident if you had to wait 17 years to break even on an investment.

If that's really xxxx/xx format, it's the year/month where the wallet was created. It's only useful on some wallets to avoid searching the blockchain for older transactions. It has absolutely nothing to do with the derivation path.
If your wallet doesn't ask for it, it won't make any difference.
Now, some wallets use the seed phrase differently. You can try to import it in electrum. If it doesn't work, import it again, but in the options select "bip39 seed".
Edit: You can also try MultiBit HD. I think that's one of the few wallets that use the date so you might have created your wallet with that one.

Most likely this won't affect much people here.
The vulnerability which they refer to is in AMT, which is only on processors for business (Intel Core vPro and Xeon).  
Thanks for the FUD though.
Edit: And even if you do have a processor with AMT, you need to explicitly enable it if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:15:18

Does that explain why BCH did not confirm for two days with empty blocks though?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:08:19
This is an disguised ICO.
Most likely a scam too.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:05:40
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:05:16
I did read It.
Most of it complains about a bug found in AMT and things that are only possible with this (while insinuating, probably because they did not dig far enough, that ME is the issue). Sure every processor has something similar to ME, and probably same as AMT too.
The thing is, You're more secure with your processor than this article would make you believe.
If someone can hack ME without AMT, most likely they have already infected your computer and stolen whatever they want to steal, in which case they don't really need to hack it.

You might need to wait a bit until it finishes scanning the blockchain.
If not, you can still import it in Electrum. Since it's a MultiBit seed, you'd need to check "bip39 seed" in the options, then use m/0' for the derivation path.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:52:25

That's 5%...
0.05%*1000 = 0.05*(1000/100) = 0.05*10 = 0.5
So the fee will be 7.5 (minimum fee)

Of course not.


Yes! It will also drop.
