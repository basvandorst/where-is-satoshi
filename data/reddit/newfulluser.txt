You better move everything into authy. Authy can be recovered into another phone if your actual phone dies, gets lost or stolen. 
Google authenticator cannot be recovered unless you kept the recovery codes, and I bet less than 10% of the users know about this and will get fucked when they lose their phone
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:56
Not trades inside an exchange (and 1% is several times more than what other exchanges charge) but moving bitcoins from coinbase to your ledger for example
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:22:01
I have kraken and local bitcoins on authy, best 2fa app ever because it can be recovered if phone dies. Google authenticator cannot..
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:53
When it starts correcting all this dumb money will go out fast, people are scared of the risk and will sell at a loss to "recover" some of their investment.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:43:06
The odds are way worse, crypto investing is just gamling with extra steps, I won't deny that

The double screen motorola at the top was my first phone, I could fit 12 songs and some java games in the massive 128mb sd card it came with!

You should listen to this:

Probably the cc comopany charges a percent without the fixed fee on transactions smaller than X
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:18:03
I replied down there about that. I know it's not free but if you pay cash you pay the same amount than with card. If there was a discount for people who pay cash then things would be different.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:48:50
This. Paying cash you will pay the same amount. The fee is just the cost of doing business, but it's you who pays it when you use bitcoin. Plus waiting for confirmation and no refund policy.
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:43:21
And the user doesn't pay the fee either, it's the store who pays it.
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:05:55
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:49:08
And transactions with a debit/credit card are also free, insured and instant. I had to wait 30 minutes to get the key for a game I bought with bitcoin. If the seller didn't deliver the key I would be out of my money. This is not the future.

I have a bitcoin adress there with some money, can I migrate the adress to another wallet? And which one is the safest and easiest to use?
Thanks in advance

Oops I thought Bitshares was renamed to EOS since they just copied it on github.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:31
I like that too
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:09:11
This, I tried to invest in stable 5% a year things but it's boring and super slow. I rather take the risk of losing it all for making what would take 20 years in a week.

Your coins are always on your wallet, withdraw at any time

@_date: 2016-11-13 20:37:26
Can anyone ELI5 why did this happen?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:25:39
I hate it but its pretty much noob proof. I tell people there are cheaper ways to buy but this is the easiest one.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:31:44
If they dont know about forks they probably keep all their bitcoin on an exchange..
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:59:26
That was the main reason it went up so fast

0.25 to be confirmed instantly, if you aren't in a hurry you can bring it down to 0.001$ and wait 5 minutes

Bring the gas price down and you can pay 0.001$ per transaction, takes between 5 - 10 minutes to confirm

This, and I'm sure a ton of new bitcoin mixers will appear.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:11:37
Not sure how its going to work but they cant know who owns which address. And you can easily mix bitcoin so it gets practically impossible to track
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:15:08
How do you move from bitcoin to fiat? Localbitcoins? 
Because the moment a bitcoin bought dollar touches your bank account the irs knows
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:45:41
So my wallet is fucked because I got 1$ transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:12:26
Yeah no thanks, bank withdrawal in a foreign country costs less than that
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:14:02
Back then? It was fast, just a couple minutes
Right now? Transaction will eventually be rejected and get back to your wallet after staying unconfirmed for several days
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:49:02
He would be extremely wealthy. I should have bought the coin instead of a mining rig, would have made 9k from a 1.7k investment in two months instead of just earning  back the 1.7k
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:00:21
You're a clown, thats why your post was downvoted, not because there is a conspiracy about how profitable mining is with solar, because it isn't.
Do the fucking math
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:42:22
If this is all based on bitcoin inflating, why not buy the coin?
You make more money reselling and thanks to the inflation than what you're saving in power costs.
The cost for one miner offgird is 6800$, this number is what you would consume in electricity with 6000w of miners connected 24h a day for a year at 0.12$ kw

Tried to buy something with bitcoin last weekend: Had to wait 30 minutes to confirm transaction, I was charged a commission and no buyer protection if the seller refused to send the purchase. I like bitcoin but next time I will use paypal.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:30:57
The pin is not in the card, and I have a virtual card for online purchases and a physical card for regular ones. The physical card cannot make online transactions so unless you know the pin you can't do shit.
