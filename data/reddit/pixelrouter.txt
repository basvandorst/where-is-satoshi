I've been thinking about how to make it a social game. There are inherently attackers and defenders at all times, in each order book. The market makers defend a price and the taker's attack it.

I posted a quick explanation video here : [**
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:47:28
I believe this does give a new level of awareness to short term traders. At least, it will when I am done. This is a very early prototype. The limit order book is an accurate representation of near-term market sentiment. Being able to see what is happening in the limit order book will give an advantage to traders. Traders already try and read this data all the time - it is presented in every crypto exchange interface. i.e. I'm not introducing novel data here, just showing it in a way which lets' the human eye get a good sense of the current market sentiment via perception of limit order imbalance and recent trade executions.
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:44:58
Is there a history here? I dont see the attack. I see a reasonable question.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:25:56
How about I just integrate it into a single view, like this?  
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:20:43


@_date: 2018-09-05 02:00:56
 
This is one that I believe does need a major overhaul, and here is why...
When I started trading, on NASDAQ, in '98, we had something called the "Level 2 Display".
See one here : [
Back then. the quotes were in fractions, and there were, therefore, a reasonable number of levels of information to read. Now, in crypto, their are sometimes eight decimal places, and they flicker so fast, it's impossible really to comprehend what is going on these order books.
This is a fundamentally superior way to present this data. This data is relevant to every active trader. Those who comprehend it, will have an edge.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:56:52
Sometimes I forget that not everyone has been looking at this data (or similar) for twenty years. 
This is the market data that **precedes** the record presented in a candle chart. This is the "limit order book" for Bitcoin on Binance. It is the real-time view of all the buy and sell orders and all the trade executions. This is called "market microstructure", and it is relevant for short-term trading.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:20:52
Yes for sure it needs a ton of "robustification". For example, right now it takes the top 50 levels on each side, no matter how far apart they are in actual price. Ideally it should group similar price and the size of the grouping can be dynamic and tied to current volatility. Thanks! I'll work on it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:08:04
Thank you! If you have any ideas about this and want to explore collaboration, message me!
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:10:39
Yep. The blue columns are orders to buy. The purple columns are orders to sell. Then the green and red boxes are the actual trades.

Cool. I think it is fun to watch, just as a cool display of human interaction, expressed as supply-demand and action.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:15:16
This is a great question.
I'm not proposing that this is the end-all all-in-one trading-interface-of-the-future. Notice I already have a primitive candle chart in there too. The idea is that this view is ideal for understanding market microstructure at the current moment. Also, this prototype slicing time three times a second, so the whole 3D view comprehends the last 20 seconds or so. Just as with a candle chart, however, it can be sliced at different rates, covering different time horizons. I think that a good candle chart, combined with a good, 3D view of the limit order book, over time, will be ideal.

Why? (If it's lovely.. ) (I made the music)
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:14:54
Yes, the 3rd dimension adds so much, especially since markets change over time. Time is a key factor in most analytics.
I'm working on various scaling strategies. This is linear, but I'm also experimenting with logarithmic and similar curves. 
Hmm..yes.. a good logline.. Will consider..
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:29:36
Exactly!

@_date: 2018-09-04 21:41:27
I totally see what you are seeing. I'll work on it. The reason it looks like that is because this is actually a fixed-dimension particle system, so i am just moving it back and forth to create the illusion of motion, but it's not yet perfect. It will be!
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:53:53
Thanks! I am coding all day, every day. It's so much fun to see this come to life. Thanks for the encouraging words.
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:02:55
This is true! Many times 2D is better. However, in this case I am convinced that 3D has the potential to be better because the data is, itself, three dimensional. 3D allows for a more natural mapping of the data to it's representation.
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:38:24
Yes I love that idea. I've been producing electronic music for many years and look forward to doing sound design for this. So many possibilities here.

@_date: 2018-09-05 05:09:38
Are you aware of how this very same information is presented currently?  Take a look at Binance:  
[  
The information which I am presenting geometrically, over time, is presented on Binance and every other exchange, as three different columns of numbers, with values flickering multiple times a second. Entries appear and disappear from the list, making it difficult to gain any insight from spatial relationships between the numbers.  
The 3D here, presents a majorly important piece of information, which is the change in the supply/demand balance over a short time-frame.  
There are other ways the third dimension might be used here, too. Wasn't it Tufte that said that the most interesting 3D visualizations are those wherein time is not mapped to the Z axis? Imagine here, presenting the order books of many markets at once, stacked where each market is on it's own row, creating a "liquidity surface" representing the current supply/demand curve across all the markets. That could be interesting.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:57:38

Thanks Giboon! On it. Motivated. Accelerating.
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:06:49
I don't agree that what we have now works perfectly well. There is valuable information presented in the limit order books of each exchange, but it is presented in a format which no human can claim fully to apprehend, in real time. I believe that presenting this data in a fundamentally more readable format, will allow astute traders to act on patterns they would otherwise miss. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:20:17
Do you commonly look at the limit order book (the ordered lists of bids and offers) and the trade execution record? This is the **same** data. It is not a novel concept that this data is relevant to trading. Is it relevant to **all** trading? Not necessarily. It is mostly relevant to short term momentum trading. 
This is an early internal alpha with zero context. The finished product will definitely come with some sort of quick primer as to how to read this. I think I can explain it in about five minutes to any bright 10 year old.
Regarding innovation making things easier, not harder. Consider that this information is currently displayed on every major exchange as columns of rapidly flickering numbers that no one can right say they comprehend. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:58:51
Hmm.. maybe you are detecting an influence on me, as a kid.
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:59:00
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:35:46
This is not meant to be a complete replacement for a normal exchange, at least not at this time. My goal here is to upgrade one aspect of the exchange -- the limit order book + trade execution display. Since this is purely browser based, the finished product can be embedded into an iFrame in a typical exchange, giving a new tool to the trader.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:13:34

Thanks. Yeah, it needs a lot more development for sure. This is about three weeks old right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:27:33
I've been experimenting with the cumulative view as well... where we end up with more of a trench like structure. I will probably make that a user-set option. That view is useful for certain things, like when trying to fill a single order at one go, but it occludes the activity of individual agents. 
I like the idea of representing dollar amounts where possible. Will consider. 
Thanks for your thoughtful comments.
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:56:41
I think the 3D approach is way simpler than the 2D - more primitive.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:53:48
I intend to make it "themed" so you can set your own color scheme.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:58:46
Yes, for sure. I'm not focusing on it for day one, but the framework I am using supports VR with very little additional work.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:05:54
Thank you for these great ideas and for letting me know you are actually looking at this. I'm already thinking along these lines. I just haven't gotten to implementing variations on these themes yet. The code is only three weeks old.
1. Granularity - There are a number of ways to approach this. How can we represent the difference between one big order and a ten small orders adding up to the same quantity. The ten small orders are may represent ten individual agents, and therefore may be less likely to disappear in an instant. We could "segement" the column, but I think that is not the best way here. Segmentation can be reserved for when we start aggregating multiple markets in one view. What if we use transparency? Maybe a single order creates a column that is only 50% alpha, and more orders make it look more "solid"?
2. Yes, I agree. Numerics representing total quantity at each price level and possible also dollar basis value,  are a good idea.  On that topic, it will probably be better to start conflating prices into groupings, like is already common on many exchange websites. (i.e. optionally to nearest penny, dime, dollar, etc..) 
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:15:12
Thing is, its the change in the bars over time that imparts good information! One thing I'm considering is that, when the bars don't change, I will just stretch them (like pulling taffy). That way there will not be so many bars.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:57:06
Simply stated and I agree. :-)
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:57:55
Yes, this is a great idea. I hear you. Will implement and report back here.

Why do you say this? I hope they all offer some flavor of this, as an option, useful for certain types of trading. Hey if you just want to buy some bitcoin and HODL, you don't need this.
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:52:58
It is the info in the depth chart plus trade executions *over time*. The "over time" is a big factor. The depth chart is a sort of cross section, and the way that is represents the order book is not ideal because it is "cumulative" away from mid.. That's why it always slopes up and away. This is showing the actual layout of the order book and is extruding it over time. By overlaying trades on this, it is possible to see cause-effect relationships between orders and trades, in a way not currently shown on current exchange interfaces.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:20:17
Yes, for sure! Would love help coding this. :-)
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:36:37
These are great ideas! I like the transparency overlay idea!
My goal is to present the market in a way which will appeal to millions of mobile gamers. I want to gamify short term trading. The current interfaces are so "technical" that most non-traders will never learn them. The current idea of showing the order book as a stack of flickery decimals is so outdated. 3D is much more natural for our brains.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:53:02
This is trading, and there is a certain amount of domain knowledge required, but I think this is pretty simple to understand for anyone familiar with a limit order book. Bid and Offers are the blue and purple bars. Horizontal position is price, height it quantity. Trade executions are the red and green shapes that come in. Consider that the standard way to view this information (i.e. on Binance) is as three columns of many-decimal numbers.
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:16:43
Yeah, I realized later that the music made it hard to understand what I am saying. I upped a new version with no music here :

That is a very nice thing they did on that Bitmex order book.
What if...
The frontmost row of columns is as I have it now... with real-time updates of the actual order book positions..
The rest of the rows, showing the history, show the cumulative view.. the "trench" - the extrusion of the cross-section in the bitmex style depth chart.
May have to try that... :-)

Always nice to hear that, as OP!
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:58:14
Yes, you've got it. I believe it does convey more information, more readily. At a moments glance you can see so much about the current market microstructure (the supply  and demand), and how it is developing over time. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:25:33
Yes! I hear that. The camera movement is "highly experimental". It is driven by the volume weighted average price of each trade. Big buys tilt it one way.. sells the other... It's a sort of momentum analytic. I think I will make it a lot less prominent and make it take longer to change...  
Yes, I agree re. price too.. Will do both of these things! Thanks.

It's pretty simple, once you know what each thing is. It's the same information as is presented in a typical exchange trading site. (i.e. Binance, etc)

Good eye. It's a bug I am working on fixing right now.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:38:28
This is, of course, a very proper question. Start by checking the reply I gave above to For our MVP product, which is the first module of Bionic Trader, called Depth Finder, our goal is to present the same information that you currently see, when trading on Binance, for example, but to do it in a much more friendly, fun, and easy to understand way. Here, maybe this will help illustrate.. The video I posted above just showed test pattern data running through Depth Finder. I just made a little video now, showing what it looks like with real, live market data.
 [   
Consider that what we are seeing here is a presentation of  the *same data*, that most would normally see presented like this on Binance :
[  
To be more accurate, the closest row to us, in the video, shows the same data as we see in the Binance image. Each row shows an historical snapshot of the data, so the full view is showing the data presented by 300 of these Binance screens, in a single view.  
This means we begin to get eyes on how the order book and trades interact, over time.   
Once we have this view as the basis, we can layer on all sorts of cool analytics and other features, which I believe will open up new capabilities, for "retail" traders, that are currently not available anywhere.   
We are going to be releasing these features as modules, kind of like a skill tree in a game like Borderlands... Here is there current set of upcoming capabilities. Maybe looking at the names will give some idea of the sorts of things we have planned.  
[  
Does this help? As me anything you like, if you want more details.

Thanks!   
 I am not designing primarily for VR, right now, because it's not wise, from a product standpoint, Before doing this, I spent a few years as an indie VR dev and got really into that. I taught a number of VR Game making courses in NYC a couple years back.   
However, when I am designing this 3D world, for the 2D screen, I am, even now, designing with VR in mind. For example, before VR, it didn't really matter where you placed your camera in the 3D scene. As long as it looked right, it was fine. But now, when you are in VR, you head controls the camera position, so your 3D world needs to appreciate that, and needs to be scaled and positioned properly. I'm designing our 3D scenes this way. The camera is at the center of the word. When we overlay 3D UI elements, they are aligned to the camera, with inertia. This way, when we want to bring this to VR, it will work, almost right away.
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:50:54
Thanks! You are totally on it, that a major aspect of this is play. It has to be. :-)
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:50:00
This is a great observation and a key aspect of the benefit.  
What we see here, represented by the columns, is an exchange order book, filled with bids and offers. It's the supply and demand. By plotting it over time, we see the shifts supply and demand over time, and we see the interaction of the trade executions (the red and green blocks), with the order book.. so we start to get a more visceral understanding of market microstructure.   
What I don't show here in this video, is that our users will be able to see their own trading activity, streaming through the 3D view, as it happens. You log in to Bionic Trader. Then you log in to Binance, for example, and trade as you normally do. If you are an algorithmic, automated, trader, it will work for you too. We "tune in"  to  the real-time feed of all your account activity. We have this new thing called a "trading rig", colocated with Binance in Tokyo, that interacts with Binance on your behalf. You trade, and as soon as you place an order, you will see it appear, as a special sort of block, streaming through the order book. We call this module "Depth Finder". It's very much like the maritime device, so named. It's like an undersea sonar, showing you the detail that was hidden. With this situational awareness, the primary thing that will happen immediately, we desire, is that the experience of executing trades on exchanges is transformed from one of some complexity and stress, to one that causes a mild, pleasurable dopamine hit, more like the feeling of tetris blocks falling into place.   
Beyond this, we have a number of modules planned, that will bring all aspects of trade execution, into this touch based, 3D, globally distributed, world.

Extremely neu! Just finished this up after another 16 hour coding session today. All came together!
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:11:16
Hopefully that will become apparent, in a few days, when I can show it in full operation, while executing real trades.
The primary problem that I'm looking to address, at first, is that currently, the experience of actually executing trades on crypto exchanges is stressful and complicated, largely due to the way that all the information is presented. My aim, with Bionic Trader, is to address that, by giving a major overhaul to the way market data and ones own trading activity is presented. By plotting it all, to scale, in a moving 3D scene, I believe it will begin to reveal things to traders, that are currently occluded by the poorly presented, numerical interfaces. Nobody can really make proper sense of the numeric order book depth tables anymore, with all these decimal places. Besides, those sort if interfaces will only ever appeal to a very small subset of humanity. My hope and plan, is that, by presenting it all in this new visual paradigm, market microstructure will become just as plain to read as a candlestick chart.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:04:45

"Using single-lensed microscopes of his own design, van Leeuwenhoek was the first to experiment with microbes, which he originally referred to as animalcules (from Latin animalculum = "tiny animal"). Through his experiments, he was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the "animalcules" are now referred to as unicellular organisms, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, crystals in gouty tophi, and blood flow in capillaries."  
Before Leeuwenhoek began actually seeing the rich, lively world of organisms we now know are always there in pond water, for example, people had no real idea what was going on at that micro level. For years,  members of the Royal Society would even make fun of his claims of observing what he termed, "wee beasties" swimming in the water.  
What we are building here with Depth Finder, is like a [scanning electron microscope]( for  [market microstructure]( It will give us eyes on the hitherto unseen world of the interactions among exchange order, exchange trades, and your own trade execution activity, at the "atomic" level.

Yes no problem. Fiat in all exchanges to fund this.
Fiat deposits  don't decrease in value when bitcoin goes down, either. Even when bitcoin is trending up, there are many opportunities to profit along the fractal coastline of intraday trading.
Does the ability to short on Bitfinex (and maybe other exchanges), change this analysis? see my response to @_date: 2017-09-11 00:59:01
From 
I see they allow shorting. Doesn't this change the situation and make is possible to perform an arb with no Fiat transfer?
i.e. say BTC/USD is $100 cheaper on GDAX.
Buy 1 BTC at 4300 on GDAX.
Short 1 BTC at 4400 on Bitfinex
-At this point we are "boxed" and market movement is negated.
Transfer 1 BTC from GDAX to Bitfinex to close the short position.
Make $100 in Bitfinex Account.
I realize I may be missing something _obvious_, but what is it?

Thanks! Check the video I just posted above if you want to hear about what we are showing here.

Excellent question! We haven't yet exposed the ability to adjust it via the UI, but yes, everything is configurable, much the way a candle chart can represent a wide array of timescales and price scales. Right now this is sampling every 500 milliseconds, because we know that Binance, which we are prototyping on, only updates their order book data once per second. By sampling twice a second, we capture all the changes. (See [Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]( Each row represents a snapshot of the order book, and the trade executions, associated with a single 500 millisecond slice of time. We can adjust the sampling rate to anything we like. Maybe it would be cool to see another depth finder set to sample every minute, so the whole structure covers the past hour. What might be the equivalent of a "moving average crossover" between these two views?   
Again, thank you for asking this, because it is this kind of feedback that gives me a sense of what other people want to see when they see this. +1 for Configurability for both time and price division (bucketing/conflation)

Oh wow, thanks! That's so cool. Author here.

Wow, thanks! I'm so happy you like it. We are hard at work, getting our MVP ready.. Soon, you will be able to put in your Binance API key, then trade normally using whatever means you already use. All of your trading activity will be overlayed on the 3D view (We call it 'depth finder') -- orders, cancellations, fills, etc, all shown in a fun, easy to read, animated 3D view.

I just made a quick video response for you. Way simpler to show it than just describe it.

Yes, of course I did. :-)

Awesome! Thank you. That is very encouraging to me.
