Maybe just realize that the term is being used by many people to mean different things, ref:  (i.e. "With the proof-of-stake mechanism, decisions about changes in the DApp are made based on the percent ownership that various stakeholders have over the application. For instance, the vote of a stakeholder who controls 10% of the tokens issued by a DApp, carries a 10% weight. The Master Protocol is based on the POS mechanism.") ~ So, its probably a good idea to clearly differentiate your idea by giving it a fairly unique name.

We recently convinced 2 international Bitcoin conferences to change their self descriptive tag-lines from 'virtual' to 'digital'... so I think its an easy point to prove.

You can see an interview we did with ZhangZhang just over a month ago, here:  (ZhangZhang is a Bittunes Artist)

Can we get a solid definition (consensus) of what 'Proof of Stake' actually means? Because it is being used by many people in this space, in quite different ways.

We think its a good set of ideas worth pursuing.. Thankfully some people are seriously trying to improve the future.

As for these issues that you have raised.. What I can say is that we have deep domain knowledge within our team of both the diamond industry and the insurance industry, and this project would never have got passed 1st base, nor into Techstars if we and they were not adequately convinced that we would achieve both an emphatically reliable result, and also receptive industry traction.
As for Bittunes.. that project is still in beta, (but open beta) so you must join the Google+ beta testing community to be able to download the Android app. Please feel free to follow the link from the Bittunes website  and let us know if you have any issues downloading the app. (Bittunes is a Bitcoin pure-play)

Hi guys.. only just came across this page in the last hour. OK, some answers: No, Edgelogic is not "afraid of Bitcoin's bad image". We still think that Bitcoin is all kinds of awesome.. Sure it has various issues that need improving, but we are pretty sure that both the technical challenges and its public image problems will resolve over time.
As to whether we will use the Bitcoin Blockchain.. we certainly can, (and currently are using testnet during development) but its probably best to describe us as Blockchain agnostic. But, will we develop independent Blockchain/s? Yes.. that is a certainty.

Some things you can just feel on an intuitive level.. and those perceptions often turn out to be true. Mike Hearn was never involved in Bitcoin for the 'greater good'.. Mike Hearn is interested in Mike Hearn.. period.
