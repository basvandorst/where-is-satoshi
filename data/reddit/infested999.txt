[Imagination bubble] Wireless 4G LTE network that is compleatly anonymous with no need to register for an account, just send a certain amount of bitcoins to your SIM card and it will be used up depending on your data usage. It has to be a very reasonable rate (1Euro/GB). 
This also has to happen in Europe, so that I can prove that Europe wireless providers are better than US. (Right now Europe is winning in 100mbit fibre internet to every household, it's available everywhere in Europe. Sadly, right now the US has unlimited calls/sms/data for $60/month, while in EU your going to pay 120E/month if you use your phone allot, and 5GB/month is the most I have seen :'(
Also you are selling a $99 tracfone card for $95, I think you made a mistake listing that item.

I wonder if GitHub has a "Panic Button" where if there is a serious vulnerability to their site, they can just take the site down completely with just message saying they are being attacked and will bring the site back online when the bug is fixed. That way the attacker cannot do any serious damage.

It's illegal for a store to give you incentive to pay with cash because it would mean the credit card company gets less of a cut if more people use cash.

The official client does download it just like torrents download. The reason it was so slow was because it's not really optimized for thousands of small files, but you can still download it in 10 minutes.

This isn't a private tracker at all, it is just a service like burnbit.com
A real private tracker you could seed other people's torrents and get paid in BTC.
EDIT: Nevermind it's not like burnbit, it's more like a seedbox just you don't get to let the torrent seed.
EDIT2: This service is actually really useful if you can to download a file that is only available in TPB and you don't want your IP to show up in the swarm of peers.

The only reason people use Dwolla is for MtGox, I don't think there is ay other large online service that uses Dwolla. I don't understand why mtgox and Dwolla work together to make the best possible API for both of them.

If a solar flare is powerful enough to wipe a hard drive, it will wipe all hard drives, that includes flash drives, SSDs, and all online storage solutions. I think that is what OP meant.

This is off-topic, but HTML has the ability to generate QR codes inside the browser? While not having to deal with jpg images and rendering on a separate server? That really cool!
But why is it that when I view the HTML code you put on pastebin in Firefox the big QR code is really blurry?
EDIT: It's blurry because the QR code is rendered as a 33x33 image, and then resized to 400x400 so it looks ugly.

Or they are just using the feeling of selectivity when you find an invite code as a form of free advertising.

Well with bitcoins you do also kind of have the PayPal type of fee, because a bank wire to MtGox costs $25.
@_date: 2011-08-03 16:48:33
No, there is no proof.

I asked someome to make this, nobody does it. Then after I make one 5 people copy it.
@_date: 2011-08-03 12:53:57
Yea the owner apparently sold thousands of BTC and that brought the price down to $12 yesterday.
@_date: 2011-09-06 05:06:37
But each vender uses a different POS system and each user uses a different app, you need to spend a good 10 seconds observing how this one system works before you can send a payment.

So if I wanted to cash out 100 of these I would spend hours typing.

BitCoin has representatives? Who pays them?


@_date: 2011-09-07 16:06:00
When it's less than 10, buy. More than 10, sell.
@_date: 2011-10-09 20:51:57
Ohh so when you do merged mining, you still have to do the same amount of work for one block. i though this was some breakthrough technology where it tests one hash against the BitCoin and the NameCoin chain at the same time. Nevermind me.

"There are many different ways we can generate interest for our account holders.  Think outside the box."
notice how they make two spaces after a period? That means that person learned typing on a typewriter or back in the days of fixed-width fonts, because after around the 2000s people learned to do one space after the period.
Nope, that's all I got out of that website.
@_date: 2011-09-12 11:46:12
They are probably going to do that in China.
@_date: 2011-08-03 17:53:29
$8.80 WTF?
@_date: 2011-06-29 11:57:22
You should pay your federal taxes on your paycheck in BitCoins.
@_date: 2011-08-18 21:51:31
So the only way to get one is to send your private key to the guy who makes them? That can be dangerous :s
@_date: 2011-06-26 19:41:55
What I don't understand though, is where are you mining the bitCoins from? Who actually NEEDS all of that computing power? What are all those GPU trying to figure out?
@_date: 2011-06-29 18:00:08
I'd imaging it wouldn't be to hard to convince Gabe to accept BitCoins on all Steam purchases, I mean it can't hurt! If anyone want's to make a Savage 2 server browsing program that allows donations, I can organize this, just get on  at irc.freenode.net

Under "Most Stable Nodes" there is a huge node somewhere in the Russia/Slovenian border.
@_date: 2011-06-29 11:36:57
Yea that's really good compared to other investments.
@_date: 2011-07-14 20:56:50
Are bots really this simple? I always thought that these bots have some very advanced formula where they get data dating back years and use every transaction ever made to figure out if the price will go up or down, and then they will do a transaction.
@_date: 2011-07-16 19:16:00
You put them in an envelope right? No way that sending off a letter costs $7!
@_date: 2011-09-10 02:01:49
But what if i know for a fact that they will go down to $0.01 and never go up again, like when you have stock and you know the company will go bankrupt.
@_date: 2011-07-31 21:09:23
$200,000 sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2011-09-10 22:48:02
Nobody has ever heard of them.
@_date: 2011-09-10 15:32:15
Right now Silk Road is the only place you can spend bitcoins at. Sure you can buy some coffee or silver with BTC, but I could get those cheaper with PayPal at Amazon.
@_date: 2011-09-06 20:09:31
look at mtgoxlive, the price isn't going to go much higher than $7.25 in a while.
@_date: 2011-07-31 21:12:24
That must have really messed up some trading bots.

The only real company on the glbse is the IBB, but their business model is flawed and I knew from day one they will be bankrupt!
@_date: 2011-09-06 03:29:45
There needs to be companies that sell BitCoin-in-a-box machines that the businesses can set-up without any technical knowledge. Like a n universal Point of Sale device that everybody uses.
@_date: 2011-07-27 19:50:26
You should index yourself in [The BitCoin Map](
@_date: 2011-06-27 11:04:15
So let's say some new country uses BitCoins as their official currency. They would print some kind of paper currency and then exchange that paper currency to other peoples BitCoins?
@_date: 2011-07-01 11:37:05
Do you think this whole thing will even out at the point where you break-even with electric costs at 10cents/kWh?
@_date: 2011-07-07 18:16:35
The real DDoS would be to have hundreds of servers constantly sending BitCoins to each other at 100 transactions per second. Each one of those would have to be :confirmed" by each node. That would really put some strain on the network!
@_date: 2011-10-08 23:36:00
That's under the category of an escrow service, but I see how it can be bounty specific.

As I see it, you can choose what you want the transaction fee to be...

It's safe, many Redditors have betted with this site before, and with a lot of money was involved!
@_date: 2011-09-09 16:06:06
Do people really pay much more than the market price for coins when trading p2p? I guess the only advantage would be for the 14 year olds who arent old enough to deposit real money in to a bank account.

Put them both in Photoshop at 50% opacity each, and align Sept. and Sept. together. I'm surprised it takes so long to do this and nobody automated a chart the combines the two datas, maybe that's why we can't get any real solution.

The office for a large luxury watch company is two blocks away from where I live in a rural city. It absolutely blew my mind because there is nothing special about this small city and their office is right here.
What do you think if I go there and ask for a part time job, since I'm a student.
