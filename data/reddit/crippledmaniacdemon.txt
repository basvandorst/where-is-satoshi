Still confused.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:09:12
Lower again! Yay!
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:54:10
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:13:15
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:39:56
Thanks! You too.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:20:37
Also false. I've made some comments the last few days as it has risen.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:07:51
And straight down...
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:00:39
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:56:15
Just more proof it can't sustain itself.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:17:25
The decline from 9.7k to 8.2k...
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:52:01
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:10:34
So where's your 10k? Hm?
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:19:01
There we go.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:09:15
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:53:33
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:58:14
Sup guys.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:12:56
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:36:29
Because it isn't growing and it's too easily manipulated...
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:47:22
There are plenty of other words in my vernacular.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:13:14

@_date: 2018-05-03 19:53:54
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:19:54
Find where I said it, bro. I'll wait.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:20:13
False lol. I'm not a no-coiner and I've proven that already.
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:46:11
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:02:56
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:12:42
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:23:14
Because it has been doing this for a while. Staying between 6k and 11.5k. Just oscillating without anything significant happening.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:33:48
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:38:35
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:20:43
I actually sold all my bitcoin this time.
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:34:23
I hope you all realize that McAfee's $1,000,000 prediction is backed up by nothing. It's simply an exponential function applied to the price of bitcoin. An exponential function can be applied to anything. Will it follow it? Possibly. Is it a guarantee? Absolutely not.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:46:40
I got out. :D
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:30:52
Ya'll hate me when I talk shit, but it keeps going lower lol.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:19:19
Lower. Told you. :)
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:37:13
What's funny is that everything after 4/20 has been sideways price action lol.
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:44:30
Long lower shadow on previous day candlestick is a bullish sign. :)
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:03:39
Love these massive red dildos.
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:30:54
Where's your God now?
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:47:00
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:02:25
This is the fourth time lol.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:11:46
Bitcoin won't go above the 200 DMA until the death cross is reversed. Bet.
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:12:39
Very happy to see it lose all its progress.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:10:28
I've kept quiet for nearly a month to give you all a break from my shit talking and to give bitcoin a chance. I think it's time for me to come back. What happened to your precious bitcoin and going to the moon?
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:19:04
I'll be here all month.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:39:45
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:54:59
Soooooo bitcoin keeps going lower... :D
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:29:43
Remind me how well bitcoin is doing? Oh wait. It's not.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:18:41
I left for three and a half weeks and haven't posted in that time. I know what I do. Why ask a question you don't want answered? Seems useless. I don't wish poor outcomes on others. I'm just not naive.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:40:12
Yeah dude. My crippled chair has nothing to do with it. Just crippled me.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:53:14
LOL. Same shit all over again.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:02:22
FUCK. True. 6k dip. Sorry guys. Straight down to a negative moon. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:45:54
Lmfao. You wish. ��
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:07:42
I hate green dildos.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:35:31
Congratulations. All the optimism you had two or three hours ago is easily down the drain again. :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:40:39
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:21:43
Take a fucking joke you troglodite. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:37:44
Eat shit.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:36:31
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:45:04
So in all seriousness, there is no price where BTC has "support." That doesn't exist and you need to understand that.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:07:43
You all thought it was a small one-time dump. Adorable. ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:51:07
Didn't break it on GDAX. :)
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:26:29
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:39:47
False. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:40:23
So Coinbase is fucking itself lol.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:23:17
It's not going to recover.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:12:55
The little bitcorn that couldn't. Next time it breaks 11k I'm pulling out completely.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:04:20
One more day till the death cross happens! I'm so excited. :)
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:56:09
Something like 5k BTC have been sold.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:00:36
All of that is false, but what do I know? I'm just a moron.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:23
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:02:38
Nah. I'll stick around. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:20:19
What is Mt. Gox and can we kill it?
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:55:11
FUCKING HELL. IT BROKE 11K ON GDAX. Welp. Goodbye to my cock.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:21:48
No moon.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:56:46
Here I am. NateTGreat20 is probably sleeping or some shit. I'm covering for him.

STRAIGHT FUCKIN' DOWN BOYS.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:00:44
can anyone give me a bitcorn for like treefitty
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:21:36
Yes. NOW it's over 21 trillion. I think it was under 20 by the time the Obama era ended.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:18:16
He never intended on draining the swamp. He has hired more lobbyists than when he first entered office. People have scaled the wall. Please take a seat.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:54:43
Because America is stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:52:29
Incorrect. My portfolio is something like 2k, I think.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:39:08
Military doesn't need more spending. There are videos of people climbing over the wall already. It's literally a waste of money.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:00:02
Holy fuck. Someone give this man a Nobel Prize. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:25:30
I'll given you the best head you've ever received if this happens.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:12:26
I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready for another six weeks of red dildos.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:20:01
This is a fucking joke lol.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:37:18
I mean, I guess.

@_date: 2018-03-10 22:50:01
I'm fourteen. I fucked your mom. My dad works for the FBI and knows where you live. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:38:07
Go buy it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:43:51
It just fell off the face of the earth.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:18:37
I mean, true.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:29:30

It's over when we've seen an overall positive trend for some weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:15:38
lololol told you
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:59:41
True story.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:20:15
This is great!
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:30:39
No spike two hours later.
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:58:54
Oh go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:20:55
Everyone restock on 9k memes. We'll probably need them again at some point.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:16:25
That is incorrect. It was roughly $17,000,000,000,000 (17 trillion) by the time the Obama era ended. Has Trump added $1,000,000,000,000 to it? Not immediately, but yes. Over a certain amount of time that amount will be added to the deficit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:56:50
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:25:53
Holy fucking shit is he salty. Not our fault he's a fucking moron.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:35:10
So would you say it's a safer bet to purchase a certain amount of bitcoin every so often and just hold onto it?
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:52:40
I will cleanse this thread of all the shitty people.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:37:07
Nah. Not talking about myself lol.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:13:49
Super glad I pulled out of this shitty market.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:22:17
Meh. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:58:49
Oh go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:22:13
It's not like there's enough "strong" hands in this game anyway. ��
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:37:38
Okay. Yes. My point is that it wasn't 500 billion lol.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:27:03
Yeah. I'm thinking how useful day trading is if I only have .104 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:39:51
Nah. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:20:43
1. No I'm not lol. It's SUBSTANTIALLY EASIER to make something when something is given to you. Making something from nothing is difficult.
2. No. You're 100% wrong. It's not the "whole idea with Bitcoin" and if you wholeheartedly think that then you really don't understand what this is all about.
3. He has a shit ton of money to throw away. He has no excuse to file for bankruptcy. Financial irresponsibility lol.
Being BORN into money plays a huge factor into his success. He didn't make his "empire" out of nothing. And as for being President, I blame the people that fell for him and voted for him. I don't think it's luck. He was given a lot of help and became untouchable because of money, which is true till today.
4. He has changed nothing for a greater good so your point is invalid lol.
You picked out one source that MIGHT have paid people in it. YOU don't know that either. Cumulatively with the sources I provided, there's likely a great amount of truth in saying thousands of people regretted their vote for Trump. Next time don't cherry pick information to support your argument. I don't need to look it up on Wikipedia. I know the population is roughly 325 million people. Google how many people ACTUALLY VOTED. ~129 million. That's about 39% of the population. So can a FEW THOUSAND votes make a difference? Yeah. It's possible.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:39:52
Golden advice.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:41:26
Holy shit volume is low.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:13:53
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:52:09
Are we still going to the moon?
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:58:14
Then don't tell me to not ask stupid shit when it's obviously a joke. :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:52:15
We need 10,000% in any of the six directions.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:14:10
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:21:26
GOT EM'. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:12:00
I hope you re-financed your home and sold your car to buy in!
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:51:53
Thrice the wow
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:13:47
Lower. :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:39:14
Fuck. You beat me to it...
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:26:23
I have no idea. Maybe another week or two. Bitcoin went sideways the last time those two crossed and then uncrossed.
It could also take a month to uncross. It took twenty-two days to get to where it is now and both seem to be starting to plateau to head in the other direction. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:16:06
That's true. I'm debating on whether or not to buy another $200 of bitcoin at this current discount. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:59:16
Here you go.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:11:40
I made a new bet for today.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:00:28
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:38:17
Yeah. I love how everyone, including John McAfee, is saying the crash is over and it's really just a bulltrap.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:42:45
No. Read. My argument was not *literally* "that old guy doesn't understand the new paradigm." I ESPECIALLY didn't use the word "paradigm" because I don't think it IS one. What I DID say is Warren Buffet AT LEAST, I did not mention Munger in this point, admitted he doesn't understand bitcoin. How can someone who DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING call something correctly? That's absurd. That's like me calling how foreign affairs between two countries will go down despite having an advanced knowledge of those countries. Does it make sense to call something you don't have knowledge on? No. The housing market and the inception of the internet are not entirely similar to this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:48:48
Not on GDAX. :)
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:54:02
But he doesn't understand bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:38:57
You bet!
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:51:53
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:25:33
What if the Winter Olympics caused bitcorn to go down because everyone was sliding/skiing/sleding/some shit DOWN snow?
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:44:33
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:42:48
Not loss of interest. Otherwise volume would continuously go down.
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:26:51
Hoe about fifteen more red ones?
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:51:44
Where you all at now? LOWERRRRRRRRRRRR. BITCORN IS DEEEEEEAAAAAAAAD.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:27:54
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:02:39
On the 4hr, 50 DMA finally went above the 200 DMA after having crossed on December 29th. On the 1hr they both look like they're going to curve towards each other again very soon. The 1 day shows no death cross happening and not strong signs of it happening. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:59:36
LOL. You guys thought...
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:01:10
You guys get mad when I say it can't sustain itself, but am I even wrong? ��
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:17:37
Oh hell yeah. We're going back down.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:09:28
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:58:52
Cheer up. I'm okay.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:33:38
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:58:06
Oh shit. True.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:38:02
I'm orange like Trump. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:37:16
I mean, you haven't detailed anything either...
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:39:32
I'd rather get run over by a fucking tricycle.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:32:02
This is very sound advice lol. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:44:34
LOLOL. A LOOOOT of you panic so incredibly easily. Sideways price action for a few more days and then we'll go up.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:46:35
So again, leave. Renounce your citizenship. Give up the USD. Go elsewhere. You have options.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:26:20
Let's go boy. All the way down.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:30:04
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:50:37
I'm sorry for your loss then lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:09:18
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:26:57
Everyone sell it all. It's crashing. Panic sell. Flip cars. Set shit on fire. Do dumb shit.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:53:48
YAY. RED DILDOS.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:42:21
Needing millions of dollars to make money off this method or you're saying YOU'VE made millions?
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:18:42
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:36:22
All right compadres, what say you on bitcorn's next move in price?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:10:08
Can I send you my nudes?
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:59:49
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:04:12
DUMP DUMP DUMP. :D
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:41:37
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:40:28
What's a floor?
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:36:36
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:02:58
Is B.C Before Cryptos? We're already in A.D. After Decentralization.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:06:04
THANK YOU! Russia has nothing to do with it. They're great! Possibly the best!
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:56:03
Never. Same shit as BitConnect except Bcash isn't a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:11:59
I will. Gonna live stream it on twitch.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:15:44
So your argument is invalid and you're full of shit lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:43:34
On TradingView you can put whatever fucking days you want so excuse me...
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:09:55
You base this advice on no argument lol. It's just a statement.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:41:33
Well, he has over a year and a half lol.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:24:40
I mean, I have way more than $200 worth of BTC lol, but okay. Sorry you can't discern pessimism from realism. :P
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:50:45
I lost the bet, but it can't sustain itself above 11k. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:29:59
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:29:16
So Goldman Sachs now owns Poloniex.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:55:22
No. Left.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:24:02
I've noticed a lot of "deleted" comments on the thread. Not sure what that's about other than users deleting their own shit for some reason or other.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:28:07
What we're seeing is sideways price action for a bit because of the 50 DMA crossing below the 100 DMA. No worries.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:38:56
I meeeaaaan, no. You're objectively wrong, but that's cool. I have nothing to prove to you anyway. xD
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:15:03
And what makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:54:50
Kinda tired of just throwing money into bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:10:21
Or...you give ME .1 bitcoin so I can tell you what to do and when to do it.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:04:02
You think that's true?

Good job, bitcoin. A disappointment once again.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:23:35
We've informed Lamborghini to not give you one.
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:16:54
Sideways price action started when 50 DMA went below the 100 DMA. It'll stop once they re-cross.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:08:46
Good tip. I appreciate the help!
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:48:52
Stop selling your BTC!!!
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:06:22
'CAUSE WHY NOT. GETTING PUMPED UP IS GOOD.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:33:37
Bitcoin can't sustain itself. This is a joke. ��
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:17:52
If bitcoin breaks 12k in the next twenty-four hours, I'll get gender reassignment surgery.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:47:23
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:36:04
Thank you for your input!
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:43:25
Is there a particular bot you can recommend?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:09:22
It'll fuck up bitcorn pretty bad.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:03:04
Jaxx isn't too recommended, honestly. Slow transactions and sometimes they're "lost." Don't use it for the long term.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:38:30
All of them. 90% discount.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:18:53
90% correction.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:20:39
And here goes the dump.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:14:20
I sometimes post neutral or happy stuff. Otherwise I troll a small amount.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:45:24
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:05:45
Not in the slightest.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:15:22
Fuck. Okay. :(
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:42:10
This is just sideways price action, like I said, because of the 50 DMA going below the 100 DMA.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:20:18
Old news.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:16:10
I hate you. I read this and it dropped $80.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:12:46
New low for the day! Yay!
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:37:34
Right? :P
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:36:51
Fucking do it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:14
Death cross.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:10:28
Proof? Lmao.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:31:16
IMO, bitcorn will go to -$800.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:51:37
I see.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:25:38
Make me.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:50:06
I'll remember how wrong you are.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:12:41
LOWERRRRRERREEERRR. IT'S OVERRRRRRRRRR.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:22:44
Mainstream currency talks lol. People want to get rich and get out because of how simple it seems. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:52:15
My computer refuses to open up that link. Why is that?
Edit: Never mind. Works on Microsoft Edge. The math is crazy lol.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:07:52
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:48:32
I overlooked it you fat fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:27:59
Yup! Currently jacking it in celebration.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:13:30
Still didn't elaborate on your comment that means nothing...
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:08:45
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:24:48
Not trying to scare anyone lol.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:12:40
Hell yeah!
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:33:23
We should all join forces and become a whale.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:30:34
It can appreciate or depreciate in value. It makes someone money if sold back.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:19:49
GDAX doesn't have high fees...
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:58:27
I completely doubt this will go back up to 11k today and think it will just continue to go lower.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:45:18

@_date: 2018-02-27 15:04:16
Move the period that's in the wrong spot over one place to the right. Grammatically it makes no sense to make a statement that simply says "5%." Jfc.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:42:45
Yes. 50 is below 100 right now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:24:50
Man, you really don't know how to read and conceptualize things. All you do is cherry pick and twist it to support your argument. Nonetheless, this was very entertaining so thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:26:13
No. Never.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:24:51
When bitcorn doesn't know what to do so it just goes down.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:35:38
1. Small loan of a million dollars.
2. Won't show his tax returns.
3. Has filed for bankruptcy several times.
4. He became President through lying and systematic racism
5. People who once supported Trump are actually no longer supporting him
6. Take a seat
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:08:36
Why wouldn't I be here? I haven't been proved wrong...?
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:24:44
That's a really confusing chart lol.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:50:41
I'm in a wheelchair. That's a hate crime.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:05:21
u da bess
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:01:50
I just sold my wheelchair to buy in now! 100% proof? What idiot is gonna argue against that? I can't move anymore, but at least I'll be fucking rich! I'll be able to buy 100 wheelchairs!
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:52:11
Do it. You won't.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:36:22
Sub 9.4k! :D
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:59:02
Actually, my mom kicked me out on February 16th, 2016.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:25:15
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:17:35
It will because John McAfee said so.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:37:56
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:37:25
No. Just a pressure sore. :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:01:13
holy fucking shit
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:57:18
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:40:57
LOLOL. It's doing so bad. This is a bear market now.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:43:22
NateTGreat20 is right. I think 6-7k will be our new best friend.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:52:09
And he won't lol. It won't break 11k for another day or two anyway. It'll keep going down.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:27:35
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:27:45
Easily under 10k. ��
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:21:31
Yeah. I fooled it a few times.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:54:58
Good. Please do so.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:56:08
I love how the BTC dominance percentage continues to increase. Trust the process.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:10:05
Slave to a passport? The fuck does that even mean? It's your ticket to being in "freedom." Use it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:54:06
LET'S GO. 5K HERE WE COME.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:29:15
Most of you aren't very emotionally resilient when looking at price action. Personally, I'd only ever actually feel something if it went sub 4k.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:15:20
That's 99% of people, yes.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:54:52
DEEZ NUTS
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:02:01
LOL. Back in the same spot. It won't have organic growth.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:24:38
10.9 is resistance. 11k will not be breached today.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:01:42
A lot of things are compared to bitcoin. None of them actually have any significant meaning. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:05:12
My crystal ball.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:40:05
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:36:51
100% wrong and I'll be calling you out in two and a half hours.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:09:18
Would be really nice to see Bitcoin never go below $20k ever again.....
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:34:51
LOL. That's cute. Reported for reporting.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:50:01
6k crash coming tonight.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:24:29
No. No I wasn't lol. I think I said it once to troll people. However, I DID say we would go sub 6k and we did that very briefly.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:16:56
No. Earnings are just in a wallet. I'm going to get a Ledger Nano S to store it. I invest my other money into crypto. Not sure if I'll expand mining.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:50:46
Best investment. YUUUUUUGE investment. Let me tell you something, people that don't invest in Bitcoin? SAD! Not wanting to go to the moon? SAD! I invested in Bitcoin. I was the FIRST person to invest in Bitcoin. I invented Bitcoin. Don't believe these Fake News articles about Satoshi Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:15:09
This is 100% false.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:16:54
Wishful because you want it to dip massively so you can buy a ton?
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:21:43
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:45:32
The fact it broke 11k and couldn't even stay near it isn't good.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:35:55
Yeah. You won't have a substantial profit unless you're messing with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:17:30
Interesting. Do you know of any reliable signals?
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:10:22
No longer 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:47:06
The train going straight down.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:47:17
So by that image, the line will never be crossed and we'll continuously have lower highs until bitcoin is worthless.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:32:11
Yeah. You fuckers got me banned.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:47:18
If bitcoin breaks 11k again today, I'll eat my own dick. That's how confident I am that it won't.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:10
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:19:18
But like, I don't own alts...
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:48:42
Of what region?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:31:22
Why the fuck isn't it 1mil like John McAfee said?
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:36:42
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:14:03
Can I get a look inside?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:14:58
Guys! Don't worry. I, Donald J. Trump, am the whale. The best whale. A YUGE whale. Don't get SAD over the drop. We'll have the best recovery now! It'll be great!
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:45:16
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:33:45
I already did...
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:05:48
Nice increase in volume.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:53:40
He IS Satoshi! I fucking knew it!
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:48:52
STOP GOING DOWN.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:42:40
It has passed it several times today.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:37:56
Seven. They're Asians and overachievers by force.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:28:43
It could in fact never recover, yes. Is that likely? No.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:30:35
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:38:22
He didn't more than double the deficit. He did exacerbate it though.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:58:52
ladder* so he can lift it up to heaven
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:51:00
"it's gonna break through 11.7k!" lololol
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:34:32
Super old news...
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:25:24
Because you can make transactions instantly. Selling bitcoin is instant and buying it is instant if you have money in your GDAX account.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:44:13
Because you're the one that wants to change because of a "broken" system as is obvious from EVERYTHING you've said...
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:44:07
Sideways over a few days. Didn't think I'd have to specify it wasn't in the span of an hour...
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:20:50
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:39:16
Do it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:30:24
Lmao 9.3k.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:08:32
I like you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:10:59
It'll move in six directions at once.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:57:28
I'm very bullish on bitcoin in the long term, but a lot of what he says I agree with and makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:57:02
Thanks for your opinion! Much appreciated. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:50:58
What...? Tons of shit that involves fiat has fees. Fees aren't why bitcoin won't replace fiat globally.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:43:48
Is your source a crystal ball?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:29:28
Something like a 58% correction as compared to a 54% correction back in late 2013 to mid 2014. Unless you look at the end of 2013 till 2015 and then it's an 80% correction.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:00:31
I'd rather you actually advocate and take more serious measures as opposed to simply not doing one thing. Y'know, put in effort.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:09:43
Cool. Just checking.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:38:42
WRONG! This is SAD!
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:30:14
Not gonna lie, that first sentence made me chuckle lol.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:52:05
I've never actually sold what I have so this is inaccurate.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:32:29
Pretty much.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:40:05
OH. Okay. Cool.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:42:34
LOL. The "perfect" time was at 6k, truly.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:01:58
"You people" lol. As if you're so much better than us. xD
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:57:53
This statement is actually true.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:50:01
He said by 2020...
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:19:52
The same thing that happened in 2013 is happening now and no one is mentioning the trend that has already happened. There's either a miracle and it increases again rapidly back to normal or it's going to take three years to recover to 19k and then have a huge run up to about 50k.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:50:02
Fuck yeah. Is medium rare okay?
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:29:53
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:35:05
I mean, I already did lol. So I'm fine.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:20:14
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:12:40
LAMBO MOON BUBBLE. Is that better?
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:19:47
I like you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:05:18
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:54:11
I'm leaning towards that one because of design mostly. Functionality between the two seems to be almost the same. Price is pretty much the same too.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:22:46
This is the most effective game.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:27:10
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:03:11
No, but you obviously are haha.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:31:58
His reason for this prediction is so incredibly stupid. "just look at the 200 DMA."
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:01:56
You get a cookie.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:06:28
Ooooo. $200 increase. How meaningful...
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:47:53
Be stronk. Beleaf in yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:16:44
You should get a job....................
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:55:35
Line of best fit and the path along the lines are the scatter plot points?
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:00:21
Oh. I don't think it will go down to 4-5k. I just don't think we'll see an overall upwards trend at this point in time. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:36:16
RAGERT IT.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:37:51
There's a lot of resistance at every number.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:48:55
Daily moving average. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:06:04
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:33:51
Even with the minimal amount of bitcoin any ONE person can have, there is still a finite number of bitcoin that will ever exist even if millions of people own multiple portions of the minimal amount (since there aren't 2.10000000E+15 people on the planet). Is it scarce? Yes. Enough for anyone to care at this point in time? No. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:34:24
So just don't sell. That's your fault lol.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:02:53
Nope. Get a passport. Go to Canada. Renounce your citizenship. Then you're free from the U.S.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:28:14
Nope. Sub 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:16:53
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:32:04
I mean, yeah. I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:28:54
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:06:39
Under sub 10k again! Yay!
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:29:55
Also true.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:10:34
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:42:04
No. Bitcoin will be 1mil. It's on the internets. It has to be true.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:58:25
No thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:08:30
Be nice now lol.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:52:40
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:14:58
I'll give you .15 BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:14:15
Long red candlesticks going upwards are never a good sign.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:38:37
Another big red dildo! Yay!
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:37:03
Okay. I'm back.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:30:18
Good resource!
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:34:40
So I took a screenshot of a chart. I think if the green line crosses the red line then we're fucked until it re-crosses. Until the green goes above the yellow, I think things will be a little weird. Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:58:30
I genuinely hope you're joking. You should have a job anyway...
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:07:53
Even lower!
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:23:22
A lot of that person's predictions are wrong lol.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:20:51
So it's going down again...
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:53:10
Nope. Left.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:23:14
Anyone excited for those dank all time lows?
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:39:36
Yeah, but bitcoin doesn't seem to be having it in any way, shape or form. It really doesn't have price support. It drops too much way too easily. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:51:19
Do it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:31:31
I do not think such a severe correction will happen as cryptocurrencies as a whole are a lot more mainstream and despite certain regulation among several countries others are adopting it rather quickly.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:38:44
It's really funny to see how bitcoin doesn't really have any price support, but every $100 is resistance.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:34:40
Lmao. Say it'll go lower and it might do the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:09:30
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:43:29
I'll eat my own dick if you're right. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:07:49
Oh boy. Look at that bitcorn.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:15:10
I'm going to assume way too many people are making panic transactions and Coinbase will be fucked for a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:18:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:26:42
Trends are trends is all I'm saying. Could it be an indicator? Yes. Could it be completely wrong? Yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:59:09
No. I have more.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:34:10
This is fucking hilarious. Bitcoin unable to find support at any level is a fucking joke.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:37:24
Oh. I see. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:04:50
1. Me specifically? Sure. In due time.
2. Supporting Bitcoin doesn't mean I support tax evasion AT ALL.
3. There's a difference between failure and being irresponsible. Bankruptcy is due to financial irresponsibility. 
4. Because it's fucking wrong. That's why. I do agree the people are the problem.
5. 
 (only one figure in this article)
 (again I think only one person)
 (nearly 3k people who regret it)
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:01:23
Why 12 and 26? Why not 50 and 100? Or 6 and 38?
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:12:22
Ahhh. Gotcha. Thank you for clarifying. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:17:31
It's just going to keep going down lol.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:59:11
Sooooooo kidnap and force thousands of people. I'm in.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:42:38
Poon time.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:10:54
Profit. It's that simple.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:35:09
Most people don't really care about it. They want to get rich quick and avoid taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:18:47
No. No one has to try and do that lol. You're on fucking reddit coming into a bitcoin subreddit wanting to be a white knight and point out everyone who is wrong whilst insulting them. Like anyone gives a fuck lol.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:55:50
Don't you shit talk everyone here?
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:09:22
It's going down just because you said it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:47:28
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:18:05
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:07:52
Fuckin' Lambo train. 110%.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:35:10
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:23:55
Market cap has been dropping quite a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:28:07
Second quote is to me. I guess there is no "normal"
 for bitcoin so I was talking a bit out of my ass with that comment.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:51:30
They UNDERSTOOD the internet bubble. They UNDERSTOOD the housing market. At least Buffet has explicitly stated he DOESN'T UNDERSTAND bitcoin. I don't care that they have superb track records. If they don't understand something then they can't give an opinion that should be taken into consideration in any matter lol.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:31:41
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:52:32
It corrected 70%. Do you think it needs more?
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:22:44
It isn't true anonymity so he's already wrong on that front lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:11:08
I'm crying from laughter. I'll eat my own dick if this happens in a day and a half.
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:14:47
You guys literally get so pissed off when I talk shit, but has bitcoin found "support" at any previous support level? No. It keeps going down.
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:19:30
I've been busy. Pretty stressed. Have some shit going on.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:43:53
Thank you. I didn't know that since I use TradingView.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:01:32
Do you have a passport?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:18:15
Good shit, man. :D
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:54:27
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:41:51
You need 65 bitcoin to move the market .5%.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:06:38
Do it. It won't break 11k. Just to clarify, eastern standard time.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:03:58
Lmao. I'm not. Just bored and horrendously sleep deprived.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:59:28
Yeah. To a U.S. Embassy in a foreign country to renounce your citizenship.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:56:28
That would be the most wild crash ever lol.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:26:32
Detailed analysis my ass lol. You just called an actual analysis above "mumbo-jumbo."
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:03:52
Of course. Just not quality discussions lol.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:09:29
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:58:17
That is incorrect. I did not say that.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:46:17
And are you the all powerful bitcoin wizard?
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:45:06
Um, can you read? I still think its a bull trap. I just don't think it'll go THAT low. Jfc.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:51:28
10k stronk af. 1 upvote = $1 for green dildo
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:58:18
Is that corn or a space lambo?
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:36:03
But you admitted to spreading FUD lol.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:35:55
Yes there was. That's not relevant to this conversation though. ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:03:33
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:31:47
1.3k. Big deal lol.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:13:10
Then unmanipulate it. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:42:10
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:34:26
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:05:49
Aaand we're going down.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:43:43
Okay. I'm selling everything. This is fucking absurd.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:32:22
17 to today is sideways too lol.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:04:36
LOL. Because I troll a bit and say things that make sense sometimes? Right.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:03:58
I've always dreamed of Lambos running a train on me.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:06:10
Valid point. He has also said it's a bad idea to touch bitcoin. He doesn't understand it though so his opinion isn't really based on much.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:07:01
This is to have an actual discussion. Do you guys feel BTC is over or under-priced? Where do you think it will go from here and why? Share any indicators you know of/use or any pertinent articles. Share ideas and shit. Be nice. :D
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:11:50
Get off your high horse you sorry sack of crap. Jfc. You get so temperamental with all the trolling and BS predictions and TA here. What do you expect?
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:14:15
HEY HEY HEYYYYYYYYYY. WHAT UP BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:58:35
Stopped reading when I read "50%." First off, it has been a 69.7% correction. Just because something has a correction doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in it. That mentality is incredibly fucking naive. EVERY stock in existence has had SOME sort of correction only to recover and continue an upwards trend at some point. Saying you won't invest in bitcoin because it had a nasty correction, mind you that it has experience 80%+ corrections, is like saying you won't take risks because of the sole reason of there being ANY possible risk.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:38:19
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:30:18
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:23:13
I'm not spreading BS. ��
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:00:34
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:00:21
Not bad. This is pretty good.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:30:06
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:38:52
I get $300+ per month mining and every couple of weeks or so I set up a new position in buying crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:09:06
Like a real man.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:50:23
And I feel day trading is only significantly profitable if you have a few grand in.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:39:57
The fuck is BTFD?
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:23:37
Where's John McAfee when you need him? :(
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:10:26
New drinking game: take a shot every time the price moves in either direction.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:20:53
I don't want to be saved, Daddy.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:26:17
Honestly? Building up the confidence to do that. A little scared about doing that haha.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:34:07
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:16:36
Got me. I'll refrain from absolutes. Correcting my absolute, my point still stands.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:51:34
Except literally no one does that so.....
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:40:33
Groupthink is unhealthy.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:39:26
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:14:01
Can't find anything. Screenshot or post link.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:39:58
It's YOUR idea to give up the USD. Carry your own ass to Brazil lmfao.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:46:58
1000 years? All of these are probably useless.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:05:42
BET. Four hours.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:00:05
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:22:15
Bitcoin has no price support as it's manipulated incredibly easy by whales. It only experiences resistance. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:58:52
What if YOU'RE Craig S. Wright?
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:57:29
Wait a second. You support Trump.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:47:07
No lol. It hasn't updated the price for eighty minutes for any of the four currencies. It's just stuck.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:50:21
Do it. You won't.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:05:35
Bitcorn doin' good. Lower!
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:53:57
He IS Satoshi! I fucking knew it!
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:23:51
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:36:57
10.8k is the new resistance and high.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:08:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:17:14
With uncertainty in price action remaining constant.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:54:59
I meant the dollar amount. Not the dominance percentage. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:16:11
Where do you guys check volume?
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:22:48
I mean, do you even Google? There's tons of evidence of Trump having ties to Russia lol.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:47:03
Okay. Cool. And according to John McAfee it'll be 78k by the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:01:10
Been in it since July of last year. Never panic sold. Don't intend on doing so.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:55:41
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:16:48
No. 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:17:32
Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:46:07
By sideways movement over several days I mean the price stays either within the same range or it doesn't deviate substantially out of that range.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:05:26
Okay. Just checking.
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:34:47
Bitcorn don't give a fuck about Bill Gates' comments.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:11:19
LOLOL. No thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:51:07
Of course Charlie Munger would says that lol Berkshire Hathaway is owned by Warren Buffet and he hates bitcoin too. Why? They don't understand it lol.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:45:14
LOL. Sub 11 it is.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:46:07
Not in the slightest. Amusing? Absolutely.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:11:11
Take a seat. It's going down.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:16:21
I have my shit in Coinbase. Should I move it to GDAX?
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:03:24
I want to short, but it seems like too much of a pain, honestly.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:27:43
Send it to my address. xD
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:06:15
Ehhh. Is it even going down that path? Pyramid schemes are usually pyramid schemes from the start. They don't transition into one. Now, being a pump and dump or a shitcoin is totally different. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:03:19
GUYS. WHAT IF THE MOON IS MADE OUT OF LAMBOS.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:01:44
Of course!
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:10:21
I agree. My wheelchair does just fine.
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:29:40
A lot of you are so incredibly weak emotionally when it comes to this. It's honestly really sad to see.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:36:00
Invest in green dildos. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:04:52
You're upset.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:33:59
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:03:07
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:44:27
It'll probably keep going down anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:52:31
When you look at bitcoins price history in charts, it always results in an upwards trend when the 50 SMA re-crosses the 100 SMA.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:52:48
Fuck you. I'm having fun.
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:16:59
Or I can say whatever I want and I won't be silenced for having a dissenting opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:04:50
Objectively wrong. Screenshot below.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:04:04
[There lol. ](
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:27:34
'Cause on my end I don't see any comments I deleted on the 16th. Again, I'll wait.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:11:24
And back under 9k.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:15:42
And there you go. Can't hold itself up. Again. This market is absolute shit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:24:33
After consulting my crystal ball, if the price continues to increase (closing doesn't need to be in the green) and the lower candlestick is as long, or longer, as it is now then that signifies a bullish trend.
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:04:10
Very happy to see the progress made was lost in a few hours. Go lower.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:32:36
And what amount do you have? Hmm?
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:47:41
I knew it couldn't sustain itself. Very happy.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:41:06
Nah. They're around.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:01:44
I've literally never said it would go to 4k. I'm not one of those.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:04:38
No. Below.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:18:26
Fuck bitcoin. This is so laughable it's pathetic.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:47:05
YAY. WE'RE GOING BACK DOWN. NO. SUPPORT.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:12:24
I mean, when we crawled up to 11.5k and tanked to 6.6k like it's nothing? Personally, nothing to be happy about lol. I'm very critical about this market because it fluctuates way too much way too quickly.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:33:40
Can I smoke a lambo?
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:09:29
Showed you the screenshot. .189. Do you ever say anything that's factually true?
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:14:46
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:52:52
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:54:47
Painfully tried.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:18:54
And another dump. So much for it having a decent recovery before closing.
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:00:15
Ahhhh. Okay. Thank you. That clears things up.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:37:53
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:08:19
Personally, nearly 3k is nothing to be celebrating over.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:03:33
Pornhub wants Verge. Amazon is making a patent to de-anonymize bitcoin to sell the information to law enforcement. No "us" is being adopted.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:45:06
Below 9k AGAIN. Yay!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:45:39
It's all manipulation. No one wants to accept that.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:43:38
No? Haven't bought in a while.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:48:58
Can't. Break. 8.4k. ��
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:21:32
Hence saying "nearly"...
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:36:18
I guess so.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:08:29
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:43:06
Still don't like being called a nocoiner as it's factually untrue. Good idea though. I like the creativity.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:24:45
And where's your proof?
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:05:02
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:47:18
I initially started at 6k. Highest I ever bought at was 12.3k after it started crashing in December.
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:13:00
Yes! We're getting a serious pullback! Finally!
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:38:38
Then I'm not lying till I'm proven wrong. ��
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:44:11
Nah fam.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:38:15
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:48:44
I'm basing what I said solely off of trends lol. Not purposely being negative or anything.
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:06:14
Prove. Me. Wrong. I'm. Waiting. 
Also, I have about .25 bitcoin.
Not a no-coiner.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:32:49
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:18:40
You're proving me completely right. I've never said it will go to 4k. Take a fucking seat already.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:06:52
Yeah. Everyone gets way too excited way too quickly. None of this means anything until it breaks and holds above 11.5k.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:39:09
This is honestly so fucking pathetic for bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:44:43
Dumping again...
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:56:42
How's everyone doing today?
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:10:31
Find where I said 2.5 because if you paid attention you'd notice I said .25. It's SOME amount so I've proven you wrong three times now.
Edit: four times because you said I deleted a comment on the 16th, which I didn't.
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:46:31
Yay! It's going down!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:50:37
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:13:36
Eh. I don't day trade. I was wrong about the amount I had. Haven't checked in a few days so my bad lol. I said "about" a certain amount lol. Shoot me. Still not a no coiner.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:16:19
This is incredibly inaccurate. The same shit was happening from 10.8k to 11.2k and it crashed by 40%.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:22:59
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:20:33
Because "resistance" never "holds." Resistance is every goddamn price now.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:07:32
I bought your mom.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:36:43
Acquire bitcoins. Disregard dumping.
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:26:30
Uh, okay?
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:54:03
Nah. I'll stick around. :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:45:01
Looks like we're losing all progress again. I genuinely think 9.7k was the top for the a bit of time.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:04:18

Wow. One of you actually messaged me telling me to kill myself. Good job. No, really. We're all very proud of you.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:00:39
Already told you the amount I have lol. And you still haven't proven me wrong. I'm waiting.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:42:36
Heeeeeeey. False. :P
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:32:07
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:59:57
Right here. ��
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:41:38
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:07:08
Ha. Got me.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:04:21
Go right ahead.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:53:46
It did the 1k jump in one hour?
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:00:26
Ah. Okay. I can kind of see that.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:05:44
Good morning. How's everyone doing today?
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:07:01
Yeah. Why not?
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:08:04
Lmao. Where you all at now, huh?
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:10:48
Jfc. I've never said bitcoin was going to 4k.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:03:46
Find where I said it though. Oh right. You can't.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:17:01
This is not good...
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:46:07
Oh lol.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:44:39
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:43:16
I'll bet it's the top lol.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:29:31
[Right in the middle, buddy. ](
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:18:42
It is, but for the sake of conventionality there needs to be an opening and closing time to me able to have candle charts.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:02:22
See? You get it.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:58:52
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:10:56
It's gone down nearly 1k...
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:32:16
Great job. First factually accurate post lol. I decided to not do it. Whoop dee fucking doo. XD
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:31:09
So, where you all at now that it's still going lower?
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:20:07
Yeah. I'm actually a little upset by it.
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:59:09
Lower. :)
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:41:11
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:24:15
What in the actual fuck?
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:39:48
Tell me the difference. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:55:19
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:47:47
I don't. I like fucking with people though. It's apparent everyone else has a weak heart. :/
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:43:51
That's what I'm saying. Doesn't seem like there's ever any actual support when the price can tank several hundred dollars so easily.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:43:52
Ahhh. Okay. Thank you haha. I mean, maybe. We'll truly see come the end of 2020.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:49:11
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:45:25
That's fine. Understand you're wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:29:27
I've never said it'll go to 4k and you still can't find proof. What you're providing is only proving me right. I'll keep waiting though.
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:21:11
Too late. As. I've reiterated many times, there are no support levels.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:35:19
Can you clarify what you mean?
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:43:13
And this is like 10%....
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:26:20
So a third of the progress made in the last eighteen days has been lost in a few hours. Nice.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:49:07
8k isn't coming. Stop. After a 1k increase in eighteen hours there will be a HARD pullback.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:15:08
I don't hope for anything. I always expect the worst so I'm never disappointed.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:20:10
Look through my comments and point out where I've said it will go to 4k. I'll wait. The other guy couldn't do it. ��
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:26:43
Nooope. Stopped by a while ago.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:06:50
It was a typo. I meant to type "of."
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:26:17
...it IS spring.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:33:26
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:11:10
Considering the minimal price action between yesterday and today, I personally expect this to be a top and the next twenty-four hours will be a hard pullback. You can go back in the daily charts and see similar patterns.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:14:28
Yeah. This isn't looking good as usual after a nice run up. Maybe next month. McAfee is totally wrong with his $1,000,000 estimate lol.
It'll stop going down at 8.2k. I'm basing this off nothing. Just a naive prediction.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:24:42
It makes me so happy when people talk shit about me and claim I've said certain shit and they simply can't find the evidence to back it up.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:26:01
Right direction. Lower.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:40:58
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:08:18
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:36:53
Opening/closing is 8 PM EST every day.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:21:19
Not true at all.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:04:16
I'm not.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:19:23
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:40:41
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:07:20
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:24:39
Passed it...
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:23:24
What in the actual fuck? Fuck the east coast. Seriously.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:33:48
My break even is at 12.3k lmfao.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:45:57
That doesn't even make sense contextually. ����������
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:45:04
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:26:36
Mine Doge Coin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:49:37
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:54:28
Lower. There's no support anywhere. It's all manipulation. :)
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:48:34
Okay. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:04:19
I mean, I was asked to screenshot the amount I have. That's my Coinbase. Don't believe it? Not my problem. It proves the amount I have because I know it's mine. ��
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:31:43
It's dumping all the progress made yesterday.
