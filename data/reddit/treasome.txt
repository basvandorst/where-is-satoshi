LOL..! I can only read bitcoin in this picture.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:07:55
Govts can still do anything however in my opinion they are also already in BTC with most of their funds .. lol
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:37:54
Altcoins are bleeding and btc is grooming, still a good sign in my opinion that btc is going up and when this money will move into other altcoins we will see a significant opportunity of earning money by investing in altcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:01:18
I will vote for trezor, rest you better should do some research instead of considering my experience as a recommendation.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:33:57
Earnings are only possible in the volatile market as we can see many forex traders trades EURUSD and the reason behind this is that it is highly volatile as compared to other currency pairs, so is the case with bitcoin i guess.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:13:29
Soon it will make another all time high however i and all others investors are waiting anxiously for another bull ride. Till then i am sticking with EURUSD trading on my hotforex account.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:43:44
Better to use these gains in building another passive income generating opportunities, there are several forex brokers like hotforex, fxprimus etc where we can deposit out btc and trade them to earn more money.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:00:01
Seems that this proposal might also become one of the reason of pumping bitcoin to make another all time high in its history.
@_date: 2019-07-25 11:34:55
Agreed to some extent however bitcoin and facebook libra both are currently facing a lot of criticism by US government. We will only see the results if facebook gets enough liberty to launch their crypto currency as per the announced dates.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:00:22
LOL.. first the bitcoin and the alts market is already bleeding and now we are hearing a new case of IRS sending notifications for bitcoin encashments.
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:02:42
Blockchain is now started implemented in almost every aspect of the industry in our economy even giants like facebook have announced launching their own cryptocurrency in 2020.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:37:16
I beleive that money just became a paper note right after it was removed from gold standards back in 1971. So better to keep it invested in different projects so that it could yield more money in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:23:27
Those who have purchased bitcoin on 3000usd and sold it when it spiked 13800usd have made more than 3x on their investments..
@_date: 2019-07-03 13:06:37
Most of us try to buy at the dip however it does not works because of our shortcoming in learning, i was looking at btc when it was accumulating around 3000usd, my bad i missed it.. yet i have a few of them bought at relatively much cheaper amount but this was a good opportunity to triple the amounts.
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:24:13
Everyone will cares when it will make a new all time high once again however who knows when the bull rally start again.
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:28:44
Soon we will see a new swing all time high in bitcoin again, i am waiting for this right moment and so for now i am trying to accumulate it.
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:01:22
Yet another sweet opportunity becoming rich right ..!
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:28:48
Can trezor or any other hardware wallet can be helpful in storing the bitcoins and then putting them in a bank vault which is to be opened after the said date.?
@_date: 2019-11-04 12:21:15
Although it is not backed by gold yet it is and will be widely acceptable currency through out the globe. IMO!
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:55:33
Lets hope it will again start making new all time highs..!
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:57:35
Maybe they already have understood the basics and have been planning to take optimal entry in bitcoin market.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:02:58
So i was waiting for an upward rally and it again starting moving down like a ston fallen from the sky.. :/
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:46:18
Yet it might be a signal which impact the price later on..
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:06:46
great job, hope to see this POS at every business places soon Good luck!
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:55:10
I have heard that this country has many bitcoin traders as well, however bittrex banned many countries from trading including this also. Not sure what was the exact reason behind their act.
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:01:03
Just earn bitcoin, buy it, trade it, double it and hodl it.. forget other parameters ;)
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:11:13
Not sure when bitcoin rallies high i also want to exit some of my positions and spend my money well. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:07:59
LOL.. Now at around 7100, became more cheaper to buy again!
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:47:51
Good luck with your future prospects and i wish you better get more than 800s.. Cheers!
@_date: 2019-11-06 12:00:59
I found out this yesterday on twitter and proud to be among the 58%. :)
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:29:44
Lol, almost all of us buying high and selling low because of the FOMO!
@_date: 2019-11-18 10:57:08
I also vote for the trezor for so far it can be a good source to keep your coins secure, lets see if we can find any alternative in the future better than the trezor wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:00:48
I guess both.. :)
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:57:51
I guess this time bitcoin will go to mars instead of moon..
@_date: 2019-11-02 09:23:27
Bakkt will be the payment processor imo..!
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:08:53
There are still many people like these who can never understand even that they can make money from this bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-01 12:03:22
I also applied for loan on btcjam once however could not get any amount from them, yet i lost a lot of bitcoin in hashocean, summerbtc and other schemes but now learned a lesson, though very hard way but it added to my experience.
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:53:08
Bitcoin upward trend will soon come, we cannot rely upon other's predictions yet we can rely upon the charts. Try to see what these charts really showing up is a true picture IMO.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:04:53
I guess 6K is a handsome figure so far but what exactly is happening to the bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-23 10:44:58
So the next five days are good for buying the dip or shorting the bitcoin on margin trading offered by brokers like binance, poloniex, hotforex, xm, exness etc.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:00:04
What if the bankers are already shorting us and are in bitcoins as well..!
@_date: 2019-11-04 15:52:23
No doubt we all have a lot of expectation from these digital asset however one simple question is that is it really wise putting all of the eggs in one single basket?
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:32:16
Maybe these have been with the forgotten wallets or otherwise they can change the entire history if moved to the exchanges like a little whale rocked the market last few weeks ago.
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:19:26
So 1 OZ worth of gold was 584 bitcoins in 2011 and now see where we are standing right now..!
@_date: 2019-11-26 09:41:08
I can see bitpay which is a bitcoin payment processor and i also have seen this in one of my forex broker payment options i.e., hotorex which also claims accepting bitcoins for payment deposit and withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:20:39
Soon we will be glad to see top officials of the commercial banks etc admitting they are fully in in this bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-02 09:01:43
Censorship is everywhere now but i don't believe it to be good. I guess the bitcoin evolution cannot be stop now and developers will soon comes up with github's replacement as well if it becomes too affected.
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:36:27
Almost 85% of the total bitcoin is mined and in the hands of investors, traders, miners etc..
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:31:47
LOL! OMG, you are right.. i can see the same chart above ;)
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:04:11
There are a few people who think bitcoin is a shiny object used to catch fishes. Some on the other hand believe it is a good pick which can make them rich, so do your own research while investing in this commodity. Many forex brokers like hotforex, fxprimus etc have offered this commodity for trading against USD and EUR too.
@_date: 2019-10-15 10:57:34
This had happened to many investors when bitcoin was at its all time highs soaring in values every day, i also did the mistake however it was adjusted because i purchase a little value of bitcoin. Still hodling it, but now i have been in trading so most of my loss was covered.
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:08:18
Not yet but i am still curious to get more about how this whole mechanism works in bitcoin automated teller machine..!
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:24:59
In my opinion, miners have switched to trading because mining operation costing too much these days due to mining difficulties.
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:18:15
For govt every earning opportunity can be taxed to generate revenues, imo..
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:15:49
Whatever, yet this computer and internet invention has fundamentally changed the entire globe.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:40:06
When gold was introduced in barter system people were not sure how it will become a precious commodity and so is the case with this bitcoin, IMO!
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:53:08
Yeah, the supply is limited and many including me have started accumulating this because there are chances that this will become a valuable thing in the future.
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:32:52
Yeah, indeed! Perhaps they had forgot that now there is a new monetary system which will revolutionized the entire world.. or may be bitcoin will also become a past story as like many bubbles schemes introduced in the history where such bubbles eventually burst going to zero in value.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:42:19
So these employees will get fluctuation in their salaries whenever USD tumbles against those currencies lol.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:59:54
Awesome, this could be the best advise i ever had!
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:02:02
Bitcoin trading seems lucrative but whenever you put money in it you will face downtrend and when you sell the market moves upwards. Is it the common scenario in the bear market or i just need improving my skills set.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:17:36
Great! So what are plans ahead.. I guess you have already made a good decision joining bitcoin club :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:54:15
Yeah its true, yet we have to use fiat to purchase other assets to make more fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-27 10:23:08
But why we should tell them about our bitcoin history, just chill and watch your bitcoin moving upwards daily. I am hoping soon it will make another new all time highs again!
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:27:07
21 million bitcoins so if one person have one each, there will be only 21 million people on earth who will be having these bitcoins. So how many of you have these bitcoins..?
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:41:09
Soon there will be plan B everywhere as these forex brokers like hotforex, fxprims, fxcm, etc have accepted it as payment deposit method as well as BTCEUR, BTCUSD pair is also available for trading to forex traders.
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:55:14
What if we ran out of the funds and the bitcoin drops more.. :-?
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:43:54
Everyone is waiting for bitcoin another bull run.. let see when see another green rally again!
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:31:27
There are a few who claimed to be the founders of Bitcoin yet they failed to prove themselves. I believe that the current influencing personalities in bitcoin are the whales who possesses large volumes of bitcoins and bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers.
@_date: 2019-10-27 10:50:19
Still fiat is required to buy bitcoin and sell it as well.
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:14:53
FB has already adopted the bitcoin and so is the idea of developing their own project based on blockchain IMO!
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:12:24
I was wondering what about those who bought it at 19000, all time high, with a high interest rate credit card!
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:45:46
I think that the banks would already be in the bitcoin trading market now, even the famous forex brokers like hotforex, xm, exness, fxcm etc have announced bitcoin paired with EUR and USD.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:18:04
What if i have too many bags of shitcoins which already valued zero now, should i still hodl them and wait for another bull run?
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:02:41
Soon this bitcoin commodity will be accepted everywhere i believe.
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:26:05
Why the mental hospital want to know the location when google exactly know our location on every search.
@_date: 2019-10-21 13:37:38
Yet we have noticed one more person claiming to be another real Satoshi Nakamoto but who cares i am concerned with trading bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:22:14
All the best, so did you got any luck getting bitcoin against the orders/sales?
@_date: 2019-10-11 10:50:39
They should also write an addendum accepting bitcoins which will appreciate in value and they can make more profits while selling coffee and bitcoin capital gains.
@_date: 2019-10-27 10:48:55
This bitcoin can't be predicted when to short and when to long IMO!
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:57:40
When it dumps why can't we buy at that moment, just because we think it will dump more but it actually retrace itself.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:00:45
I have noticed bittrex winded up its operations in Venezuela as well as in other 30 countries, not sure why!
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:55:32
SO this is the best use of bitcoin you have ever made i guess.. Good job!
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:32:11
So for me, bitcoin does not spark any joy when it rallies downwards.. i want to see it in up trends and thats make most of us joyful.. correct me if i am wrong!
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:29:18
This still happens to many and i believe it is a human nature whereas those who had bought it around 3k and sold when it touches above 11k again made hefty profits in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-12-19 11:47:40
What would be the output of this heater cum bitcoin miner..?
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:25:12
Hodling bitcoin and others as well for quite sometime, i just regret i should have hodl only the bitcoin and not the other shitcoins because all the other have devalued. Bitcoin also went down in value but still one bitcoin worths one bitcoin at the end of day whereas the other coins went down reduced my portfolio value drastically.
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:06:49
Like gold people will always find btc very expensive to buy in..
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:21:52
Yes indeed i must agree with this, the wealthy and riches have their money in less liquid assets like properties however on the other hand middle class and poor invest in liquid assets like stocks, mutual funds etc..
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:10:34
Can you share which software is this ..? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:54:49
So instead i believe better to accumulate bitcoin so can it be sold when it touches all times high once again.
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:21:44
Yet the FIAT is required to buy or sell the bitcoin, not sure when this irony gets to an end.
@_date: 2019-12-12 11:55:19
Good luck for your future ambitions!
@_date: 2019-12-12 11:53:51
For those who knew how trading system works can still make hefty profits making longs or shorts on BTC in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-12-19 11:05:35
Going to moon or mars..!
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:09:04
In my opinion i am hoping that this bitcoin will be bullish in the upcoming 2020, lets see how it goes.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:48:32
So this means that the upcoming year might be helpful in earning through crypto trading IMO!
@_date: 2019-12-19 11:55:15
Only bitcoin chocolate has a price tag with satoshis.. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:50:08
Oh, i seriously forgot his bets about bitcoin or eating up his dick..!
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:22:25
In my opinion there is no profitability in mining these days because of increase in mining difficulty with every passing day. Yet the energy cost too much and the output is low either due to bitcoin halving and other issues etc
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:11:08
When the bitcoin hits it all time highs i still remember that those who made money sold it and the other who were not in bitcoin desperately bought different coins in a FOMO! Now they are looking at others hands as all of their funds are gone.
@_date: 2019-09-18 09:11:39
LOL.. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-18 08:13:41
This is why bitcoin is the best because you can never mine more than 21m in any manner.
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:08:11
Very well said, we can not mine more than the value yet we can make money trading this commodity either through leveraged trading with forex brokers like hotforex, fxprimus, fxcm etc or at different digital exchanges with no leverage like binance, bittrex, poloniex etc.
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:16:07
There are two opinions about bitcoins, one says it will go up again and the other are with the opinion that this is a shiny object used to catch fishes/investors.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:27:45
Bitcoin will soon be accepted everywhere and we will see this.. even the forex brokers like hotforex, octa, fxcm, fxprimus etc have started accepted this as a payment deposit method and now we can also trade bitcoin against USD and Eur too.
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:43:35
I don't think these fees are that so high.. they are still too low in my opinion. I saw the fees jumped up too once the bitcoin touched its all time highs in 2018, now these are comparatively low.
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:43:48
I guess we can make more than bitcoin wallet address using blockchain wallet..
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:37:36
So is this an exchange, next competitor to binance and other digital exchanges..? I guess this will also be competing with forex brokers like hotforex, fxcm, fxprimus, etc which also offer leveraged trading for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:06:11
Waiting to see the bitcoin rally upward and touching another all time highs again..
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:04:38
Good otherwise there should be a hard fork for sure..
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:38:58
Ok, let me do the math again.. hmmm, i guess you are right too! :)
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:33:19
This point worth to be noted, i agreed with you indeed this is the same reason many businesses avoid accepting such currencies which moves too unpredictable.
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:43:53
So you might be hodling for long term and for better profits, i believe that it will surely go up once again and touches all time high when the next bull market revive.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:53:17
Well that can make him millions of dollars in future.. :)
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:36:05
Either hodl or trade it but be careful trading is very risky and you need to learn the skills requires for trading money in order to earn money before jumping into trading.
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:18:30
I am also hodling a few bags of altcoins and still waiting for another bull run... lets see how it goes!
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:22:32
Well that's interesting, let me do the math again.. umm! yeah you are right ;)
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:36:34
Spending a kidney may never be a good idea because we can earn money at any phase of life but once the kidney is gone it will never come back..
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:38:13
I guess diversification can be a good idea so put a little amount in bitcoin as well besides your stocks &amp; mutual funds.
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:28:02
Just waiting for another green rally in the bull run so that i could sell my altcoin bags once the market hits the new trends.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:46:19
Didn't get the logic still it was a cool video i believe that.. ;)
@_date: 2019-09-16 11:49:20
Yeah just like the story of the guy who ate pizza for bitcoin.. :)
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:27:24
The FED has the printing authority so they will keep printing fiat money and pushing it into the economy as long as they want to print more money.
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:32:21
I guess these governments have also planned to get into the bitcoin business, now they might be waiting to tax the others in order to make more money.
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:01:55
We can expect anything from bitcoin i guess..
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:49:16
Agreed, it is obvious to look for the right pattern to decide either to get into the trade or wait for another favorable conditions IMO..
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:32:47
One of my Vietnamese friend claimed it to be fake otherwise he said it is a good news to withdraw bitcoins directly to the ATM rather than transferring them to exchangers which charge their own rate to convert money. WHere is it situated by the way?
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:15:29
Even if it goes to zero, one bitcoin will be still equal to one bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:38:15
If you have written this book, i believe this is your first step to success. Type it and proof read and try to put it at amazon in order to monetize. Good Luck!
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:44:45
In my opinion bitcoin will dominate the coin market capitalization just like the USD when it is compared in forex trading, every pair become a major one if it is paired with the USD.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:24:43
Yes i believe you should review trezor hardware wallet..!
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:25:38
Soon we will find bitcoin related projects everywhere because the world has accepting bitcoin reality very slowly and quietly.
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:18:38
Anxiously waiting for bull rally so that other alts can also move upward at least..!
@_date: 2019-09-18 08:33:02
This might be the FOMO i believe, they might be thinking that they could have earn more if started this cryptocurrency earlier however i guess they will soon face the consequences as Facebook is experiencing now after their Libra coin announcement.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:29:52
Keep them secure or keep trading them to make more bitcoins because they will surely make you rich one day.. I have made a mistake of not diversifying to other investment avenues when btc touches all time high and now i regrets for not getting into any other physical business or even converting them to my hotforex account using bitpay.
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:16:08
Bitcoin will eventually make new highs again and everyone is expecting the same in my opinion.
