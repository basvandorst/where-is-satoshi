"After your account hits 180 points, points convert to bitcoin (as if USD cents) and are paid directly to your address, usually within minutes."
This is what is says on the website.
1. if you get paid in bitcoin you get payed directly to your address. i dont see any reason to make it more complicated with points and usd.  
2. this job-micro-payments aspect of it it's just on piece of the big puzzle we hope to solve. we want introduce newbies to bitcoin and help them earn some bits answering some questions that they would probably do it for free anyway.

What about this?
In July 2015, Dotcom said he doesn't trust Mega service in a Q&amp;A session with tech website Slashdot, claims the company had "suffered from a hostile takeover by a Chinese investor who is wanted in China for fraud" and that the New Zealand government seized this investor's shares and now has control of the site. Dotcom encouraged readers not to use it and that he plans to set up a completely open source nonprofit competitor. Dotcom announced on his Twitter account that he plans to release a detailed breakdown of Mega's status.[31][32][33] Mega responded that the authorities have not opposed or interefered with any of Mega’s operations.

You do bring a valid point about job creators. We want to build communities local, and global and around this communities there will exist jobs. Like mandarln said mturk is just an example. 
For the moment we want to test the earning part of it. This is an really early stage we are in.
The new that bitcoin brings is that is just better money.

@_date: 2016-04-15 19:13:03
The goal is to be useful.

@_date: 2016-04-11 16:10:01
they just replied, after i posted. so yeah i am happy.
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:16:32
this is how bitcoin is for most of people
@_date: 2016-04-15 19:24:26
Well the most success bitcoin had was drug money, coffee is a drug. Still good for "coffee" not that much changed.
@_date: 2016-04-10 11:19:37
they replyed me and send what i need. thanks
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:15:26
thanks, sent a pm
@_date: 2016-04-15 19:48:11
interesting is what works not what people think works. 
it s like you think it would be nice for everyone to have a mercedes car in a world where everyone has wings and can fly.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:57:22
I had another trade planned, after to buy the coins
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:53:00
I was in a full packed cafe.
In UK it s illegal to arm yourself in any way
@_date: 2017-02-18 15:38:29
Btw link to pictures, even though they are also in the LBC thread 
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:45:44
The friend who could have came with me, he was doing his own stuff.
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:57:20
Yeah that was my luck. The other trader that got the same thing for 4 BTC in same day, he sent to their wallet directly
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:19:20
The thing is that when using coinbace, which is the worst exchange in terms of privacy, you have to hand in documents and Bitcoin by it s nature it s quite against that.
People pay a premium when buying from me for this convenience first of all.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:20:23
But if i get my coins back i ll make more by trading. 
Trading as a retails service, nothing with a crystal ball. ;)
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:16:34
I checked the money with my money checker pen and i believe there would have been a trace of that on them.
And i would show that there was a trade on LocalBitcoins that shows exactly the amount she had on her.
And not the say the people at the tables next to us that saw her handing me the money.
In UK if i hand you a 10 GBP bill and after i try to snatch it, it s illegal what i am doing. (I did not search for this specific law, but this is what the police man has told me)
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:57:41
Coke with ice i was drinking.
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:56:44
No clients go with that believe me. 
People when they buy they want a simple fast and easy way
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:47:09
LBC is a good place to trade. Just happened i ran in to the most stupid people in london probably
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:17:08
Even so, they could have just waited for me to get out, or follow me home, and that would have ended the same.
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:55:00
The UK police was the best, very responsive and understanding. Took the time with me and listen to me explaining Bitcoin and LBC
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:25:46
And what if he decides it s worth for him to take my money.
The problem there is that i put my trust in some one else who i expose myself to me
@_date: 2017-02-18 12:46:22
Just a few bumps on the back of my head. thanks for the concerns
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:17:38
coin.army find some groups you like and lurk around 
@_date: 2017-02-25 10:24:34

I also do Bank transfer only when buying
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:52:05
The only good thing is to minimise the risk.
When going alone you have x risk.
Another trader also has x risk.
If you both do a trade for y btc split it in 2.
Now you hold x/2 risk and make profit out of y/2.  But the math is in both of your favour
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:54:27
There was a metal fork and knife on the table, it is a cafe/restaurant,
but me hurting them like that was not an option.
But if they went for me in the heat of the moment it's legal in UK to defend myself like that.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:20:13

Some one will cut off your hand. I would not go around telling people i have a wallet in my hand.
Regarding this problem i guess you can have something in the chip that if it goes far away from your phone i cant be use.
Still risky if you ask me, compared to the benefits you get from this.

This is because people like them manage risk differently.
What i did wrong is that other people see the world like i do.
