Again, you're asking for negative proofs.
*Can you prove that the planet Gorborgon doesn't exist? No? Then you're willfully ignoring that it might exist!*
*Can you prove how the Aztec lines were made? No? Then you're willfully ignoring that they might have been made by extra-terrestrials!*
*Can you prove that the old Japanese man that shares part of the same name as the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin isn't actually the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin? No? Then you're willfully ignoring that they may in fact be the same person!*
Please, do yourself a favor, and learn how to think critically.

It makes plenty of sense when you realize that pseudonymity is not anonymity, and pseudonymity is not privacy.  Anonymity is not privacy either. 
To be clear: anonymity conceals authorship while privacy conceals content; a whitepaper written by an identifiable (pseudo)name is neither anonymous nor private.

IIRC, a working implementation of Shor's algorithm would only effectively halve the keyspace.

It's not an argument; it's a clarification of terms. And you're not properly "anonymous" if you're choosing to re-use the same identity (as "Satoshi Nakomoto" clearly did) even if it isn't your "real" identity -- whatever *that* means.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:26:46
You're misinterpreting his tweet: Gavin a) is disappointed that the Nakamoto family has been doxxed and b) regrets talking to Leah. Neither is these serve to lend credence to the claim that the "Nakamoto" portrayed in the Newsweek article is the creator of Bitcoin; Gavin simply feels bad that a person (or family of persons) that wishes to be left alone is being harassed unrelentingly.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:15:01
No. The onus is on Newsweek to provide evidence in support of their claims; extraordinary claims should be approached with suspicion until sufficient evidence suggests otherwise.

@_date: 2014-03-07 06:49:04
No. Your interpretation adds information that is not explicitly present in what is written. It is also [fallacious]( But since you don't seem to willing to put forth any evidence in support of your claim and would rather base your interpretation on your own speculation, I invite you to go speak with him yourself. He has already made it very clear that he does not know who "the real Satoshi" is.

When all institutions of the state can be decentered -- when the power of violence is displaced by the authority of trustless cryptosystems -- there no longer remains a need for government; the very notion of a "decentralized government" is a contradiction in terms.

How do you verifiably prove a negative?
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:56:12




No; price is *not* a strict indicator of "success" (nor is it even a loose one as the recent history of speculative bubbles should tell you). Success, for Satoshi (at least as I knew of him), would entail the destabilization of centralized banking. Let's face it: Bitcoin is *far* from successful right now in either sense of the term -- and if/when it does become successful, that success will not necessarily be reflected in its market price. If it did, at which point would you deem it "successful"? When 1 BTC is worth $10,000 USD? $100,000? $1,000,000? If Bitcoin has succeeded anywhere, it has done so most meaningfully in making the *idea* of peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies more acceptable. And, again, this has much more to do with adoption (including, most notably, the adoption of *alternate* currencies in general) than price.

While this is all well and good, you're misunderstanding Kant here (or at least confusing his ethical position with the much simpler notion of "the golden rule"). For one, he doesn't take into account - at all - the consequences of an action, only whether or not that action is carried out in accordance with - and for the sake of - *duty*. Secondly, the categorical imperative fails IFF there is a resultant *logical* contradiction (and not because the situation is somehow "worse" in consequentialst terms). For example, lying fails the categorical imperative (and is thus "unethical") because if *everyone* were to lie, telling the truth would become *logically impossible.* All that being said, OP's actions may be unethical but they are not unethical because they fail the categorical imperative. Perhaps your evaluation would be more Kantian if you stressed that he was using those machines/users only as a means to an end. 
Good luck with your Kant reading. 
@_date: 2012-09-08 17:22:42


From Kant himself (specifically, in the *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals* where his moral philosophy is first developed). Assuming you don't have the time/patience to actually read it, Wikipedia offers a decent summary:  - see, in particular, the section on "maxims" and the later remarks about the law of non-contradiction (under the "Kant's argument" section).
Also, I'm not sure where you're getting this whole "incompatibility with established maxims" thing from - this sort of thinking (of comparing acts/rules to whatever is popular or culturally established) is decidedly un-Kantian since his primary concern is to develop a moral principle that depends only on Reason.

I think this is where you are mistaken. Network topologies are *inherently* political; decentralization "works" for Bitcoin (and other peer-to-peer technologies) precisely because it operates, in principle, independently of any ultimate authority.

I would urge you to read much more then. It is very unlikely that any government would fund a project whose consequences are clearly antithetical to its own purposes and ideals and far more likely that it was conceived by simply combining the many already-existing notions of digital currency with newer/developing technologies (more specifically, by taking the notions of electronic currency already developed by the cypherpunks of the 1990s and supplementing them with the newly-emerging "proof-of-work" comcept that were being discussed fairly extensively at the time as a solution to combatting email spam). See Satoshi's contributions to the mailing list for the full genealogical account.
Regarding bitcoin's "resistance to hacking," this is easily explained by understanding the underlying crypto, specifically SHA256 and ECDSA – neither of which are exclusive to bitcoin.
In short, bitcoin mostly amounts to a clever combination of several pre-existing technologies; there's no reason to believe that any government was involved.

A "0day flaw" generally refers to a new security vulnerability (i.e., zero days old).
As far as we know, cold storage (as you've described it) is safe.

Please name them. Preferably the "online" ones. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:07:02
No. The poster to which I originally responded was asking about *cold storage*; the private key associated with the storage address would never be used to sign transactions until withdrawal (and hence would not be vulnerable to the java randlib exploit).
To be clear: Coins sent *to* a new/storage address are safe (assuming, again, that the target/receiving address has never spent coins). Coins sent *from* a pre-fix android wallet, however, may have jeopardized the private key of that wallet.
