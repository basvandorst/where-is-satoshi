Am a Porsche man.but since I don't own any bitcoin. I guess am a poor man.

Me too I am trying to sell star citizen space ship for BTC instead. If only we had more fiat so we can make more fiat via crypto.

You have taste. Aston Martin is for me one of the most elegant car. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:03:12
I would certainly like that too. But it will probably be a camper. Why not a solar Tesla camper one would say.

The real bubble is people saying it is a bubble. Cause one day they will stop all at once. On that day I wish to be blowing soap bubbles nonchalantly.

I started a new job today. I chose and decided not to ever talk about crypto there, to avoid exactly that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:18:41

I am also a noob who need to learn all the above. Also what are the flash sales? Looks like humor.

Think of a night mode made of Grey scales. We tend store spend a loooong time in front of those. If you don't want to be confused with binance I advise blueish and greenish grays.

Same here. I  verifying my passport. And it sits above the counter saying verification in progress.

We need the porn industry and the gaming industry to get on board. If we get these two. The rest will offer little or no resistance at all.

Do you know why Bitcoiners don't buy Ferraris?
Because their main investor is Fiat.

8k is a lot of pixels to drive for the GPU. Get a good one or a SLI.

You are the greatest Muffing ever!
If you see yourself in need of Star Citizen spaceships/game pack I will be happy to give you everything I know as well (it is a highly complexe line up of ships)
Thanks for all the info. (should I edit the link?)
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:49:20
PS am not a gamer either but Star Citizen tickles my ''kid space lego time/sci fi novel teenage phase/science oriented adult in me are the targeted customer :D
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:35:01
Yes I was talking about a quick conversion to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:43:21

Thanks for the prompt response! 
Here is another: What is the best way to implement crypto payment (without losing money due to market fluctuation apart of fees) on a Webstore?
I sell Spaceships and most people are aware of Crypto tech so on their side it shouldn't be a problem. 
I do sell Ships for crypto the old fashion way here on reddit (with pms and comments) I am wondering about a semi automated system of a middleman/seller platform like this one:
