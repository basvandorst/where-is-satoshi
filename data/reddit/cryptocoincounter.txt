WTF does that even mean? Care to explain in english?
Chase sucks. Closed my account and went with another fissured. Loving it!
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:30:35


In other words you have no idea why they closed your account. Why don't you ask them for a reason instead of libeling them on public forums.
Chase is my main bank as well as my cousin. We have both been clustomers for over 10 years. Combined we have invested over 15K and Chase has never said a word or even blocked a single transaction. 
For all we know this guy is lying and never had a Chase account or did something shady like trying to reverse a Coinbase purchase.

See the issue is that when debits cards first came out there was NO WAY to overdraft. You would not be allowed to make that purchase. Banks figured out that if they allowed them they could make even more money on overdraft fees. Add them running transaction in a certain order to overdraft your account. Banks have been making ever increasing profits on overdraft fees. A few years ago there was no way to turn that crap off.

The OP is full of shit. He gives no details on why he thinks they closed his account. He said he found out because of some googling. 
I suspect he tried to cancel a coinbase transfer and thats why they cancelled his account. For fraud on HIS part.

You should report this to the SEC and im sure there is another federal agency (possibly your states DA office) that would like to take his money. These agencies don't regulate bitcoin NOW but in the future they will have some say and can go after him. Not to mention this sounds like outright fraud.

Coinbase is only insured against hacks and inside jobs. If your phone is stolen or you used SMS 2FA and they get into your account the Coinbase insurance DOES NOT cover that.

If you make less than $300K your capitol gains tax rate is the same as if you made $30K

Except that there are major issues with LN. Specifically that all people in the chain need to be able to cover the payment. Sending .025 BTC is one thing but what happens when they need to send 250 BTC, or even 1 BTC? It's just another band-aid.

I wonder what the people that lost millions of dollars on gox think?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:59:42
What does one have to do with the other? If you flip the graph the data is meaningless, it's not a graph of USD value. And who the hell would invest in something that has went down 900% in a year? USD has not lost 900% of its value because that's not possible. A dollar is a dollar, buying power may change but it's still $1.

If you had to cash out your bitcoin for this dog then you are buying from a store that gets their dogs from a puppy mill. Go to the fucking pound and stop one from being killed.

You will see tons of day traders post about the gains they made on some coin. What they fail to mention is the 10 trades they made before that one were for huge losses and this one win was just made them break even. Traders never tell you about their losses.

Now we can centralize bitcoin even more. Bitcoin nodes should be verifying transactions not some douchebags running a mining farm.

The  rule of Bitcoin and Crypto. If you don't hold the private keys to the wallet is NOT your Bitcoin.
Don't leave Bitcoin or Altcoins on a exchange. Protect your exchange accounts with Google 2FA.

I have about .6 BTC or do I have 600 BTC? You would never know because my Trezor has multiple passwords on it and which ever I enter is what you see as my balance.

It's nice to see people on here speak the truth. 99% of people you talk to on this Reddit or even twitter seem to think Bitcoin will just rise indefinitely, to infinity.

Both sites went down during the dip and magically came back up after it started rising.

Just don't trade coins as a business entity unless you have a Money Transmitters License. I have only seen them clamp down on people running a business and selling coins without a MTL or doing something shady at the same time.

Coinbase is raking in billions of dollars and cant be bothered to spend a little bit of it on support agents and infrastructure? CB is lucky nobody has built a clone yet

Except nowhere does it say any of those people purchased any bitcoin or alts.

You can say what you want about Charlie, he is a great win for ~~cryptos~~ Bitcoin. Trying to push ~~them~~ it everywhere *to protect his true wealth*
And to OP - What a GIANT load of shit! Musk says "Not true" and then something about getting bitcoin from a friend and losing it. For all we know the post above it could have said Bitcoin is the answer to all our problems and the "Not true" was his response. The above post could have said Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin. It easy to post a load of crap when you don't have to post the whole thread.

Schwab users actually buy stocks. We have ZERO idea of how many users on CB actually buy crypto

1. Don't use webmail that does not block content/html by default. Instead of buttons you will see the links and easily see the don't have similar domain names. If you ever get an email from coinbase or your bank/CC company you go TO THEIR WEBSITE DIRECTLY. NEVER click on a hyperlink in an email.
2. Use an adblocker. No more phising ads. There is a reason millions of people use ad blockers , and it IS NOT because we hate ads. They carry malware, goto phising sites, etc..
3. Do not EVER click on links. Find the real website address and go there.
4. same as 3. Don't click on links sent to you via SMS. If Coinbase does actually send an SMS don't delete it, that way it will be part of a chain when they senda new SMS. Dont use SMS 2 factor auth. Don't use SMS it is not secure.

I can already tell this is your first Coinbase purchase. That is their fraud prevention stopping the purchase. This is designed to prevent fraud and all the headache that come with it. I hate it too but I find it easier to call them and get it approved instead of trying to use my card and finding out someone stole it all. I have had the same thing happen after only a $300 purchase at Home Depot.
I have made about $4k in Coinbase purchases using Chase and have never had an issue.

Hire a lawyer unless you can file small claims in your state for an amount that large. Just spending a few hundred to have a lawyer send a message on their companies letterhead might get an immediate refund.

This has nothing to do with leaving coins on an exchange. Coinbase IS NOT an exchange. A real exchange like Bittrex or Binance will auto credit the coins to your account. No need to split them yourself. Only thing is you have to wait for them to implement the split on their end. Both exchanges have credited coins with days of the last forks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:07:54
Just because someone makes an account on CB does not mean they actually bought any crypto.

You should go ask him if he needs any help with wallets and such. Would be shitty to learn he went to bitcoin.com and lost all his BTC by sending to a BCH wallet or just going to a phising site and losing it. 
Guy should be able to make a hefty profit just off his BCH, BTG and BTD.
