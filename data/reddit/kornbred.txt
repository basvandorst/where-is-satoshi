I am fairly certain that Circle informs users that using a CC could cause problems and extra scrutiny.
I set up my account and linking my PNC checking account.  A few days later, they made 2 small deposits which I used to verify the account.  Haven't had any issues.
Is it possible that the account information on your Chase account differs from information on your state issued ID?  I am assuming that Circle is erroring on the side caution and denying if anything is slightly off.

In case you are curious, the website is owned and run by Wikileaks (in fact Julian Assange is listed as the Registrant, Admin and Tech contact) and the funds are being processed by the Wau Holland Foundation in Germany.

First off, lower BTC price means mining is less profitable.  Now is the time to buy, not mine.
You stated you can spend $300 on hardware.  You could probably get a used 500 GH/s miner for that price.  Assuming you live in an area with reasonable electric rates (lets say $0.07 kW/h), it would take you almost 1.5 years to break even (at current BTC price, assuming your miner is running 24/7/365).
You missed the get rich quick with BTC opportunity by about 3 years.

They are giving you advice.  Unless you have thousands of $$ and a data center ready to support you mining operation, you will never make money mining.

There are numerous, really good reasons to invest in bitcoin.  This is the most idiotically uninformed reason to do so.

Well, that's half right.  Fed doesn't produce currency, USDT does and "sells" it  to the Fed.  Now if the Fed wants to buy more, the USDT is gonna print it.

This has nothing to do with his work with cryptocurrencies; he is a former biotech founder and extremely anti regulatory.  If appointed he will gut the FDA and basically stop all oversight of food or drug products.
