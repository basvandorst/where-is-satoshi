It’s worth reading. And be fair - OP is just being positive. We could do with lots of that! Nice article. OP! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:05
That’s fine - be a lot friendlier if you just explained that nicely in the first place! ( See above - I do concepts not tech dev). We do need it explained.

Really interesting article. Very far-sighted. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks! The tech is all Dutch to me ( but the concepts I get , before I get any sneering remarks!). I am a marketer not a dev.

Good move. Well done. Let’s have more.

Thanks. That makes it sound less complicated. I’d be afraid of messing up and crashing the network though!!!! Or can’t that happen?

I would probably buy a ready made device to do it. It would be my contribution to decentralisation. I am not techie enough to bother trying to join the network in whatever way is the norm currently. It’s a good idea for people like me.

I got it anyway. I just feel sorry for you that you see/live life like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:45:22
I can see the point of price fixing a commodity you will spend 6 months producing: that’s sensible commercial activity. But this sort of cash settlement on betting? On bitcoin? It really is just gambling. I’m a bit gobsmacked to learn about it.

Couldn’t care less. Just pointing out you are on wrong subreddit if you want to slaver over BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:10:50
Well yes I see your point. It is sad in that way. I admit I only came into it as an investment originally - in 2016 - but now I really know so much more about it I believe in the concept. I think it very likely it will continue to take hold. I think of this phase as very temporary in the entire history of  finance: it will settle and stabilise one day in the long-term then it can do what it is meant to do. Not until then - and as you imply - not unless it can survive this speculation phase.  I hope it does survive - for the concept’s sake - not for my funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:58:54
I agree with that. It’s logical. Trouble is, it’s not good for bitcoin to be associated with gambling because so few people (relatively) don’t understand its true underlying value and raison d’etre. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:46:04

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:57:23
IMO you have to accept that. It’s evolution. Those of us who have been in it longer and see innovation and system change can’t be elite hodlers. We want bitcoin to penetrate widely to be successful which includes everyone. If btc has to become valued asset first then this ‘gold 2.0 - rush’  phase is inevitable. It’s all part of the adoption cycle. It’s inconvenient to us because bitcoin has just started taking off for real - now it’s getting tripped up daily. I feel irritated too. But I think we just have to sit it out. What doesn’t break it will make it stronger. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:18:55
Sounds like chucking money away to me. You might as well go to a casino and roll dice....
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:38:34
I don’t know. I thought it was really helpful! Thanks. But it 31 views so I guess other people didn’t think much of it!  
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:22:57
Do you still feel like that? There is a rationale for believing in bitcoin’s future. You can’t honestly compare it to just gambling.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:10
He’s got a point, but the way I see it, you  turn some back to fiat as and when you need it, and you keep hodling the rest - because one day you may be able to spend it as it is. There has to be a transition period. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:24:04
I use Bread online. Very simple to use. I believe it’s one of the earlier ones. I also do have a Ledger Nano which is for larger amounts.

Probably means a load of people who bought in at 16k when it was galloping are aiming to sell out as soon as they see a bit of profit. There must be a fair few like that. Profiteers not hodlers.

@_date: 2017-12-15 20:22:21
Someone just said I’m wrong about that - Breadwallet is not yet Segwitised so sorry. I must have confused it with my Ledger Wallet , which is Segwitised ( must be because one of my two wallets is and apparently it’s not Bread. Sorry for misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:00:09
I realise that, but this could be on a scale x 10 or x100 and could be very hard to progress with.

Where is it ( and I’m always on mobile version) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:40:53
None at all because this is a technical question that I know nothing about I’m afraid. My research told me both Trezor and Ledger were safe and good. Either would be a better alternative to a web-based online wallet.

I beg your pardon? Don’t be so fucking supercilious. How do you know what I know about the technology. Sounds like all I didn’t know is that this tea company actually wasn’t a tea company but a tech company. Bully for you. I live in the UK not NY. None of you people have any manners I swear. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:52
This - what? ‘This’?
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:29:30
I’m not knowledgable enough about blockchain.info to advise. But - if you would be moving coin twice then I think at the moment wait until you getting a Trezor/Ledger then you would only pay one lot of tx fees. If you are planning on getting it pretty soon anyway I’d just do that. Ledger Nano is cheaper - it’s a nice device. Links to computer to connect to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:12:13
Oh well, never mind. Others will, and they will be as happy using as you are , not using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:37:46
Excellent debate. Good argument points to be learned there. I really liked Saruhan Hapiglopu (? What a name to remember!) too - the global business analyst. Peter Schiff is so weak. It is a great demonstration of why cryptocurrency is of the future and gold is of the past.

@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:05
Well, you could be right about that ( last comment). I suppose the publicity is good for it generally. But it is very hard to see a benefit in it : gambling on the price? It is inviting market manipulation.....
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:59:52
Which still doesn’t make it a ponzi scheme. Dear me you are depressed aren’t you! ? Early New Year hangover? 
It’s a massive lull after a massive bull run. It may lay low for a while while futures marketeers work out how to play this new market. There are technical issues to be resolved - but Core know it. I cannot believe they aren’t working at it. 
The reasons above are potentially quite valid. We won’t know for a while I think. How can you possibly pretend  to know it’s “all over” when none of us know. If you’ve been in it since 2011 you have seen it all before. What’s changed in your view? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:44

Love your story, even if you went against all conventional wisdom. Btc isn't conventional anyway so do the old rules even apply? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:06:22
Decentralisation; rapid direct low cost transactions; 21 m market cap; potential for the unbanked; the far-reaching underlying value of blockchain technology ; disruption of the traditional financial sector in line with millenial philosophy and needs. Global instability coupled with inflated fiat. 
Not necessarily in that order and some clear explanation for each. Plus a slide on the adoption curve and where we might be now. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:39:09
Oh drool! I got in at about $600 but I'm still happy!!

Fair comment. Had not thought about it like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:13:03
I watched it the other night. I thought it was good - really got over the way bitcoin should work and the point about decentralisation. Bit of overkill though on who Satoshi really is/was. That's interesting to speculate, but it ended all on that subject and I felt a bit disappointed that it didn't end with looking into the future vision a bit more. Def worth watching though and it helped educate my other half too.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:11:51
My point is - they are know-it-alls now about crypto - so it's good to see them exposed as fallible publicly. Thought this subreddit might enjoy it. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:01:24
OMG they have finally cracked! What! No bubble talk?
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:11:11
For which I am happy and totally partisan. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:18:00
No but that's only because I have quite a few. I have enough to make me a millionairess if it hits 50k. In fact it can hit 30k and I'll achieve it. But if I didn't have much invested in it I would buy, yes.

Good article. Definitely the way to go. If you can afford a few hundred quid I recommend Ronnie Moas’ service - he does research and makes recommendations. He is very active and pro-active. He may not always get it right but he has a very good rep as a stock analyst and I haven’t been disappointed in his recommendations so far.

@_date: 2017-08-22 09:39:07
You aren't the first person to tell me that of course. But if I bought at say x4 less than current price, I think it  only makes sense to sell if I think long term bitcoin will lose value. I don't think that. I have held since 2015 when I first bought and it has risen. I think it will rise a lot more so why take profit now if it will cost me more in the longer term to buy them back? In the case of ETH I bought at an average $30 so yes I could take profit there too, but same applies. I believe ETH has a longterm future as well. It all depends on your faith. I'm not a trader and I do believe in the future of bitcoin. Obviously bitcoin cash could come forward but I now hold an equal number of those now too....! 
As it happens, I did take back my original investment.....but only to invest in shares in a bitcoin exchange company!!!!! So if bitcoin dies I still lose!! I know I am taking a risk, that's all I can say.

It doesn’t verify a named owner - that is meaningless to the system: it verifies the correct use of a private key. Possession of the private key becomes  ownership on the blockchain.

I can’t believe you haven’t told her - didn’t tell her right from the beginning. But since you are in that position now..... use some of this money to make your lives good. Buy a home - no mortgage means less stress and property is a good asset if you have chosen wisely. 
Then - your poor wife hates her job but doesn’t know she could change it? Suggest you use some of that money to retrain so that she can do something she really enjoys. You still won’t have spent half the amount even just with that expenditure and 100+ btc is plenty to hodl for the future. 
You are in your thirties - whilst saving for the future is important , you have enough already to improve your lives. Enjoying it now is important too. 
And if you don’t tell her now - when are you planning on telling her? When it’s worth 10 million, 50 million? And she finds out she has been doing a shitty job all through her thirties , and bringing up a child, and you didn’t offer her the chance to change her life? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:39:30

Bitcoin is ridiculously low and not in proportion to the others. Where on earth did they pull this from? Waste of my reading time.

No, with due respect it showed £8k on Cointelegraph Index when I looked only minutes after you posted. Perhaps you looked away or blinked. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:59:21
It is a huge deal. You describe it well and beyond that, and because of that, it could be that the unbanked will adopt bitcoin en masse ahead of developed economies. This will be yet another form of disruption - an innovatory economic model of P2P that penetrates underdeveloped economies before the mature ones. That would be really interesting....
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:10:54
It never occurred to me not to tell my financial adviser ( I am in UK - he’s great and I totally trust him). I have not actually followed his initial advice about it, for which he has since congratulated me because of course my coins have way out-performed anything else I have. He now follows bitcoin but they aren’t involved in it in his firm. He openly admits I know more about it than he does. 
In actual fact, if you don’t want to tell him you probably shouldn’t - he can’t in a sense advise you and he makes nothing from it. But if you want him to see the full picture for his best advice on some other investment - it would probably help him to know - about the funds but also about your attitude to risk. Of course you should trust him. If you can’t, ditch him and find someone else.

I’m in UK so it may be different here. A lot of retirement funds are now flexible to release a bit of cash. So maybe DCA from monthly budget on a bit by bit basis like anyone working? Just seems a shame they can’t get involved at all.

I’m 60 tomorrow and I ended up investing about 10% of my cash/investments portfolio in bitcoin and ether between 2015 and this year. All added up ( including my BCH which I haven’t sold yet ) it’s worth over £300k at today’s prices - and that’s 99 % profit as I cashed in an amount almost equal to my original investment to buy shares in a bitcoin company. I went against my financial planner’s advice in the amount I invested - but he is congratulating me now! He is not ready as a traditional financial retailer to enter the bitcoin arena - but he sees how it is coming on-stream and certainly does not give me the sour-grapes doom and gloom ‘tulip’ litany. On the contrary.  I am apparently the only one of the company’s 260 clients to have invested in cryptocurrency. I am rather proud as I think it is unusual for my age, and as op says - at my age you are meant to head towards safety. Well , something drew me to believe in bitcoin and here I am. As it is quite possible that bitcoin will one day be worth 10 times what it is today ( after many more ups and downs of course) - then maybe I will make it to being a millionairess after all!! having never got rich ( enough!) in my job - I have retired this year. So, OP, your parents may not be convinced - but you can tell them my story which looks like ending well unless there’s a huge catastrophe. And I think I’ll still be young enough to enjoy the fruits of it over the next 10 years!!  
Maybe just convince them to buy 1 btc?

Looks quite good to me. I don’t think the warning adds anything though. It makes it sound suddenly fanatical.  Stick to the facts: have a new heading such as ‘sub-brands of Bitcoin, and say in one sentence what they are and just make the point that they create some confusion but are not in fact the original bitcoin. Also, bitcoin is not ‘known’ as Bitcoin Core, it was developed by Bitcoin Core, the name of the team. 
Also worth throwing in the correct tick fro bitcoin - BTC ( always its true identifier) and BCH, BCG etc ( not sure I got that last one right, check it). Well done though in general!

Interest in crypto is not declining. There are things developing all the time - in Bitcoin alone - Schnorr, LN, Rootstock to name but a few very key technological improvements in the pipeline which will take btc up again in time. Just because the market took a hit after a massive spike and has therefore suffered a shock of confidence does not mean it’s all going to nothing now. It’s just another phase in its evolution. Do you expect it to increase at 1000% per year every year? That’s just unrealistic.

I guess your scenarios do give rise to some serious consideration about regulation. You are right about taxation. They won’t want to miss out and we don’t want them to kill bitcoin just for that. I don’t know what the answer is, but I expect we will find out soon enough.

Money not coming in right now also does not equal lack of adoption in the longer term. Read the history of bitcoin to date. It has been through a lot of ups and downs and I daresay will go through many more. This is a down period.

You must have bought recently : so be patient. It will rally and go above your buy price. I assume you are not a trader or you wouldn't be asking for coping advice! So you are in it for the long term - remember that and try and forget about it for now. One day your 2BTC will be worth x10 what you paid for them and you will be happy you bought when you did. Remember all the reasons you decided to purchase. They are still good. As long as you don't sell you have lost nothing - and have everything to gain.

I guess that if there are only 300,000 people who own at least $5000 in btc, as I read recently, then this could be accurate. I got into it in 2015 and assumed I was an early adopter!  But as you indicate, it was probably at a much earlier stage then. It's hard to say really - the market is so new and different. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:13:31
That's true, but the community has to find a way to reach consensus. Bitcoin cannot have a captain, it is counter to the whole philosophy. The governance of bitcoin is about innovation as much as the concept and technology. It is probably though as you say, it's biggest challenge. But they've managed so far......let's keep faith. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:27:45
We've had this one before. Americans could care less and UK English couldn't care less. As the American version makes no sense at all I can only assume that once upon a time a Brit said it and an American misheard it, but it stuck. That is what they say, so you just have to imagine the negative.

@_date: 2017-09-11 07:40:50
I certainly agree that they know the influence they have and this may well all just be market manipulation. With you there. Just don't agree they could practically buy up all the btc in the world! That's too extreme. Also agree that the mad ICO market is  different to the onward march of btc and that maybe they have good reason to want to curb it. I can't see them banning all activity though. They'd be missing out on too much. It's a global movement. Although price has fallen it's still holding well. They won't be scooping up that cheap. Cheap was $100! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:08:34

@_date: 2017-09-28 09:23:48
Hmm. I am sure there will be many hurdles to this yes. But at least it is starting. I have recently seen 3 examples of property - purchase and rental - made available in bitcoin - London, Dubai and can’t remember the third one. The demand to pay in bitcoin is actually driving the sellers to make this offer. If the sellers are clever they will keep their own bitcoin account and not just turn it back to fiat. So it gradually builds up its own retailing ecosystem. I might be talking rubbish �� but that’s how I see bitcoin gradually taking hold. I have a paper wallet for hodling but also a Bread wallet to practise spending with!  Always an interesting subject to debate though. We are living a fintech revolution.

Just sent donation. This was actually my first ever transaction from a btc wallet. Exciting to use btc as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:28:30
Although I still find it hard to get my head round, banks have nothing to do with the rise of bitcoin. It's a weird situation. Banks = financial management on our behalf ( good or bad) , bitcoin = complete personal control without intervention. So bitcoin means not needing banks right? But I do see a long transition period of a mix - maybe will last 30 years - where banks continue to have a role in our lives, but bitcoin exists and flourishes too. So banks really need to be going with the flow or they will just die out even sooner if they resist and take the Luddite stance. That's also why China won't ban exchanges. Sorry this is a ramble but just some thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:15:16
First: this assumes bitcoin is , or is going to be, in a bubble. Maybe this is just growth. Think the introduction and growth of the internet. 
Second: this is a sector that is so new that old models are probably not relevant. 
Third. Even if this were valid, IMO we are not even at the stage of institutional investors adopting universally: it is still piecemeal and controversial. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:10:03
Thanks. I do read widely and am always collecting new news and info sources. I find it all fascinating as such a new fast-moving sector. I suppose I do hold my own views as well by now. But like many - I get a bit freaked at the tense moment of forks etc. Maybe we have to learn to live with that though. Maybe forks are going to become part of the evolution to a greater degree as distribution and awareness get wider, more is at stake and the community is ever bigger.  It’s destabilising though... 
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:10:29

You are impatient. Give the new concept time to evolve. It won’t go overnight from store of value for hodlers to global currency . It will happen over years. Maybe - as another post I saw said - bitcoin will always remain the store of value and another cryptocurrency will become the fluid daily currency, pegged to bitcoin. The first step will be general currency digitisation - and I am sure there will be a flurry of fiat digital currencies pretty soon. But this will just be part of the whole evolution. Revolutions involving technology and process - especially on a global scale - don’t happen overnight.

A really good point. I haven't done any transacting - I have my main hodling in paper wallets, but have opened a Bread wallet and loaded it with a small amount of btc for the experience. So far so good. So I like your idea of transacting for the experience too. Unfortunately I don't have any friends who also own btc!! My plan is to buy something using btc but I am struggling to find something I want in the UK. However, I've spotted some rugs on therealrugcompany.co.uk so may purchase something soon. Better do it before price drops a lot as forecast as I bought recently..

Market confidence is growing which is why hodling is good for now. This allows bitcoin to grow up as a store of value, after which it stabilises and can move to adoption and use. Just my opinion.

@_date: 2018-03-26 12:17:56
Not really in my view. Google trends always go down when the price/value isn’t driving searches. It’s only logical. 
My point is simply that it is such a cliche’ when the price goes down/flat and people start complaining there’s ‘ no interest’. I don’t see how anyone can actually state that categorically. People are more aware - and I believe still interested -  but the price-battering has really switched people off. True they aren’t thinking of buying therefore this week - but when price does start to move again there will be a lot of primed ‘interested’ buyers ready. Back to my point about development - successful improvement drives functionality and creates newsworthy good PR etc. 
I shall just have to agree to disagree with the black and white redditors here.

It may be fine for a trained trader to trade - and maybe for him ( you) it is more profitable than hodling, and maybe less stressful ( though I doubt that since I spend most of my time lurking in r/bitcoinmarkets and they have been losing their minds and their G SOH over there for the last month). But for people who don’t know how to trade, it would be a fine way to lose money , to even try it. I am not sure why you even posted this.  It’s like saying - look, you can earn more money as a surgeon than an ambulance driver, so really everyone should be doing that. It’s nonsense. Not everyone can.

Really good comments. In fact your post comes at a moment when I am in turmoil about what action to take and looking for answers. And you are right - other people can't  give me satisfactory answers because they don't know the variables and details of my holdings. So why do I even ask!? Well, I don't have experience. I wandered into bitcoin on advice 2 years ago and it has worked out very well for me. The person who advised me - and to buy Ether early on, now advises me to sell. He wouldn't do that without good reason. Since then, I have learned a lot about what I've invested in. And my instinct to hodl is now very strong. So ..... as you rightly say ... this is all up to just me and I have to decide. I am a great believer in bitcoin's future so if I do sell I will buy back at the 'best' possible moment which may be very soon. The risk now, this morning, is - is it worth the hassle. I have missed the top profit so might as well not bother with the tax implications and sit on it. Yup...... sitting here trying to form my own opinion. But you are so right. A timely reminder.

@_date: 2018-03-26 13:45:11
That’s not what I’m saying -  and the discussion was not about ’new money’ it was about interest. IMO ‘new money’ isn’t the only market sector and so it does not only require that to get the market moving. There are former buyers who’ve cashed out into fiat since December and are biding their time; there will be alt coin holders doing that too; there are traders; there are whales. None of these people will be googling ‘bitcoin’ - but their interest is still there.  Maybe I misunderstand because I do not define ‘interest’ in terms of  entry of ‘new money’ only. It is more complex than that and there are a number of market segments at play. But I agree it’s an odd market , and reading ‘Digital Gold’ at the moment brings home just how many whales there must be who can, as you say, manipulate. 
We shall see. I have faith!
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:16:03
I agree with that (  . And further, I think that nations will produce their own digital fiat currencies in the future. It will be their solution to meeting the competition, because that is better for governments than trying to ignore digital altogether, or going the China route. Centralised digital vs decentralised. This will help the widespread adoption of bitcoin as well.

I know the whole debate isn’t neutral - I know it’s political so you have to be extremely wary reading it. But at least it puts down ( some of) the historical facts. It is really hard for a non techie, or if you’re like me only started really following things earlier on this year, to understand wtf is going on. There is so much behind it. IMO bitcoin really risks getting blown because as people start to come on board they meet with all this crap that’s going on. I learnt something from this article - but took the bias and parked it. I just want to understand what is happening so I can try and understand the outcome when it comes. I intend to do nothing: hodl and hope it’ll be ok. But maybe I’ll lose a lot of money. What do you think will happen? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:54:35
You are right as well! You know what gets me? People who say hodl are right ( if you believe in it which I do) - but so are people who say, take some profit: that is a practical suggestion after all. I can afford to lose my investment - but why not make $50k if I can. I could have made a lot more 10 days ago. I am prepared to buy back in next week if I have to and if it was a poor decision to sell I will have learned something. Thanks for support on it.

Oh well I'm not as old then - I'll be 60 in November and think I must be the oldest redditor! Sshh don't tell anyone! But fair play to her! That's brilliant that at 77 she has invested in bitcoin at all. A lot of people will be scared at the moment and a great many people will also believe what they see online. Then the price plummets and seems to reinforce it. Hell I'm nervous - but something in me just says hodl... sorry if it's too late now - but as you said you made her some money which is really nice. Here's a positive article I just saw you can show her to assure her you haven't lost your judgement : 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:54:43
The internet merely grew, it did not explode. It has become what the inventors and believers said it would. The .com bubble story refers to a great many companies that sprang up on the basis of internet technology. The internet technology did not pop: but many of the companies did. That was the result of the companies in question not succeeding. But as we know, some did - Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple. I would liken the plethora of ICOs to the .com mania and do not believe they will all survive. And, bitcoin is a currency not a stock and so will not necessarily follow any 'bubble'. 
You seem to imply ( or, the post implies and you agree) that bitcoin is in a bubble and it is inevitable that it has to pop. My opinion is that it is not in any bubble. It is a financial/commercial innovation in early growth. The laws of economics  may well apply here, but we are both entitled to assume a different stance. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:23:47

I used Bittylicious for small purchase to keep in a wallet. The purchase was quick and I made a bank transfer then moved to another wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-16 05:57:43

I have used Bitcoin Global Capital for large deposits. They are a London based broker ( not exchange) too and although they charge 5% they provide a tamper-proof hard wallet, and also excellent customer services. It has worked very well for me as I have a good relationship with the company and they have been great for reassurance through the dips!! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:31:37
Surely actual value depends on trading activity within each market?  So higher demand from one currency area means higher price there? Hence why price has presumably been dropping in China as they all have ti sell off? I'm not a trader so someone correct me if this is simplistic nonsense.

Surely we aren't far from $5000? Did you mean $50000? We may be in for a correction but will it be that deep? We only need a bullish run now and we will be back to $5k. I think what's happening is an ICO bubble, but I see bitcoin outside of that. Ok so obviously it's part of the same broader market - but personally I wouldn't touch an ICO whilst I am a bitcoin hodler. Bitcoin may correct, but I'd have thought it would bounce back by November.

It's had loads of corrections but no bubble. It's still here. Or - depends on what we are talking about. By bubble do you mean phases where it grows too fast then falls back then picks up again ? Ok, yes it has done that a lot. I think of a bubble as something which when it has popped, it's gone. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:39:20
Do you mean you are trying to work out by how much the market price will increase after you bought a bitcoin? Why? And I don’t see how you can. The market is driven by volume/demand, not a single sale? Oh well, let’s just agree I’m too thick!!! Good luck with it. Probably just a maths formula.

I am probably wrong but there are only two kinds of forks - hard fork, which relates to a change in code and therefore splits the network, and soft fork which is more about the choice made by users across the community and is therefore less brutal - sort of natural selection by consensus. 
But help me out someone! I am not a techie and have possibly got this wrong.

I’m holding mine as long as I possibly can - until I need it to buy something. I don’t get tempted when the price goes up. I just get my calculator out.

Good article, quite wordy - but it was also good to read the detailed arguments rather than sound bytes which you get elsewhere. I follow your thinking for sure. I would counter-argue that ICOs are likely to become accepted in certain countries: the UK I would think, as they are usually all for innovation. Despite the warnings from the FSA - just means regulation will have to come in. Scandinavia is pretty forward-thinking too. So longer term, I don't fear for ICOs though they are pretty bubble-like at the moment. 
As regards channels, I think that is a greater fear and you describe it clearly. But - my counter-argument would be that in the final analysis, governments want and need blockchain technology, so finally they will allow exchanges and the existence of cc. Most countries that is. The controlling ones may try to quash it for a couple of years. In the final analysis the technology will win and governments will be forced to adapt to a co-existence of fiat and cc. Banks will have to try and make themselves more attractive and thus competitive to survive and thrive. It's economics and marketing lore. 
The Tether/Bitfinex situation is scary. Well done for exposing it but let's hope that you are right about it being the least likely bubble-popper. 
Enjoyed reading your article. Thanks.

I invested quite a lot between 2015 and 2016 in bitcoin and ether. My current holding is about x5 what it was and I could currently buy a modest house with it, after taking back most of my original investment. I saw the opportunity because at the time I was studying digital marketing and disruption became a hot topic. I did it to make money - I still want that, but I also know a helluver lot more about the rationale and benefits now and am more convinced than ever. I don't think it is too late to buy into it for investment at all, and have encouraged a few friends though none have done it yet ( I am really old compared to ave age on this sub I expect!) I may still invest more - even though it's so much more than it was when I first bought in: bottom line is- crypto currencies are here to stay and I see bitcoin remaining leader provided the development teams work consistently to keep improvements ahead of the game.

I can’t tell you what the technical difference is in financial terms, but I think that the majority of the market will trade in dollars hence it is a more stable price to watch. Euros and GBP are reactive in a smaller space - maybe important to you locally if selling for good, but the benchmark level is more realistic in dollars. Does that make sense? I might just be talking crap. ��

This is quite significant I think. The quote says - ( "Ce lo chiedono i nostri clienti internazionali, tanti hanno accumulato grandi somme in bitcoin e ora le vogliono spendere"):
" our international clients are asking [to pay in bitcoin], many have accumulated large sums in bitcoin and now they want to spend them". 
This shows adoption slowly taking root, which I think is great. It is often debated on here that we should spend ( and replace) and not just hodl. This is right if bitcoin is to become a popular currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:59:28
 I think the point is, a very credible source is supporting the concept not crushing it. They are not saying bitcoin is a digital fiat....but they are talking about replacing national trad fiat with digital. IMO this is inevitable. I believe this is how the revolution will develop: countries will all individually create their own digital versions of fiat over time. Estonia are trying already. This does not replace the bitcoin ( or any altcoin) concept- it is another facet of the changes to come. People will use digital currency gradually - and when they grasp that, they will come to realise why bitcoin et al are so different. I think this is a good thing. I have been surprised that Switzerland have been so forward-thinking as I tend to think of them as traditional and institutional. But they have shown themselves to be on board with the coming changes, and this latest news reinforces their position.

I don't have computer science knowledge at all. But as an investor and a marketer - you are right about the brand awareness. Bitcoin has traction now and is 'first in market'. In a new market that counts for a lot. It has critical mass. But in the longer term - it may get taken over. But my understanding is that all the digital currencies offer something different ( or should). As a currency , which is what it was designed as, bitcoin seems to work well. And is starting to get known mainstream. It is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies.  The market is too young really for you to see an answer to your question - in 10 years time, the landscape may have shifted.

That's not fair and the wrong attitude. For cryptocurrency to grow and become mainstream, it needs mass interest and adoption. There are a lot of people out there who will struggle to ever understand the complexities of the technology - yes even at a personal admin level - but if you want cryptocurrencies to be held only by people who have full understanding then you will be severely limiting the market and that will obstruct global adoption. I'm like this guy - except I did my investing through a broker and they bought my btc and eth for me and created a hard wallet. I don't have any wallet I can spend from online , but if I did I'd be in the same situation I expect. But do I think I am too naive to be participating in this market? No of course not. I come at it from a professional marketing angle - I understand disruption trends and I believe in the future of cryptocurrency. I hope it will be btc and eth as that's what I have, but I don't know. I understand the concept and the vision, and buy into it. I don't understand the technology very well ( and I read up on the universe and market daily).  I also drive a car, but am not a mechanic. Be a bit more generous - if you are competent in the area, extend a bit of help instead of criticising. We need mass adoption to permanently embed a new technology.

My pleasure - to communicate like a normal person !!What's the point of a forum if not to help one another! I'm new to the forum - but had Bitcoin for 2 years and ethereum for 1. I  am hanging on in the belief it will all take off again. But of course that's my hope - nothing guaranteed. Good luck! You'll soon pick up all the basics and current issues.

I'm with you mate! I like your no BS honesty! I'm confused as hell too : and that's still after reading all the articles that come my way about all the forks and etc! Just hoping it all sorts out and BTC gets back on a nice upward track again. Learning to hodl stoically though..

I found this useful - I keep reading about the fork event and understand the concept but not the technical detail. But - what does BTU stand for? Assume it is the new ( potential) parallel BTC resulting from fork?
