basically for insurance to have value u need to have a direct agreement with the insurance, if not u are just trusting someone else's claims
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:12:31
but shouldn't btc implement sidechains first for it to work?
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:15:16
the issue with insurance is in the fine print really, like exclusions, etc...

put it this way: is it more likely that someone steals $100 in your wallet or $100 in a huge safe where the cost of opening it is more than $100?

you right I didn't think of the change address

it guarantees that to double spend they would have to spend a fee higher than the amount they would recover
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:38:17
it's not arbitrary, if the fee is the same as the amount sent it means that to double spend you need to put a fee that it higher than the amount you would recover.

As far as I understand there is no way for the controller to know when it's the right time to type. It may just type that stuff in a chat box.
Regarding the overflow I guess it's possible but then the same is true for your mouse, keyboard, external hard disk, etc. in that case the vulnerability should be fixed on the operating system side if discovered.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:03:17
But the mouse can be malicious :-)

How would that help? I'm not saying the mouse would stop functioning, simply that at some point it will "attempt" something.
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:21:40
are u 100% sure? it seems counterintuitive, i would assume private keys are generated from a seed + extra values and then hashed in public keys. how can you derive an additional public key from another public key without having the seed?
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:08:46
ah so the way it works is the watch only address file contains those pre-computed 1000 addresses?
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:17:12
By reading the article and thinking about it it doesn't seems as bad as it may seems at first sight. The firmware is basically the controller for the item. What it does is manage what goes through the USB port. But that doesn't means it can do crazy things. They mention 2 examples, one is sending keystrokes (basically emulating a keyboard) and altering a file during reading (makes sense, it's the controller of the data). Now if you transfer executable files then yes you may be at risk, but you would have been anyways (you can still check the hash before running it). But if for example you transfer a text file there is nothing the firmware can do. It could alter the text file of course but you can usually check if that happened or not. But it cannot infect the computer or do weird things. I will guess the weirdest thing it can do is simply emulate USB devices, that would be basically typing keystrokes and moving the mouse (but that's not so useful if you cannot see the screen to get feedback). Maybe it's possible to reprogram the firmware also of keyboards, mice, etc. but the worst-case scenario is that they would just behave in some weird way, and not for example take full control of everything just by inserting it. I am right?

But difficulty readjusts only every two weeks, if you lose half of the hashpower for those two weeks you will earn half. If if miners refuse that then the chain might die.

**If he's not willing to do even 500 he either has none left or understands that BCU is worthless.**

I'm sure if he is willing to take this trade many more people will show up willing to trade more
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:05:10
He's not completely wrong, eventually block reward would be very small and miners must be paid to secure the network. A solution could be a minimum transaction fee, anyway even with LN channels will need to be opened and closed.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:50:41
He may very well sell them, but unlikely he will crash the price. If he sells them slowly to maximize his return the price won't be affected much, if he sells them very quickly to crash the price that will come at a huge cost to him, it's like a fat finger trade, maybe you get half or even less what you could've gotten. And anyway the price recovers very quickly.
So either he sells slowly and the price is not affected or he does a fat finger trade losing most of his money and most likely the price would rebound quickly

Doesn't RSK requires segwit to work?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:30:49
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:51:46
A common view is that Satoshi failed to foresee pooled mining. On the other hand I don't believe Satoshi ever asked permission to make changes to the code. Why don't the developers simply introduce segwit in the next release maybe with an activation time of let's say six months? The change is still backward-compatible anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:12:55
I'm not saying he's doing it, but that he has a strong incentive to do so
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:04:07
Since loaded is not available I'm willing to do the same deal with 500 btc to start with. Is Roger willing to take it? I don't have a bitcointalk account so if anyone can help me with this I would be grateful. I also encourage anyone else that has a decent amount to force Roger to put his money where his mouth is.
"i am itworks123"
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:13:10
His argument works for ethereum simply because he is clearly the de-facto dictator of that coin. After all he (The foundation) seized funds and bailed out investors that invested in Dao going against the core principle "the code this law". Something of this magnitude would be similar as increasing the coin supply in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:47:46
yes it would be a problem if they go above 50%, but still if they would allow segwit at least it will show they are not trying to stop the development
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:00:42
The difficulty readjusts every two weeks. But if you have 10% of the hash rate it would take 10 times longer, so 20 weeks. You will get one block every 100 minutes. And that's if miners don't completely abandon the chain because the rewards will also be every 100 minutes. The only way for both chains to survive is to have roughly the same hash power
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:44:38
GPU mining is pretty safe
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:18:56
That's interesting, the first coin going to implement segwit may see some traction because of that
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:58:07
There is a flaw in your logic. According to your argument the miners should then have switched entirely to ETC hoping that POS would never be launched. I assume there are other factors at play.
I also wonder what they are researching regarding POS since peercoin has been doing it successfully for five years.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:10:49
Or do a leveraged short :-)
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:23:42
**Basically if ASIC manufacturers were more open to selling the products rather than mine themselves you would be completely right.**
But it seems that they have decided to mine. They knew that bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized. If they threaten that there should be consequences.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:52:58
Actually peercoin has been running on POS for almost 5 years now.

His achievements give him credibility. However credibility doesn't means the message is always good.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:02:01
This is very good, it would be great if other exchanges did it too. Now we can know before the fork how much each side of the fork would be priced.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:21:57
What exactly is good in his idea? The premise is wrong as I explain my post. Be more specific
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:44:51
The assumption was that BU would hard fork and core would remain the original chain and automatically activate segwit. your idea is good but then it must be prepared with ample advance.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:22:14
**Unfortunately the chain with the less hashing power may die because of the retargeting time**

More hashpower equal more security only if it's decentralized. Who would want to use their centralized coin?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:57:51
miners validate blocks but they don't decide the rules. If they could they would then increase the block reward. But would the community accept that? It seems there is some sort of paradox where we accept the miner's decision to maintain the status quo but we would reject their decision to alter the status quo (like increasing block reward)
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:15:15
It really seems a lot of work went into this, those guys must've spent a lot for this coordinated marketing campaign.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:15:11
Only if there are signals too strong to ignore of lack of decentralization. If they stop pushing unlimited and adopt segwit they are doing their job, why would you change POW?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:06:17
You probably didn't read what I wrote or are simply being paid to write this. The market is not just the miners. And since the retargeting is slow there is no guarantee both chains will survive unlike ethereum. By the way democracy is Fiat money. That is most people vote to tax a few people. I thought the point of bitcoin was to be libertarian and not democratic.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:42:48
Peercoin actually has made checkpoints optional since a long time
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:59:32
Sunny King, the developer of Peercoin explained years ago why PoW is fucked. You can search online to read more about it. However I don't really believe PoW is fucked, but it must be properly decentralized.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:09:47
*In the case of soft forks, however, if the fork succeeds the unforked chain does not exist. Hence, soft forks clearly institutionally favor coercion over secession, whereas hard forks have the opposite bias. My own moral views lead me to favor secession over coercion*
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:59:10
I assume most of them are just passive. They are not signaling for BU either. However if they need to upgrade they would just upgrade. Not really because of segwit, just because they will install the new version regardless of what it contains.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:26:33
seems you ran out of arguments LOL
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:02:34
I actually assume the opposite. Democracy intended as voting of hashing power is a terrible way to design the protocol. It will simply favor the interests of the ones that can vote. And only them
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:51:04
In this specific case both outcomes are coercion since the retargeting time in bitcoin won't allow the minority chain to survive unlike in ethereum. Since there is no alternative to coercion the question becomes who should coerce who?
Should a few Chinese pools coerce everyone? Or should all the exchangers, developers, wallets, payment processors coerce a few Chinese pools?
It's obvious that you are a paid shill and have no integrity. First you said that Vitalik was not claiming hard forks to be a superior moral solution then once proven wrong you simply pick something out of context to try to push your agenda.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:37:54
Medium is not twitter or his personal blog. It took time to prepare the article. Certainly not an impulse decision.

**Investing in ASIC is a huge risk. What about people that invested in GPU and got fucked by ASIC? What about people that invested in older generation ASIC and got fucked by newer generation ASIC? The point of POW is to give everyone a chance to participate. If only one guy in the world can efficiently do POW it's useless.**
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:49:52
If he doesn't respond we can forever point to this thread to prove that after all the market and all its participants strongly favor core versus unlimited and I hope that may help with the debate.
Unlike loaded I'm always online and available, so if he (or anyone else) wants to take the deal I'm here.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:57:27
That's true short-term, but then at that point everyone will know that coin is centralized. **Hashpower only has value when there is decentralization, in case of centralization you could as well have an SQL database**
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:37:23
That would be a problem
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:29:41
But still be hard fork he performed was morally questionable. He had one principle "the code is law" and went against it. He replaced it with "the foundation is law"
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:29:34
**It's about how vocal the miners are. It's acceptable that for some time there is some centralization, this has happened many times in the past but eventually some new competitor came in. It's a problem however if they use the temporary leadership to coerce the development. I would say that if they stop endorsing unlimited and quickly adopt segwit we can live with some temporary centralization expecting more competition to come in the future**
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:56:13
So when you upgrade you lose the uptime? That sucks

Credibility = Market cap (Sad but true)
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:51:51
Spend some time researching peercoin. This will not happen as being proof of stake there is no conflict of interest between holders and miners.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:24:15
It's not if it can stay decentralized
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:44:40
it may last forever, if a chain has let's say 20% then it would take 8 weeks, but that's only if miners are willing to stay on the chain for that long. Most likely they would quit and switch to the other chain so the difficulty of the smaller chain would never readjust
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:43:44
If we need to hard fork then we should change POW since we are at it. Of course the best would be no need to hard fork and no change of  POW.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:14:58
**Bitcoin works because it's decentralized**
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:25:53
That's what worries me. Why did he say those things since he knows what he talks about? How could he not mention the difference in retargeting time between ethereum and bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:19:18
And that's because ETH philosophy just like BU is "let's go fast and break things". If ETH had stuck with 10 minute blocks and two weeks retargeting the minority chain would have died immediately. However since they wanted to change things (faster blocks and faster retargeting) they now have ETC. Vitalik is a very smart guy but he is also very overconfident. That can be very dangerous.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:18:35
Exactly, so why do you accept his idea just because he has authority and you refuse my idea which I explained in detail about why he is wrong just because I have no authority?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:35:01
**Totally wrong. Segwit is about fixing a bug. Anyone can implement any layer 2 solution they want. There would probably be many implementations. All competing with each other. Decentralized.**
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:34:47
I think this is a very good point. If the best tool to mine is current technology then everyone has the same access to it. So let's say it's a GPU from AMD. Anyone can buy it and no one can get it at a lower price.

If the deal doesn't go through I will move the funds to a different address anyway in a few days
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:26:11
It's a simple logic of dependency. He is the leader of the development and more development is needed. Why would the miners go against him and take the risk to compromise the development? Because the development of ethereum is very very dependent on Vitalik/the foundation.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:54:42
much appreciated
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:56:57
is segwit the simplest solution to malleability? maybe that's the answer the public needs to understand, as if there is a simpler and cleaner solution to malleability then probably it's not right to use malleability as a way to push segwit
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:03:05
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:16:35
He had enough power to retain 90% of the hashing power while going against his core principle "the code is law"
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:52:09
I hope Vitalik realizes that
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:42:39
So why do you think he bothered to write that article about soft versus hard forks?
Do you really think he doesn't understand the difference between the retargeting time of bitcoin and ethereum?
Because if he does (and most likely he does) what he is saying is wrong. **With the retargeting time of bitcoin the minority chain would most likely not survive.**
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:03:10
I think it's important that people understand this, segwit is the best way to fix some bugs and not a hack to increase block size. Once they get this the argument segwit vs 2mb blocks will completely disappear
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:21:10
Really the big notes are already well known, those are the major exchanges, wallets and payment processors and basically all of them endorse segwit
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:45:52
**Their best interest is to ensure POW is not changed. To do that they must start selling**
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:33:59
i think the issue is that people perceive it first of all as a hack to increase blocksize without having to debate hardfork. it should be explained better that it just happen to be the simplest way to fix those bugs
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:27:25

Block Size = Cost to validate transactions yourself
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:42:25
i think they understand that long term scaling can only be done off chain, they just use 2mb (vs 1.8mb of segwit) as a way to make a hard fork vs soft fork debate claiming that hard fork is the democratic way to go and soft fork is non-democratic. however since segwit is basically a bugfix and not a block increase if this is explained clearly i think their argument drops

@_date: 2015-07-17 06:47:25
if this is real it would be amazing.
1) it would make truly decentralized exchanges possible as you can convert from any crypto into citicoin and then citibank will guarantee the USD exchange rate by acting as market maker.
2) more and more sites will accept crypto, and since the technology is the same they'll accept both BTC and citicoin
3) since citicoin is centralized and citibank can change the rules any time most people will decide to keep their savings in BTC. but still citicoin would be useful for day to day spending
@_date: 2016-09-25 18:15:08
ok but if u agree to increase now, how do u agree on how much to increase?
@_date: 2016-09-25 12:16:03
LN is one of many implementations of off-chain scaling, u can't have exponential scaling on chain anyway, to become mainstream btc needs 1k+ tps which would require 300mb+ blocks, not feasible short term.
@_date: 2016-09-25 19:13:05
how do u compromise? there are too many views, none will get a supermajority in the short term
@_date: 2016-09-25 10:12:09
i agree, but on chain scaling should happen only after off chain has been implemented so that it's easier to determine how much space is needed
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:52:40
the idea is that large fees will push adoption of off chain mechanisms like LN
@_date: 2016-09-25 06:51:31
could the client simply make the transaction in 2 steps? 1st confirm a hash of the transaction, then on next block broadcast the transaction and the network would ensure that that pubkey gets used only once for the transaction that was already confirmed as a hash?
@_date: 2016-09-25 17:15:34
LN is just one of the implementations, plus how do u know how much more will be needed until LN is deployed?
@_date: 2016-09-25 13:39:59
the argument is technical and not subjective. u can't have every node process everyone's micro transactions. the reason not to increase block size is that any reasonable increase will not allow to scale exponentially anyway, so why increase it instead of working on something that can scale exponentially?
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:53:39
yes but by then off chain transactions will be commonplace
@_date: 2016-09-25 07:12:46
if u agree that free is bad, then u must put a constraint somewhere. the easiest one is to limit block size, and invisible hand decides fee based on that. on chain scaling is not possible as in order to reduce transaction fee it'll increase storage costs for all nodes. invisible hand will decide how many transactions will be on chain and how many off chain.
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:23:19
there has to be at least 1 constraint, invisible hand won't work if there are no constraints. if u want the market to decide the block size then u have to arbitrarily decide a minimum fee.
@_date: 2016-09-25 06:58:06
on chain scaling makes no sense, and fee pressure is a must. if transactions were free someone would make a tool to store data in the blockchain, after all if it's free why not? wouldn't you just do your backup [encrypted] there?
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:25:23

Which will be used by? Everyone?
@_date: 2016-05-22 07:12:43
that's a wallet issue, people are overpaying compared to what it would  actually cost

how does 15 sec blocks scale anything?

why don't u refute the claims one by one?

LN will still make transactions to open/close channels. combine that with small blocks and fee pressure = miners can make money. if u increase block size + LN then miners will make much less. LN cannot be avoided anyway.
@_date: 2016-05-22 19:45:50
then maybe this should be implemented before block increase?

if it was unlimited it would take just 1 evil miner to inflate the blockchain

where is 5 cents a lot? [just curious]
@_date: 2016-05-21 11:09:14
it would be nice to stick this link on the home page, it basically summarizes the full debate. if fees stay low then small blocks proponents are right, if fees increase then something needs to be done [lighthing or block increase]. it would be very expensive to manipulate this metric, whereas it's very simple to spam blocks to fill them

do people keep the receipt for their coffe? important transactions should be on-chain, non important ones can be off-chain
@_date: 2016-05-21 11:18:37
at 5 cents? maybe once we reach 50 cents [i believe paypal minimum viable transaction amount]
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:23:49
thing is no one can control LN happening, whether blocks are big or small

can't one just use hash of an image as seed + password?

if the coins have been obtained with PoW during YEARS there is nothing wrong with PoS [peercoin is a good example]. if coins have been obtained with pre-mine/pre-sale then i agree with you

interesting point, if it's not fungible it's not money. gold/cash are money, but bank accounts/payments systems are not money, they are just credit
