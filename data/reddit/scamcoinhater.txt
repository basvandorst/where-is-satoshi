also : premined test coins are showing up on exchanges !
and yes this is relevant on bitcoin because the mainstream media is already of the opinion that there are a lot of cryptocurrencies equally valid , so a bit of self policing is needed . warning of scam is appropriate .

and now the scamcoin fans are trying to say their video is covered by fair use . 
no it's not. 
Fair use goes out of the window when there's a commercial product \ business interest ( paycoin \ paybase ) involved . 
your video instead is pure parody , perfectly covered !! (-:

on gaw forum they are going insane - some talk about a possible btc - paycoin joined project - some mention a possible paycoin 2.0 and some others fire up asking what will happens to paycoin !!
funny that someone from Team XPY is trying to say they used stock videos , while is clear that the Jeb Corliss video is surely stealed . that's one scam and lie after another .
