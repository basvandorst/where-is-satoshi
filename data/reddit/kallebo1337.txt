serious question: 
i wanted to send 1 satoshi, but it shows me 0,113 mBTC mining fee.
how can i send it for free?
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:24:28
worked now. hehe
*no it didnt...*
This transaction requires a higher fee, or it will not be propagated by the network
i have 193mbbtc received yesterday but cant send a satoshi because i need wait 100.000 days to send it free. stupid system...
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:12:54
electrum, no chance for 0.
how do i get a new wallet then? i wanna send out for free.... -.-
so then i transfer once all over there for 0.13mbtc and then enjoy the free shizzle. thats good idea.
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:03:43
somebody breaking into the house, kidnapping the daughter can also then rethink his idea and just go online because he could read the QR code. but yes indeed, if you don't do yourself its not *100%* safe.

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:29:36
of course it's true. you can sell 5000 BTC in a flashcrash, but good luck getting paid 200k to 1M per month due to stupid limits. most exchanges limits are ridiculous.
best is to simply buy a lamborgini with it.

@_date: 2018-01-03 05:42:03
i would love if a judge rule that they own you 1000€ worth of bitcoin from 3.5 months ago. it sucks . i can feel you. i had similar problems on a almost 6 digit€ transfer to hongkong where the sender messed up and forgot a 0 in the bankaccount in between. 18 days later then i received the money and monero skyrocket as fuck. lost 300%.... so is life. life sucks.
wish you good luck!

it's for mining in your bedroom. ok?

@_date: 2018-01-30 08:20:57
it's sillicon lottery. not every chip/gpu/miner can do 100%. those that do 95% only are in another product group.
thats why you have MSI 580s, MSI 580s Gaming X. just an example.
The T9 is defenitely more relieable.

sell is good. and then? say you have 20M$ Tether. you literally are forced to sell in darkweb for USD or OTC style to somebody else for 99% or so.
no exchange sends you a 20M$ wire with ease.

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:33:37
your statement is very invalid in such a discussion.
so you say that the limits of every exchange are fine?
need example? i deposited 35k€ to kraken via fidor bank. money arrived instant. wasn't credited. oops, only 25k$ limit per day. 
instead of crediting me 25k$ today and the rest tomorrow literally nothing happend. i begged on 7 support tickets and escalated each of them via the reddit link.
4 days later i got all credited. how embarassing.
and then, bitcoin.de
you literally have to trade your limits up. you start silver-start and can only buy 5k€ per day. if you did 25 successfull trades you become gold start and can do up to 15k per day (cant remember).
so i litetrally hat do buy 25x 150€ bitcoin worth to simply get enough trades in. **nope!** needs to be from different sellers. rofl.
then after my gold-start you need tradingvolume of 50k€ lifetime to become platinstar. now i have 75k€ withdrawal limits per day !!!!!
what a joke. i can only sell 5 bitcoin per day. 
how can you say i should buy stocks? 
i'm 6 digits down in crypto, soon it's 7. your statement is invalid.

@_date: 2018-01-14 05:58:36
i'm still waiting.
crypto/bitcoin is an embarassment. 
if you have 100M of stocks, you can sell them and the money is yours.
if you have 5M bitcoin you can withdraw over a period of a year.
if you wanna buy 100M stocks, you just do it.
if you wanna buy 10M bitcoin you can do over a period of 10 months, after you passed 3 months verification time.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:09:11
bitcoin embraces a free market with all the rogue and rascal. if it's like this, so then it is. same as BCH/Bitmain dilemma. bitcoin can swallow it.
why i can spend 100M$ on lambos with bitcoin but i'm not able to convert it to USD even tho people bought it for 100M$ with real currency... what a joke :-)

@_date: 2019-07-10 15:16:02
yes exactly. if nobody ever buys it and nobody ever sells it, there is no more market. it's dead. you need to understand how markets work.
if its something worth for you, then you would buy it. so then there is still a market

even your CPU can contribute and make a fair amount of cents per day. 
your CPU might do 70-200 H/s

@_date: 2017-12-29 05:58:30
if somebody would kidnapp you, you wouldn't have any chance at all to give them the keys?
if somebody killed your wife in front of you and your daughter is next, you really can't give them *any* keys?
i call this an ops-fail. the real alternative would be to open your Nano Ledger, type in the *wrong* passphrase to open the wallet with 3 Bitcoin on it and call it a night. i mean, they see that it's all you have and they can have it.
the same reason why you buy 100gr Fake goldbars and make them easy accessible. robbers take them and cant leave then.

@_date: 2017-12-29 04:00:49

@_date: 2017-12-27 05:25:11
the miners does via the node. ya?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:45:12
they send a flag, which version they are following. that's how the network seperates.

Bad decision Bro!
all calculators are lying to you [sic!]. Monero has a decreasing blockreward.
Please try, the onliest real monero calculator, that i programmed. demo version 
if the network only increases 10% per month you'll end up with: 
`Total mined in 720 days: 4.953 XMR `
get your money back and buy monero :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:32:01
no. i mine monero.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:16:38
you change the flag and compile, then run it. that's how you signal which version you want.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:38:05
top 50 is fine. oh wait, vergescam is top50. bitconnect aswell.
oh fuck. crypto is sick.

no, you just give me teamviewer (viewing) access and i'll look you over the shoulder while you do it and tell you what to do. easy game, no risk for you.
if we are able to recover, i hope you'll send me 10%. that's it.

this is actually a great thing. especially since it costs money and bitcoin will have a real usecase and fuel to power nodes and miners.
if it can scale, and if it could scale to a network size of whatsapp, then there is no need for any central communication ever. nobody can be censored and everybody can talk to anybody and nobody will be targeted with ads (in theory). and no more downtime, delays and blacklists.
it's really good.

what you talking? 
There was one Ethereum and a few bugs. Somehow the developers decided to be not trustworthy and reverted transactions so some early adopters can keep their money. 
the ETC chain said "nope, we dont support that"
they splitted.
who is the TRUE ethereum?
what would you say if BTC now revertes all satoshi coins and throws them somewhere else? is BTC still the real bitcoin chain or is it then BCH?

seriously: 1 BTC is more worth then 1oz of gold. so what's up here? gold will hit 10%. for sure. even 20 and 30. think now yet. think in 20 years. when some smaller countried use bitcoinstandard as currency. or 2nd currency.

haha, lol.
just see europe collapsing, see next war starting and talk about a bubble.
what's up with the stock market? alltime highs wherever you can see. because of economy or because of banks getting greedy again, print worthless money, give loans to anybody.
seriously, crypto takes over.
we are faaaaaar away from mass-adoption. we dont even have mass-knowing. we are a bunch of nerds. imagine my dad and mom will use bitcoin in 10 years. at 100k$ each. the world will use it. people will murder for bitcoin.

**for everybody else future**
use [Keepass]( and create a container that is encrypted. Yes, keepass is legit and safe.
Write down your Seed of your wallet and any other informations and save it in keepass. If you feel not safe, then change the words in a way that only you know. (flop 5th and 7th for example)
Put that file into your Dropbox. If you feel that is unsafe, use Boxcryptor to actually encrypto your Dropbox.
in case shit goes wrong, just go into your cloud, get the file. don't forget the password and youre good.
if you update the keepass file, it automatically syncs with the cloud.

5700 where?
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:36:22
well, that's not really difficult. ruby on rails would be way enough to capture bitcoin payments for something and have a solid test driven construction around it. 
basically any solid webdeveloper can do that. 
you might run your own node tho and if somebody understands bitcoin and has experience, it's of course a great benefit. there are so many gems out there or other *plugins* for easy bitcoin integrations

i really hope, BTC is crashing to death, lets say 50$, 150$ whatever. bubble-pop please. tons of mining-farms will run on a massive -eV. 
all these miners, who run on free electricity (like i do) are then getting a big boost for the lowered difficulty. wohoo. i can't wait for it!
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:31:34
but i mined some, worth 15,000$ and made a profit of say 8,000$. this profits  now worth 3500$. fml
@_date: 2018-06-20 08:35:57
they use a javascript miner which isn't the most powerful but it generates hashes. then they mine CPU minable coins, like monero.
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:54:02
either the numbers are random or the numbers are produced on purpose. to produce them on purpose you need as much hashingpower that wasn't available back in the days.
maens, in the future you just make those numbers in a second, travel back in time and bring them in.
pure nonsense. 
whatever random data u have, u always find weired patterns.
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:26:53
this is actually true
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:23:23


it's literally calling the bitcoinb RPC
doing 
`getnewaddress ""` 
   
vs 
`getnewaddress "", "bech32"`
this would have had fixed it all. yes, only adding 7 characters and the problem is solved. i'm not kidding!

With bitcoin it costs 0,17$ and with credit card somewhere between 100 and 170$. And of its foreign currency it’s easy a hundred bucks more .

Yes that’s literally all. You used the upgraded protocol with using the new addresses 
Legacy, p2sh-segwit or bech32
Bech32 is 191 bytes to size  (iirc). 
Your  TX fee goes down if you use those ones.
I’ve implemented it myself last week. It’s no rocket science
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:37:35
yes it is worth it. 
first of all, you take down your hashpower of BTC and you absolutely FUCK UP those shitchains. they are so fucked up, that everybody instantly drops support and acceptance. they are just fucking dead. with the power you bring and the low diff, you can re-org the chain in such a quick way, it's insane. 
week later, after BCH and SV are on the graveyard, you go back to bitcoin and enjoy the lower difficulty, crushing a few blocks and go on with life.
also, you sold all your shitcoins before you attack them. even more profitz ever.

and this is exactly the point of bitcoin. if \*everybody\* accepts it, you can spend it. and those who accepted it, spend it again aswell for their wholeseller. and the spends it for the manufactur. and he pays his wages with bitcoin. and they spend their salary in the grocery with bitcoin....

Yes, it takes an engineer to write this feature, commit it to the source code control (git) and deploy it 
On the other side: you also need to write some tests to ensure all is working. So that’s another 5
Minutes. I’m not kidding you. That’s a 10 minute task.

@_date: 2016-12-26 10:26:40
please explain. with my calculations that's impossible, but maybe i have a mistake in my math. for roughly 1k$ i get 6.5TH/s, which currently somehow is ~0.16 BTC per month (0.0052 per day). 
if we have that ~300 (300k$) we can come up to 48 BTC per month. that's very far away from your 150-180 per month. not including any setup cost (heat, powerlines, etc) and any electricity costs.

you *can't*
in theory every block should occur every 600.0 seconds.
if they do 50% faster (every 300 seconds) the difficulty will raise 100% so it's leveled out again. this diff-adjustment is happening every 2016 blocks (you can do the math how many days are that)
the exact algo behind  youll find here: 
you can use these *live stats* for some calculations. 
running your own node might help. the difficulty is store inside the blocks. you can then calculate if n-blocks fit the difficultyu ad if not, what would it be

I'm currently in charge of building a cryptocurrency broker for Fiat
We have a lot of security features. It's up to the user which one he want's to use and activate.
* 2Fa for Login
* A different 2FA for Withdrawals
* IP Whitelisting for the login
* Single session login
* Auto logout
* Confirmation to add new withdrawal addresses (by e-mail)
* Withdrawals need to be confirmed by mail, by 2FA or both
* Withdrawals can be delayed by default if you chose so
* Vault feature, withdrawals only approved if confirmed on multiple emailaddresses
* Anti Phishing Secret (we include a secret word of your choice in all emails, so you can ensure it's from us)
* We encrypt emails with your Publickey if you chose so
* Every e-mail contains a lockdown link to instantly shutdown your account
* Never reset your password. We won't send a reset-password link if you activate that feature
* **Global Setting Lock (GSL)**  Lock all Security/Setting relating things in your account. They won't be accessible or changeable. If you enable the lock, you chose a time that keeps your account protected in case you disable the lock. (If  hacker thinks he can just disable all your security stuff by disabling this feature, nope - he has to wait X hours (24 - 720))
We don't have:
* anything related with SMS or your phone number
I had discussions with management about the SMS stuff and i told them there is no way i'm in charge for anything technical if they want SMS related things. I showed them this article  [  and the problem was solved.

This is true. I’m in the open source exchange community and what’s going on there is just horrible 
Financial weak people from around the world joining discord and GitHub, hoping for a plug and play solution so they can get rich now. Asking people to fix something and offer 50$ for a task.  They can’t fix or improve things because they’re no developer. They literally don’t know what they are doing. Yet they want to run an exchange, driven by the hope to earn easy money 
With a fiat gateway things are different. People need companies, licenses, banks, compliance,
Lawyers. This all cost money. A lot. It you don’t know what you are doing you won’t do this business
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:22:32
 course it's great to have 10,000 customer BTC in our cold storage and play bank for them, but that's not what i want. i want them to understand what crypto means and for that reason i want them to put their crypto into their own pockets (and lets us charge 2$ for the withdrawal)
i'm very passionated about it and my real motivation isn't money. i'm driven by the idea to have an impact. to change the world into a better direction. ironically to this thread, two hours ago i've applied to an open position at coinbase as an engineer and my cover letter included (i quote):
*Everyday i give my best to bring crypto to the masses, educate people about
crypto and to make it easier for everybody to use Bitcoin or other relevant cryptocurrencies. I'm not in for the
"moon" or the money - i do it for the opportunity to impact the world with positive changes.*

generally speaking: not price effective good for mining
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:22:20
This is not really accurate.
- The current Blockreward is 12.5 BTC
- Bitcoin started with 50 BTC reward, and halved every 210k blocks (
- The Transaction Fee of the Block will also be paid out
- A new Output without inputs will be formed from BR + TXFees
- Not the miner get's the reward but the one who relayed the Block.
- If a Miner is operating in single-mode or pool-mode (connected with other ones) won't change who gets paid. The Output goes to the destination where the block relayed.
- If a Pool mined the Block, it's up to the pool what they do. 1 year ago TX Fees been low and pools kept them for theirself + 1% pool-fee. This changed since TX Fees are high and pools attracted miners with paying out 50-100% TX fees (which was at some points +5-15% more income for miners!)
Example block for you to inspect


Hashpower itself doesn't matter in mining. What matters are submitted and valid shares. You can have shitload of Hashingpower but if you submit your shares too late because of a 400ms latency to the relay/pool your shares turn into stale and you never even get a satoshi.
There are also different payout methods. PPS (Pay per share), you simply get paid per share regardless of the block finds something or not. Best for you! Other methods are to look who worked how much for a certain found block and distribute reward among those miners based on their share-contribution. If it took 20 hours to mine a block, everybody gets reward. Often you find PPLNS (pay per last n shares). Say in 20 hours the pool finds a block, only the last 2 hours of work get rewarded. this prevents pool-hopping. if you would have mined the first 18 hours of the block but not the last 2 that counts, you'll get 0 reward.

very easy (and little bit wrong)
- you send BTC to the public key. everybody can see what's on there. 
- a public key holds `inputs` and `outputs`. the balance is `input - output`
- the privatekey can spend the coins (the unspend inputs) from the public key.

Yes, at around 120 left
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:30:33
with free electricity you're going to do the following
- 10k$ with BTC rate now gives you 1.3 BTC (i made that up)
- 10k$ with $average buying strategy gives you 1.05 - 1.5 BTC (through next 5 weeks as example)
- 10k$ gives you 16x Vega56 rig action that equals to roughly 30 kh/s XMR mining. 
- with nicehash (look and understand what it is) *currently* you'll do 0.00937 BTC a day with that hashrate. it will fluctuate between 0.005 and 0.013. 
- do your math

seriously. if somebody hacks them and steal all the coins, coinbase goes belly up and you have nothing. dont tell me "but they own me". you go on court, you end up same as with mt.gox.

If they have 30,000,000 they would pay it 
The problem is that most exchanges keep profits in btc for moon speculations and get double rent when the price drops. It’s still wants 30m but their assets are maybe worth only 10m, but it’s a money printing machine. Either call insolvency or get hacked and then go on from there

- 15.000.000 coins * 6.800$ = 102.000.000.000$ market-cap

- 2.200.000.000 / 102.000.000.000 * 100

@_date: 2018-03-16 05:08:29
absolutely. you just have to work harder to pay it back. 
and yes, loan 21M BTC at 5% IS working. in fact, if you have all, then you buy something and spend all, so the people have to create value to the world in order to trade with each other and to pay you back. at the end, some people will fail and won't be able to  pay you back (5% of the loans will burst, obviously).

even i know that this is bullshit. OP, you're dumb. if not, then you're a retarded fud-spreading dude without a clue.
let me explain you quick ELI5
the CME Futures are a contract, like a bet on the bitcoin price. either up or down. whoever wins the bet, will pay the other side what he lost IN FIATQ




there is no fucking bitcoin involved in future trading. especially does 1 Future Contrad **NOT** equals a bitcoin. are you nutz?

ae you kidding me?
if i create a github project, this is the source. period.
you then can *fork* it. YOU are running the fork. you change something.
you can merge it back into the primary thing, but how can source become a fork? lol

@_date: 2018-11-10 13:28:40
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:36:17
If this is really your work ethic, then please don't do anything cryptorelated.  The wheel is already invented for crypto.
XMR is a very tricky coin and wallets just came 1-2 weeks ago and we need more, way more, to support this beautiful coin. At the end of the cryptoworld, BTC, LTC, ETH and XMR will survive. If any of these fail, so did crypto at all fail and we are dead. Giving your love for Monero is a very very good way to get involved into the cryptoworld.

1 + 12^2048.
feels pretty save.
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:26:15
it's just a random thing.
i did read exactly this sentence and can't translate it into any sourcecode. maybe it's a language barrier or fact i didnt study math. 
in monero it's pretty easy done, just make a CRC from the first 3 characters of the 24 words, modulo 24 and that's your index. 
    check = seed.collect{|word| word[0..2]}.join
    crc = Zlib::crc32(check) % 24
    seed &lt;&lt; seed[crc]
i can't find code for Bitcoin, but i assume it can't be that difficult either
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:45:49
i will never sell them because i'm a greedy cunt

[conspiracy] Us Govt. forced bittrex to close middle-eastern accounts with hilarious reasons (terrorism funding etc.). They are forced to legally not answer any support tickets.

give him 1 BTC, he needs to return 1.05 BTC.
means, he needs to work 5% more to pay you back. what's up?

@_date: 2018-03-10 13:57:24
if you have 15.000 BTC, which then is just a shy 150M$, you're not that big tho, but you don't care so much about price. 
however, you simpy have no money to buy. all money is bitcoin.

i think, all the exchanges like coinbase, bittrex, kraken should provide some emergency-stuff.
something like a unique-number to lockdown the account.
either via telephone or via something else.
something you'll get presented at signup. something that can't be changed.
if you go on ermergency.coinbase.com and type-in that code, immediately the account gets *locked-down*. then you can sort out with the support within the next 3 days. no problem.
even tho you might have a bad feeling it was a fishing site, 2 minutes later you might lockdown and safe all your shit.
lets everybody vote for it!
 i am very very sorry to hear this storry. i hope you still go on with wealth in your life and you can somehow get back into bitcoin soon. it sounds nasty, but in future please have a hardware wallet and simply save your coins there.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:58:36
because every time 12.5 BTC-C are rewarded which people instantly sell for cheapest rate to get rid of it and make maximum profit.

@_date: 2017-10-31 15:25:32
everybody feel free to downvote me.
and this is **exactly** the reason, why bitcoin will fail in it's design as beeing a currency.
what exactly is this post about. that you profited in GBP? cool! good for you. and now exactly what? you sell you bitcoin and buy a new tshirt with it, instead of buying the tshirt with bitcoin. congratulations.
how exactly is bitcoin a currency if people (not you) see it as a *i make profits* thing?
i have 6 digits in crypto. but somehow, all the people that get new into, they simply wanna ride the wave and gain profits. people who cant even explain the rough concept of bitcoin to me wanna invest deeeeeep, because get rich quick or whatever. 
seriously. it's annoying as fuck and eventually will break bitcoins neck.
if my mom asks me one day, how to buy bitcoin, it's time for me to sell off, cuz then we seriously have a bubble.
*rant over*

@_date: 2017-10-15 00:49:42
if bitcoin doesnt hit 10.000$ next year, nobody can mine profitable. with even more hashrate that's coming, and block-halving in future, bitcoin NEEEEEDS to be 40.000$ in 3 years, otherwise seriously nobody can/will mine it on a huge loss.
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:00:14
Monero would have had fixed those problem before it occurs. Monero has a private Blockchain. You can't see the balance of people, hence you don't even know who sends you money.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:14:46

@_date: 2017-10-03 08:54:06
Monero Blockchain is *hidden* means you don't see how much was transacted.. additional it is using *stealth-addresses* which means, you can't trace who sends who anything.
monero is very unique and the most private coin.

check your nicehash account. you'll get credits there.
to withdraw you'll need to mine like 100 days because withdrawal fee is 0.25% or 0.0005 BTC
also, you're better off mining ZEC. 
nvidia and cryptonight isnt good. you will have 50% mehr income if you go ZEC compared to XMR.
best idea is to mine directly to bittrex account via nanopool for example, set the treshold to 1.0 ZEC and whenever you wanna cashout your earnings, like once a month , just lower your treshold and boom, have ZEC @ bittrex.then convert into whatever you want. good luck

@_date: 2017-10-10 04:58:39
they will for sure mine BTC. very sure. otherwise they are belly up.
they propably won't pay out for 2-3 days so they can save up some BTCX2 to dump and pay out missing customer payouts. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:35:22
so they spend 2.000.000.000 $ just to keep BTC high? lulz

i won't spend my BTC to buy a trezor. period. also amazon doesnt do BTC yet.

That’s what you think! And it’s bullshit. 
Open source is bigger then ever: bitcoin takes over the biggest industry that we have: financial. 
Even Microsoft open sourced dot.net and the world fixed the shit for them. 
The incentive is coming from the usecase of the benefit for the world. 
I might just have different visions. I’m all into capitalism. I really am. But I’m also into freedom for the world. If you had a great idea: super! Benefit from it now. But there is no need to hold 20 years a fucking led light as a patent which won’t be used then anyways. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:21:22

you tell me
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:36:42
so 100$ from 100 years ago is now 5$ worth. mkay. 
so we need 2000$ current equivalent? here ya go!
- 100$ from 100 years ago with 1% interest is now 270$ worth. 
- 100$ from 100 years ago with 2% interest is now 724$ worth. 
- 100$ from 100 years ago with 3% interest is now 1,921$ worth. 
- 100$ from 100 years ago with 4% interest is now 5,050$ worth. 
- 100$ from 100 years ago with 5% interest is now 13,150$ worth. 
1oz of gold was 20.67$ in 1917.  so your 100$ might yield 5 ounces which is now 5,750$
weak statement.

the address they give me is to receive (!). if i buy BTC they just say i have 1.0 BTC. it's like paypal who tells ya you have money but you dont. 
after you withdrawed you get the money.

you can select.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:26:40
few believers int he fork or stupid daytraders will give you their high valued BTC for your shit valued forked-crap-coin (FCC). They loose.
The miners who should have had stayed with BTC will make less income. those that they generate, they instant dump for the real BTC. they loose aswell.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:26:28
then use bitfinex and not bittrex? use monero and not bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:15:25
refund complicated? mmmh. why?.
the item is worth 100$, so you'll pay with bitcoin. you return it so you'll receive 100$ worth of bitcoin.
- issue i see: 
you buy something for 100$ that you anyways wanna have. 2 weeks later BTC worth 50$, so you'll return item get double amount of bitcoin and buy the item with FIAT.

@_date: 2019-09-29 15:41:30
i wonder: 
bitcoin always tries to be as backwards compatible as possible. so that will mean we need a softfork where we enable new quantum resistant address generation. however, what are we doing if somebody can easy generate the genesis block key pair and spend satoshis coins to a new created address?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:19:14

We are currently working on a bitcoin broker and I’ve implemented a feature called emergencypassword. 
If someone forces you to login - just use your emergency password. 
You can choose that either you account gets blocked, all withdrawals will never be send out or we rescue 98% of your balance. So if you have 10 BTC on your account and use your emergency password there is only 0.2 BTC left that your attacker can have 
I don’t know if it’s a good idea or not but we came
Up with this concept. It’s just an additional layer of security. Hopefully it will Be useful for somebody in the future

the last coinbase TX will be worth 0.00_000_001 BTC or 1 satoshi.
the last 100,000 blocks are worth 0,00_100_000 BTC total.
yet those last 100,000 blocks only take 1 million minutes. 
the whole network, containing 20,999,999.998xxxxx Bitcoin is older then 1,000,000 minutes.
makes your statement invalid. 
do 210000 blocks for better math. before those with 2 sats. so it's 420000 blocks for 3 sats 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:50:04
so, i could simply send 10,000 0.7 satoshis and then have 10,000 satoshis?
ezy gain of +3000 sats.
whos paying for it? does it cover the fee? :D

mining on a medium size scale is a fulltime job that turns headache. if a miner/rig won't hash, you're not making money. it can turn into a nightmare if you jump in too big. 
on a big scale it's a company operation as a single guy can't handle that shit.
don't forget the huge infrastructure costs to get that shit running. power and heat needs to be planned.
if you wanna drop 10k$ into mining for teh lulz, do it. i still tell ya: buy XMR ;)

This ama is a farce . I have nothing against the guy and or mt gox and I didn’t loose anything 
Reading the comments here is breaking my heart. People lost money and all are asking the same question which isn’t answered and the real questions won’t be answered
Even if people can claim many people weren’t able to do so, and they’ll still sit on a loss. Easiest way would be to make a diff of claims and balances and refund those that missed the claim at least in half, the remeinaing btc distribute to everybody fair share 
If this won’t happen you’re a real fraustar and most likely end up being shot. I think you’re smart enough knowing if you get rich out of this dilemma you’re a dead men and somebody will eventually do it. 
I believe the real intention if you distribute the coins is simply to stay alive 
I wish you personally good luck in life and hope everything turns out good for you and family 
I hope everybody gets bitcoins back and they can have a peaceful life

i hate people who act like a judge and write things that are not proven yet. i was sitting in custody for 10 months and the press wrote shit as fuck, while at the end i got out on a plea deal for total different things and just 3% of what the press wrote.
let's just wait till his trial is over. apparently it's disgusting that the US can run through the world and arrest people who never even stepped with a foot into their country. It's also disgusting that they now really want to extradite him to put him on trial and then keep him 25 years in a jail in the US. 
whatever he did, it's not US business. if you think it's okay the US become world police, then i hope you never do something wrong in another country, which the US doesn't like.
at the end: he is not sentenced yet, he didn't even had a trial and never spoke or defend himself. everybody has a right to do so before we should start judging people. 
free speech does not imply to say: **he is guilty, he did this and this....**. Free speech just gives humanity the right to say what they want and think.
of course you are allowed to say that you think he did it. but then write it this way rather then acting like it's a fact.

so the solidity is creating a private key inside, and then the coins get transferred to its public key? otherwise rule  applies *you don't own the coins if you don't own the private key*
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:54:10
not really. there is a huge difference vs the stock market where the money actually went in.
how much money did indeed jump into the BTC market?
example. 1MIO coins out there. 1 guys sells 10k for 1$. MarketCap is 100$.
another guy bids 1000$ for 50 piece. so he buys 20$ each and the marketcap is 20M$. but in total only 1.001$ went into the whole market.
maybe i'm wrong, explain plox
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:27:38
asia 3k$+
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:24:16
ah, it says 32M$  i read 32M coins. so, then it's a short of 20M coins...

@_date: 2017-07-28 03:51:03
yes, most likely as otherwise you mine more +eV on the other chain and trade back into the other chain.
but that wasn't the question. my question was more like: will they have 25%? 50%?
i think the price will adapt onto the hashrate, not the otherway as they literally gamble with it. if they bring huge hashingpower over to fork it, and the value drops to 5$, well, then RIP jihan.
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:57:11
from 100 TH/s to 300 TH/s is easiser then from 300 to 900 which is easier then from 900 to 2700 ;)

just wait for it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:44:01
that is not true. pls math it out.


now you can argue *if BTC drops he has less $*. that argument is invalid as we invest to have BTC. easy math.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:06:10
or they don't have the coins, that's why they can't give you the BCH?
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:37:47
well, before BTC got 1$ value think about how many coins were already there. how many BTC never ever got traded? alot. everything gets hodlled. 
those BTC that got into trade actually make up the marketcap. i don't have stats, but i estimate that maybe 10-20% of all BTC are actually "traded" and make up the price. if the famous pizza-deal never happened, they would still be worth 0$. 
if nobody sells, and then i sell for 2.000$ - the price indeed is 2000$. and just because one coin got traded for 2k$, the whole market-cap is raising up a shitload. yes, that's true.
but what i wanted to say is, that not 30billion US$ actually made its way INTO the market.

just think about it. maybe they just keep us in secure strategy and then take over. however... i dont think that they wanna risk billions of money with this fork. they must have a shady dirty plan.
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:49:07
if you have 300k over, i would buy 250x S9. exactly right now. with 1099$ each net and free electricity, you're good damn goood !!!!! each will still make &gt;1 BTC in 1 year, so then you have 250 BTC. right now for 300k$ youre far away from buying 250 BTC.

ya, all the evil banks. even though most of them are greeedy, the swiss banking system indeed has lots of trust, from all citizens around the world (many rich people like to keep money there).
it's actually a nice thing that you now can deposit BTC in your bank - or better think about this: you can exchange FIAT/BTC at a bank. how good is this ??? monthly retirement plan based on BTC (and then withdrawal the BTC for sure), but hey, it's such a nice thing to gain awareness

@_date: 2017-06-10 02:28:39
FAR AWAY FROM BEEING A SCAM
you have to pay for electricity and as long your income covers those cost you are running. calculate BTC$/Difficulty calculated with your share and turn it into daily earnings for the last 180 days. yes, you do only 50% of starting BTC, but moneywise you do the same. 
calling it a scam is stupid, as genesis is one of the onliest serious players.
the most scammers are taking your money, pay you out with that money, every day, and one day it stopps. they won't buy hardware or anything else.

the blame is to put on exchanges who offer this option. i find it unacceptable. i'm a software developer myself and it's beyond ludicrous to develop this option. you're aware that people, who have no clue about security, can have there 10 mio USD, you as an exchange need to take precautions to protect your clients. 
kraken doesn't offer this shit, yet kraken is called the most secure exchange.

exactly. you pretty much hope that they give you the bitcoin that your account is listing. imagine they follow a chain and that chain turns into 1$ per coin. the whole company is instantly belly up. you won't even receive your 1$ coin anymore.

somebody greedy
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:55:59
i wrote this a couple of times in the past: i think BTC as a *currency* failed, because of greed.  is the key. back in the days everybody promoted bitcoinwith *just buy and spend them*. nobody is doing that anymore. nobody buys BTC to spend them. everybody only buys to hope to make profits. sorry, but currency thing is gone. it's just a big asset, bigger then gold. that's it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:17:27
yeah, they just dump it by theirself :]
i would do so.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:16:02
they literally scam everybody for their BCC. pure scam.
coinboise gains access to ALL the BCC. just let BCC be valued at 220$ and they have 100.000 * 200$ = 20 Million$ for free.

who gives a shit about that as a miner? in fact our farm is protected anyways, we run our own firewall and only a few requests can go out and in.  antbleed is easy to fix.
yes, i know what you mean, but at the end its about $$$ so we will order 200x S9 and 100x L3 more.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:32:02
explain how we can loose money if the miners are free :D 
think about 2ct per kw/h and how much the creation of 1 BTC does us cost.

sell off.
i believe they have S11 coming
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:35:30
we have 80%+ of our S9 on slush.... 
i wish the TX fees will be 10ct, i recently used LTC to pay 6k$ because using that from a mining address would have cost propably 120$ fees O.o
and yes, BTC failed. nobody buys things (due high fee, due gree, whatever). LTC is imho the *real* currency behind bitcoins technology. BTC is just the pure gold asset.

he's proving a lot right now.... /s
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:02:22
it's simple. i will also shareout some hashingpower of my next 250x gpu farm.  the whole farm cost something like close to 100k$.
i offer some friends for 10k$ something that is worth 10k$ in hardware and then they get ~65-70% of that hashrate, while i still pay electricity, the whole thing capped for 2 years. for them its a good deal, for me its a good deal.
before people come with blabla: this particular friend simply can't mine at home, as he is a digital nomad and travels around. same goes for 1-2 other guys. 
why i do this? i actually can afford the whole farm myself, but sharing risks is always a good thing. at the end, i still own the hardware, i make lots of profits, they also make good profit and i have then 20 or 30k$ already back for the next farm and can already start with locationing setup.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:15:44
i understand your point. i dont like bitmains actions too much. what can we do? stop mining?
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:05:15
so why can people say it's a scam? what's your daily income currently? you pay 6$ for electricity a day?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:33:13
yeah, antminer is 30% cheaper for $/THs. what's competitive here? if they would be 50% of Antminer power consumption - ok. but right now they are more expensive then ants.
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:58:30

this. 
in what timespan did you do?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:02:34
the real question: we are close to order 200 new units from bitmain. why whould we use you? what's the pricing? what's our security that those miners are stable, rather then pandas?
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:01:29
no it would NOT be more efficient to buy the BTC.
tkae the offer with 2800$ for 100 MH/s for ETH, go 1 month back. you either buy 20 ETH or you mine and will have more then 20 in 2 years (yes, pos coming, i know)
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:59:04
you send the BTC and then an email - and you expect to get an email back with the encryption keys.
the email adress was locked/blocked/shutdown by the (german) emailprovider / or goverment/police
even if the attacker is honest and wanted to give you the keys after you paid, you'll never get'em
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:09:55
ya, hope he enjoys a good life
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:59:14
numbers please
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:52:10
exactly that is NOT true. they charge you 11$ a day.
lets say fancy numbers 
-  you ear 0.1 BTC a day at a rate of 100$ = 10$ a day.
- they charge you 5$ a day for maintenance.
- difficulty increases, you only make 0.05 BTC anymore. the price now is 200$. you still make 10$ a day and can pay for the 5$ maintenance.
- 1 year later price is 500$ and you only make 0.02 BTC a day. you still make 10$ and can py for the maintenance.
yes, this is actually what is currently happening. maybe it changs in future. as long the price raises while the difficulty raises,you still earn the same - $wise
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:57:52
what hashrate did you buy? when did you buy? how did it end?

thanks for letting us know. great. 
we already have that much profit that those miners are pretty much bought *for free*. 
maybe bitcoin is going to explode because it doesnt scale. who knows. maybe it fails. maybe 10$ and then a comeback and we get really rich because we bought 80k coins for 10$. who knows the future. 
and the L3+ miners? paid off after propably 2 months, if bad difficulty 2.5 months. then can get crazy for the next 2 years. thanks for the cheese. propably mined 50k LTC in those 2 years. lets see LTC at 200$ one day. again, thanks for the cheese.

free/cheap electricity: yes. otherwise: marginal
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:35:18
not really true and just stereotype thinking apparently. you guys forget that the CM-companies do own the hardware. you know why we GPU Miners are getting so rich? not because of the coins (well, yes because of that) but especially since the hardware is 100% paid off in less 6 months....
genesis has over 20k GPUs.... hanneluja

in the first days i got payment everyday via bitmain. then via slush. then i realised, if i ever move those BTC, it will be a huge TX. now i get only 0.25 BTC payments to the wallet. whatever. i just had LTC in my wallet so i paid for new L3+ miners with LTC. Give out 2010 LTC and then in 6 mnths have way more then 2010 LTC ;)
