I wish it would be fixed, would be so much easier.

The new FAQ says more like 1.5MB
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:57:46
"According to some calculations performed by Anthony Towns, a block filled with standard single-signature P2PKH transactions would be about 1.6MB"

As I came into bitcoin it was this 7tps network, but it was promised that it is only a temporary DOS protection and will be lifted soon.
Today it turns out to be more like 3.5 tps and those in power have no incentive/a other vision to update.
Wish I would not have fallen for the lie, so much wasted time and money.
@_date: 2015-06-22 06:15:29
So requiring cheap power is Ok, but requiring good network connection is evil? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:11:16
Ups, sorry, was the wrong thread.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:11:33
starts sounding like :-)  
1 doge = 1 doge
1 bit = 1 bit

ING in Germany gives you this.  
No Fee for the account.  
Free VISA.  
Free cash from any ATM (national/international). - only the cheep  currency conversion. 
  
I never paid them anything!

Isn't this drawbacks of two worlds?
You give up control over your private key, trust a mergent device and the stripe is easily copied?  
In conjuction you have to own bitcoins with buy/sale spread and volatility.  
  
As good as it sound a first sight, but this wont work.    
  
Correct solution: The device must keep the private key locked inside and only sign the transaction transmitted from the pos. Do this in credit card format with NFC and a display on the device to see what you sign for extra credit. :-)

Bought a Ledger Wallet (for BTC), was not a "official" deal, but had a 30% discount code for Black Friday

Perfect! This essentially might become Trezor/BitSafe for 25 dollar.

I think it's helpful crowd here :-)

For me it's 0.5% on BitStamp an SEPA is free. Can't get better soon.
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:42:16
Yubikey NEO could do it (contains a java vm).
It could sign transaction over usb / nfc.
There is even an project for it 
The only remaining problem is that there is no screen to make sure, what transaktion you are signing.
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:55:21
Kraken trades Euro, Fee &lt;0.2%  
So total Fee would be    
1%(Coinbase $-&gt;XBT)  
+0.2%(Kraken XBT-&gt;€)  
+XBT Buy/Sell Spread  
   
Kraken will SEPA you the money in 24-48h for free.  
What is the Fee to get $ to Coinbase?

 looks way more complete compared to the one from blockchain.info

As said before, give the Trezor a NFV/BLE interface a everything should work.  
It should then even be possible to pay with trezor on POS Terminals.

Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. is pretty good, they are using bitpay:  
   
  
Click on "Bitcoin spenden" to go to bitpay

Here we go:  
BitX is initially establishing operations in 12 countries: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Namibia, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, South Africa and Turkey.

Together coinbase and bitpay may process the volume of new coins on a given day.

I send Via SEPA money to kraken at 460$, was there 4 h later.
BUT  took several emails and days before I could buy bitcoin well over 500$, support was not very fast or helpful.

"multisig-based instant confirmation" is really brilliant, it could solve the problem of buying at brick and mortar stores.  
But there must be a "List" of "Trusted" signers (should not only work with GreenAddress).  
Q: How to bootstrap this trust for new parties?  
A: Only already trusted members of the community could offer this function.  
Q: What if a once trusted party turns against the system?
A: There need to be automatic analyses of the network which flag those parties must automatically removed from the list of trusted signers.  
Q: Do we need a central instance to build the list of trusted signer?  
A: I don't know...

I liked that part, gives personal touch

For some reason, people hate bitcoin at heart.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:51:04
I think the problem is that the block reward is to high, so a reasonable priced transaction has no additional value to the miner.
We might be doomed by to high block rewards. With lower block rewards, there might be less people mining, but those will try to bring real value to the network by including as many as possible transactions.
Mabay bitcoin will be killed by that. Block rewards are not bound to the value of bitcoin but transaction fees are.

Give the trezor a qr code reader/BLE/NFC interface.  
Trezor should read the transaction from the POS terminal, sign it and send it either over NFC back to the POS terminal or via BLE and a mobile directly to the network.
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:04:26
Here, should work with mobiles too.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:04:06
Sorry, that's not how crypto currencies work.
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:56:40
Should work on mobile (NFC) and desktop (USB like Yubikey)
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:38:14
I can't think of a possibility, where you control the Hashing-Power and at the same time it decentralized. It's a conundrum at best/paradox at worst.  
The only way would be to give up physical access to the miners  (or sell the miners), transfer them physically to a different location, where someone else controls them.
You hurting bitcoin more than you can imagine (for months now). I'm bitcoiner at heart but because of the overwhelming control of you,  bitcoin might be doomed and I might pull back.

Nice post.
Open an account with kraken for it. I'm already verified.

If the community can't hardfork today we could stop using bitcoin now and look for the better suited alt coin. If bitcoin can't fork-update it has no value.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:55:00
Just think about it, maybe you don't have the full picture

I'm in since 2012 and for the first time since, it does feel so. This sub is dieing, only dubious news, devs holding back. It feels like the endgame and the once very clear future is only blurry at best.

Would be cool to use this to secure transactions from mobile/desktop/hybrid wallets

This should be much more prominent.
