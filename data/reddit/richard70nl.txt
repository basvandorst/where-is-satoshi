My condolences and best of luck to you and your family. A nice tulip in memory of your dad. @_date: 2014-12-07 04:14:24
Depending how you handle your online bank account information, they can also steal that information and use it to get all your money from it. That is not difference with bitcoins or other online valuables. If valuables can be accessed online then hackers will always make an effort to access that.
So in short, be very careful with your keys, passwords, pincodes, etc. These issues are not only related to bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:28:31
Aha, I didn't know it changes that quickly.
@_date: 2014-11-27 09:41:15
Was Bitcoin ever meant to be anonymous?
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:27:57
It was in most Dutch papers and on Dutch TV news. If you really doubt it's true I can find the sources for you but as a Dutch citizen I can tell you it's true. The reason was also that for a long time there was doubt the gold was still there. Besides our own gold reserve we still have some in Canada and in England/London.

Ask a family member?

I put it on my [tumblr blog]( a few days ago already. Many should do the same IMHO.
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:44:00
I was already wondering about a new coin. Even on Nicehash you can make 10x the normal prices.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:41:28
If I remember correctly it's almost instant. You register and you need to upload front and back of your id/passport. That is all.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:33:29
Sounds like a good deal, have a tulip @_date: 2014-12-01 19:25:33
 says -0.42%, what is your source?
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:57:47
Coinbase is pretty good. Your identity are quickly validated and the SEPA transaction is normally received within a working day.
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:32:08
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:13:38
well, have a tulip as well then. @_date: 2014-12-29 22:08:40
Another top video of James! Cant wait for part two.
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:58:13
Thanks, makes sense to me now.
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:01:03
And that does not make you wonder if you should change this dependency?
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:47:47
It already has been changed to "Some bitcoins *have* been used...".
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:03:58
You sold Bitcoin, you did not buy USD.

Awesome, this post makes me feel all warm a fluffy inside. :-) But on a serious note though, try to figure out a better way to keep your BTC. Read up on cold storage or maybe a Trezor as somewhere else also mentioned. Good for you that you kept your word and gave the reward. We need more people like you (and of course Introshine and other people who helped). Awesome... just awesome!
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:33:11
Imagine the people who bought at $200, they do a little dance now.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:46:51
Yeah, you meant to say that all cloud mining sites are ponzies. Would have been easier to say so in the first place. Or maybe even send people to this informative forum post:  BTW, your name suggests also that you are somebody else then you really are... a bit like cloud mining! ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:42:19
I think it's more a matter of finding a balance. Isn't that all how its supposed to work?
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:17:21
Says enough about the web developer.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:37:06
At this moment cloud mining at cex.io is very tricky. You pay maintenance fees separately and if you track it closely you will notice that the fees are many times higher then the payouts. Thats why the price of GHS dropped a lot (see  So if you do cloud mine at cex.io you constantly need to check your payouts against the fees. Some day or even hour it's profitable and the next you lose money again.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:14:55
Good point, did not even think that far.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:52:36
Like the package sais "cheez", is it made of cheese? The trick is that you hope people are not careful readers so they mis out the 't'. Although I do like the stats &lt;-&gt; satoshi trick much better then calling fake cheese "cheez".
edit: cheese -&gt; cheez... dammed cheesy spellchecker ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:38:28
Thats GHash, not CEX. GHash numbers includes the pool miners as well, its not only the cloud mining.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:04:07
I tried to setup CoinFire.info to that address but cloudflare is not configured to accept it. If you guys from CoinFire read this, and hopefully you are able to configure this, please do. I leave coinfire.info pointing to 104.28.28.114 for now (got to go to sleep soon, sorry).

Get a faster ROI.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:42:19
In fact, I started with peercoin last week for this same reason. It's very weird that we talk about decentralisation of BTC and other coins but still have mining pools and cloud mining. I know that peercoin uses POW as well but thats only for the distribution and not to secure the network (Am I right?). Not to mention the immense amount of energy wasted while mining.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:24:49
Dude, don't even click the link! You just have confirmed your e-mail address to all spammers in the world.
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:32:03
Yes, this is how I do it.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:05:19
Good stuff, 1 tulip @_date: 2015-01-17 23:32:36
Sjeez, not very proud of being a Dutchman right now tbh. Anyway, I will nominate him as our country-idiot.
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:00:40
As stated [here]( I quickly registered CoinFire.info. It's yours for free, even if you don't want to use it. I know that .info is also considered to be spammy but still. I hope you get through this mess soon.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:40:29
Yeah, but I saw .info and .org open and I quickly registered it just in case. But .org was not available when I clicked it, .info still was. If CoinFire uses a different one then that is great for me as well. I just wanted to be sure to give them options. Even if CoinFire is up and running I would have no problem to donate the domain or at least forward traffic (although probably the .info will not have much traffic).
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:23:20
In all honesty, the cost of an .info is less then that. But I did register it with the privacy option in case GAW followers are abusing my home/family. I paid a little over $11. You contribution is well appreciated sir!

"Please use Chrome or Firefox." 8-|
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:48:58
Nope sorry. Let me know if you get hold of it.
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:08:25
No worries, take your time to get your stuff done.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:45:11
It's about time. The fees are higher then the returns for some time now. Hence the drop in GHS prices.
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:36:42
Nicely done!
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:34:27
Thanks, that makes sense. I did check the dividends yes but did not come to your conclusion. Hence the confusion.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:23:18
Genesis Mining, AMHash and Hashnest have continued to payout, small amounts, but still. And between those 3 Genesis Mining pays the most per GH/s. You missed Cryptx PETAmine which has been liquidated a few weeks ago. As always, [this]( is the best resources thus far about cloud mining.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:19:57
Hmm, they had some issues with that earlier this week as well I think.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:16:11
I'm still wondering how HI calculates the yields. For PETA it jumps up and down. Now it's about 150% but I have seen it at 1100% a few days ago. Am I mistaken that yield is the yearly dividend above the asset value? With 1100% that would be an ROI less then 2 months (in these days seems to me not really likely). Current 150% would suggest still making profit so then the message itself does not make sense. Anyway... just wondering about all this. ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:51:28
Yup, same problem here... wasted some time just swinging back and forth.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:32:39
Hence it's called "cloud mining". It's not different then "cloud computing", "cloud storage", etc.
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:20:33
It's up again, took a while tough.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:15:05
Craig just trolls himself, there is no need to have Satoshi involved.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:59:01
Drama about nothing...
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:12:22
As always, start here before you invest in cloud mining: 
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:03:21
Exactly! Satoshi (if still alive) should not even be bothered at all. It's weird though that people like Dr Wrong, who supposed to be the smartest people, are thinking they can fool the world? Probably a tiny dick and a huge god complex.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:24:19
Cloud mining can be profitable. Or at least a few are.
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:59:40
Makes sense, hence the high handling and holding fees.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:26:38
*weird... trying to be funny and correct at the same time 8-|

oops, lol
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:38:44
Here is another nice one...
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:33:28
I think not directly on the website. But if you are a bit handy with writing scripts I'm sure you can use the API.
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:21:38
Yeah, the only problem is that you need to have a machine running 24/7 to monitor the price and buy/sell.
