There is a dust limit which has to be honored, but pretty much yes.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:07:55
Yes, the basic protocol extension could, and should, be adopted by all torrent clients. It would require the developers of rtorrent to implement it though.
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:39:10
Much appreciated!!
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:13:38
Hey gubatron!
JoyStream actually works with all existing torrents. All the pricing is independently set by suppliers and buyers. Different suppliers have different opportunity cost, so you have to allow for this to create a proper market for the bandwidth. Likewise, you different buyers have different levels of urgency, and so you can ration who is serviced first by different ask prices. I do however expect that most people wont actually think a great deal about this!
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:12:43
Yes, I think I get what you are describing, but I do think the problems are quite significant. For example, how do you control who is listed as a seeder in that case? if its just because someone claims they downloaded from them, then that can easily be gamed, and then anyone can get a cut of the seeding reward without doing anything. And trust me, people will!
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:48:48
Yes, of course! As many people as possible need to try it to get some proper tests going, and enough seeders on all torrents.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:29:29
Yes, trackers keep track on what you client reports, which can be easily altered, and is. This is part of the reason such communities are closed, so that there are fixed accounts with a reputation attached to it, and people can discover blatant gaming. For an open system without accounts, it would be hard to not have it undermined by false reporting.

much appreciated!
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:47:56
There will, but the alpha will be on testnet, just to see how it works on different platforms, and getting the basic usability there.
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:44:41
Skimmed through, and I think that is a GREAT idea. You should try to build this as webservice which focuses on torrents with paid seeding. I think it could be huge, as finding some rare piece of content is one of the big pain points JoinStream attempts to enable, however, it requires a user layer to actually make publishers aware of what buyers want. Send me an email/PM if you need any support on this.
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:07:52
I have wondered about the same thing. I imagine so, but since a key part of Tor is the whole privacy issue, that may complicate matters. I really dont know. There was a project, called Toroken, which was trying to do this, but I dont know what became of it:
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:09:43
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:27:16
Wow, that is pretty bad. I have never heard of anything like it, I presume you live in the US? internett speeds are kind of messed up there I have heard.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:55:35
My first thought was to actually show demand or supply curves, and then let the seller or buyer, respectively, set their price accordinly. Now I htink is to involved, and the basic ux needs to more or less automate everything on the buyer side, since buyers are often not sophisticated. Sellers can have more control, but there should also be some automatic pricing based on the swarm.
It works with the regular bittorrent protocol, so yes, you can use it with other regular clients as well.
On your last point, you would have to have the torrent directory websites try to incorporate this information, so that people see this when they pcik a torrent file. E.g. what the current prices are, or filtering on torrents which have paid seeding/leeching. That would be a great project for someone to do to if they wanted to help out. Like a joystreambay.org or something.
Otherwise, people willhave to download multiple torrents, load them all in joystream, and see what the prices are, before picking the one with paid seeding/leeching.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:19:23
Source is not public yet, but likely will be soon. There is no built in tracker, its just like a regular torrent client with a built in wallet. Glad you like it, hope youve signed up to give it a try!
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:10:37
You have Streamium, which is live in production, and I know there is a startup called BitMesh trying to do this with wifi access, but not a lot of examples yet. No, the client is in C++, and bitcoinj is in Java, bridging the gap was not feasible given my constraints. Also, that implementation can only pay one person per channel, while this is a multiway channel, although Im sure the bitcoinj guys would be willing to implement that addition if enough people asked for it. So it is a new payment channel implementation from scratch.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:56:26
Are you having trouble with the signup? If so, what kind of browser are you on, and what happens?
@_date: 2015-06-16 08:34:48
Hope so!
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:26:15
Glad you think it has potential!
I haven't looked into it at this point, but I would guess it should be possible to combine some sorts of rights management into it. That way people with copyright claims could use the bandwidth of the swarm to do the distribution, and only sell keys or something.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:39:23
Takker! Ses!

Every torrent has an order book implicitly, in the sense that there is a set of buyers and sellers with different bid and ask prices at any given time. So I imagine that if there is *a lot* of traffic, then you could pay a higher price to get service first. However as you said, this complexity has to be hidden from the user, at the very least the buyer, as that side will be less sophisticated on average.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:32:43
What happens? Are you not getting a confirmation email? It could be stuck in your spam filter.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:38:53
There should be response which pops up below the form field, however it is not always so clear depending on your browser I think. if you PM me your email, I can make sure you are signed up!
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:40:34
At this point, it can do neither, but that could be added if it was something people appreciated.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:05:08
This is a very good point! Your understanding of Tor clearly eclipses mine, but from what your saying, it should work. I would be interested to hear more about this, get in touch if you move a head with this!
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:47:54
I believe in privacy, but there are no plans to integrate Tor, as it is not accepted to use it for heavy traffic. Someone needs to solve the incentive problems in Tor first! There will however potentially be VPN support added down the line, so you can pay for that with one click as well.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:39:11
Glad you like it! Not only seed, but also to find and make available content which is not even online today.
Please sign up if you want to test!

WOW, thanks, biggest tip Ive seen since... ever? Thanks!

Too generous, thank you!

@_date: 2015-06-16 10:06:50
Hey, thanks!
Yes, so long as you dont put a lot in the wallet, then no problem. But if the wallet has a bug, you can loose funds that havent even been put in a channel, e.g. if keys or signatures are mismanaged. There is also the issue of security holes which peers could try to take advantage of. That is why its just testnet for now, but after a couple of security reviews, it should run on mainnet fine!
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:33:18
Most clients do have this, there is in fact a standard for this called BEP10. (
I expect most clients will follow suit when it is demonstrated that this works well, but if not I am happy for everyone to use JoyStream. Either way, the extension will be free and open for everyone to implement.
I dont think the scenario you describe would work, as you need to split up the payments during the exchange, otherwise the exchange becomes a prisoners dilemma. There is no way to decide who goes first, seeder or leecher, if its all in one go. Also the tip needs to go to the spesific seeder, not the group, otherwise seeders will start to free ride.
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:47:02
Thank you for the tip! Lets hope I stay out of trouble then!
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:40:15
Over the long term, yes, I want all clients to use this extension to BitTorrent, in the mean time it requires some work to be useful for others.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:26:59
Great, hope youve signed up!
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:33:06
I am not familiar with Usenet, but couldnt people just make torrent files for old usenet content and publish it at some price?
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:33:54
Sorry you couldnt sign up, send me your email over PM and ill add you. Also check your spam filter!
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:17:16
JoyStream creates a market, anyone who can supply bandwidth at a good price can enter, so seedbox companies are possible candidates as you say.
@_date: 2015-06-21 07:42:25
Thank you for the tip! I think you will enjoy it when its ready!
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:42:42
That is strange, it works in FF? Perhaps its ghostery? Does it work for you in other browsers?
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:58:18
At present you already spesify the upper bound for how much you want to spend, and then the client looks for the lowest prices which allows it to get a paid download. I guess you want it to not purely minimize the cost, start spending more if it finds out it has to?
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:00:38
Thanks for the encouragment! should be within a month or two.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:31:58
Thanks for the kind words!
I am pretty sure they are using it now, a module called bitcore-channel is the bitpay implementation of payment channels, and I think they use it.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:44:46
Well, it wouldnt be known what was actually being transacted, just parties in the exchange. Private trackers do actually track what is being uploaded by each person, so far as I know.
But point taken, its just a thought to avoid any tx fee pr. exchange.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:00:09
Yes it does support NAT-PMP (what you asked about), and also UPnP.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:31:12
Hey! 
Yes, I totally agree. The problem is that the plugin was not designed to be able to enter the swarm before having its prices set, but that has to change as you say, otherwise people will be pricing in the dark.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:57:25
Thank you so much, any relation to the bitvote project on Ethereum?

A few people have mentioned this idea of automatically seeding what you are leeching, for payment, but I am not sure I am getting the main point. Is it that you do not want to drop your btc, ballance?
Yes I think it is very interesting to consider how the basic distribution could be used by rights holders. The real question in that case is, is p2p seeding more (cost) effective than Netflix super seeding boxes at all the key backbone locations? I dont know the answer to that.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:25:14
Agreed, needs to be in global settings.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:06:27
Well put
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:15:52
I love your excitement, but I am afraid its not quite ready yet! I am doing my best to get it ready asap!
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:17:45
Thanks! Yes I would want to integrate with lightning or StrawPay when they are ready. If that doesnt happen any time soon, I could also function as a single hub between all JoyStream nodes, to avoid opening and closing channels all the time.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:25:07
In Streamium there is no wallet, so its an "extra light weight" channel where the user spends it to a streamium controlled address, which then spends it into a channel, so both transactions are unconfirmed when the channel begins. Here, you have a wallet with keys, so you just spend into a channe right away. However, that channel has not yet been confirmed when the download begins, so the seller has to set an upper limit on how much to send before stopping if the channel has not gotten confirmed (not shown). There is also a fee negotioation which is not shown, which ensures prompt more prompt confirmation. It is basically just a typical 0 conf scenario, which is quite safe given the low amounts involved, and the reliability of confirmation heuristics, and it is quite a bit safer then Streamium in principle, although I think that is quite fine anyway. Hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:02:21
I see, get it, well yeah, if no one has the content anymore, then you cannot seed it :D
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:19:40
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:26:08
I did not know about that project, thanks, will look into it!
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:01:22
Interesting. So the way I read the firt point is that regular seeding is actually not even allowed over Comcast, do you agree?
The second purpose says it has to be for non-commercial use, goes beyond this and directly covers paid seeding. So I guess their costumers will have to run their paid seedboxes on some external host.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:44:57
thanks! signed up?
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:55:52
very kind!
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:03:50
As is, it all goes to the seeder, no central party takes any cut.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:15:46
There is a good chance I will be able to do that ones the implementation is finalized, right now its very messy, and at the very least I'll be able to publish a formal BEP pretty soon, so everyone can get on the same page!
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:45:52
I wasnt aware of that, would be great if someone could answer that!
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:32:56
That sounds interesting, if you come up with something clever, let me know!
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:24:48
Yes, but you have to make sure the entry node, or other nodes dont run away with any funds, and actualy do the full tunneling. So its the mix of getting privacy right, and incentives right, which may be hard.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:54:11
Totally agree, this is just the beginning!
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:49:04
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:39:28
I agree, and I am hopeful.
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:28:14
Yes I did a long long time ago. I looked extremly complicated, and I moved on after a while. I know they want to decentralized and incentivze the entire internet, so quite a bit more ambitious than this!
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:00:39
I see. I think I will have to ask everyone with ideas on the details of this to join me on a reddit thread on this later, to really hash this out, as many people are mentioning variations on the same thing. So there is obviously something there. There are also some constraints in terms of what the client can do to initiate new payments after the contract has been created, as it would be very costly to start lots of channels, but I will need to give it more thought.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:15:29
Glad you like it!
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:32:12
True indeed. But how do you know your traffic got routed through N&gt;1 nodes, and not just the one node, or that they arent just all operated by one actor in a data center.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:50:23
Yes, I think a lot of people will like this pattern, as it makes means they dont have to get fresh btc all the time, which is still quite tricky in lots of places. But it goes beyond just balancing total speeds, the fact that you are paying for service at a per piece level means you can stream very easily, often this is not possible even when seed/leech is balanced on private trackers.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:17:16
Thanks for those suggestions, will definitively consider doing this.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:26:44
FrostWire has the ability for people to embed tipping information into the torrents, so that you can tip some one ones the download is completed, which typically would not be a seeder. This is great, but doesnt really solve the seeding problem, as there is no link between what you get and what you pay.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:52:44
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:15:34

@_date: 2015-06-16 16:19:48
I am hurrying, but I dont think those projects really focus on torrents, but I get your point.
I am not going to make a new tracker, this works with regular trackers, and all existing torrents. Please do contribute ideas to monetization, it is *badly* needed. Send me an email.
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:29:21
I cant seem to see that question on angellist!
Monetization is something I havent given enough thoght to at present. A lot of other clients are monetized in various intrusive ways,  which I would want to avoid, and your defaulted donation feature could be one of those. Some sort of freemium offering could also work, or alternatively just trying to use the network of users with payment channel enabled wallets in some entirely different way. So to be frank, it is still very much an open question, would love to get more ideas.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:58:50
Private trackers indeed solve the same free riding problem by forcing everyone to contribute above some minimum, so it is indeed not "free" to get great service. The problem is that getting into, and staying in, a private tracker is a lot of hassle, and it is more efficient too just price the resource in question, namely bandwidth. This has lots of benefits, among which, people who dont want to spend effort and time seeding dont have to.
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:34:13
This looks great! 
Is Streamium a startup, or just an open source project inside bitpay?
When will the beta start, at the latest?

I am the founder of JoyStream ( with demo video), a BitTorrent client where you pay/get paid in Bitcoin for seeding. Launching alpha in a few weeks, currently part of boostvc ( tribe 6.
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:01:01
Very interesting. Not entirely sure what that interface would look like, something to exchange keys and signatues and stuff I presume. I still think the wallet will absorb quite a bit of the complexity, e.g. in terms of showing a ux which reflects the state of lightning protocol. When do you think this would be mature enough to run as a single server for small payments, like the JoyStream case?
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:14:13
Yes, hopefully in the future.

@_date: 2015-10-09 20:14:52
It is only using testnet, as it states in the client. More work is required too make it handle a lot of different edge cases which can occur. Testnet is also a good testing ground since it has a lot of forks and weird behaviour.
