If two companies compete they lose money. If there is a monopoly the company creates the price they want. Competition will slowdown bitcoin. You will end up losing money. If you been mining bitcoin and then change to Bcash. Your own bitcoin will devaluate so you won't be making more money at all.

There's two types of countries. Countries with small resources and big resources. Usually countries with big resources have a old way of thinking because it went well for them. And small countries with small resources have a more progressive thinking because they might gain a advantage for being the first. 
Big countries want to tax the hell out of it. While smaller countries let things happen and then tax there people when the project is already established.

That's very stupid. You have to think of the future. If miner would have not switched to bitcoin cash. We would have already been at 7k and you would be making the most money. If miners would stick to bitcoin core we would have more stability and probably hit 10k this year. But you moving between both disrupts the growing of bitcoin core making your own payments lower. 
Yeah you make a few bucks more in the switch but lost thousands by not supporting bitcoin core.

Competition will always arrive. If your team is the winning team. Why would you want competition to arrive any time soon. And what has Bcash done? Nothing new. Nothing at all. Ethereum is good competition. Bcash is a bastard clone. You betting on a clone just shows who you are.

Holders are the people that tell family to buy. 
Holders are the business that accept bitcoin. 
Holders also day trade with bitcoin making the volumes go up. 
I think you undervalue these holders.
