Nah. He's just exaggerating.

Where's the evidence to back that up?

If anyone wants to see Jordan's original post in all its glory:




1. Andrew bought a Robocoin kiosk.  
2. Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way.  
3. We delivered the kiosk. Andrew took receipt of the unit.  
4. The kiosk had some hardware failures. My support team worked with them every step of the way. We spent hours on hours working on solutions. My support team, dedicated to their job, was met with constant belittlement and noncooperation from Andrew.  
5. Andrew lost patience and decided he was over it. He shipped the kiosk back to Robocoin's manufacturer.  
6. He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business.  
7. Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds.  
8. Andrew would not come to any type of terms. He chose to threaten as opposed to negote. We offered to resell the unit - he declined. That is not the kind of way we like to do business.  
9. He sent out a horrible tweet - saying that I'm crooked. Something I take personal offense to. Again - we delivered his kiosk, we provided him support. We did our part and we're ready and willing to go above and beyond.  
10. I am always happy to come to a swift and easy resolution. It's disappointing that business is conducted this way and even more disappointing that my company - a team that works every day, tirelessly to the bone, to develop great solutions to enable the world to buy bitcoin - is dragged through the muck.

And what did you do? Nothing.

Unless of course, doing so would break one or more laws.

Shame I can't afford to mine.
