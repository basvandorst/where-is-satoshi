I’m waiting for a reply also - I sent everyone in the company an email. Even tweeted the CEO.
They should cover losses as this was brought to there attention 8 days prior on Twitter. 
Check it out: (
Nobody sent an email saying that’s going on, or have authority to remove it for over a week!

Coinbase / GDAX could have easily prevented this by having the proper security features in-place. My account was compromised / login from another country minutes after my own login.. don’t you think they should have temporarily disabled?

This just happened to me too.. 
Went to go login to GDAX looking at my history was redirected to GDAXBTC.COM .. Entered my login and password, received verification to my iCloud, thought GDAX was requesting this info, and without hezitation entered all my info, and now $3,500 of my ETH coins are gone! This needs to be covered by GDAX / COINBASE this has made me loose any and all faith in crypto currency. If anyone has any info please share!

The website seems to be down now. I was redirected to this site directly from GDAX, others have had this issue from google ad’s or email. I️ hope Coinbase will cover losses. This happened to me on the 25th they literally had people report this since the 19th! As big as they are they have  0 customer service.

Did you contact Coinbase? contacted them the first day this happened, long hold time.. and it said my account is restricted for 24-48 Hours. After l got back on didn’t see my coins, thought it was part of the restricted access 24-48 hours, emailed, tried calling each time 45 minute hold. This is like a dream! What just happened????
