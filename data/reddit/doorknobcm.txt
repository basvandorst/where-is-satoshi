We're not even sure if the bubble has fully deflated. Lots of stakeholders with deep pockets propping up the price.

No. It's a pump and dump "news" site.

Shut up! You're messing with their investments.

Bitcoin - as low as -10%*

Heavily invested in bitcoins, obviously.
One of the biggest problem with Bitcoins is security. You can easily lose some if you're not careful. Gox's "tx malleability" theft is a good example.

Sooner or later this post will get picked up and posted by another user anyway. Redirecting my comments to redditors.

They're already using US Dollars.
Bitcoin will not solve Zimbabwe's problem.

Karpeles is having a great time right now. Now other exchanges are having the same problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:42:32
you should start a new post for this. reading that thread made me realize the problem is much bigger than what other users here want others to think.

I have to be honest. I only use cryptocurrencies to buy fiat. Always looking for the best deal. Sold majority of my stash around $1150.

Even blockchain.info isn't that reliable in estimating volume transferred. You can just transferbitcoins to yourself and they'll still count that.

They don't want it unless if it happens to them.

sounds like he did.

non-bitcoin user pretty much unaffected. I bet bitcoiners will still buy those iThingy.

Basically, you're saying we bail out bitcoin bagholders?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:02:04
lol. It's Bitcoin's best "feature".

I just recently watched a program on Al Jazeera(hours ago) about property bubbles around the world. If you replace every mention of the word "property" with "bitcoin", it perfectly describes the attitudes of investors/ponzi managers in  Ninja Edits: oh, and here's the link to the show.
"... over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product."
"And in the UAE's Dubai, the crash was like a **game of musical chairs coming to an end**."
"using **PR strategies** to suggest that the real estate **crash was a good thing** for the emirate."
"As one world leader handled the crisis through **denial**, other leaders tried to rethink capitalism."

It's a free market.
I thought people here hate government intervention.
