Yes but competition will force me to lower my fees soon. Right now some companies are as low as 8%
Only thing is, we aren’t close to their locations

You are not going to add Jewish and black holidays? People like you are the most racists of all... come on man

manually load BTC? reminds me of theif that stole a BTC ATM thinking it was going to be full of bitcoins

i have tons of marketing experience and have access to low cost marketing executives with good skills. We are one of those companies that you will not be able to get rid of no matter how hard you try, i know its bad for brand long term but gotta do what you gotta do

There are tons of small companies in Bay Area that fits this description. Also, coinradar isn’t even close to accurate
I can’t share my company details or personal details. Can share with moderators as a proof, if required to verify

bitcoin but that won't matter. The seller was ready to take fiat, i just didn't want to to wait 12 hours to send a wire... So sent bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:28:33
all machines are listed on cointATM radar, except the one we installed yesterday.. I think the hardest part is getting started, which you should have but hey, good luck on what you are doing now!

Our customers can’t buy from exchanges. These are people that don’t have bank account. Localbitcoin isn’t for everyone. Tons of people don’t feel safe meeting each other in person.
I am not worried, I know for a fact we will have to lower our fees down. In fact some companies in San Francisco are already at 8%

Gas stations, food mart kind of places... Paying fixed rent per month.
Just one way machine, which means you can put in cash and buy cryptos.. The ones that dispense cash are called two way and they are very expensive
its all own my own.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:34:48
Thank you so much... 1 day at a time, 1 machine at a time... we will make this work
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:03:52
i don't like running a business unless it doesn't scare me. I know its a bit reckless but thats how i have lived my life so far and it has worked out great. Whats the worst that can happen? I lose a lot of money... so what? i can make it back... Start with sales and bar tending at age of 32, how is that not amazing for life experience
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:53:57
selling right now 20% over exchange rate
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:49:08
yes i do...
it wasn't that hard, found an attorney that does just that for Bitcoin atm companies
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:44:23
i bought a company that owned 3 machines on the east cost. I paid them $19,000
Another $10,000 in everything else

FINCEN took about a month. MSB license is 6 weeks. Not that complicated if you ask me
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:58:50
Thank you... Spending more than i can afford to lose
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:19:02
That seems reasonable 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:00:05
I agree with everything you said. Also I think this 20% will go down faster than we all think
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:10:36
$250 to $900 a month fixed rent depending upon location and type of business
Mostly gas station that have heavy foot traffic and are open 24 7

Answered already 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:07:34
2 reasons
a) exchange cant' take physical cash
b) exchange can't give you bitcoins right this second
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:07:05
General bytes- I like them for a fact that they are cheap. They don’t ship 2 months after you pay them, so that sucks
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:57:51
Not full time right now but will need an executive in couple of months who will negotiate with stores and get contracts signed before putting machines in
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:05:13
85 business days = July

Right now all machines are one way, which means you can buy only.... I offer 3 cryptos right now... all machines are connected to single hot wallet
Rough numbers after month 1 - $10,000 per month so roughly $1500 net profit per month per box but my sample size is too small
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:03:03
6 months from the time machine is installed 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:18:53
Bay area 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:01:01
1) no.. these are one way machines. Which means you can buy cryptos only
2) 10k
3) no insurance. Can’t afford it yet
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:03:55
That’s not us
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:40:26
you can do both... i chose to sell what i have on hand
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:57:05
Machines are on the stands. Stands are bolted down to ground
Merchants’ WiFi
Server is super easy to configure. Costs like $20 a month 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:47:03
sorry, didn't meant to be an asshole... your machines are connected to a hot wallet or exchange (you have an option to choose). When customer buys, bitcoin can be transferred from your wallet (hot wallet or exchange) directly to customers wallet. The cash box hold the cash, you go pick up the cash. Refilling? you refil your wallet by buying more bitcoins as they sell
