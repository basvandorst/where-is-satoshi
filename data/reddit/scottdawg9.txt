It's kind of a paradox almost. You invest in Bitcoin because you believe in it. And you tell other people how great it is because the more people invested, the better it succeeds. Which directly results in you making more money.

How does crypto solve the loan though? Loans are the reason banks exist. You want to start a business and need $10,000 but you only have $2,000. So you go to someone who has that kind of money. That's a banks primary reason for existing and why they have become so wealthy. They essentially invest in everything. How does crypto seriously stop that?

@_date: 2017-12-25 19:47:01
Who said 40k by the end of this year? When I started investing in September the most optimistic predictions from brilliant market analysts said 10k by the end of the year. I was thinking how amazing 10k before 2018 would be and we're at 14k now. That's insane.

If you're thinking about buying alts then BitTrex has been good for me for alts. Alts make a very small portion of my portfolio. You have to use BTC to purchase alts on there. Maybe ETH too, I can't remember. It's a lot less user friendly than Gemini or Coinbase but once you take an hour or so to really understand it's nice. No info on mining though as I've never done it. My advice with buying alts is a small amount in a bunch of them. No one really knows which will tank and which will rocket up. Don't over think it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:51:03

@_date: 2017-12-04 02:35:30
You can already do that with several coins. And people do it. I'd guess that for every successful day trade there's an unsuccessful one.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:18:17
Alts are generally trash and ETH has been my slowest gain so far. I originally went half and half with ETH and BTC, but I've already swapped 20% of my ETH to BTC and I think I'll move more again tomorrow. I just don't see ETH having the short term gains BTC will have. 
I ask people "Have you heard of cryptocurreny?" 
They'll say "No, what's that?" 
"Oh yeah! I've heard of it."
And that's why I think Bitcoin is the best investment for now. ETH doesn't have the popularity BTC does. It'll be a while before all of it's supposed improvements make it a better investment than bitcoin, if it ever does, imo.

@_date: 2017-12-04 05:17:04
Not sure how that works. I use gemini because of the low fees and because coinbase verified me, then unverified me and when I used the exact same pictures again it said they were not accepted.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:47:05

@_date: 2017-12-02 18:01:59
Yup. Sorta. When it went back to $330 I traded about 20% of them for BTC and kept the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:47:55

It was really simple for me my first time. I use Gemini. Just called USAA and gave the representative all the info he asked for and the money was in my account in under 2 hours. But I think most wire transfers have a flat $20 fee so it sucks if you're only doing a few hundred.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:56:08
Damn son I wish I didn't put half my investment in fucking ETH a few months ago. I might have to wait for 150k BTC to retire. That could take like, one whole year :(

Jesus if that happens I'd have to seriously convince myself not to cash out even 20% of my holdings.

Not even gonna lie, I'm already thinking of ways to avoid taxes if I cash out in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:38
1) Gdax deposits can take like over a week. My brother did it to avoid fees and ended up losing out on way more money as the price climbed while he waited for it to clear. Eventually I just bought the coin for him and he transferred me money. I've never used Gdax, just gemini for me.
2) Buy some now, then wait. Maybe 50/50. No one knows wtf is gonna happen even 10 mins from now. Or just go all in. I would definitely NOT hold all your money and wait for a dip. One might happen but you don't know by how much or when. Example: When we hit 8k, I sold some coin, expecting a dip. Well the dip was only down to like 7.8k. Not enough for me. So I waited. Eventually I bought back in at about 8.2k. So that might happen. You wait for the dip but think it'll get bigger and then it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:57:50
I didn't say just not pay taxes, but I'll find a financial advisor and see what loopholes there are. If Apple can avoid paying hundreds of millions I can avoid a few thousand. Just gotta find the way how.

I think they'll enjoy it in the short term, because who doesn't like making a quick buck. But if Bitcoin continues and does what it was made to do, completely disrupt the banking institutions, then they'll try and stop it.

Selling it and buying goods with it are two different things. For example, if it had that kind of value I won't sell any for some shitty USD however I will buy goods with it. Especially since the return of my initial investment will be so massive that the goods I'm buying will have essentially been "free".
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:43:27
Considering my brother and I have made more money from this than our actual jobs over the past few months, yeah it's pretty addicting. I check it all the time. Until then price is fairly stable like today. Then I get bored for a day or two and the monsterous swings start back up and my addiction returns.

I don't get people comparing this to some random Vegas number. Bitcoin is a groundbreaking new technology and it's been soaring up constantly. If you had invested at ANY point since BTC was created and held until this moment, you've made profit. It's got a solid track record. How is buying Bitcoin the same as picking a random lotto number?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:44:16
Maybe in the short term. But I think about it like this: the internet has absolutely revolutionized the way we live, and it's young to some people. My grandparents are still alive. The World Wide Web wasn't turned on until they were 60. Bitcoin is meant to be a financial revolutionary tool and is not even 10 years old yet. The value of it is directly related to how many people want it. It's a global currency and barely any people at all own it. The entire crypto market cap is an incredibly small percentage of the world economy. But yes, the 19k happened faster than we were ready. I'm in crypto for the long run. I only started in September, but I plan on keeping my investments for years. I think older generations are pretty skeptical of it, and my parents and friends parents have told us to pull out and be done, but younger generations, those who are still in high school or middle school, and even younger, will be drawn to crypto. Adoption will increase as time does because younger generations will grow up hearing about it and younger people usually take bigger financial risks. So does it have to come down hard? Huh. Just depends if sellers outweigh buyers. But if it crashes I think it'll be short term, as long as another crypto doesn't dethrone it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:08:38
Altcoins are pretty much any coin that isn't Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the big Daddy and it's price usually drives the price of the altcoins. I think as of now there are 1200+ altcoins. Obviously the vast majority will fail and be worthless in the future. Buying them is like buying a penny stock. Low risk, low chance of reward, but success can be huge. Ethereum was once a lowly shitcoin and look at it now. 
Gemini has been solid for me so far. They have such small fees on purchases (0.25%) that they're essentially negligible with all of the price swings crypto has. As of now only Bitcoin and Ethereum are sold/purchased there. I have wired quite large amounts of money into Gemini with no issue. My money was there usually within an hour of doing it. Gemini also (it might depend on credit score) will approve a $500 pre credit with nothing more than a debit card. So you can immediately buy your coins, no waiting like on GDax (which I've never used but my brother does). The only issue with this is you cannot move your coins around for a few weeks while they verify the transaction. Think of it as collateral in case you can't pay. I have not sold any coins yet so I have not yet seen how Gemini works when transferring money out of the exchange and into your bank. Gemini is very user friendly as well and their customer support replied quickly when I had questions. I'm no expert, only started in September but lemme know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:13:21

The "dip." My last BTC purchase was when it was like 9k. My portfolio was still at double at the worst point in this dip. Aww yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:09:16
Just had a friend today asking about it, said he doesn't wanna put 11k in. I told him it can go to .00000001 coin and that's a fraction of a penny for now. Hopefully he buys something!
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:12:02
If everyone could predict the dips and spikes, this market wouldn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:03
Yeah that's exactly it. And I think if Ethereum actually fixes the problems it claims Bitcoin has people will move to eth, but only after BTC is widespread enough for people to have problems with it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:42:22
Pretty much since I bought my first $200 worth when it was 4.7k. My life sucks and I got nothing else to do besides enjoy the shitposts and echo chamber of people telling me we're all gonna be rich.

It's directly dependent on the amount of shitposts in a given day as well as the quality of memes for a given price.

On Gemeni they will precredit you $500 a day just from your debit card. Might need good credit for that, I'm not sure. They'll hold your crypto for a few weeks as collateral until the payment completely processes but it's nice to get money instantly. If you wanna do a ton of money a wire transfer is worth it. USAA sent the money instantly and I had it in my Gemini account within an hour. I was doing the $500 a day in late Sept/Early Oct and realized bitcoin wasn't slowing down so I did the wire. 
EDIT: Coinbase has pretty steep fees. Gemini is 0.25%. Also I know Gdax has no fees, but you need to buy a certain way. Limit order I think. Again I've never used Gdax but I know my brother was paying fees because he was using the wrong buy option there.

Yup. I've lost money on bad investments. And I've looked at BTC years prior to see what "could have been" and the "what could have been" feeling sucks WAY more than losing. At least with losing you take that risk rather than sitting on the sidelines.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:04:36
That's what I'm thinking, that it'll drop and faster than it recovers. So sell right before the fork, rebuy after. I don't see it skyrocketing after the fork. I will keep some BTC in just to see what happens, but even if I get free B2X coins I have to wait for Trezor to make sure everything is good which could take weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:32:49
Stop, my doctor said my erection has already been going for too long. But for real I went to EDC this weekend and was like "I'm not thinking of BTC at all." So I deleted my crypto apps, but before I left I set a buy order of 1 BTC at 6k and then while I was there got an email saying "Buy order filled" and was like "wtf??" But still managed to not check anything else. I'm so glad I did that.

Ok, thanks for the tip. Right now it's a Mutual Fund. Should I keep it as that or move to something else? And I've got the risk tolerance BECAUSE I have a bunch of money in safe places too. Plus I saw how fast bitcoin has risen and I could have put my Roth IRA money in BTC and pulled out in one month and made more than in 5 years of the Roth IRA, so that helped me decide to dump a lot into crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:29:27
I'm not sure when Trezor will be safe for me to touch my BTC. I read that this no replay thing will cause issues so I'll have to wait a while before it's safe to touch my Trezor. In that time B2X price will probably go down. And won't BTC likely crash at the fork? Doesn't that usually happen?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:46:15

Idk why people keep saying BTC is playing the lotto. It's not at all like that. This is a risky investment in new technology. Playing the lotto is randomly picking numbers in a game that is designed to profit those who run it. Even gambling is going to a casino, which someone owns, and putting your money in. The guy at the top will make sure no matter who wins, he gets more money out of the night. And he fixes his machines to all do that. If there was a "CEO" of bitcoin, yeah, I'd be way the hell more concerned with it.

Uhhh, someone is making a coin "from" BTC. But this one has no replay protection, I think. So if you spend one of these shitcoins, you might also sell you bitcoin. You gotta read coinbase's stance on this I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:15
But in all honesty I did the exact same thing. Bought my first bit around 4.7k and it dropped a hundred or so and I went ah fuck. Then day to day it went up until I finally made my wire transfer at 5.8k and did the same thing and got nervous. Happens to everyone. Today was actually fun watching my portfolio drop and spike all over the place.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:00:15
I don't think that will happen again. No way to know for certain obviously, but so many of us are now used to this. And our sub is an incredibly small amount if BTC users who have been following this. Every time BTC crashed, it has come back stronger than ever and I think so many people realizing this now will prevent a huge crash from taking so long to recover. Summer is a good example of a huge crash that bounced back pretty quickly. My plan is sell off all BTC on Bitfinex pre-fork and rebuy right after.

I didn't really do anything. When I talked to someone at USAA years ago he gave me "risk level" and I chose "moderately conservative" and I've dumped 5,500 each year, the max amount. It's sitting at just over 30k now. Which is a few hundred bucks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:41:50
Something has gotta happen a the fork though right? Hasn't BTC crashed the last few?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:59:06
Then why hold onto it? Clearly it's not an investment so holding it is pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:29:19
A few hundred. It blows. I don't even understand stock market shit but it's spread across the board.

I don't think you know the definition of socialism. Taken from Google: "a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole." None of those countries you listed do that. Again, things like healthcare and education being publicly funded are "socialist elements" but all of those countries use the free market as a base, meaning they're capitalist countries that have some socialist elements. They don't lean socialist. They lean heavily to capitalism. Which is great because it works. But you can't use those countries as "examples of socialist leaning countries" when the entire foundation if their economy is capitalist.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:21:12
an act of devoting time, effort, or energy to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result.

Buy some and do your best to ignore it for a few days, else you'll go "oh wow, I just lost x money faster than ever." since the price fluctuates so fast. I thought I was late and losing money when I bought my first bit when BTC was 4.7k.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:13:36
Fuck coinbase. I had the same problem. Got verified and made a purchase. Went to make another and I needed to verify again and it wouldn't let me so I left. Also they take out a much bigger percent than Gemini when making purchases. Gemini takes .25% so I use them now BUT Gemini is the same as coinbase where they don't even know which coin will be BTC after this fork so I'm taking my coins outta Gemini prefork. There's too much uncertainty this fork for next to trust them. Bitfinex has said they will call BTC the same thing so look into that exchange. I have a hard wallet too, Trezor. It's pretty legit and super simple to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:39

I don't quite believe the "collapse of USD" that gets spewed around here. Do people sincerely believe the entire USD will evaporate in a few years? No way. It's bounced back, same as BTC, except the USD has a much longer track record of doing it. I do think BTC is much better as it's deflationary but no way does the USD just lose all it's power. It's already only backed by faith and it's far too important for the global economy for the world governments to let that happen.

I would use a wire transfer. When I began purchasing BTC on Gemini the price was 4.7k. Gemini has a $500 a day limit so I did that for weeks. But it's pre-credited so, even after a week when I got an email saying "You can take out your crypto now!" I still couldn't. They hold onto your crypto until it fully clears. Took 2 weeks roughly per purchase. There's no limit on wire transfer and both time mine were approved in a few hours. By the time I made a big wire transfer BTC was 5.7k. Also as soon as you purchase crypto with wire transfer money you can move it to your hard wallet. I'd be careful purchasing BTC right now on Gemini through credit cuz you likely won't be able to withdrawal it until after the fork and no one knows what's gonna happen with this fork.

There's no way of knowing for sure. My wire transfer went through and I went "Maybe I should wait a day. Wait, no it's the waiting that kills you." Whatever. I'm in for the long run. Gonna swap some ETH for others when it crawls back.

@_date: 2017-11-17 00:38:58
Not only that, but the fees are miniscule. Like .25% or something. Idk exactly, but I pay 1.25 ever $500 and those fees are wiped after 10 mins of crypto swings.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:50:05
I just don't think selling the day before the fork and buying right after is that big of a deal right? If BTC "survives" the fork the price shouldn't skyrocket. But if the fork causes a crash, it'll drop significantly over the next few days. That's what I think.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:56
A big thing to look at is how many Litecoin there are total. I know eth has over 90 million total coins and BTC will only ever have 21 million. So unless BTC completely collapses I don't see one ETH being equal to one BTC in value.

I didn't even know B2X had a price yet. But isn't it extremely likely that ONE of these coins will crash after the fork since everyone who has BTC gets a free B2X? And my other problem is that I don't feel safe touching my BTC right after the fork because it's currently on my Trezor, so I won't be able to touch that for a while since I gotta make sure it's safe.

A) Cryptocurreny is the least socialist thing ever.
B) Socialism and corruption go hand in hand, any corruption in capitalist leaning countries is way worse in socialist leaning countries. Compare 1950s USA to 1950s USSR. Compare 1970s Great Britain to 1970s PRC. Compare modern France to modern Venezuela. The list goes on.

Is there a plan in place for if B2X "wins"? Several massive exchanges (Bitfinex) have said they'll keep the naming as is and others (coinbase, Gemini) have said they go with the harder hash rate. So if I go to Gemini will I see BTC, which is actually B2X, and I go to Bitfinex I'll see BTC, which is actually BTC? Seems like there's going to be tons of confusion with this fork.

Ok, so one industry in one of those countries listed. Not very convincing to call them socialist countries. It's also funny because it's owned by the government, not directly by the workers like Karl Marx wanted. I love that when a state controls an asset and it's a shitty country (Venezuela) it's "not real socialism" but when a great country does the exact same thing it's "proof socialism works." Anyways the PM of Denmark gets annoyed with people like you apparently if ya wanna check out this article where he directly says his country is free market, not socialist.

I'd tell people but I'm still kinda sketched out as far as security goes with Bitcoin. My money is pretty safe on USAA, and insured up to 250k whereas crypto is the wild west of the financial world and if something happens to my shit I'm SOL. Even making a mistake on an address of one character and your coins are gone forever. I only started a few months ago and I've made awesome returns. First small amount of BTC was when it was 4.7k and that was "so expensive" at the time.

I only started two months ago. Got my friend into it a few weeks ago. Now he tells me to cash out and get buy back in the months. He's trying to day trade. H makes it sound like holding is stupid, ignoring that if you bought BTC at ANY point before Nov 27 and held until today you've made profit. He also believes the technology won't last. Pretty much gave me a bunch of texts saying what everyone else has said the past 7 years. I'm holding for years, and if enough places accept BTC in 3-4 years I'll never go back to fiat.
EDIT: The only cashing out I'd consider is my initial investment, so that all money in crypto from then on is "free" money.

Don't think about how much you spent on BTC for this, think about how much it can be worth. Losing 200 sucks, but imagine if in a few years that 200 is worth 1000 or more and then it gets stolen. You technically only lost 200, but you're gonna tell yourself you lost over 1000 and beat yourself up over it.

I'm still confused about this fork. I have a bunch of coin (BTC and ETH) in Gemini. I just emailed them because I have a Trezor and none of my bank transactions have cleared yet for some reason so I can't withdrawal any of my crypto yet. Is it important to get everything into my hard wallet before this fork?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:46:13
True. I wish I had. Since it's basically doubled, I'd take that initial money out and then all my BTC money would be "free" money and losing it wouldn't bother me at all. I'm not even too worried about the big investment I just made.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:24:07
Yeah, if my bank (USAA) gets hacked and money gets stolen, I'm insured and it'll be front page news everywhere. If gemini gets hacked, it's a foot note I the news and it's "tough luck." I'm ok losing my money from crashes, that's a risk I'm accepting. I'm not fine losing my money to theft.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:05
Putting all of your hard earned money in crypto at a young age is risky as hell. That being said I think there's nothing wrong with 10-20% of your money in crypto because the returns have been insane for 7 years now. But I have a ton in a Roth IRA that has slowly, but surely, making money. Idk if they get mad when you mention putting some in crypto, I don't browse it. But crypto is essentially wall street bets as far as safety goes.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:23:35
You on Gemini? They pre credited me so while it took a while to clear my bank I was able to purchase I was able to purchase crypto immediately.

I like reading stuff like this cuz it gives me some peace of mind that I just dumped a fuck ton of my money into BTC. Even though it's pure speculation and if it was certainly going to hit 400k, everyone would invest today.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:51:52
The best advice would honestly be put a bunch it now, move it to a hard wallet, and ignore crypto news for a year or two. But this shit is too exciting and now I check everyday lol. I have to remind myself I haven't actually made any money yet, not until I actually convert to cash, if I ever even do.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:20:41
Why now though? I know the reason it's increasing is because people are buying but why right now, on this day, is it spiking so suddenly? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:50:59
So after the fork I'll just have regular BTC then and nothing changes for me? A fork sounds like it "chooses" one path. How will I know which path my coins follow?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:49:01
Because they're looking at the rate it's going up and other things. The flip side is BTC completely crashes and is worthless. It's conservative because of how crazy BTC growth has been but it is still ridiculously risky. The way I see it is it keeps rising or it crashes to nothing. There's not really an in-between here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:50:40

Ok, first off do you use Gemini? I'm not sure why I still have pre-credited deposits when my first transaction was Sept 27 and they say 4-5 business days. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:21:31
I've been doing a bit of both but more eth. Is this an issue eth could have in the future?

Just remember all of the absurd shit we saw being legitimately reported by the news this election cycle related to memes. It'll happen soon.

Same! I used gemini so I could only do $500 a day. My first purchase was at 4,700. I finally did a wire transfer 2 weeks later and it was 5,700. Like jesus, wtf is this

Gemini customer service told me they do something to keep a lot of info offline but who knows. Got myself a Trezor so I feel safe now. And yeah, even if you only invest a few hundred that partial coin may be worth thousands in 4 years. There are tons of stories of people not protecting or saving hard drives that had dozens of bitcoins because at the time they weren't worth shit.

I wanna know what the realistic "top" value of BTC is. I've seen a lot of analysts say $50,000 in a decade or two is completely possible. Is there any "top out" value? Like if bitcoin finally makes it mainstream and there are "BTC cards" or whatever (just like debit cards) and virtually every company accepts it, is there a solid estimate for what its value will be then?

You guys please, you're making me so erect.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:42:53
My first transaction was Sept 27 and I still can't withdrawal the ETH that I bought that day.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:14:20
Sold???? Why sell? If I could I'd just ignore BTC completely for a year. I'm holding for quite a while but hate that I check this shit several times a day.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:47:12
Should I put my coins into an exchange before this fork? Mine are all in my hard wallet and it sounds like one of these coins is going to tank, so it'd be smart to sell early right? Someone else said don't touch my trezor during fork time.

Interesting. I totally, of my own decision alone, decided not to have sex with any beautiful women last night and it went up $1,000. Does this mean I gotta keep it up (well down) for the sake of mad gainz?

I have set up my Trezor. I moved my crypto to it from Coinbase after they kept making me send in ID and saying it was incorrect, after I had already verified my ID. Plus Gemini takes way less money per transaction. My deposits have been cleared from my bank so I don't know why I still can't transfer to my Trezor. I hope they email back soon cuz it's a lot of money and I don't want it there for much longer. And yeah, I've been buying crypto already. A bunch. Not sure what the issue is. I don't wanna have to find another site to use, Gemini is cheap and easy to navigate for a dumbass like me.

My first deposit was Sept 27 and I've pretty much done every day since then. I checked and had an email on Oct 6 saying "Your transaction has cleared and you can now withdrawal." This morning I can finally move some around for my first time. I'm not sure why there was 7 days between the email saying I can withdrawal and me actually being allowed to withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:11:33
Put it all in baby. Don't listen to the naysayers. The days of $60 making $6,000 are over for a bit. Gotta put more money in now.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:45:28
True. But the 24 hour growth has still been pretty drastic today compared to from when I started following. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:26:47
Can you explain this to a dumbass? I've tried to get it but can't. After this fork, every coin will be duplicated, under a new coin name? Say I have 1 BTC. After this fork I'll have 1 BTC and 1 B2X? Or do I somehow choose what I want my  coins as, BTC or B2X? My crypto is on a trezor. How will this work? Will I have to connect my trezor and it will automatically split all of the coins?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:44:33
What if they regulate it though?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:22:16
Agreed. They take out 1.50 on ever $500 while coinbase takes like 4%. Luckily coinbase's authentication is so horrible I looked for other exchanges and found Gemini
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:27:45
I'm not sure which other ones besides BTC and Ethereum. I read there's over 700 now. Obviously the vast majority will bust. I don't have time to research what makes each one different and better than the last. I'd like to buy a bunch of one of the really cheap ones, just no clue which few to invest in.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:02:47
I hope it stays that way. I feel like I'm so late to the game, but I have no idea honestly.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:44:12
What's the prediction on values? Like an even split, no change, one collapses completely and one is unchanged?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:37:43
Actually I don't think it'd have been dumb, but that's because over half of that was an enlistment bonus and I still had 4 years on my military contract so I made plenty more money than that. But my scenario is pretty specific. At least I put it in savings. Another guy went and gambled it away then got discharged for a DUI and had to pay half of the bonus back lol.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:31:35
If you told me a few years ago that it would even hit $5k I would have said no way. Which is why I didn't invest. Honestly $1M is possible because there are only so many possible bitcoins, and the value will rise as it's used more and more.
