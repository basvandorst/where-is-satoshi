So another server in the voting pool will prove that my cash is legit if that is all I have?  Then allocate funds to my account on a new server, then provide me new cash for my old cash?
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:04:07
Cool, I have not been following the voting pool development, as much as I thought it was strictly related to the control of bitcoin, colored coins opens up a new dynamic.  Ill keep a closer eye now.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:53:44
Cool, for some reason I was thinking that there was a way for other people in the market to prove a liability is acceptible with out necessarily talking to the original server it was issued on(maybe by reading last reciepts via the blockchain).  Though from what I am reading it sounds like this is possible with in a voting pool?

Perhaps this is the key..  so my *faulty* notary can create colored coins(based on any asset??) and then put them into a voting pool?   At which my notary can't lie to other users very easily?   If many servers are apart of the same voting pool can they use the same cash?  or does it need to be exchanged between notaries? 
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:24:10
I am in Canada, but FWIW I switched to a us based vpn and recieved the same error.   I have not used coinbase many times for checkout.

This is very exciting!  Does this mean that most OT functions will be able to be used via the blockchain?
Reading this..


Does this mean Chaumian signatures will function on the blockchain?  
If so maybe, this + multisig + proof of solvency could solve the bitcoin transaction limitations as well as kill zerocash were it stands.
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:08:03
Hrmm.  I am particularly interested in how multiple servers could keep track of cash.  Particularly in regards to fedeartion and redundancy.  I thought maybe this would solve that, does having just the notary server handling cash transactions introduce a single point of failure?
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:02:03
OK so I can use the colored coin/pool technology to prove that I can't steal or modify the assets backing the cash.   
Do you have any information on how I can provide redunancy for cash users?  Is this as simple as having the same OTX private key(same as namespace?) on multiple servers?
Thanks for the links, Ill dive in a bit. 
You guys are awesome!
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:42:35
Thank you, I get it!
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:55:59


is there a way to issue cash outside of the namespace of a notary?  (voting pools?)
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:28:04
I am not sure, probably not, though maybe if you guys give me a job (we met in vancouver years ago)?    Still looking for that QA guy?

Also, Im constantly repping for you guys here anyways.... may as well get me on board.  I think you guys will build new kingdoms, but I doubt I will play in them if I can't participate in the same way I do with bitcoind.  But perhaps when monetas is ready for primetime, I wont have choice.

OTX is a client/server/library for smart contracts and digital cash.  There has been more then one server running for over a year.  So yes it is usable but still lacks federation,  this is supposed to be fixed with the work they are doing on voting pools.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:48:57
Huh, OK.  Maybe I will try again in a few hours.  Perhaps it is just a hiccup. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:50:39
So maybe it is not a Zerocash killer...
Maybe I am missing something but I have been following and looking at your wiki on atleast a montly basis for many years and I keep on waiting for the feature that will provide me with redunancy, and if possbile even federation of untrusted servers.  This is what I have been reading as the vision the entire time...
So can you have a voting pool for assets(particularly interested in using basket currencies[gold, seeds, bitcoin, etc]) other than bitcoin?   If so, since it is a voting pool can I have some redunancy(is there documentation?)?  I am particularly interested in what happens when a OTX server goes offline.. is the ecconomy broken until it comes back up?  Can other cash users prove cash is real with out talking to the server?   If I want to build a company based off of this technology where is my redunancy and how do I scale?
Sorry for the barrage of questions, Im just starting to get the saddened feeling that federated cash is a bit of snake oil.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:44:48
Oh, its a work VPN I doubt it is on any block lists.  I provided my real IP the first time around, which sprung the error as well.

@_date: 2012-07-04 07:56:55
AFAIK bitcoin is not political.. so It can not be anti government.   Just a well designed value transfer policy that people voluntarily become apart of.
A little offtopic.. I can't speak for everyone but.. I personally don't do drugs  and I &lt;3 le governd.   I personally think bitcoin is great because services like paypal are not accessible to me.  Bitcoin allows me and friends(who which paypal is also not accessible) to start exchanging immediately(no approval, or banking hoops to jump through).   
This may not seem like a big deal to you, but for me/us this is life changing.
I believe it gives us a sense of security by stating the rules for getting involved up front, Its my choice to get involved.. and bitcoin makes no judgements on me as a requisite for doing so.   
@_date: 2012-06-16 18:20:01
I think this the best answer.  bitpay, and mtgox alike will be skimming off the top of your donations.  Unless your looking to get bitcoin-&gt;direct depost(bitpay), best to get your own wallet.  Once you have a wallet you can make address's for each site, labeled in your bitcoin wallet.  This way when I donation comes in you can discern which site it was given too.

I dont see anything anti-government.  
If anything bitcoin is highly governed.. and quite a bit more efficient then other currently available systems.

[I posted some info on the bitcoin forums](
**copied below:**
first off,  these are signs we made for friends and shops in our area.  They are definately not cookie cutter and have some differences among them.  We were not planning on selling them, but if we can convert some of our workhours into bitcoin, that rocks!!  
These signs are lazzor cut, and we just made a few more( this time varnished for shine  Cool ).  
each of those images is a different sign, as its wood there are some differences.  So its first come first serve.  If you want clearer pictures of any of the signs let me know.
For these we are requesting 2btc per as they are made out of the "good wood" mahogany!   There maybe some additional costs for shipping, Ill have to see how much it costs after someone places a order.
the trouble with these wooden signs is that each piece of wood cuts differently under the laser so adjustments need to be made all the time.  Also knots and lines in the wood will cause differences in appearence.   If these  are bought up we will work on sourcing some smaller cheaper pieces of good wood.
We are discussing making laser cut plastic signs as well for 1 btc.  Upside of plastic is, they all will look EXACTLY the same.  We will do our best to keep it classy.  Let me know if there is interest in this, large orders welcome!
Also, we also did a small run (20 of each) outdoor grade UV/Vynal stickers so merchants can put a "bitcoin - accepted here" sticker along side their "debt card" stickers.
pic any 5 stickers for 1btc (includes shipping)
if you want a btc address so you can send me coins, send me a message and Ill generate you one.

I would argue that bitcoin is highly regulated.  Actually its regulated on a consensus basis by hundreds of thousands of nodes.   In this sense I would say the policy of the bitcoin network is HIGHLY regulated.  The Regulation you speak of is what would keep Mt.GOX in power when something better is about to trump it.  But because of consensus like regulation mt. gox would fall as their survival is not written into the policy of the 100 of thousands of nodes that are regulating the network.   
in my mind 100,000s deciding on regulation trumps backroom deals that decide regulation.

I think its good to start local.  This is probably easier in a small town, or a community based neighborhood.   I have built relationships with a few shops in my area,  mostly through a friends of friends kinda basis.   This has landed me a small grocery, a computer store, and a pub that are all willing to accept bitcoins.  I brought them some [lazzooor cut signs]( [vynal stickers]( (bitcoin: accepted here stickers are on the glass next to visa/MC/AE and the likes), and flyers to post on message boards.  I picked up a nook colour(~120) and threw cyanogen/android-wallet on it for the grocery store.  This appears to meet all of their needs on the receiving end.   At this point Im worried about rushing things by trying to get everyone excited about bitcoins, before bitcoins are ready for them.  I dont want to ruin the hype by introducing something half-baked.  Ive had a few friends go from being super excited about bitcoin to super bummed out when the blockchain took 2 days to download, putting our trading on hiatus.   So at the moment, even though the local infrastructure is in place at all of these places, we are waiting for thin clients that run on iphone/android/bb/etc.  Likely this will end up being a local supernode/thinclient setup running on bitcoinjs, with a frontend themed for a locality.  After this is there I will begin spending a $100 worth of bitcoins every few weeks,  on friends art, beer, etc.   I know a good handful people that are excited to use it and trade with friends as soon as it works well on their iphones.   After the other local shops see success at the grocery and the pub, they would be silly not to invest in a smartphone so they can start accepting too.
What todo next?  throw another developer at bitcoinjs.org ;)

Its a risk to start accepting bitcoins.  Even more of a risk if your not a schooled crypto freak.  Regardless of the eloquince of your bitcoin description it can be hard to convince business owners that its more than a toy.  What I have found that works.. is banding together with a few like minded bitcoin enthusiasts and offering to bottom line all bitcoin exchanges for the shop that you choose.  The choice should be a shop that will allow for the most exposure in your community. This may mean coming up with a Max daily exchange that you can promise to fill for the business owner.. ie $500 or so.  What you will guarantee the business is that the will not loose a penny if they start exchanging .. thus putting you on the line for all exchanges.  This should raise the visibility of bitcoin in your area.. possibly encouraging other shop owners to hop on board.  Also.. get some stickers, signs, and info bulletins cooked up, and keep it classy.  Check my old posts if your interested in vynal stickers or laser cut signage.  Would link but I'm on phone.

We are also expecting most/any BTC transactions to be from vacationing moguls looking for a good community to spend a little coin in.  Once we have some more information around the community(trying to make some pamphlets now, if anyone knows of some examples) and maybe another shop or two on board, we'll let the cat out of the bag.

are you interested forking a thin client to work with something like bitcoinjs?  It might become more widely used if you didnt have to download and install bitcoind as well.   Plus thin client tech allows means you dont have to download the block chain, its working well here  .

alternate reality is they key word.  AFAIK bitcoin has grown by leaps and bounds.. there is not 1 but 3 supernode/thinclient designs that have been polished since the mtGOX fiasco.  This means that new users can instantly start using bitcoin with out having to wait days for the block chain to download(progress?).  P2Pool is a sweet evolving project has rocked localized pool infrastructure.   Im sorry your coins went from $30 to $3... but Ive been using coins for a while.. and have seen mine rise from 20 cents a coin to $3.50 a coin.. even if it was wildly over valued while people first stumbled down the silk road.  I feel like demand is balancing with mining.  Not to mention those who have interest in keeping bitcoin alive, with the means todo so, which means keeping prices accessible.. much easier for a noob to spend $3 than $30.  *shrugs*... I can still buy and sell coins.. people are making tons of transactions.. lots of good news coverage... not that horrid a situation.
@_date: 2011-09-23 15:29:45
I like the less than a penny, as most people cant contemplate transactions costs that small.

ROFL.. gauging success of bitcoin by Hah!   Dont be such a debbie downer :P
bitcoin *is* liquid... I can buy or sell bitcoins for cash same day.. I can use my bitcoins at the local market for food.. so sue me if I think it would be sweet to get bitcoins for posting on reddit.    
I think more of what your experiencing is the true boringness of bitcoin... which is good.   We experienced ALOT of hype, ALOT of ups and downs,  but when it comes down to it.. bitcoin is just another tool.  If it works it *should be boring*.   the fact that it has liquidity and its thriving in *some* realms shows me that it has found its usefulness and will most likely be boring otherwise, far from dead AFAIK.
Ill keep to my pipe dreams, enjoy your vodka/depression.

I have heard the tor devs talk about a possible tor coin that servers could earn for running tor.  These would be anonymous and presumably bought and sold using bitcoin, they provide priority traffic in the tor network.  I wonder how traffic consensus could be reached, would/could it be a quarum consensus like bitcoin?   Like all nodes have to agree that a certain amount of traffic passed through, is handled with something hard to forge like checksumin packets..
I don't know how this can be built, but as soon as it is... my ISP is going online ;)

@_date: 2011-07-15 14:25:01
I dont think it needs to be mesh, like wifi mesh that is.   We just need to learn some OSPF and BGP.   and then somehow account for traffic sent/recieved.  Maybe the ammount of credits needed to send something accross the world would cost more then stuff sent locally etc.  If this was a seperate IPV6 internet, maybe links into the "old" internet could earn coin for the amount of data they are pushing through as well.
@_date: 2011-07-15 15:48:55
If we go the tor route then there could be captive portals software, that would allow hooked in nodes to charge  per use

They are not currently, but we were talking about this I think they will(or I could if they wont) ship for 2.5 - 3 bitcoins.  They just need to cover shipping costs, could be cheaper if more is ordered.

western canada, if your in the hood I can give you some more details.   Waiting for some decent clients, before we start shouting "use your bitcoins over here".  You likely will be able to use bitcoins most places in town by late spring(local pub, grocery, computer shop, bed and breakfest already on board).
@_date: 2011-09-01 21:50:49
the website looks fine to me(in chrome), but I just tried in firefox and it didnt load.  also [.ch]( domains are swiss... and on top of that your wallets private keys are not stored on their server they are stored locally and loaded via javascript.   Its a implementation of the supernode/thinclient design, and a open source project to boot.

Im talking about people setting up a seperate credit-internet with links in to reg-internet.   
this way if we were downloading something a local "mesh network"  charges wont be as great as only so many hops were made to our neighbors down the road.  However if we need to download something from further away more nodes need to be transversed costing more etc.   This scales.. so if people in a small community were using a single wifi link for most of their traffic, that wifi link provider would stand to make a great profit.  However if someone with some dough coughs up  enough to get fiber run to the next community over then traffic would start to ballance out over that, as well as handle more capacity when the wifi link was over capacity.   It would be transparent to the user, functioning like the internet opening the shortest/quickest path first
@_date: 2011-07-02 23:02:11

@_date: 2011-11-19 06:05:19
btw.  this town is definitely bitcoin-alternative friendly..  but actually thriving.. is really dependent on the status of the software(tools) available to users.  People here are into alternatives, but there is really no point explaining  bitcoin to people if they cant easily(download blockchain) use it.

This should really be transparent to what ever hardware is used.. as mesh networking is still pretty broken afaik.  Plus.. if somebody wants to contribute their fiber links they should earn credits

Cheers.. on phone sorry for shity replies..  
I am in Canada and our telcos are shit...  I'm more interested in strong cheap links for our region.   In a model where the competition is in setting up and keeping the links online.. I think communities will likely have many competing links fighting for regional traffic.  Many of these people will likely be reselling(better legal speak might be "community credit earning") their home connections to earn credit on the network.  Hopefully if this was very useful to a community a big Telecom couldn't stomach the backlash caused by disconnecting the community.  Again while a project like this could have awesome world implications I am more interested in a decentralized/federated network in my region.  
@_date: 2011-09-01 19:00:03

I suppose.. however, what ever you call it(ignorance or idealism), the old powers in their blind greed often overlook new technologies and assume that the towers they have built and the control that they have installed are immortal.  I think this is hubris.  History seems to show that this stagnance or inability to adapt allows new techniques to outperform the old techniques.  eventually pushing them into irrelevance. Evolution, problem? *trollface*

@_date: 2011-09-01 21:55:59
its a deployment of [bitcoinjs]( it uses a supernode/thinclient design and your wallets private key is not stored on their server.  So only your device has access spending with your wallet.  I dont think there is information about backing up keys on your phone yet.. but it should be around the corner.
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:16:19

You most certainly would need to build a market, and every Tor node would be a producer of their own credits(mining) for every packet they passed/planned to pass.  Their ability to transfer data on the network is their ability to create credits.  The trust worthiness of their credit would be defined by efficiency at which it is fulfilled.  The trust worthiness of the credit defines how much those are worth in comparison to other nodes(auto-market).
