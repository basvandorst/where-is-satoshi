Be careful using Changelly, they are known for holding users funds and requiring KYC info in order to release them. Just searching Reddit, you will also find many instances of them selectively scamming users.

every article there is filled with incorrect information and just hate towards bitcoin in general. I have been avoiding it altogether.

Freewallet is a known scam, please do research before using a "random" wallet.

There are a few ATMs around, but you'll have to check each one to see which has the lowest fees. You should also try to check LibertyX, which i think it similar to how the atms work.

Seems more like unprepared or untrained store owners and staff is the problem here, and most similar cases like this.
