Can you ELI5 how the agreement is actually made? What does that exactly mean? Like is every single owner of a satoshi voting somehow electronically? And then the devs change the code? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:08:30
How does that really work in the modern world when you throw in corporations who are trying to maximize profit, labor &amp; utility? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:09:56
Because they have to compete with the public option.

Those generators in the towers probably already have SOME fuel in them or else they're pointless. Now if they run out of fuel while running, then I doubt they'd get priority for a REFUEL over a hospital.

We should just separate commercial banks from investment banks again.

Most folks just want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2019-11-09 03:18:23
how long are you going to hodl without water and food? shelter? transportation? gonna wipe your arse with leaves?
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:38:52


Looks really cyberpunk aesthetically.
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:09:24
Yeah I do. And I think it is/was Hal Finney; who unfortunately passed away but is in cryogenic preservation.  
Screw this "James Bilal Khalid Caan" dude for coming up with this crap, even bringing Hal Finney into this scam of a presentation and build up.
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:02:07
I'd be okay with 1 satoshi. It's the thought that counts.
@_date: 2019-08-28 03:15:15
I wouldn't have named it differently but I think I would have made the total supply number more meaningful. Like maybe the atomic number of Gold.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:07:39
Deserves it.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:58:43
 I mean, if it reaches $100K, does it matter AS much? Still a gain.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:47:04
This is perfect!
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:25:58
I looked through a good chunk of the messages from Satoshi and the British slang is really minor and infrequent. I mean, hell I use Brit slang sometimes and I ain't British. It really does overall sound like a dude from California. There's a relaxed style to it.    I really do not think at all it's multiple people or an alphabet agency.  If it was multiple people, way more would have gotten done and it seems like there was still a lot of WIP (the other person's name is escaping me but emails between him and the person make it clearer) before Gavin went to the CIA presentation. But it sure as hell isn't this Bilal Khalid Pakistani dude.

You really don't understand the behind-the-scenes stuff. It's obvious. They state it. They have to deal with banks too you know. It's custodial.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:01:33
Low was just about 9,640 (4:30pm-ish)
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:00:56
Lots of selling at first, then those who aren't as much at risk (job wise or stretched thin because of obligations) buy out the lower price.
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:42:50
I just love how cyberpunk it looks.
@_date: 2019-10-04 01:46:55
Why do they punish the average little guy more??
These rates should be opposite.
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:26:11
I just read his wiki and he does read like the scammer type. 


I've only recently checked out Twitter (I know...). I legit thought it was the original Bitcoin. I'm sure most followers think or thought so too. In fact the Bitcoin handle has 927K followers!  I'm honestly kind of mad now that they're deceiving people in order to pump/hype their altcoin. If anything I feel like they're damaging Bitcoin. Or maybe that's the plan?   I'm guessing these dudes are gonna sell / exit scam once Lightning gets more popular &amp; robust and leave everyone they convinced with the bill (loss).   
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:26:01


It is. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:56:12
Also, they want to become middlemen and becoming a middleman is a great way to make money by putting a lot of the risk &amp; cost on others (content creators and supports). 
@_date: 2019-02-25 09:28:14
Even if he was, I'm sure you'd find something to say still. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:52:12
I mean, if you're using fiat, then a CC is excellent for many reasons if you're responsible: 
Being irresponsible is bad whether using fiat or crypto. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 09:13:45
How do satoshis work? 
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:03:55
Damn, you're right. Although, I can easily see a new credit system once cryptocurrencies get bigger since it's endemic to money in general, not a specific currency. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:17:12
I like it but at the same time, for general usage for the general public, all this extra layered stuff should just be invisible. It's Bitcoin. That's it.  There are too many buzzwords, brandings, other word associations, ideas, etc congratulating the entire thing. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:44:58
Is that what Basic Attention Token is about? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 10:58:35
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:49:24
Do it only matter if you go to fiat (USD)? Does it matter if you're only doing crypto to crypto? 
@_date: 2019-02-24 10:16:35
Yup, and to top it off producers more so care about looks and size, not nutritional content (or even taste). 
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:22:07
You know, I didn't really think of it as a variation of dollar cost averaging. But I can totally see it now.
@_date: 2019-02-08 11:19:23
Still looks much younger too. I was super surprised of his age. 
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:20:30
All electrical energy turns into heat eventually though, no? Even sound itself, turns to heat.
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:51:18
Is it really based on empirical evidence anyway? It's mostly all built on confidence. Which is why some bad news, even if very irrelevant to goods and services themselves, often brings the total market downward with a cascading effect.
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:54:20
Not yet but it's possible because of all the digital price discrimination systems being put in place now; as in the price of the item changes based on who is buying, when, etc.   It prices don't change as often now because it's a pain to physical change out prices constantly and a pain to update old point of sale machines. But in the future, it could probably change near instant; whether it's based on exchange rates or some price discrimination. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:27:17
Do you still use it?
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:51:46
The whole thing was a huge nightmare and headache but luckily sites like  started to exist and I feel better. I'm still a bit worried since it'll be the first time reporting but not like before.
@_date: 2019-12-22 00:04:52
Dumbest comment. Yang is pro-Capitalism.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:14:59
Might as well just keep it. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:42:06
I mean, I think we can all agree we should get our share instead the constant throw away to the banks.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:19:35
Does the fact that Bitcoin isn't centralized, so all the nodes are spread around, help in that regard?
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:22:33
To the people saying it's unprofitable, are you calculating in the potential for the Bitcoin mined to increase in value over time? HODL? Or is this more like a NiceHash view of it where you get paid to mine for others?
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:58:32
Inflation is good for debt holders.
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:59:59
Also knock out a lot of heads.
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:47:11
I see this argument a lot about inflation but I think the truth is that inflation is good for debt and the entire system is practically based on debt; it makes paying off debt easier. There's just so much of a backlog of debt than inflation needs to happen. And it's been propagated perpetually by large corporations &amp; institutions. All other arguments just seem like a way to deflect that aspect. And it pacifies the commoners to accept it and dismiss any "deflation".
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:00:45
Because they just perpetuate debt.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:53:08
You are the bank. I'd be paranoid too. :O
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:04:12
Would anything change for the better overall if the reserve quota was much higher? Say 30% or 40%?
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:52:46
You sound like the perfect person to get Bitcoin advice from.
