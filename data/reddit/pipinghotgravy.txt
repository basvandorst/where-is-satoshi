Why did you enable 2FA if you didn't know what it was? Here's what's written on the CampBX site:
"How does it work? After you activate this feature for your account, every attempt to login or transfer Bitcoins will require a 6-digit code generated by Google Authenticator app on your smartphone. This code must be entered correctly for transaction to proceed. **Google Authenticator app is available for Apple iOS devices (iPhone / iPad / iPod), Android phones and tablets, and Blackberry devices.**"

What about backing up an encrypted wallet.dat file to a TureCrypt volume that happens to be stored on a DropBox folder? Is this safe?

It sounds like you are ignoring the solution. Refunds in $USD *is* the solution. What more are you looking for? 
If you truly believe that "it's a prepaid credit card" then you don't understand what Bitcoin is all about and shouldn't be accepting it in the first place. End of story!

What? One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the fact that is *not* regulated. Please take your socialist economic views elsewhere if you honestly support Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.

Maybe someone you know did it.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the invention of the Bitcoin futures exchange. We have witnessed history! [slow clap]

I don't think you know what "pump and dump" really means...
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:06:17
Yaah, you're right!
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:12:02
LOL. You said it, Fuck Sox!
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:32:50
Perfect! LOL

This I support.

OP: can you expand on your title statement, please? I'm failing to see the connection.

Thanks Obama.

So, explain how the current situation is pump and dump then. Who's making the misleading statements causing the price to be artificially inflated right now? 
Look, I'm not trying to start a war with you, I just see that term thrown around quite a bit on Reddit, and it's usually used incorrectly. 
I don't really see any proof of a pump &amp; dump scenario right now.

I'm with you, Anus Blender!

Sorry, but I'm not going to trust anyone with my money who doesn't at least have a solid grasp of English grammar and punctuation.

Didn't Charlie Shrem already have enough money from Two and a Half Men and Anger Management? What a greedy jerk.

"redditor for 1 week"
Sounds credible to me.

Are you day trading bitcoin or just obsessed with price?

Dogecoin is only 3 weeks old though. Your math is flawed.
