Hey Bugsbugsy,
You can store upto 10 Bitcoin addresses in our card.
It also has an NFC chip embedded in it, so you don't have to open the application to receive Bitcoins and there's no need to scan the QR code as well. You can just tap the card on the sender's NFC phone and it will show you a list of your addresses that you can choose to receive Bitcoins in.
We're currently working on our application that will also enable the feature to transfer Bitcoins from your Qrypto card as well. :)
This should help you explain the NFC feature better: 
Hope this helps.

Hey Exab,
Apologies for not being clear. 
This card has an NFC chip in it that will contain your list of Bitcoin addresses. (Which you can edit using our Android Application.)


The sender would require an NFC enabled phone and a bitcoin wallet in their android phone. If they don't have an NFC enabled phone, they can just scan the QR code (Which will have your primary address.)


Just the Qrypto card with the customer's Bitcoin Addresses.


* To receive the funds, the sender would have to tap this card on their NFC-enabled phone. 
* Once they do that, they'll see this screen with the receiver's list of Addresses: 
* The sender would then select the address that you want to send the funds to. 
* Once they click on the address, their wallet application would open with the address entered in the field. Check this screenshot for reference (Using Mycelium Wallet for this tutorial): 
* They can, now, just enter the BTC amount and click on send to transfer the Bitcoins. 
Hope this clears things up. :)
Thank you!

The QR code will only be used if the sender doesn't have an NFC-enabled phone. 
The NFC chip would store upto 10 Bitcoin addresses.
We're looking into using xPub keys for the card right now. 
And no, there won't be a 10 address limitation in this case. :)
Here is the list of NFC-enabled phones, if you want to check it out: 
Thank you!

Thank you for your reply. 
You'd provide us with the public keys that you want to add to the card when you place an order.
We'll just code your keys in the card using our application and print your primary address on the card. 
You can, of course, change them whenever you want to. 
So, we have no access to the private keys. :)

Hey Exab,
This card lets you receive Bitcoin in upto 10 Bitcoin addresses. 
All you need to do is tap this card on your NFC enabled phone and select which address you'd like to receive the Bitcoins in. 
If the sender doesn't have an NFC enabled phone, they can use the QR code on the front side to scan the primary Bitcoin address, just like any other Bitcoin transaction. 
You can edit your Bitcoin Addresses any time you want through our android application. 
Here's are the screens for that: 
Thank you!

Check out Blockonomics
They don't require any kind of approval. 
All you need to do is sign up on their site. 
Been using their module since 3-4 months now. 
Love the fact that the funds are sent straight to my wallet. 
Would definitely recommend it.
