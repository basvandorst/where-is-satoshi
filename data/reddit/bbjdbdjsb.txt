Hey, 
I looked at your various plans and I saw the debit card. Can you tell me about that? Can you load that with bitcoin and spend it at stores that accept regular credit and debit cards? 
Can I use in places like Latin America and Europe?

"We are a crypto only company." &lt;--- That is pretty damn cool. 
Do you have a map or list for stores that have your terminals?

Hello, 
Thanks for the security tips. I did not know about that blog post. I would really appericate if you clarify what control or input your company does have on my account? Also, I would be interested to hear what specific measures you are taking to improve security and address the problems that have been higlighted? 
I would like to mention I have not had a bad experience with blockchain.info but I do not feel conifident that you are taking these problems seriously and just doing PR damage control. If you have laid out a game plan about how you address these issues and I am not aware of it. If you have, can you please link me to it. If my concerns were address I would be much less interested in other wallets.

No, I haven't had any personally and than ones than were my fault (like not writing down the passsword correctly) but I also haven't had any expreiences with other web wallets so I would like to see what they are like. 
Blockchain.info is getting thrown under the bus right now and I am not given up on them. They might come up on top of this since they are getting all this pressure and other wallets are not so they might really focus making it better.

Wow! That is really cool. I will have to check that out. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:57:06
I hope so. I replied to their comment in this thread looking for details if they are and if so what. Haven't got a response back yet so I don't know. I haven't hread them say anything about that. If you know a post or tweet where they have please link it to me.

Out of curiosity, lets say my computer is compermised. What would be more vulunerable? A web wallet? Or a downloaded wallet?
