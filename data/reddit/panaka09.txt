By some mistake I am not US citizen so Gemini is not an option for me.

people used to see price going up constantly. If we believe BTC is something like gold is. Look at the gold price and will realize it has been suppressed constantly last 5 years. Don't expect bitcoin to go to the moon in two years. Invest wisely and hodl

Anyone to know how to do this with Raspbery PI? 200$ for such toy is too much
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:41:53
I am. I would like to see BTC back to 2000 USD. This will dismantle all of the shitcoins. Everyone will be "I told you this is bubble" etc. and this will prove that BTC is the only currency we have to endure. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:36:36
Still offer lower fees on USD-&gt;BTC transaction. Not their fan at all but after almost a month trying to research something better I think I'll stick with them for now.

Just stop explaining them. People are idiots by default. You don't need someone's approval for your self esteem.

Cant believe someone will purchase such think with BTC. Guys reinvest the money instead of purchasing shit. Reinvest in blockchain technology/green tech enterprises  not stupid gas engines from 19 century. Only this way we can make difference.

Good xmass gift. Thank you! Now let me exchange them for BTC please
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:55:13
Not planing to claim them at all. My BTCs are in my hardware wallet and no one knows how much I possess. If Canadian government would like to take taxes on my BTC profits let them admit publicly they want to regulate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:21
Where else we can buy and sell bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:09:57
True but can be used to recover the private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:46:32
It’s worst in my country. Recently the police confiscated 200 000 BTC. Now some idiot was explaining they can’t sell them because it will crash the market of Bitcoin!!

It really doesn't matter what I think. But also it really doesn't matter what CRA considers in this case. Until my Ledger wallet start reporting to CRA I am OK with their interpretations of what is crypto capital gain and not.

It is not available outside USA. How can we support it?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:21:54
This is legitimate source. You want me to quote the the police department? Dude these people don't know how to open an email and you asking me for their clarification on bitcoin. 
Please tell me what you consider as real source? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:00:01
Market circulated BTC daily are [1,032,960]( How is this not going to happen. And yes it will sink a little bit but since this is unregulated market no one is going to be prosecuted for such transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:00:49
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:46:36
It is not regulated so I don't considered it as an asset. 
About the statement why not IIROC issue something like statement on the bitcoin exchanges? They already screwed up the forex market, cant they make it with cryptos? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:47:16
Personally I think this is bad for every crypto. Protocol approved from one of the most corrupted and crocked government which starves its own people and now in a verge of hyperinflation is trying to avoid it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:54:42
Always invest money you can afford to loose. And remember bitcoin is not investment its future currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:33:05
what a looser!!! How someone could trust such personality.... beyond my understanding 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:55:48
So basically only private key is enough.

Newcomer question here:
I am expat in mid east and obviously here is very difficult to buy bitcoins. However, back in my country I have friend who has owe me some money and for that reason I asked her to purchase bitcoins from bitcoin atm and send me the virtual currency. To my understanding the process should be: 
1. She goes to the ATM and purchase bitcoins
2. Scan the qcode from the bill and send it to me. 
3. I receive the money in bitcoins. 
Any flaws here? I have blockchain wallet but she doesn't have any. What is the easiest way to do it? Which app we have to use?
Thank you!

I have some issues with the verification by SMS. They were supposed to send me SMS message which I had to send back for verification but still waiting. usually is instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:58:03
Actually it make sense. But if BTC went to world domination it price will be enormous.  Lets say currently there are 70 Trillion $ in the world economy. In order BTC to serve its purpose as exchange token with the limited supply this means average price sill be 3 million $ for each one if my math is wright . 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:57:13
haha no. I am just climate change denier and people bust me when I comment on the news. You can check its on the world news subreddit:). BTW, is that bad thing?

So in your case is in therms of years not money. Interesting

Earth is sphere but let’s keep this conversation for somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:37:19
Not so sure. If BTC reaches 1M in two years I doubt it will be accepted everywhere. People are still asking "What is bitcoin?".

Actually that's what I am doing. Hodling all the time. Recently I paid for internet service which costed me around 5$ in bitcoins. Then the BTC was around 3500$. Somewhere mid August I check my bill again and turns out I spend 7$ for this. Just because BTC raised so fast the service which costs 5$ and still cost 5$ is estimated as loss of 2$. 
Am I wrong?

What is this for? I don't get it. Any quick explanation please? Why someone needs to run node on RaspberryPI? That's actually I don't understand.

I am using it since December. Pretty happy. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:41:25
What is the point to run node? Mining bitcoins? Isn't that require something like AntMiner?
