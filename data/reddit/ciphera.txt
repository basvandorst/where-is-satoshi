Since you don't want unnecessary things on the blockchain, can I assume you are pro 1MB blocks then? Otherwise it will be cheap to stuff whatever type of transactions you want on it. Or would you rather abolish the scripting system and have it static to only allow one type of transaction?
You aren't making a lot of sense.

True, this would be most effective for pools, such that users can select one that has explicitly rejected them.
Nothing stops them from breaking any promises, but some of them have other businesses than mere mining and may risk sullying their reputation and have their products boycotted.

Of course, but &amp; co think they have that ability. And should they pony up the dough for miners to vote a certain way, it would be hilarious to see miners soft forking back later on.

I assume only Coinbase, Bitstamp and Xapo are interested in this.
We have seen the winklevoss twins coming out as pro-decentralization, meaning Gemini is most likely not interested. Bitfinex, OKCoin, Huobi, HaoBTC, BTCC have all signed the HK roundtable agreement and are probably not interested in a different time than Core.
Excellent if more developers can be funded, but my guess is that the money will mostly go to doing politics and lobbying a la Classic/XT/BU.

That wouldn't be the case as long as no &gt;1MB blocks are created. Miners could activate BIP109 and then not enforce it.

Chinese blocks won't be orphaned as much since they have most the hashpower.

Those running with BIP101 would still accept blocks smaller than 1MB, but those who don't accept BIP101 will reject those blocks. If &gt;50% hashpower rejects BIP101 the longest chain will eventually be nothing but &lt;1MB blocks which will be accepted by all clients.

That small change would be a checkpoint on a &gt;1MB block. Can you give an example of what other change it could be? Note that the new chain would have to somehow ignore the chain with most work on it. This is the change that is dangerous.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:28:34

I'm glad he acknowledges that there is no consensus on how to solve the block size increase, but that there is consensus that it should be increased.

So that is a reason to not explore alternatives? Wow...


But when a large gathering of technical people get together to talk what he feels very passionate about? Shouldn't that be one of those times when he SHOULD discuss. Face it. He is not, nor has he ever been interested in discussing this.

Right. I am curious why he suddenly is so passionate about SW when it has existed for so long. As 'chief scientist' he must surely have been aware of it before the conference.
And since he seems to think a hard fork is more interesting there was nothing stopping him from pushing SW months ago. AFAIK the only reason SW was presented at the conference was because of the breakthrough in deploying it as a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:10:45

@_date: 2015-12-03 09:38:57
Can you try to refute my claims with logic? If &gt;50% of the hashing power discards &gt;1MB blocks, the only way to fork is to do centralized checkpoints (which wouldn't hinder miners to jump on your chain and refuse any further &gt;1MB blocks unless you keep checkpointing at which time you can just scrap PoW alltogether and go with a centralized solution a la Paypal) or switching PoW algorithm (which would let the fork become insanely insecure).
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:46:54


For now maybe. They are bound to change that ruling when they see fit.


Umm.. running an LN node will be possible on a machine running a bitcoin node. You don't need to perform a huge amount of traffic to be a node. If the LN developers succeed with their design, nodes will not be able to gather the necessary information to divulge relevant information about payments.

@_date: 2015-06-24 19:56:53


This I agree with. Rushing it, however, is dangerous. If we want to minimize the number of hard forks the technical community should get consensus on what to do. If Gavin gets his way with his hard fork and there are some issues ahead, then some other core developer will want to create Bitcoin-XP with another hard fork. Better take it slow and play it safe, even if it will slow adoption-rate.

If changing hashing algorithm, they would have very weak security. No infrastructure in place (asics and the like). Confidence in that chain would plummet. No company want to risk this happening and that is why the fork will never happen without consensus. Its sha256 or nothing.
Everyone with Asics would mine on the sha256 chain and this chain would be the more secure one, hence the most valuable one.

What transit? Lightning transactions transfers real bitcoins. Lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions.

Perhaps in the beginning there will need to be a few large hubs, but as the network grows the difference between hubs and spokes should become minimal and anyone could act as an intermediary if they wish.

Nothing strange about removing Coinbase wallet. By running XT nodes, users will not be aware of what chain their coins belong to in the event of a fork. When an action that affects users security like this is taken, the best thing to do is discourage new users to user it. 
A while back blockchain.info web wallet was removed for security reasons and there was much less drama. The reason there is so much drama right now is the big-block side yelling and screaming censorship to try to stay relevant for just a little while longer.

If I understand things correctly Bob can pay Claire via GW again by making the payment he received from Alice void (or at least reduce the amount he should receive with what he wants to pay Claire). 
In the end there should be many ways to send a payment through the Lightning Network. I believe this routing part of the protocol is where the challenge lies. In the beginning it may be necessary to have large gateways that have enough funds to route payments for everyone, but as time goes on and the network grows everyone should be able to act as gateways to the extent possible.

That post clearly shows that Satoshi was wrong. He seems to suggest that miners will always be honest and never cheat, and that the "first-seen safe" principle was part of the consensus. It clearly is not, as Todd has demonstrated with the RBF patch.

It could be either side, but the pro-20MB people have been particularly vocal on this subreddit about spamming the blockchain to show how awful things would get.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:10:57
Only if you can predict the future. But I guess we are lucky that Gavin can do that...
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:13:13
Yeah, I noticed.
It has happened before, but was added at the top in the new section even if it was a couple of hours old. I dont know if it is because I'm posting via the tor network or that I have full names in the title. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:32:05
Perhaps you are the one who is dumb on blocksize? 
Didn't think of that, did you?
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:57:39


I would say it is just as likely as a miner being deemed an MTS. Running a miner doesn't require an identity, and the same goes for setting up an LN node.


With enough privacy built into the network (onion routing, R-value cloaking) individual nodes will not be able to hand out usable information about payments anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:09:07
It is dangerous to assume what the future will bring. This is lazy engineering in order for you to not have to debate this again in the future.

You are [losing]( dude!
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:12:40
Yeah, good luck with that.
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:19:31


I'm seeing a lot of this here. If &gt;50% does not accept your change they will reject blocks that include those changes and everyone will be on the same chain, because the majority hashrate will have the chain with most work on it. The only way around this is centralized checkpoints or changing the PoW algorithm. **There is no other fork if you don't have a majority hashrate, unless you abandon decentralization altogether.**
@_date: 2015-12-03 08:51:48
They are deciding what they will do with their hash-power. You got a problem with that? Who should decide? If other miners join their pool they are free to leave if their policies makes them unhappy.
Mining decentralization is bad Lets not make it worse with BIP101.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:36:30
I would say having a wait and see approach is rather waiting to see what the future brings without trying to predict it.
@_date: 2015-12-04 06:02:12
Depends on your viewpoint. Status quo is difficult to change. The other way around would be difficult as well. If all miners wanted to do an increase, but nobody else, they would not be able to do it because no one would accept their fork. Its the power of censorship resistance.
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:33:19
Dunno if ELI5, but basically tx malleability safe method of nLocktime. Fixes payment channels.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:24:10
Personally I think its great that a magnitude of options are being discussed. Adam Backs proposal presented on the mailing list a couple of days ago is very interesting as well as Meni Rosenfelds proposal the other day. 
You seem set on the only thing working is 20MB blocks...
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:01:48
Yeah, its better non-english speakers only read populist opinions and gets in line with the sheep... /s
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:20:40
When you say 100% consensus protocol change, do you mean a hard fork?
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:43:32


The problem is that the blocks created by those 30% would be orphaned, because everyone will follow the chain with most work on it. The only way to escape this is to do centralized checkpointing or changing the PoW algorithm.
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:05:15
You seem to imply that they cannot agree on some issues while disagreeing on others and still be able to work together.
I guess it is just you who have to oppose every single idea that comes from blockstream, no matter what it is, just because you don't like them.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:05:46
The committee didn't ban him. They rejected his proposed talk. This happens all the time in academia. He was even offered to come to the conference for free. How is that a ban?
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:50:30
When he left the scene there were very few Bitcoin users. There is no way he could know how his creation would scale. He had some assumptions sure, e.g, everyone running SPV, but I wouldn't bet on him sticking to those today, as it is clear SPV requires too much trust and have awful privacy properties.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:39:48
So I'm a sockpuppet because I only joined a month ago? Strong evidence you got there. Is there anything with substance you want to complain about in my post?
@_date: 2015-12-11 06:19:50
You shouldn't be informing yourself about a new topic on reddit anyway.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:24:58
Grow up jackass. It got rejected. Move on with your life. Or are you suggesting that everyone who proposes a talk should be accepted?
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:52:32
Incorrect. If &gt;50% of hashing power refuses &gt;1MB blocks then the longest chain, which everyone will follow, can never include &gt;1MB blocks. A centralized checkpoint a la Hearn or changing the PoW algorithm would be necessary. And a checkpoint is easy to circumvent for miners who don't want &gt;1MB blocks. Just accept the checkpointed block and refuse any further, which would cause your fork to checkpoint every &gt;1MB block. In that case you should just ignore PoW and go the way of paypal.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:07:27
Perhaps. But Mike is ridiculously irrational compared to Gavin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:17:38
You dont get distributed consensus? Do you?
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:56:38
As I said, if there are reasonable objections I'm sure they will work things out in due time without any drama on reddit.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:03:41
Jackass. Bitcoin has always been Gavin-less. It has always been leaderless.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:47:12
No, I am against BIP101. Period. I am not against a moderate increase in block size and hope there will be some form of consensus from this weekends conference.
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:41:01
Read the many excellent posts here on reddit by and on scalability and decentralization tradeoffs and you shall see. But you are one of those "increase the block size no matter what!" people, so I think you won't care much.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:38:09
First he complains that there are no counter-proposals. Then when he gets them he says they have no chance to be included so the hard fork he proposes should just happen!
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:34:49
Why would they? This is a technical talk. Sidechains is not even close to being deployed onto mainnet. If you want to speculate about some bullshit economic ramifications because you are butthurt that blockstream rightly fights Gavins blocksize increase proposal, then take it somewhere else.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:14:31
I think that the wait and see approach is the right approach, but it seems you think not. So lets agree to disagree =) 
Neither of us will know what the right call was until many years from now.
Thank you for being a reasonable debater at least.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:27:12
It doesn't look like Gavin the God and savior Mike is gonna get what they want.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:18:45
Nah, I'll just use Bitcoin with 1MB blocksize. You go to your GavinCoin with 20MB.

Poor dear. Go study some math and cryptography.

Holy shit! That really shows what wannabe-dictators they really are. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:23:52
Yeah what an idiot. He found a way to give everyone what they want. How dare he... He should just listen to almighty Mike and keep his pretty mouth shut... right? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:28:36
Exactly. And the only thing I care about is that consensus is reached. If there is no consensus, there is no hard fork. Else confidence in Bitcoin will plummet and we all lose.
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:34:29


Mike explicitly said he was not interested in participating. He is not interested in exploring alternatives. He seems to think its his way or the highway. How can you have a discussion with someone who don't want to discuss? Its mute anyway, as he has taken a job with big bankers. Probably just a matter of time before he distances himself from Bitcoin all together.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:48:03
Like Adam Backs 2-4-8 proposal?
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:36:23
Of course I can't force them, but they should be aware of the dangers of such a move without consensus.
And please don't claim that there is basically just one person who dont want this. In the technical community (the community that actually knows this stuff), there is widespread agreement (consensus) that this is the wrong thing to do.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:44:33
Some assumptions need to be made, of course, but things like predicting bandwidth 20 years from now is ludicrous. Conservative assumptions should be used to move this project along.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:14:18




I believe it can be worse as it will become more difficult to fix.


Hehe, mining centralization is bad, yes. I meant that the state of mining decentralization on the network is bad right now.
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:52:16
Luckily Bitcoin is permissionless, and they can try out a lot of stuff given support by the Bitcoin protocol. If you are correct that there are bad economic incentives, then Bitcoin is doomes anyway. What should be fought is the blocksize increase hardfork which is extremly bad for the network!
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:45:03

@_date: 2015-12-03 13:37:03
Without &gt;50% hashrate it doesn't matter what the economic majority thinks. Centralized checkpoint or change PoW algo would be necessary to fork off.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:25:36
There will be no fork if &gt;50% of the hashing power refuses to accept &gt;1MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:31:26
You think there is going to be big money being a node on the lightning network? lol
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:07:32
Of course full nodes are more resilient, the point is that the hubs cannot steal funds, nor is there anyone you have to register with to become one. These are the two most important attributes of decentralized system: a) Anyone can join b) no one can cheat. Wtf is your problem?
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:37:08
Simplifying this problem the way you do, clearly shows that you don't understand it.

@_date: 2015-12-26 06:57:47
Yeah. Pathetic to see Hearn claim that Gavin has spoken out against LN when he has expressed support for it. Even worse he is claiming that satoshi is against it even though he left the scene long before LN was even proposed.
@_date: 2015-12-08 13:58:02
New users should spend more time trying to make their own informed opinions. It is better to scare off some users who find it frightening to read a little bit extra beyond the popular opinion based on votes, rather than having those users believe what is popular is the correct thing.
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:18:40
That perfectly displays Gavin's incompetence. He doesn't understand how lightning works, yet badmouths it because he desperately wants his centralizing solution deployed. Talk about tunnel vision...
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:03:42
Right. Not agreeing with you make them clowns. Nice way of building consensus...
The significant minority that don't want the increase have valid reasons. You are just blind.

Looking through your posting history, I can see you are an expert on encouraging balanced discussions ;)

@_date: 2015-05-14 06:39:17
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:41:02
I agree. But hard forks need near unanimous consensus.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:18:02
You need to read up on LN some more. Channels can be open for years without being settled on the blockchain.
But you are right in that there is no implementation and it will take some time to get a working network up and running. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:26:31
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:09:45
But an implementation is being worked on and it is probably only a matter of time before we see a working proof-of-concept. And the whitepaper is clear on how it works and no one is disputing that so how is it rainbows and unicorns?
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:34:13
Quote from "Lightning still needs some level of transactions to establish, groom, reset, timeout, and reorganize channels. They're just not proportional to usage. One benefit of this is that these activities can pay fairly high fees without resulting in large overall net fees for users."
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:42:54
stopping the clock when blocks are full... beautiful! This was always a concern I had when I first heard of lightning
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:51:51
It will rely on intermediaries the same as Bitcoin relies on intermediaries in the form of miners.
It may be complex, but so is Bitcoin.
All protocol changes required are soft forks. And uncontroversial ones at that, unlike the block size increase proposal.
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:12:32
Yeah the paper is not easy to understand. Took me like 4 readings. Give it another read and see if it can change your mind =)
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:24:58


Interesting! Is that you :P
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:11:12
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:39:03
A single miner can deny your transaction, but cannot stop other miners from adding it.
In LN, if a node don't want to relay your payment, you can choose any other route through the LN to the recipient. The idea is that there should be enough intermediaries such that you can transfer payment without being censored.
So yes, it is basically the same, from a censorship-resistence point of view.

From rusty at rustcorp.com.au  Thu May 28 03:15:23 2015
From: rusty at rustcorp.com.au (Rusty Russell)
Date: Thu, 28 May 2015 12:45:23 +0930
Subject: [Lightning-dev] Use of hash chain instead of private key chain.
Message-ID: &lt;87siahwfxw.fsf
(Re-sent to new mailing list, for archival purposes)
Hi all,
	I hate list test messages, so this contains content :)
Adam suggested replacing the line of disposable keys with a line of
disposable hashes, which are faster (eg. H(N-1) = H(H(N)), H(1000000) =
&lt;random secret seed&gt;).
To recap:
	The Commitment Tx has an output to Alice-tmpkey and Bob, and Bob
gives Alice a signed 40-day timelocked Commitment Refund Tx. To
invalidate the commitment tx, Alice gives Bob Alice-tmpkey.
So the Commitment Tx output and Commitment Refund Tx serve three
1) If the commitment tx goes to blockchain, Alice can her money is N
   days (normal channel close).
2) If the commitment tx is invalidated, then goes to the blockchain,
   Bob (with Alice's tmpkey) can write a replacement commitment and
   steal the money.
3) If (1) Bob can help Alice get the money sooner if he wants to.
So we can't just replace Alice-tmpkey with Alice-preimage, since Alice
needs to reveal this to spend, and that would mean a race.  But we can
change the commitment tx output to allow immediate spend if Bob has the
pre-image, as follows:
	Alice's sig and relative-checklocktimeverify N days
	OR Bob's sig and hash preimage
Note that I snuck in RCLTV; it simplifies things.  This means that you
can invalidate the Commitment TX by giving Bob the hash preimage.  But
it does mean that (3) above is lost, so we probably want a mutual
agreement clause:
	Alice's sig and relative-checklocktimeverify N days
	OR Bob's sig and hash preimage
	OR Alice's sig and Bob's sig

Lets just say I take advantage of the low intelligence of users.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:14:08
Fuck Satoshi's vision! This religious path some have chosen must stop. Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful that Satoshi invented Bitcoin and gave it to the world, but he had no way of knowing how it would develop. Its not as if he had experimented with his invention on a large scale before he released it to the world. His writings is **not** gospel. People who take his writings as some holy truth that must be followed are no different than religious nutjobs who follow the bible, the quran or some other religious writings without any critical thinking.
People who say they bought into Bitcoin because of what he wrote are fucking stupid! They should have studied the technology and take it for what it is. A consensus system which is difficult to change.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:38:26
It can be gamed by regular users as well by spamming.
@_date: 2016-03-21 09:45:02
He surely has a lot of good stuff in his writings, but what I'm saying is that it should be analyzed and praised (or rejected) on their technical merit and not "because it was Satoshi who said it!!!111".
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:22:50
I think it was only his gmx mail that was hacked, and not his vistomail. The headers from that mail proved to be authentic. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:32:18
It will provide a greater benefit for multisig transactions, and BitGo (whom I read stood for more than half of all multsig transactions) have declared to be segwit ready the moment the soft fork is enforced. So I expect greater than the equivalent of a 2MB block size increase which should please Bobby if 2MB is what he desires.
@_date: 2015-05-28 06:21:35

@_date: 2016-01-15 14:13:45
Hello captain hindsight! Of course now that we now the price it was a good move to sell. What if the price rises again to 450 a week from now? It is pure speculation/fear that is driving the dump.
Nothing is falling apart. What CEOs are leaving? Mike Hearn? He is a jackass, not a CEO.

Keeping transactions small isn't a solution. Segwit actually **solves** it.
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:20:21
Then he should have included a hard-coded date or block height where the 1MB limit would cease to exist.
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:57:06
Since they are in fact mining classic blocks, I'd say their word means nothing.

@_date: 2015-05-29 18:26:29


And yet, this is what Gavin, Mike and their following want, because Satoshi wanted it 6 years ago...
Thank you for working on long-term Bitcoin, but I think you need to do what Gavin &amp; co is doing... lobbying businesses and pools to make sure they don't destroy Bitcoin as we know it.
I hope if Gavin plans on building on Bitcoin-XT, that he resigns from the current dev-team and give up any commit access there. It would be the only right thing to do.
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:50:05
Why assume something has been hacked if there is no indication of it? Satoshi never signed anything as far as I know. Perhaps he wants plausible deniability?
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:35:02
Just shows that it is extremely vulnerable to sybil attacks. Imagine a determined attacker who didn't create all identities at once, but over time.
Same can be done with full nodes which is why neither is a good way to measure consensus.
Besides, the operators of consider.it have a conflict of interest since they also run classic. I wouldn't trust what any of those polls say.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:40:48

@_date: 2016-03-01 11:26:29
I've been having the same problems lately. A bunch of confirmed transactions and no unconfirmed ones. I have felt so left out. I've been asking myself "Why do all of those reddit posters get to have uncofirmed transactions, but not me?" Glad to see I am not alone in this situation though! Stay strong!
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:59:03
Thanks for the answer. Just felt like this piece was made to martyrize Hearn.
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:11:51
That is true, but only in the case that miners want to make up their own new rules. In this case that is exactly what Gavin &amp; co proposes and if a significant amount of miners don't upgrade, then the change will not happen. So I would argue that in this case, the miners have the power to NOT make the change happen, even if all other nodes and and software makes the change.
@_date: 2016-03-19 08:08:36
I think he mistakenly thought he was on where his talking point is seen as gospel.

@_date: 2016-03-20 11:11:31


Anyone else find it funny when people say that segwits code is so complicated, but cannot refer to what about it is complicated? Something tells me these people don't even know where the code for segwit is available, nor have any actual programming skills.


This is why a soft fork is the most reasonable way to go. Wallet authors can take the time they need instead of having to be complete by a specific time.


It has been used for both P2SH and CLTV, and proven to work well.
So many more of these points are just pure FUD, I'm not even gonna bother addressing them.
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:07:34

That is some firstclass journalism there! Doxing AND accusations of being someone else. I am impressed. I wonder if he is on drugs...
Seems the "journalist" think I will attack users and steal coins, when I would never stoop so low. I will only attempt crash nodes. Preferably miners nodes, and perhaps making them create invalid blocks if I can find such a bug. Though I doubt many miners are stupid enough to actually run BU, except for Roger Ver of course.
Just to be clear, if I do find a bug in BU that allows theft of coins I will apply responsible disclosure and inform them.

@_date: 2016-06-30 14:11:37


Its even more adorable when someone tries to educate others with completely incorrect facts. The bitcoin protocol does **not** state that miners vote on forks. If they did, Satoshi would have made full nodes follow the miners blindly. They don't. They follow consensus rules first and foremost. Miners only have power over the ordering of transactions.
Go educate yourself darling. Go here for starters:

@_date: 2016-06-14 20:08:16
Are you feeling safe allowing BIP109 mining to continue once CSV has activated? Will you be taking any extra precautions, assuming classic will not release an update to allow miners to properly validate transactions?
@_date: 2016-06-15 12:28:42
Why did you not include it when you released 0.12.1? Why wait until the last possible moment? appears to apply a very long testing period before upgrading to any new versions based on how long it took them to upgrade to various soft fork versions in the past, including CSV.

@_date: 2015-08-06 06:08:18
It is important to note that Mike Hearn has suggested multiple centralizing propsals in regards to Bitcoin.
*For example centralized checkpoints if &lt;50% of miners agree to update to XT. 
*Changing consensus to allow miners to steal coinbases from other miners that include double-spends (would require a central authority that decides what transactions is the approved one)
*Implementing black-lists (or red-lists, but are effectively black-lists)
Mike Hearn should rightly be scolded and for proposing such ideas, and it is beyond me how people who like Bitcoin can get behind this guy.
Stick to Gavin if you want to idolize someone, but Hearn is pure poison.

No chinese miner agrees to use Bitcoin XT, they want to see consensus. They agreed 8MB would be OK, but not doubling every 2 years. Bitfury does not agree to anything larger than 2MB. The only miner I have seen that has directly supported Gavin and Mike's proposal is KnC. What pools are you referring to that is greater than 50% that will run XT?
No serious business would play games by using Bitcoin XT and risk the entire Bitcoin project. They are smarter than Gavin and Mike.
Mike even stated that if he doesn't get 75% consensus, that he would checkpoint the software itself to keep it on the "right" chain. Talk about not understanding what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:04:57

One attack vector on Bitcoin is double spending zeroconf txes. So you must be all for full-RBF by Peter Todd, because if there is an attack vector, then it must be used at some point to attack the network? Same with 51% attacks. At some point someone will attack the network so Bitcoin was doomed from the start?

lol indeed. I never said it was the perfect system for everything. Right now there is a lot of discussion about instant transactions (with regards to zeroconf transactions) and Bitcoin's ability to handle microtransactions. Many people require that Bitcoin must handle their cup of coffee purchases, which is the ideal use case for LN. No one is claiming it is a good system to use for purchasing houses and cars. Rather its for everyday low-value purchases at Brick&amp;Mortar stores that requires instant confirmations.
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:31:24
i have not enumerated all attacks on bitcoin and all attacks on LN so I dont know. Attacks on LN is difficult to enumerate as it isn't implemented in full yet. What is true is that LN can never be more secure than bitcoin because LN is running on top of bitcoin. No one has claimed that LN is more secure than Bitcoin anyways.

Agree with everything Adam says in those posts! He is a visionary and the fact that they hired someone to work on the lightning network shows that.
And Blockstreams interest lies with Bitcoin LONG-TERM success, so their interests are perfectly aligned with Bitcoin's development. Unlike Gavin and Mike who seem to think very short-term and expects nodes only to be operated in datacenters in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:09:41
Its a matter of trade-offs. If you want secure instant transactions you need LN. There is no such thing as secure instant transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the future when transactions fees are higher on the Bitcoin blockchain, you will need to pay less fees using LN.
And seriously, who gives a shit about votes on reddit??

The double-spend relay also helps people to double-spend. When people buy in physical locations, the seller will probably not force the buyer to wait for the transaction to confirm. So when the buyer leaves he can send a double-spend and rely on XT nodes to relay the double-spend to a full-RBF miner. Thanks Bitcoin-XT!
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:21:59

It wouldn't be a problem if most transactions can be made on the lightning network, then you would only need one blockchain transaction to anchor the LN channel and then have years worth of transactions occur through LN. The 25$ fee would divided by all transactions on LN make each transaction cheaper than what we pay for transactions today.

I don't know why I'm wasting my time on you, as you will undoubtedly not care about my response. But for the others reading:
Alice will close out a channel with a hub and specify that 10BTC of her money will go to Bill. This tx will be broadcast immediately if the hub is cooperative and Bill will not even know the BTC was locked up in LN. Alice may want to return the remaining BTC in the channel and re-open the payment channel with the hub in question immediately. She might have multiple channels open and in case one hub doesn't cooperate she could choose another hub to close the channel with to pay Bill.

Bullshit! It is other people who are working on improving it. For example libsecp256k1 which makes signature validation 6 times faster, segregated witnesses which allow ultra-pruning and work on introducing schnorr signatures that would allow even faster signature verification. Probably more I am missing right now.
Gavin and Mike have only proposed raising the blocksize. Gavin have talked a lot about IBLT for a LONG time, but have not showed any code for it. Hopefully we will see some soon if I understood him correctly from the IRC meeting two days ago.


Funny how Mike thinks lightning-like technology is a good idea if it comes from Satoshi, but when someone presents a protocol that may realize this, he scoffs at it, deems it too complex to work and that it shouldn't be made.
Kudos to Gavin though who initially misunderstood what lightning was about and deemed it stupid, but then gained some knowledge and changed his mind about it. That really shows character.

If they get reimbursed for voting for BIP101, they can just later say "fuck you, I just wanted the coins" and then switch back.

For a complete libconsensus that includes all consensus rules that you would recommend alternative node implementations to use.
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:49:22
Even if they are thorough, there may still be bugs in core that are yet to reveal themselves and are not present in btcd. btcd is pretty small right now, and especially no miners (I think) are using it, so if such a bug would be triggered it would only affect the few btcd nodes on the network that exist. If there were many more implementations and they were as decentralized as mining, and then a bug triggered it would be devastating to the network.
Remember, Pieter Wuille recently disclosed a bug where core on 32-bit and 64-bit OSes could fork!
I'm all for diversity, but consensus rules implementations should stay singular.

No just over the wishes of a bunch of loudmouths.
For the record I agree that the subject should be discussed, but at one point it was unbearable to be here because of some fanatics spending time upvoting every single blocksize thread and downvoting the rest. I want more diversity and I believe we have that now when there is a dedicated post for the blocksize question each day and the worst people have moved to kthxbye 
@_date: 2015-09-18 07:28:34
Its an interesting project. The biggest difference IMO is that it seems you need to trust a set of notaries not to collude and defraud you whereas the trust model in lightning is basically the same as plain Bitcoin.

Can we expect to see a BIP on flexcap anytime soon? I think it looks really promising.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:52:18
Basically what I'm saying is that if there are many different implementations of the consensus rules and a fork occurs, then no one knows which rule implementation they should follow and the hole thing breaks. Inconsistency in consensus rules implementation is the worst thing we can do in Bitcoin. Hopefully libconsensus will be released in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:27:54
Just look at Mike's past also.
* Proposed redlisting of coins
* Proposed forking without miner consensus by means of checkpointing
* Proposed punishing miners who don't follow a centralized authority's view of what transaction was seen first
Overall, just a very bad person to have in the Bitcoin project. Glad to see he is shooting himself with this whole XT-fiasco.

@_date: 2016-10-12 14:55:51
Given current types of transactions, segwit would provide more like 1.8 equivalent block size. It could give more if multisig would become more widely used, such as if lightning becomes utilized. 
You know you don't have to be embarrassed just because you don't understand something, right? You just have to educate yourself sweetheart.

If a majority of miners refuses to build upon &gt;1MB blocks, then the longest blockchain with &lt;1MB blocks will prevail. If you don't have a majority of miners, an economic majority wouldn't matter unless you change the PoW algorithm or make centralized checkpoints a la Hearn.

If the chain makes up more than 50% of the hashing power even XT nodes will end up converging with this chain eventually and orphaning the other blocks. They would need to checkpoint the first &gt;1MB block in order to stay on their fork.

Consensus critical bug found and solved with BIP62 by Pieter. Confidential transactions by Greg. CLTV by Peter Todd. Tree signatures by Pieter. CSV by Mark and btcdrak. Many improvements on the lightning network by Rusty and many others. RBF by Peter todd. And so much more just by looking at the work on the github.
What have Mike and Gavin done? Political lobbying and a small controversial blocksize increase patch. You wanna update your statement on who is making progress?
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:58:26
This. Its a pathetic propaganda piece. Mike is getting desperate.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:20:01
Thats crazy talk! The only solution is to increase the block size! EVERYONE KNOWS THAT!!
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:33:48
Definitely agree. Roger is a jackass. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:47:25
All I see is a desperate piece by a desperate man.

Looks as if we are stuck with CSW for now though. It was him 6 months ago, it is him now and I'm guessing he will be back in 6 months.
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:08:35
If you don't understand, I can't help you sweetheart. Go redo elementary school, and then get back to me.

Thats because there is usually too much noise to get a good signal here on reddit. Try reading the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Since the moderation started it is much easier to follow conversations, and a discussion on flexcap started there today.
@_date: 2015-11-10 12:43:43
Nah. They are just short-term greedy bastards. Good to know their stance. Much easier to boycott them now.
On the list are: Circle, Coinbase, BitPay. Have I missed any obvious ones?
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:03:50
Couple this with the fact that Gavin is not exactly an expert on crypto.
@_date: 2016-05-06 11:23:27


Good idea! Ping Dont know if the others are on reddit.
Remember that many of the Core devs have already answered this here:  including Wlad, Greg, Pieter and Luke.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:12:16


Evidently not.

Pretty much only people who are investing are joining in, and they will either leave their bitcoins on the exchanges until they sell or move them once to a cold storage address. Doubt this bull run will mean more people using bitcoin in their everyday lives...
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:37:38
All I see here is a propaganda piece from a desperate man. Moving on.
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:59:40
Andresen I could see stepping in trying to tame the XT-crowd. He does so every once in a while, but Hearn is a lost cause. Hearn will antagonize and talk down every chance he gets. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:14:42
Yes, it gives them the power to innovate even more. Better stop them!
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:40:29
Oh my, how dumb you can be. When a user utilizes segwit, they will enjoy the full scaling benefits. Even those that don't upgrade will benefit somewhat by those upgrading moving their witnesses outside the 1MB block size.
Please... you are embarrassing yourself sweetheart.
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:41:31
Don't interact with that jackass. He doesn't understand you, nor does he have any intention in trying to understand you. Just ignore him.
@_date: 2016-10-13 11:50:53


I agree with you. However, when the one you are speaking with only qualifies for an IQ as that of a worm, there isn't really much of a point in trying to explain things.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:50:22
Never said it wasn't controversial nor that it isn't complex. I was just correcting the statement that for greater transaction throughput to happen, one would need a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:51:42
He doesn't have commit access.
@_date: 2016-05-11 11:49:59
If that happens in a hard fork scenario the other chain could continue to exist. Not so with a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-10-30 08:36:34
Hilarious! "China is the new China"

Only Rusty Russell works on lightning for Blockstream. Poon et al are independent.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:26:31
Why do you disagree? From a security pov it makes perfect sense. It seemed like it was just a matter before it happened anyway. Should they have reinstated him, only to remove him again after a couple of weeks?
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:30:21


Interesting here is that Mike Hearn is an advisor for Circle. I guess we can see a conflict of interest here...
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:40:08
Anyone else find it weird that Jon Matonis is one step ahead of his announcements?
@_date: 2016-05-11 11:33:21
Technically when &gt;50% are voting in favor for it, they could agree to a lower threshold and start orphaning other blocks until the 95% is reached. I doubt this will happen though. Maybe if they are around 90% and a long time passes without any change.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:21:03
Indeed! He can't even handle certificates on his blog. Try going to 
And yet, we expect him to positively identify Satoshi via cryptographic keys? Would have been better to send Todd or Maxwell who would have thought of ways he could try to trick them.
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:27:07
Nice! Imagine if we could have a million btc verifiably locked for 5 years
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:50:49
Yeah, it feels like I'm in the fucking twilight zone.
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:04:28


You certainly don't! Its all open source. Anyone can fork it. There are at least two other implementations. Start with reading the summary of the technology at lightning.network, and hold off commenting until you are a little bit wiser...
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:05:52
They also make stupid analogies to coffee, highways and websites. And these people should be listened to??
