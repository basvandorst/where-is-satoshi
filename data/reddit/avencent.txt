No one can guarantee the price rising again, but I highly doubt crypto will die because of this. I hope many of the shitcoins die off but the true tech is here to stay.

If you sell now you lose, simple as that. There have been many crashes and there will always be crashes in the future. I don't understand the people selling at a loss, they're literally throwing money away.

Wait it out. Thousand others are having the same issue as you

Most of the time yes but with bull runs there are always pullbacks. What I meant was whenever you buy at a high there is a 50/50 chance it could pullback the next day.

But previous corrections had nowhere near the amount of volume it has now, with all the increased volume it's also increasing the volatility, I hope a correction doesn't wipe out too much of it but at this point would a correction to $10k be that crazy ? It was only at $5k last month.

I understand, from what I see many people are holding since 2018 is looking to be a huge year for crypto.

Look for a bat file, could have the miner settings including your pool address and account.
Hope you find something :)

No point trying. Even if you got it out you'd end up with nothing due to fees. If this small amount is really important I suggest you don't invest anymore until you have yourself sorted financially. Please be responsible

It's because you bought close to the ATH, basically 50/50 on the price going up or down at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:18
I'm sure many would.

It does worry me, I see people on facebook that don't even know what bitcoin does wanting to spend thousands... it's the blind leading the blind into a scary market. They need to know what they are getting into.

No one knows. Odds are it isn't but the market is unpredictable so always consider that you could get screwed by it.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:47:43
Must have sold at an all-time low lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:11:02
Exactly, I understand people spending thousands with money that they had sitting around because the upside potential is worth it. But people pulling money out of retirement funds etc is so dangerous. 
Borrowing towards investments is by far the worst, many of these people don't understand the long term damage debt will have on them.

No one knows if it's going to crash. It's completely your choice don't follow others. Odds are there will be a correction but judging from past data it has always recovered to a new high... But that doesn't guarantee the future.

Good idea, you will most likely still make a great return but with a sensible and safe amount of money. 
The odds are you would still make a huge return if you dropped every penny you have but is it really worth the risk and constant anxiety for it.
