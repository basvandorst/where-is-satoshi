Well there’s a new app out there that is giving away $25 free btc to any new us-based customer. I downloaded it and tried it and it works pretty well. Free Btc takes 30 days to get to you and 60 days thereafter to be eligible to be withdrawn. It’s called Voyager App and seems to have some weight behind it. They charge no fees, but instead (allegedly) scour the top 10 exchanges to get you the best deal and the split the cost savings with you.

You can use bitcoin to purchase the Smartlands security token offerings. Using cryptocurrency to buy cryptosecurities backed by real property. 
It’s not directly related to bitcoin, but it’s a great way for bitcoin holders to convert their btc gains into fractional ownership in land. I’d say that concept in general would apply to this sub. 
It’s not some moonshot either. They have a live security token offering for fractional ownership in a student apartment building in England right now. All compliance is in place, etc. 
Was kinda surprised to see Smartlands posted here, but happy nonetheless.

Not really. When you earn interest it is income. It is taxable when you receive it. Then, if you later sell it for a loss that’s a loss. If you later sell it for a profit then you owe tax on the profit from the sale price vs how much you received (tax basis).
You receive $100 in btc interest one month. That $100 is taxable as income (probably not dividends). Then you sell that $100 in btc for $200. That is another taxable event of $100 profit (you already paid tax on the first $100, so you only owe tax on the remaining $100 profit). If you had sold the $100 btc for $50 instead of $200 then you would have a loss of $50 which would be offset by the $100 gain you originally had.

1. The 6% APY has turned out to be more like 18% APY in USD value due to bitcoin’s price increase.
2. It’s not BlockFi’s bitcoin. That is entirely ludicrous. You don’t lose your vested property interest in something just because someone else holds it for you. When you loan money to someone at a certain interest rate, as people like me are doing for BlockFi, then you have a legal right to repayment of the principle plus the interest promised. It’s an offer and acceptance issue under the law. 
This is kinda what I mean when I said the “not your keys not your coins” folks can seem a bit Puritan. To them, any form of third party custody has the same net effect as not owning the property anymore. While it’s a great lesson and one that people should understand when it comes to shady exchanges and pump and dump scams, it really has little basis in reality when you are dealing with regulated entities and courts of law. This notion that BlockFi can just take your coin because you gave them your keys is insane. Is it possible you might lose your coins due to bankruptcy of the company? Sure, but you would get a cut of the remaining assets at least. That’s part of an investment.  If you think they can just say “lol our keys now sucker cya” then you don’t understand how courts and laws work imo.

Sounds similar to a living trust or revocable trust. You would need to find some licensed brokerage entity that allowed for pay on death accounts to avoid probate. Vanguard has this option and you can buy GBTC on there which is a bitcoin trust. Not the same thing as physical btc, but at least your shares are backed by cold storage btc. Just an idea. GBTC basically tracks the price of btc.
Probably safer than hoping when you die that your loved one gets your private keys and nobody else interferes or obtains them first.

It doesn’t matter if it’s insured or not. You’re telling me if I lend you my very expensive bbq grill to use at your house for a weekend party and you trash it, destroy it, or lose it, that I have no legal recourse against you? That’s completely false. Now it may not be insured, so I can’t just get paid automatically by an insurance company, but that person is still legally liable for my loss. I can sue them and get a judgment and take their bank accounts or have a sheriff auction their personal property until I am repaid. The only time this doesn’t work is when the person has no assets to take (just like I said above where you risk losing your money in the event or bankruptcy of the company). That’s called trying to get blood from a stone.
But to sit here and suggest that because someone on the planet holds your btc for you that they can take it whenever they want without consequences is flat out wrong. You are being a purist about this and giving misleading and false information. If the company goes bankrupt? Yes you lose your money and get in line as a creditor with the bankruptcy court. However, for you to tell people that putting their bitcoin on a licensed and regulated website to earn interest means you are giving it away and the ceo can buy himself a new house and never pay you back is a total fantasy. If they steal your coins they owe you those coins legally. If the executives perpetrate fraud they are personally liable and you can pierce the corporate veil and take their personal assets like their house and cars until you are repaid. This is done every day in the real world. BlockFi has multiple millions of dollars. It would cost them more money to fight a lawsuit then it would be to make me whole.

I can say I used TurboTax and imported my coinbase data and tried my best to report applicable tx. The problem is when you send btc off coinbase it counts as a tx on the coinbase imported data, but you wouldn’t report this because you just sent it to yourself (in the case of a hardware wallet). So I went through my sale history manually on my phone and reported my fiat cashouts.
Regardless, I keep checking every day for the letter but so far nothing has come. So maybe you’re right? 
If people were cashing out crypto on coinbase in large quantities and not reporting it they are going to be feeling some pain over this.
Edit: just wanted to clarify I disagree with poster above me who says “use random numbers.” That means you’re even more screwed if they audit you. Just be honest and play by the rules. If bitcoin is going to deliver massive gains then you can pay taxes on those massive gains like everyone else. You pay taxes on your crappy salary and your meager stock market gains, but you won’t pay taxes on 300% increase in 7 months because that’s somehow unfair?

Honestly this whole issue is why we need custody providers. People who will have multiple millions of dollars of crypto assets will want to make damn sure it passes according to their wishes. This will be accomplished through estate planning attorneys who will recommend custodial solutions because the result is guaranteed and insured. 
Hoping that your loved one gets the keys before someone else in the event you die untimely in a car accident isn’t the best estate plan. Just saying. Custodial solutions and written estate planning documents will cement the heir’s vested right to the property and make it enforceable in a court of law. That is the preferred outcome imo.

Cash app or coinbase is good. Eventually if you buy enough you will want a hardware wallet to hold your crypto. The problem with keeping it on cash app or coinbase is that you don’t actually control it. The website could lock your account or freeze it. When it’s on a hardware wallet it is held directly by you without any third party.
Ledger Nano S is only like $65 now. That’s just an example of one hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:30:35
I have the majority of my btc on a hardware wallet, but I also bought some GBTC in my vanguard account just because.
At least GBTC has the bitcoin in trust held in Gemini cold storage and it’s verifiable. So as GBTC grows and buys more bitcoin to put into the trust, those bitcoins will essentially be locked up for a long time and not available on the physical crypto market.

Btc is taxed no differently than any other commodity like copper or silver or gold. When you hold an asset longer than 1 year it is taxed as “long term capital gains” which can be 0-20% depending on your situation, but odds are you’ll be 15%.
If you hold it less than a year, it’s taxed at your current effective rate, i.e., it’s treated as regular income just like wages. In that situation you pay whatever rate you pay based on your income.
Your state, if it has income tax, will likely get a cut as well.

Halving means new supply (block reward) is cut in half. Because you own paper bitcoin, your holdings will end up reflecting whatever happens to the price after the halving.

Don’t keep bashing something just because it’s beyond your own personal risk tolerance. Many people believe even owning bitcoin to be risky. They are obviously wrong, as are you. BlockFi has made me quite a lot of btc so far so use it or don’t, it doesn’t affect me. I was just sharing my experiences and my reasons for using the service.
Sometimes you “not your keys not your coins” guys can be a little too Puritan. This isn’t some exit scam. It’s a legit regulated company that uses the cold storage custody solution provided by Gemini. If you truly believe Gemini is going to take your bitcoin from you then you are paranoid imo.

I have received on time payments every month. The withdraw function seems to work just fine. All in all thumbs up from me. In fact next interest payment in a few days.
When I started with them, btc was like $4000 ish? Maybe $5k? Regardless, as the price of btc goes up, the effective interest rate does too. I get paid 6% btc per year, but the usd value of that 6% could be much greater in the future. So if I just let it sit and accumulate the 6% now, in 10 years every one of those interest payments might actually have been a much higher % in usd because of price increase.
It’s like the reverse of the people where you buy a pizza with 10k btc and hate your life when it goes up. Here I put in $5k at the time so my accrued interest payments should be worth about 6% of $5k. Yet if btc keeps going up over time, my $5k investment has yielded me insane interest payments well above 6%.
I don’t hold all my btc on there just in case, but BlockFi is backed up by Gemini cold storage so it’s more legit than other custodial options imo.

Smartlands is the utility token that is used to run the platform. The platform produces 100% legally compliant securities in the form of security tokens that are tradeable 24/7 just like crypto, but also represent legal fractional ownership of real property.
By crowdfunding fractional ownership of real estate, the illiquidity discount in real estate (the cheaper prices due to how hard it is to sell real estate and the headache associated with finding investors for it) goes away. Capturing that 5-10% illiquidity discount is what all STOs will end up doing. Smartlands is just one vehicle.
PS: There’s only 7.1 million Smartlands tokens, and they get locked up as more users hold securities.

Sounds like an irrevocable transaction, but that would technically be custodial as well because you’re relying on someone else to execute the transaction even if you change your mind. If you want to be able to stop it whenever you want, you can do that but then it won’t be irrevocable. You just change your mind.
Your idea doesn’t really work non-custodially because it necessarily requires a third party to trigger the event because you’ll be dead. How else can a wallet or otherwise know you’re dead unless someone else tells it? 
I guess you could set up a tx of “send all contents to this address at this time,” but you would be able to stop it whenever you wanted.

I did some research myself and thought it was pretty cool. The app also offers deposits/withdraws so you can very much withdraw your crypto to a private wallet. They claim to charge no fees.
The only drawback I saw was the free btc takes up to 30 days to be credited, and then can’t be withdrawn for 60 days. So basically 3 months to withdraw the free btc.

Robinhood has you owning a paper share of bitcoin basically. It’s a derivative. You cannot withdraw the bitcoin and you do not physically own it. You own a speculative position in it based on the price at the time you bought. 
Now if you are only after pure fiat gains, and Robinhood has no fees, then you can trade speculatively on Robinhood, but you won’t ever actually be owning bitcoin.
If you want to join the crypto revolution and own your own bitcoin that can’t be censored or frozen then you need to buy real crypto and store it on a wallet you control. Preferably a hardware wallet. You can purchase bitcoin numerous ways, but Robinhood isn’t one of them.

You could make a movie or a story about bitcoin set in the future. The world has become overrun with bitcoin elites and the dream of crypto currency helping the poor masses is all but gone. Bitcoin has largely become an asset of the elite and the poor can barely earn a few satoshis.
Until, however, one day our unlikely hero stumbles upon a clue to unlocking the greatest treasure trove ever to exist: Satoshi’s Wallet. Apparently the masterminds who created bitcoin centuries before also had the foresight that their experiment might be used by those with ill intentions. Therefore, they created an elaborate set of puzzles and clues hidden throughout [the world? The blockchain? Whatever]. The point is our hero, in a cross between Robin Hood and Indiana Jones, must find the keys to set the world free.

BlockFi offers 6.2% APY on bitcoin deposits.
As for the why? Let’s say I hold 10 btc, and I need to come up with $20k for a major life event or some other expense. I can sell $20k in btc, thus potentially never actually getting it back if price spikes. Or, I can use my btc as collateral for a reasonable interest loan and pay back the loan in fiat over time. This way I don’t lose my seed btc. 
Of course the counter is that you are paying interest in the loan scenario that could have been used to buy more btc. So ask yourself, would you rather sell $20k and try to DCA back in, or just take a fiat loan and pay interest on the loan in fiat?

Plus can we get rid of this notion that only “1%” got tax cuts. It’s not true it’s a repeated media talking point. Everyone’s checks got bigger when that bill was passed, even people making in the $30k range.
Second, if you actually read some articles about the tax cuts and property deduction rules, many rich people in liberal states are complaining about paying significantly more taxes due to capping the SALT deduction (state and local taxes). Before where a rich person in California might pay $1 million in state taxes, they could deduct those state taxes from their federal income taxes. The net effect of this was to have federal taxpayers in other states subsidizing the revenue lost from the deduction of California’s high taxes. But now, the wealthy are moving out of New York and California because they can’t deduct all SALTs anymore, so their net tax bill has gone way up. Sound like a tax break?

I believe whole heartedly what I said in my other post. Attitudes like yours harm the space because it comes from a place of lack of knowledge. It’s very simple really, 2 options:
1. If the entire company goes under then yeah you get in line in bankruptcy court just like anybody else on any other startup ever. It doesn’t mean it’s a scam. It means people chose to invest and were willing to tolerate the risk. Quite frankly based on BlockFi’s backers and the insane amount of money it has raised I don’t understand why anyone believes it’s going bankrupt. Regardless, doesn’t make it a scam.
2. The company doesn’t go under but for some reason targets only your money. They take or lose only your coins. No big deal, it’s a super simple fix because the company is liable to you. Regulators and courts will come down on them so hard you wouldn’t believe. So in that case you get compensated.
Compare with “I held my own coins and they just disappeared what can I do??” You know...the posts we see almost every other day on this subreddit. Still waiting for a single post on this subreddit of a licensed regulated custodian stealing people’s money.

It’s part of the risk analysis that every investor has to make for themselves. Many people would say about bitcoin the same crap you are saying now. 
There is a difference between “it’s a scam” and “there’s an amount of risk just like investing in any asset class.”
Holy crap.
Here’s a hint: your coins are never truly safe. I’d rather have them held by Gemini cold storage tbh than many other forms of holding coins. 
What do you see more of on this sub? People posting how they lost everything because they tried holding their own coins? Or people who lost everything from a regulated company who uses Gemini cold storage? Gtfoh.

You people are total extremists sometimes you know that? FWIW I’m an attorney and I use it with my own money. 
Sometimes you bitcoin purists give bad advice to people. You prevent them from otherwise engaging in the space because of unfounded fears. Everything is a scam to this sub it’s really sad.
Here’s a hint. They are a licensed and regulated company. They can’t just steal your coins you fools. If they do they are liable to you for those coins. The basic principles of law don’t just disappear because you are investing in crypto. It’s not like “oh well that regulated company stole my coins now I have no recourse because a bunch of incel autists in the btc subreddit told me so.”
No. They have a fiduciary duty with your crypto and they can’t just spend it or lose it. If they do they owe you and they will lose in court. I have no concerns whatsoever about that.
Now is it possible that the company goes under and you have to get in line with bankruptcy court? Sure!! But that’s the same for any startup.

“Schemes” “aren’t safe”
And yet I’m the cunt? You are lying to people. That’s why I’m upset. You are a purist that lies to people and quite frankly people like you and the attitude of people like you on this sub do more HARM to the space than good. You scare people away and tell them this lie that their coins are safer with them than regulated custodians. The likelihood of a regular person on this sub losing their own coins is far far far greater than the likelihood of someone losing their coins with licensed regulated custodial solutions. Because even if the custodian screws you, the courts have your back.
But what do I know? It’s not like I’m licensed to give advice about this kind of stuff. Pretty sure if you advised someone “hold your own coins” even though they aren’t sophisticated enough to understand it, and then they lose those coins, you’re facing a malpractice suit. I’m sorry I live in the real world.

I already own a Casa node. I was just asking hypothetically about mining small amounts of sats. I’m not some lunatic on the fringe of selling the house to buy a shitty miner. I enjoy participating in the space and I wanted to find a way to maybe generate some sats now passively for a small amount of electricity. The idea is that the small investment now may pay off down the road. Yes I could just buy bitcoin instead but that’s boring.
I was also interested in using solar power for the small miner. “Microminer” should be the company whenever someone realizes it’s not bad idea and many crypto hobbyists would buy a reasonably priced small miner that doesn’t bankrupt their electric bills.

I am interested in generational wealth for my children and family. I will be long gone in 2140 when the last bitcoin is mined, but hopefully my children and their children will live on and have the coins I accumulated now.
Likewise, many people would say they have seen inflation affect them in their time. My grandparents easily remembered 5cent hamburgers at McDonald’s. You should look at average prices of goods in 1919 vs 2019. Even 1950 vs 2019 is an extreme disparity.

Actually bitcoin is only $170 billion market cap. You are using total crypto market cap.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:03:39
It’s not guaranteed. If bitcoin price spikes, it could mean people are selling eth to buy btc. You should view the two’s relationship as a percentage.
For example at all time high btc was $19k and eth was $1300. Therefore one eth was worth about 7 percent of one bitcoin. Compare to now, where 1 btc is $8200 and 1 eth is $180. Eth is now only worth 2.2% of a bitcoin.
Long story short, prices also move relative to one another. There isn’t a guaranteed correlation that 100% btc increase means 100% eth increase.

My job is to protect the person who is seeking advice from me. Advising people to hold their own coins when they probably aren’t sophisticated enough to do so safely is not in their best interest.

Whatever service you are using is a scam. 15% is totally inappropriate. You’re looking at .25% or .5% fees on legit exchanges such as Gemini or coinbase pro. Cash app has a 1% price spread or so, so you’ll pay fees on there.
99% of legit exchanges allow you to withdraw your crypto for free. Then once you send it to your own wallet you can set custom fees to send it again. For example you can send with lowest fees possible and pay almost nothing to transfer the bitcoin. It may take a few hours or so, but it will get there.

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is what it sounds like you want to do. Basically buying in regular intervals over time is the best way to “time” the market. It lets you buy the dips when they come because you just keep buying at regular intervals even if it’s a small amount of money.
Make sure you have a secure wallet and do not lose your private key and/or seed phrase. There are lots of people out there who got into bitcoin early on and then forgot about it and ended up throwing away and losing lots of bitcoin. Don’t become like them. Don’t keep everything digitally. Hardware fails over time. 
Lastly, understand the philosophy of the cypherpunk movement and crypto. Bitcoin is freedom money. Nobody controls it except algorithms and math. No third party can stop you from sending it (value) around the world. Visa and PayPal can’t deplatform you because they don’t like your politics. Governments can’t freeze your account. So long as you have internet and your private key nobody can stop you from making a transaction and sending value instantly anywhere on earth. That’s a game changer.

So where exactly did all those magical new dollars come from? From a bank who printed them. What happens when banks print money? It increases the money supply!! What happens when the money supply increases? Your share of the whole, and thus your purchasing power relative to all dollars, DECREASES. Unless of course all that nice new bank money is distributed proportionally amongst people who own dollars. Because we all know when banks print money they give it to regular people to ensure the wellbeing of the regular people.
Long story short, your own response to me discredits your beliefs. Fiat has lost value because they print more of it. Bitcoin can never have more than 21 million printed. It’s mathematically impossible.
So let’s do more math? If bitcoin supply is fixed, but fiat keeps getting printed, what must happen to the price of bitcoin? It must go up just like the stock market. Stocks will always keep going up because they keep printing money which in turn ends up in the markets.

Gonna be a super unpopular comment, but this situation makes the case for having the OPTION to store your crypto with regulated trusted third parties. I know that’s evil in btc land (not your keys not your coins), BUT, I think there is value in having insured, regulated, and guaranteed third party storage to prevent these types of situations. It must be voluntary though.
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:07:40
Trusted custody solutions will solve this. I know it’s the boogeyman of crypto holders, but the option should exist. Banks would actually be pretty good at this and could incorporate numerous fail safes that would prevent these kinds of losses. Why can’t crypto be treated like a stock holding if you wanted it to?

@_date: 2019-02-13 02:45:20
I agree with commenter. Even if they were lying and they work a fee into the price, it’s much better mentally to not even see the fee. The prices I buy at are reasonable given the large spread of btc prices across worldwide exchanges. A few dollar difference in btc price won’t even be noticed by me. Sticking it in my face like coinbase? Creates resentment.

Look man, it’s not a popular opinion on here sometimes, but if you really just want to buy your first bitcoin and feel safe, you can use the big players like coinbase, Gemini, cash app, kraken, etc. 
Those websites will onboard you and allow you to buy a small amount of bitcoin so you can say you own some. In time as you learn more about buy more you should look into managing your own keys and withdrawing your bitcoin off the exchange. For a total beginner who wants to just dabble and put a small amount of money in...start with one of the very well known exchanges imo. NOT BINANCE.

Bro, $15k in a retirement account is nothing. That’s pennies. Not even really a retirement account. That’s a halfass investment account.
Just FYI, it’s terrifying, but you need to be aiming for about a million or more dollars in your retirement accounts by the time you hit retirement age. So if you’re young, say under 28, it’s probably okay to not have any money or any retirement. But you need to start that shit ASAP once you hit 30. Get a 401k and max out the matching, or at least get a Roth IRA (if you think you’ll be rich later in life), or a Traditional IRA (if you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket at retirement).

Yep, same as with any investment in a company. I’m taking the risk because I trust the people involved and I believe the model works well. They lend the btc out to exchanges for liquidity and share the interest with you.
I also plan on using the loan function at some point. By using their loan system I don’t have to sell crypto to access capital. You post 2x the loan amount as collateral and then it’s an interest-only loan for 12 months with principle due in full after 12 months. Because the loan is collateralized it isn’t reported to any credit bureaus and doesn’t affect your credit report. I think that’s a really cool feature.
Oh yeah, and I have some GUSD on there earning 8.6% APY because my savings account rate of .25% just wasn’t cutting it.

I keep my bitcoin with a custodian (BlockFi) because it pays me 6.2% APY in bitcoin, and I can use the service to take loans on my crypto if i need cash. This allows me to get cash out of my crypto without having to sell it.

Its not so much that they lose it, as it is more easily compromised.

Much different scenario if using a hardware wallet.

BlockFi is a service that you deposit your crypto with them and they pay you 6.2% interest. So if you have 1 btc on there you earn .062 btc per year. If you deposit GUSD (Gemini dollars) you get paid 8.6% interest.

Focus on how bitcoin is a sovereign currency not subject to control by any one person or nation. How it can be transferred instantly from one impenetrable vault to another impenetrable vault anywhere on earth, instantly. How it’s backed by mathematics and algorithms. In these times there is value in such a currency. The maximum number of bitcoins is already set at 21 million. The same can’t be said for fiat. If fiat was fixed McDonald’s would still be charging 5 cents for a burger and a Ford would be a few hundred dollars. Instead they keep printing and printing. This devalues your savings. Imagine if someone buried $100k in the ground 100 years ago for their descendants. Does anyone think that money has the same value now?

My thought process would be that nothing changes with QC. Current encryption is based on cryptography that is able to be done with current systems. Sure, if an advanced QC had to break an older encryption, it could happen. However, what happens when QC can encrypt 512, or 1028, or beyond?
My point is, if current computers can create an encryption so strong that current computers can’t break it, wouldn’t a QC be able to create an encryption so strong that a QC can’t break it?

Don’t listen to this person. They think they know, but they obviously don’t. The only thing holding up Bakkt is a pending petition for administrative rule waiver filed by bakkt. There’s a current administrative regulation providing that an exchange/seller of futures must use a 3rd party “warehouse” to hold the goods. This ensures legitimacy and that the goods actually exist. So when you buy coffee or wheat or oil, you know that an independent 3rd party has the goods for you so you don’t get scammed or ripped off.
Bakkt has petitioned the CFTC to waive this rule requirement and allow Bakkt itself to warehouse the bitcoin. This will likely be approved as Bakkt has a strong reputation. It’s not like some Pakistani startup is asking for the waiver, ICE is. Regardless, I predict the waiver will be granted bc ICE is trusted, and because the blockchain allows for independent verification and auditing functions even if Bakkt warehouses its own btc.
Lastly, the CFTC must approve the waiver, but even if they do there’s still a public comment period afterward prior to final rule waiver adoption by the CFTC.
Oh, and since “Bakkt is never happening” according to haters and shills, here’s a link to Bakkt’s futures info. Because obviously you create websites for things that will never be approved.

Look, all I’m saying is I have personally advised agency heads about rule waiver petitions. Bakkt is not some shady startup. You are crossing all sorts of different things that aren’t connected. SEC isn’t involved in this. CFTC is. The issue isn’t physically-backed settlement, the issue is can Bakkt warehouse it itself. Security is easily enough dealt with through cyber best practices and liability insurance in the event people do somehow get hacked. Bakkt’s owner is ICE, who also owns the NYSE. Don’t you think the owner of the NYSE, who hasn’t been hacked, can be trusted to secure bitcoins, or at least to purchase sufficient insurance to ensure regulators consumers will be protected? Come on man. 
This is a personal pet project of the ICE CEO and his wife, the CEO of Bakkt. This dude revolutionized electronic stock trading and modern market exchanges. He’s about to do it with crypto too.

Their CEO published an update on New Year’s Eve. They got $182 million investment from approx 10 companies, but indicated they expect launch in 1st quarter 2019.
There is currently an issue regarding an administrative rule waiver. Long story short the commodities commission has a rule that the exchange generally has to “warehouse” the commodity somewhere safe with a 3rd party. Think coffee, wheat, etc. There needs to be secure storage that is audited to confirm the commodities exist to backup physical-delivery futures contracts.
Bakkt has asked for a waiver of this rule so it can warehouse bitcoin itself. I think they will get the waiver because the blockchain is easily audited and they can show they own the coins backing up the futures.
TLDR, the government has to approve a waiver allowing bakkt to warehouse the bitcoin itself rather than using some 3rd party. I suspect bakkt will be deemed trustworthy enough to do this, and then will launch. I know of no other holdups besides this.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:20:08
From the August 2018 Fortune article about Bakkt:
“Bakkt is the brainchild of Jeff Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and CEO of ICE, and a disrupter par excellence. Sprecher (pronounced “Sprecker”) stands alone as the leading force in modernizing the world’s exchanges in recent years from open-outcry pits into super-efficient electronic marketplaces. Along the way, Sprecher built a flailing electricity exchange that he reportedly purchased for $1 into a global trading and data empire now worth $44 billion. “In 25 years he’s gone from nothing to the most powerful exchange entrepreneur in the world,” says Larry Tabb, chief of consultancy the Tabb Group. “He hasn’t failed yet.””

This is about the identity of the people proposing the project more than it is about the project. If some Pakistani startup was saying they were going to do Bakkt I would say “yeah ok good luck.” But this isn’t some startup. This is a world leader in digital trading who revolutionized stock trading now looking to disrupt the crypto industry. 
Once bakkt launches, big money can begin to safely play. I saw a video of a workgroup where ICE’s CEO was talking to some other people and one of the people pointed out, correctly so, that old timey Wall Street types look at a “crypto kid” with his big brimmed hat and glasses and think “I’m not giving my money to this kid.” 
Bakkt will be the bridge between the crypto kids and the real money. Some people say that’s bad, some say it’s good. I think fiat is here to stay so I intend to sell like 50-70% of my btc during the next bull run.

Rule waivers can absolutely be denied, but then they are subject to judicial review for whether the denial was an abuse of discretion/irrational. Regardless, you are acting like the CONCEPT of Bakkt is pending approval. It isn’t. What’s pending approval is the warehousing rule waiver. Otherwise there is no difference between btc as a commodity and wheat or oil or corn. It’s just physical property being exchanged with physical settlement. There is nothing special about bitcoin. There’s already approved cboe bitcoin futures as you mentioned.
Now, it seems pretty irrational to me to deny Bakkt a warehousing waiver when the blockchain is public and independently verifiable. Regulators can just watch Bakkt’s accounts and verify that they hold the btc they say they do. The approval will be granted, mark my words. It won’t be for a while though because of the public comment process involved. I’m guessing given the shutdown probably Q2 or Q3 of this year.
As for source? 
“Specifically, the CFTC must grant an exemption for Bakkt’s plan to custody bitcoin on behalf of its clients in its own “warehouse,” according to sources familiar with regulatory discussions of the plan. CFTC regulations normally require that customer funds be held by a bank, trust company or futures commission merchant (FCM).
The agency’s staff has finished reviewing Bakkt’s exemption request and passed it to the commission on Friday, one source said. Now the commissioners have to vote on whether to put out the proposal for public comment. After the 30-day comment period, the commissioners would likely take at least a couple days to read the comments, and then vote on the proposal itself.”
Here’s the regulation allowing the CFTC to waive rules:
If you think I’m lying why don’t you just send the CFTC a FOIA request for the petition for rule waiver?

Yes, because anyone who disagrees with any talking point left of John Kasich is a Nazi. Because people who vote for less government control somehow support government rounding people up based on their race and throwing them into camps (which makes 0 sense because removing power from government would prevent that from ever happening).
Hint: The only president in history to ever round up American citizens based on race and throw them into camps definitely wasn’t one of those “Nazis” voting for less government. He was a member of the party that today accuses everyone ELSE of being Nazis.

Sure! Bakkt will be a physically settled 1-day bitcoin futures contract. Meaning you buy the btc and get it at the end of the day in your Bakkt wallet which you can then withdraw. It’s unlike cboe futures product which is basically cash-settled (paper bitcoin).
Bakkt’s parent company (ICE) is credited with helping disrupt the online securities trading markets. The CEO of ICE has Bakkt as a pet project of his (his wife is CEO of Bakkt). This will assure institutional investors like 401ks and investment funds that they can buy crypto and trust bakkt to hold it like you would allow a brokerage to hold your stocks.
Microsoft and Starbucks are involved as well. Bakkt isn’t just an exchange. If you read the below Starbucks link you’ll see how Bakkt wants to create digital ecosystems for crypto. 
Here’s some good info to read:

Bakkt is a trusted provider in exchanges offering to warehouse its own goods. Warehousing is a term of art in the commodities future world, but it means holding and securing the asset. Normally the exchange itself has to use 3rd party warehousers who can hold and verify the commodities exist, so settlement (transfer) can take place. It prevent people from selling goods they don’t have, just like the current cboe bitcoin futures. They trade paper bitcoin so the supply never comes into play.
By having Bakkt warehouse its own bitcoin AND physical settlement, suddenly there is a trusted institutional on-ramp investment system. Not only that, but because it trades in physical bitcoins, the scarcity will become a factor. For every bitcoin someone wants to sell, there has to be a physical bitcoin. The theory is that eventually institutional demand will skyrocket such that price must skyrocket with it due to the scarcity of bitcoin. It may take a while, but the underlying theories are strong, as demand increases, a limited supply will become worth more.

It’s how they were programmed by the indoctrination camps now known as school. The whole purpose of the movement is total mental control. This is effectuated by convincing people to disregard and ignore verifiable objective fact right in front of their faces. By pejoratively labeling anyone you don’t like as evil words that end in “ist” or “ism” they are able to completely destroy the speaker without having to address the speech. They look at a biological man and tell you to disbelieve reality, i.e., “that’s not a man how dare you!’ Transphobic racist etc etc.”
They look at objective crime statistics and tell you “no, those numbers aren’t true. You can’t think that way.” They look at repeatedly failed economic theory and tell you “it didn’t fail, in fact it works great and we should do it.” They tell you “you can’t use cars, or gas, or have BBQ, or meat, because it pollutes the earth.” Yet, they own mega mansions with carbon footprints bigger than 1000 regular people. They fly around the world on private jets burning thousands and thousands of gallons of fuel just to tell less well-to-do people that THEY must be the ones to sacrifice. Then they get back on those jets and burn a few more thousand gallons on the way back to their mansion.
They tell you that YOU are racist for believing that minorities are equal and perfectly capable of succeeding on their own without the government’s help. Because if you don’t help minorities then they aren’t smart enough to succeed on their own, or something. They tell you guns are evil, and surround themselves with armed guards and gated communities. They tell you a wall is immoral and you need to accept anyone and everyone who wants to come into your country, but they themselves live in private secluded areas where they will never have to deal with the consequences of their actions that they expect you to deal with.

Cash App has instant buy/sell with 0 fees using your debit card. However, you will have to get “verified” to withdraw your btc. Verification took me less than 24 hours but I think each person varies.
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:01:56
Yeah because everyone raises $182 million in anticipation of not launching. Do you even law, bro? The only thing holding up the release is a pending petition for administrative rule waiver that Bakkt filed with the CFTC (commodities futures trading commission). Normally the exchange isn’t allowed to “warehouse” (hold, store) the goods. For example a 3rd party intermediary normally has to warehouse the goods (wheat, gold, soy, etc) to ensure it actually exists and can be handed to the buyer when settlement time comes. Bakkt wants to perform these functions themselves, which will likely work because blockchain is immutable and you can always verify an account’s holdings. Also, it’s not like they are some Pakistani startup here, bakkt’s parent company is ICE.
Lastly, the federal shutdown is delaying the launch because the waiver process is halted. Even if it were going on, once the waiver is initially approved, there is a public comment period before a final vote. 
TLDR: Bakkt will launch, there are legitimate regulatory matters pending that preclude it from launching right now. Not some contrived theory as OP posits.

Square Cash App for Americans is great. No fees, instant buy instant withdrawal. Hook your debit card up to the app. You will need to prove ID with license/photo in order to withdraw btc, but once you do that you can instant buy/instant withdraw with ease.

If you have a debit card you can instant buy and instant sell right now. Verification took me less than 24 hours. Once verified you can instant buy, instant withdraw. The only catch is it’s a one way street. You can send btc OUT from the cash app but you can’t sent it IN yet. So once it goes out it can’t come back into cash app. Good luck.

When you live in libertarian p2p land, the real world will pass you by. I’m not hyping anything I am telling the truth. Jeff Sprecher is the CEO of ICE and his wife is CEO of Bakkt. He did revolutionize stock trading. He did disrupt the electronic securities markets. It’s not hype it’s history. If you think bitcoin adoption will occur with a bunch of autist half-broke computer geeks, then all the power to you. Adoption will occur when 401k, etfs, hedge funds, pension plans, etc can diversify with adding .5-1% of their portfolios into crypto. When Starbucks and McDonald’s accept crypto payments. Guess what company is doing that? Hint: Bakkt. It’s not just an exchange they are establishing a digital economy with mega companies. Read Starbucks press release, them and Microsoft are both investors in Bakkt. Must be a fad?
Read the press release it’s not that long. It lays out the whole plan.

My understanding is that the cboe just sells paper that tracks the price of bitcoin. Those papers are settled in cash, and can be bought/sold. So it's easy to make the price go down because it has "unlimited" supply. When you are dealing with physical delivery, suddenly the number of bitcoin in existence comes into play.

Bakkt will offer 1-day bitcoin futures with physical settlement. Bakkt’s parent company is ICE, who owns the New York Stock Exchange and is respected the world over for its part in revolutionizing trading through digital trades. 
With this trusted company, and physical delivery of bitcoin, the scarcity of bitcoin will eventually come into play. As it stands now, the cboe bitcoin futures contracts are paid in USD, meaning it’s basically paper bitcoin. This will be actual bitcoin you can send to your cold storage at the end of the day.

I literally said in my very first post “this rule waiver will likely be approved.” The fact I said that means inherently that it might not be approved. I sure hope people aren’t taking you seriously.
Nobody can guarantee a warehouse is “hack proof.” The place where the wheat is stored might get robbed. That doesn’t mean there aren’t warehouses that hold wheat. 
You are very misinformed and believe there’s some overarching “bitcoin bad” conspiracy. There is no problem or pending issue with a physically backed bitcoin contract. The issue is whether Bakkt has to hire a 3rd party warehouser or not. Seriously, there are lots of videos of ICE’s CEO and his WIFE, the Bakkt CEO, discussing all of this. They just raised $182 million and announced it on New Year’s Eve. This is occurring.  It’s going to happen. The waiver isn’t a big deal.

Imo it will help price because for the first time institutional investors will feel the scarcity of bitcoin. Physical delivery means the bitcoin supply becomes a factor. The current futures setup allows unlimited btc to be “traded.”

Hey bro,
If you are American you can use the “Square Cash App” to buy and sell bitcoin instantly. Square is the company who makes the little white squares you swipe on a cell phone for credit cards. It’s instant buy instant sell, annnddd INSTANT WITHDRAWAL. NO FEES. You need to get verified to withdraw the btc, but it took me only 1 day to pass KYC and now I can buy btc fee-free instantly and withdraw instantly. Never using coinbase again. IJS.
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:04:37
Bakkt will be good for bitcoin price. Etf is BS because it’s basically paper bitcoin. Bakkt is physically-settled bitcoin so the scarcity of it comes into play. I believe Bakkt will be a great institutional on-ramp and will cause massive FOMO.

That’s why Bakkt is so important. Bitcoin’s scarcity will finally become known to the institutional investors. Technically, if analysts are to be believed, the big money is only messing around with futures at moment and is waiting for a more legit on-ramp like Bakkt.

One thing we didn't seem to mention. Bakkt isn't some random startup out of Pakistan or something. Bakkt's parent company is ICE, Intercontinental Exchange, the company that owns and operates the New York Stock Exchange (yes, THAT NYSE). They are a monster company, trusted the world over, and experts in electronic exchange technology and futures. The fact they are launching this product speaks VOLUMES. Bakkt's CEO released a memo on New Year's Eve stating they had raised $182 million in capital, and that they are just waiting on an administrative rule waiver before they launch.
Starbucks and Microsoft are also officially involved. Bakkt has the potential to change the entire world's payment systems and introduce crypto to the mainstream. They don't want just an exchange, they want to create payment systems. Hence Starbucks involvement. But you keep on listening to the naysayers out there and keep believing Bakkt is no big deal!

I know what you want to do. Let’s say you bought $100 btc at $10k/btc. If btc goes to $15k, btc has increased by 50%. Therefore your $100 is now $150.
Works both ways. You buy $200 btc at $5k/btc. Btc drops to $2500 (50% decline), your btc is now worth $100 (50% decline).
Calculate the % increase or decrease from your purchase point to some point in the future, lower or higher, and just apply that to your investment.
Another easy way is if btc doubles then your initial investment doubles.

It’s settled in actual btc not cash. Thus, under current futures systems, there could be more btc buy/sell orders than there is actual bitcoin. It’s like “paper” gold. If everyone who had paper gold tried to cash it simultaneously it wouldn’t work because there isn’t enough gold on earth.
With physical btc settlement the scarcity of btc will begin to matter. It won’t be pure speculation it will be based on supply and demand. They are also going to be a reliable custody solution. I suspect Bakkt is one of the places where you will feel safe(r) with them holding your crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:15:07
Once you buy btc on kraken you now own it, but a third party is holding it for you. Not your keys not your coins. You don’t physically get your keys from kraken. They hold your keys for you and keep them secret from you. It’s a total custodial third-party holding scenario. You may have a login to kraken but they can freeze your account or lose your btc if they get hacked. You will need to withdraw it from kraken to another wallet address. This can be your “cold wallet.”
Honestly, just buy a hardware wallet like ledger nano s for $65 and be done with it. If you insist on not doing that, you can look up how to generate wallets offline by using usb drives. Then you can store the keypairing securely. One day when you want to use that btc, you can download a wallet and restore the funds to that wallet by using the secret key. For example if you gave me your secret key I could download any wallet and restore your account on it with the key and spend your btc.
Does that clear anything up at all?

Coinbase works just fine. Just be sure to find a way to have your own personal wallet.

Just be sure not to lose your secret key!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:02:24
1.you own it legally, but they are holding it for you. Just like keeping your money in a bank instead of under your mattress. Same with stocks. You don’t hold the physical stock certificates someone holds them for you. It’s similar to a situation where a bank can freeze your account but not the cash in your wallet. Kraken is the bank holding your funds. A cold wallet allows you to store it “under your mattress.”
2. Every time btc is sent from one address to another you will incur transaction fees. They vary depending how crowded the network is. You will have to consult independent info about btc transaction fees.
3. Yes as many as you want. But understand it’s all traceable basically. Kraken will require ID so they know your account bought btc and then sent it to another address. They won’t know whose address necessarily but they know you sent it.
4. Ledger or Trezor. If you have a small amount of btc you can keep it on an exchange like kraken. Those exchanges are insured and will probably be fine. That said, it is true not your keys not your coins and if it’s important to have full control of your assets then you won’t want to keep it on there.
5. Hardware wallets support numerous crypto currencies in one device. You will need a separate paper wallet for each crypto though if you don’t want to do a hardware wallet.

I haven’t done this, but people online day you can order a debit card from square and tie your crypto to it. You just sell some btc whenever you want and load it onto the card.
Note: at the moment it’s only one-way. You can withdraw btc instantly but you can’t deposit btc yet. So once you withdraw you need another fiat exit ramp like coinbase or Gemini. Or just keep it on the app.

The ledger live program that comes with ledger does this for you. It shows you your entire portfolio and can send/receive any of the types of crypto. If you have lots of different cryptos the worst you will have to do to make a transaction is load up ledger live, open ledger manager, uninstall an app (this is assuming your ledger is full and can not hold any more apps), and then install the one you want and make your transaction.
If you are concerned with saving crypto in cold storage, you can just generate one receive address for each crypto type and send it there from exchanges regularly. You won’t have to touch your ledger at all. Some people say you should generate a new address for every single deposit. I don’t know about that. If I was in a situation where I wanted to set it and forget it, I would probably generate one address and then send crypto to it as I buy it over time. 
Does that help answer your question?
PS: the newest ledger holds like 100 apps so the whole “delete app and reinstall” thing won’t be relevant anymore.

Quite frankly it’s ridiculous and annoying. The US is in great shape. People need to stop whining about debt. It’s not like it’s real debt...nobody is ever going to collect.

I’m not sure, but bitcoin has always been subject to taxes like any other property. The SEC clarified it isn’t a security, but if you want the real reason the price crashed take a look at the date the price peaked and the date the CBOE futures market opened (this allowed shorting bitcoin for the first time).
