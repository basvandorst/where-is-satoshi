Some of the people who predicted the housing bubble collapse also predicted massive inflation, and have done so for years now.
While it's true that not every prediction is based on luck, it's also true that an accurate prediction once doesn't necessarily mean some special insight.
Anybody who could accurately predict bubbles would be able to dominate the market.  No one has that kind of ability beyond very broad statements.

On the federal level:
[18 U.S. CODE § 1956 - LAUNDERING OF MONETARY INSTRUMENTS](


It's not a "loose term".  It has a specific statutory definition.

That is exactly one element of the charge that the prosecution must prove at trial.  This is the "knowing" element.  In the case at hand, there are apparently emails showing that Shrem was aware that the money was from an illegal source.
This is Criminal Law 101.  I think a lot of the comments here stem from a fundamental ignorance and/or misunderstanding of the law or how criminal prosecutions work.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:11:31


Yeah, no.  [Here's the federal statute in question.](  Please point out where it makes buying or selling Bitcoins that are not proceeds of a crime illegal.


From the post article:




[Here's the full indictment]( where they allege that Shrem knowingly concealed criminal proceeds.
Do you know how I know you're full of shit?  Because *alleging that these people have concealed illegal income is required by the law to prosecute them*.  
It helps if you actually bother to read anything at all on the topic you're trying to discuss.
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:17:00


Of course it is.  If you're knowingly concealing the source of illegally-generated income, you're helping conceal a crime.


What distinction?  Money laundering involves *knowingly* concealing illegal income, not just handling money.
People here are acting as if just touching money that might the used for criminal activity is a crime.

Are you kidding?  Even this article notes the defense was throwing a Hail Mary, after admitting Ross's involvement.
Ross is guilty as fuck and as such was convicted.  There was a mountain of evidence showing he was running the site.

What's not justice?  By his own admission he created and a drug market.  That doesn't magically become legal once you let someone else take over.  It also isn't magically legal if someone hands it back to him later.
I think his account is bullshit and directly contradicted by the evidence, but even working solely by his account he's guilty.

True, but that's for the legislature to change.  It's the job of judges and prosecutors to enforce the law as written.

Because that is justice. The courts apply the laws created by the legislature. 
The courts apply the laws equally to all. Leaving the outcome to the whims of whoever happens to be sitting there that day is precisely what the rule of law seeks to prevent.

Resent all you want, that's what anarcho-capitalism is: religion.  
You're not studying economics and political science, you're espousing a religion that, like all religions, have rejected empiricism in favor of a mystical set of beliefs.  In your case, the Prophet Mises didn't claim to have had the Truth revealed to him, but divined it via Pure Reason from a set of convenient assumptions.  If reality conflicts with those assumptions or their conclusions, then reality must be wrong.
You're not making predictions, you're just espousing your faith in  the divinely-ordained future perfection that will come when the wicked are cast down.


No thanks, I've already perused the Holy Scriptures of Mises and Rothbard.  At least the Bible has some entertaining stories.
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:51:03
It's literally never been right.  Who told you that?  
That's the thing about libertarians.  They're never right about anything, but it doesn't matter, because their theories tell them what must happen.  If it doesn't, that's reality's problem.

"is supposed to"?
No, one particular school of thought holds this as a belief.  There are all sorts of ways to approach ethics, and the idea that property derives from ethics is also a particular, and fairly unusual, position.
You're making a lot of assumptions here, as does the deeply dishonest article you link to.  But then, ancaps are generally dishonest garbage.  It's a cult.
Even the briefest glimpse at [actual resources on philosophy]( would show the abundance of thought on what ethics are, and where they originate.

Nothing "alleged" about that, he was convicted.
@_date: 2015-09-02 13:19:18
No, it wouldn't.  Why are Bitcoin enthusiasts so stupid?
Bridges is being charged for stealing *from Ross while he was operating the Silk Road*.  He admits to communicating with Ross *while the was operating the Silk Road*.
"He stole money from me while I was running my drug operation!" is not a good defense when you're being accused of running a drug operation.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:02:18
It's not.  Entrapment is, as you note, inducing someone to commit a crime they would not otherwise have done.
An example would be a cop paying someone to buy cocaine for them.  An example would *not* be you buying cocaine from a cop posing as a dealer, since you were already looking to commit a crime and the cop just facilitated.
And there's the problem.  Ulbricht was running a criminal enterprise that he was willing to protect regardless.  Whether or not Bridges was the catalyst for the hit, Ulbricht would have acted to protect his empire.  It's not as if but for Bridges Ross would have let people steal from his criminal enterprise without consequence.  Any suspicion of theft would have triggered the same response.
Remember that Ulbricht didn't think that *Bridges* was stealing from him, just that someone was.  He didn't know who, and took action to stop it.  This shows that it wasn't entrapment: it's what Ulbricht would have done in any situation where he thought he was being stolen from.

Yeah, I don't get these people.  They're trying to argue both that Ross ran a drug market that was good and helped people, but also that he didn't do anything and should go free.
Don't they understand that pointing to someone who stole from Ross's illegal black market doesn't really help Ross's case?

It isn't, at all, you just want it to be.


It makes perfect sense. The Internet isn't magic-land in another dimension.  Those electrons do  go all around the world, and are thus subject to the various jurisdictions they pass through.  Servers are physical things in physical places that are subject to the laws of that place.  It's baffling why you would think otherwise.  Just because traffic is "routed all around the world" doesn't magically make it beyond the law.
If you don't want to be liable in the US for something that's illegal in the US, don't conduct that activity via the US.
Feel free to test this out in court if you disagree.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:29:39

@_date: 2013-12-07 00:08:02
If the server was in US jurisdiction, US law applies.  Just because it's done online doesn't magically make the law not apply.
I'll never get why people don't understand this.  If the activity is illegal offline in US jurisdiction (buying/selling drugs), why would it be legal online?
