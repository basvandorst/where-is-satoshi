Systems do not fail. They do exactly as they are told to do, every time, as long as the hardware doesn't break (which is an easy failure to detect and to protect against with redundancy).
The failures are always human: either someone built the system incorrectly, or someone bypassed the system. I don't think you realize that I am making the long-term argument.
We can't depend on human oversight of transactions; BitFinex supposedly had such human oversight, and that's what failed. This is proof for my point.
If you don't want this to happen again, the solution is *not* to add oversight over the people who are supposed to provide oversight. The solution is to build a system that, at a fundamental level, does not allow unauthorized transactions. The Bitcoin protocol is like this, but BitFinex's protocol is not.

Human-based fail-safes are the complete antithesis of Bitcoin. That depends on trust in the humans who oversee the transactions. 
That is what Bitcoin was made to avoid. If you want other people to see the transaction and have an ability to stop it, use a traditional bank. If you walk into a bank branch and ask to wire $2,000 to some prince in Nigeria, I assure you that the teller will stop you.
Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless and mathematical. It should not need humans to interfere. When you have humans interfere, you get all the problems of the traditional banking system.
Except, we don't have FDIC insurance, and it is much hard for us to track thieves.

I, for one, can abide by the equally shared losses.
However, regarding those tokens, I want to see an independent valuation of BitFinex as a company. If that valuation is greater than the losses, I want those tokens to be assigned as partial ownership of the company. 
In essence, the ownership shares of BitFinex should become an asset as part of the reimbursement to customers. Retained earnings (profit) should be distributed accordingly. BitFinex is to become a publicly traded company, but publicly traded in the form of BitFinex tokens rather than on a traditional stock exchange. 
Any valuation of BitFinex in excess of the amount owed should be retained by BitFinex as tokens, just like a company would retain its own stock.

Bitfinex built their flaws into their system. That's what I'm saying is stupid, and why humans should be removed from that part of the equation *whenever possible*. Obviously there are fringe cases; no shit Sherlock. **But don't design a system that gives humans an unnecessary chance to mess it up**. It looks like BitGo did exactly that; they designed a system, and let the people at Bitfinex implement it horribly. The system didn't even flag things for human review, from what we can tell, because the people setting the policies implemented it horribly.
But what do I know? I'm just a software engineer with a security clearance, and I'm making programs for the federal government.

Want to count the number of failed exchanges that didn't have cold storage?
And Gox's only cold storage was coins that Karpeles forgot about. 
But I can already see that I gave your original question too much credence, because I answered it as though it were rhetorical.

It could be done, especially with a tumbler going through small amounts at a time. But, local bitcoins is one of the riskiest ways to cash out a lot of stolen coins. He would need to use it many times, and the chances are higher that someone traces the coins back to bitfinex. From that point, it's just a matter of contacting the traders and offering a bounty for information about the person who sold some coins from the account. If they are really lucky, they can arrange another transaction and police can ambush the thief.
Of a private security team can ambush the thief. It depends on where it happens and how far Bitfinex is willing to go.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:05:21
So if Bitfinex removed all the important security filters, what exactly was BitGo selling them?  They can't say "we sold them the trust and faith that our brand offers" for a business-to-business deal like this. It's not as though BitFinex planted an ADT Security sign on the lawn in front of their office.
There are only 4 options:
1: someone was ridiculously negligent
2: many people were moderately negligent and incompetent
3: someone on the inside was involved
4: aliens with super-advanced technology hacked the exchange and took the bitcoins.
I'm not betting on option  But that's just me.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:07:18
Point  is plain and simple victim blaming.
"Someone stole your money? That's your own fault. You were dumb enough to trust someone else with your bitcoins." That type of logic is used only by ignorant fools, and by fools who grow all their own food, build their houses by hand out of trees they chopped down themselves, and never see another human except to tell them to get off their land.
Could people prevent the loss of their own coins? Sure, by using a different exchange or wallet, or having their own wallet. But all those have risks too. Even if you have your own offline wallet, there is a chance of a flaw in the implementation of the program you downloaded, and you could lose your coins with no recourse at all.

@_date: 2016-08-07 23:21:53
I don't think any company will offer real bitcoin insurance anytime soon, especially not for customer deposits. The failure and loss rate is so high thus far that no exchange could afford the premiums.

Good question. And I see that my comment has gotten a lot of doubt already.
The only retaliation against unauthorized transactions currently is the ability to double-spend and hope that the 2nd transaction spreads faster than the first. This usually is a futile effort, as there is a very short time between the original transaction and the moment a retailer can see the 2nd transaction conflicting with it.
The other forms of delay, that I know of, can be done in 2 ways:
First, a trusted intermediary can delay the transaction, but assure the seller that they will get paid. Escrow services and credit card companies currently do this, for a fee, but it also gives them the power (and sometimes the legal obligation) to stop transactions, against the wishes of both the buyer and seller.
The other option is to have either or both parties confirm the transaction later. A bitter buyer could deny it after the purchase, or a cheating seller could confirm it despite not delivering the products. If they disagree, someone has to arbitrate that disagreement, and we're back in option 1. 
The only way around this is to have a 2-phase transaction in which the sender confirms in both phases. First it is sent, then the parties sit around for a while to make sure nothing bad happens. Then they both confirm it, as the seller delivers the goods to the buyer. 
This other system is just a way of designating coins for an upcoming purchase and announcing it, and a user would only catch a fraudulent spend if the delay was at least several hours (probably an entire day). I suppose this could give a chance for the sender to provide a 2nd authentication, which could be helpful, but it also slows the system significantly. This means uploading a transaction to the network, letting it spread, letting it sit, and then re-signing and re-spreading it across the network. That doubles the bandwidth requirement, and greatly increases the buffer of pending transactions.
That's still a good idea for large transactions. The biggest flaw, to me, is that it creates a system with 2 kinds of transactions and thus doubles the complication of any other software that uses bitcoin. And requiring a 2nd key to be used only on rare occasions is a bad security practice, as those rarely-used keys tend to be lost or forgotten.
Many of the Chinese exchanges have a 2nd password, called a trade password, that needs to be used on each transaction; even after the user has logged in. That's a bit more like a pre-emptive version of this, as a properly implemented system would require it before releasing the coins. At the end of the day, it's just an extra signature requirement.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:19:14
I think that their proposal depends on the users to agree; and they may be able to force a bit from the original terms of service.
Anyway, with a loss of 60 million, most customers will probably agree, and there isn't enough accumulated loss left to have an international lawsuit against the exchange on behalf of the users. I don't even know if international class-action lawsuits can exist; it may be a part of only the American legal system.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:36:04
It sounds like they had a very sophisticated and knowledgeable attack. I'm certain you are leaving no stone unturned, but do not ignore the possibility of someone (or several people) on the inside who could compromise the system.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:56:43
Yes yes yes, I know, we all know. It's obvious that humans need to be involved for these things. But I was answering the original question as though it were rhetorical.
So, I was commenting from the mathematical purest point of view. The protocol was made for complete security, and it can be used with complete security (as far as we know), if used only by individuals who do not need to trust third parties to simplify it and provide additional services like currency conversions.
This theft was caused by human greed and human failures. An ideal exchange would eliminate these possibilities as much as possible.
If anything, this has proven to us again that the humans at exchanges cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:10:09
Wise? Probably.
Legal? I doubt it. I want to see BitFinex go through all the trouble that they deserve for this. I may lose potential earnings in the future if the company ever goes public (notice that they never said that affected creditors now own a part of the company; only that they have potential future rights to own the company - ie, they have no rights at all unless the company decides otherwise).
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:44:24
I've paid them good money for a quick answer.
I haven't *paid* paid them, as such. But I had money, I gave it to them, and now they are not keen to give it back to me. I think they have a debt to pay.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:23:43
So it should be "Fiat users not effected".
But Bitfinex held fiat balances too, so we don't actually know yet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:29:34
So you think they took the website down just for fun then? 
Because there is a reason they took the website down. And it's not because they could get hacked again, because all those coins are already gone.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:13:25
As an account owner with losses exceeding the thousands (dollars, not thousands of bitcoins), I 99% agree with you. However, the distributed loss is, I think, the best way they have to return assets to customers. Bankruptcy takes so long and the process involves a lot of further losses.
If BitFinex revised their offer so they became a publicly traded company, with the debtors receiving stock equal to the amount owed as reimbursement, I would *almost* consider that OK. That's a great bankruptcy offer, as far as bankruptcy offers go, but I'm still not OK with the company losing customer funds - especially if it's a company that I now own part of.
The downside of the offer is that there is little reason for the company managers to want to expand it if it is mostly owned by the customers. If they could make more money by starting a new company without that debt, they would.
Otherwise, I think a criminal prosecution is more than justified.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:49:58
This one was regulated, and we thought it was insured.
Turns out BitGo insurance isn't anywhere near as useful as FDIC insurance.

It may not be valid, but if the money changes hands then the money has changed hands. Laws regarding duress have little control over where bitcoin goes.

If Bitfinex was smart, they would have held many of their coins in a warm wallet. This would be on a completely separate system, and accessible only with human intervention. These coins are locked away from the main website and active trading, but are still on electronic systems (with paper backups, presumably) so that they can be moved as needed.
The exchange only needed to keep enough coins in the hot wallet to cover the deliveries necessary for the upcoming leveraged transactions. This may have been a lot of coins, but certainly not all of them. It's unlikely that all financial (leveraged, margin, etc) trades would be resolved on the same day, and even if they were then the exchange could make transactions with the warm wallet every few hours.
For comparison, consider the scenario from the movie Ocean's 11. The casino needed to have the cash on hand to cover *every chip in play*. However, it does not need to keep cash for all the chips that are in the croupier's collections, stored in the dispensing machines, or held in a lockbox for the cashier. They only need to cover the chips that are in the customer's hands and/or sitting on the table during a bet. A warm wallet is like having a 2nd vault a few blocks away, with the extra cash to cover those inactive chips, in case Bill Gates walks in and buys every chip in the casino.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:27:19
The CFTC didn't force them to stop using cold storage. It only forced Bitfinex to actually deliver funds to a designated wallet for each customer. 
You can still use cold storage in those conditions, as long as the entire collection of bitcoins on the exchange are not changing hands on a daily basis. 
The only downside is that, if the margin transactions get large and deliveries exceed the funds of the hot wallet, the exchange needs to dip into the cold wallet to get enough coins for delivery.
Financial regulations state that this delivery must take place within 28 days. Bitfinex has a **28 day window** during which they can dip into the cold wallet. That's not a tough timeframe by anyone's standard.
These regulations were made when people could request their stock certificates be mailed to them. If Bitfinex is slower than the mailroom of a financial exchange (which are notoriously understaffed) and the US Post Office combined, that's BitFinex's fault.
I should also mention that, after the funds are delivered to a customer's hot wallet, the exchange can move them to a cold wallet for that customer if those coins are not used for a while. There is no regulation saying the customer can only have 1 wallet. If the customer suddenly wants to spend those coins, the exchange can use some of it's own reserves, or it can provide some coins from the general deposit funds (rather than the trading/margin funds) to provide the liquidity until it can get the coins from the cold wallet. This is how banks work too; they shuffle everyone's money around to keep liquidity flowing, and to minimize the number of times they open the vaults.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:32:00
They weren't. Dropping cold storage was just the lazy and easy option. They were only required to deliver the funds to a wallet for the customer (within a leisurely 28 days). They could easily do this with a fractional hot wallet, and only dip into the cold wallet when needed. 
They could have done a cold wallet transaction every other week, and still deliver customer funds twice as early as they are required to.
This regulation would prevent the exchange from running on non-existent coins, like Gox managed to do for a few years. You can't deliver bitcoin that you don't have. An exchange could still siphon coins away, but they wouldn't be able to take all of them.

Thank you! Comments like the one you responded to are one of the reasons I stopped watching this sub. It's one thing to speculate, but some of the speculation is so mind-bendingly crazy that it makes my head spin.
I have a few rules for investing; one of them is: if many of the investors are idiots who simply jumped onto the bandwagon, then abandon ship ASAP. 
The dumb money follows the smart money, but only after the smart money has already left. The smart investors will only talk about the their profits after they have exited the position, and actually taken their profits. Fools read their reports as though it is a prediction, so they jump into the investment and keep the price up, but only briefly.
There is also a classic paraphrase: if you see a hedge fund entertaining its employees by launching Porsche's from a catapult, you should do the opposite of whatever they do.
I can't remember what book that is from, but it's a true story. An investment fund was launching Porsche's from a catapult, and some other investor saw the idiocy and realized that those nuts had no idea what they were doing. He made a lot of money by betting against everything they bet for.

Bitcoin is a medium of exchange. It was made to be traded, that's what the protocol is all about. Just like fiat currency was made to be traded. The only reason anyone ever hoards it is because other people are trading and can increase it's value.
Gold, real estate, and porn are for hoarding. Bitcoin and fiat currency are for transactions.

Except the human checks in this case either failed outright, or never happened at all. If the checks never happened, it's because someone implemented the system poorly.
At some point, someone made very large mistakes. Automated financial systems should refuse to function when they have such massive errors in their implementation.
My point is: you can't predict what people will do, but you can predict what software will do. So write the software so that it can handle the human's idiocy correctly.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:28:22
No, that's how it's distributed in bankruptcies, which is what Bitfinex will go through if they either don't have massive amounts of insurance to cover this, or enough of their own funds to cover the losses.
They declare bankruptcy while holding all remaining assets. Everyone then becomes a creditor, and all the customers get proportional shares of the assets.

So much this. The bank's don't view bitcoin as a threat in any sense at all. Some government bodies may, as it's hard to track. We've already seen that it's the way ransomware demands payment, so it is a legitimate concern for both consumer protection groups and law enforcement bodies (if they would actually bother to enforce this stuff).
Banks do t consider it a threat at all. What are you going to do, get your car loans from Coinbase or Blockchain? I doubt that could ever happen, and P2P lending exists without bitcoin already.

The sub used to be nice, but first it was invaded by anarcho-capitalists who wanted to destroy the entire financial system and insult anyone who disagreed. Then it was just overrun by bitter trolls.

That's the most roundabout and risk-prone way to 'prove' something that I think I've ever heard of in a serious context.
As Vitalik just said, there's an easy way and a bad way. This is also a bad way to prove he's not Satoshi. What if Gavin said he absolutely believed him, and everyone trusted Gavin? That's not the bitcoin way, but that is a very human behavior. CW would be as likely to prove he is Satoshi as to claim he isn't.
Also, this opened him to massive investigation from resources that were not involved before. If he made any misstep in the past that could connect CW and SN, this would have made it much more likely to be noticed. It's hard to keep a secret identity for years, there are certainly errors somewhere in the secrecy.
How often does a criminal suspect go to the cops and try to turn himself in for a different crime that happened at the same time as the one he's a suspect for? It doesn't happen often, and I doubt SN would do something that ridiculous.
