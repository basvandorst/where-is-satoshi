I'm gonna guess 6 Muricans on hand, a couple hundred grand in material support, and a 30 man task force back home.

What the hell? That's really messed up. I mean, I'd love to be getting some ginormous changetip lovin, but stalking people that already gave ain't cool. The whole goal of changetip is to encourage people to use btc, not turn current users away from it due to stalking.

Two, one for surveillance of the server, and one for surveillance of the owners home. Another two on backup in case of failures. No weaponized drones though.

That is a fair point, but how big a percentage are they actually taking? Anything under 1% I don't much mind. Reddit bots need a server and a connection to work, and that costs money.
If they manage to get it big enough to actually turn a profit, good for them, as long as they aren't gouging folks.

Thanks man!
@_date: 2012-12-13 07:23:08
Awesome, Thanks!

Um, you're aware that it is super easy to mine btc right? It's hard to do it **profitably**, but if you're just using it to convert your electricity into donations for Snowden, you aren't worried about turning a profit anyway

Seriously, that's a damn good idea.
@_date: 2015-04-02 01:33:12
Doing it now. Thanks for the fantastic idea.

Yep. EVERY private tracker allows utorrent 2.2.1
It's why I still use it.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:46:39
Well, thanks man. Keep on rocking.
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:46:04
And thanks again, I'll spread the love.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:38:42
There is in fact a reason to do that. Private trackers usually have a list of torrent clients they allow/disallow. utorrent 2.2.1 is allowed basically everywhere.

Yeah. Expect to see the FUD get spread far and wide as time goes by.
