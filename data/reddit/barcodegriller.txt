I wouldn't recommend you invest in 'fiat' either, but it's great to use for sales at a given time because it's fairly stable, accepted everywhere, and has no/low transaction fees. As an investment I'd prefer something that produces value on its own like an index fund, REIT etf, etc.  Where does crypto fit in other than speculation?

The problem I have with bitcoin, personally, is that there isn't really a way to know that the value of a bitcoin should go up.  What I mean to say is that it depends entirely on other people putting money into bitcoin currently.  An investment, to me, is something that generates value inherently.  When I put money into Google, for example, they produce technology and generate value by innovating (in general).
Warren Buffet has a great quote on gold that I think is apt here (I know bitcoin isn't exactly like gold):
"I will say this about gold. If you took all the gold in the world, it would roughly make a cube 67 feet on a side…Now for that same cube of gold, it would be worth at today's market prices about $7 trillion – that's probably about a third of the value of all the stocks in the United States…For $7 trillion…you could have all the farmland in the United States, you could have about seven Exxon Mobils and you could have a trillion dollars of walking-around money…And if you offered me the choice of looking at some 67 foot cube of gold and looking at it all day, and you know me touching it and fondling it occasionally…Call me crazy, but I'll take the farmland and the Exxon Mobils."

I don't agree with who you're responding to about commodities, but look at what US companies have produced in the last 20 years. Companies produce new goods, technologies, inventions that provide value.  There is a huge difference in speculating on Bitcoin and buying into the US or global economy as a whole.
