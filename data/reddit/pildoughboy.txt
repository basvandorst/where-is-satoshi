There are 3 teams developing LN (ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs)
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:48:39
I had the same thought yesterday.  
The LN bitcoins have a lot of additional attributes and hopefully won't sacrifice security.  The main chain is going to turn into a consolidation level to store funds where you pay a flat tax (fee) on the amount of data you want forever confirmed into the blockchain. 
Exchanges will sell LN bitcoins to avoid the fees. Services will accept LN bitcoins.  Eventually when you want to store the wealth like putting gold into a safe you'll move the LN bitcoin to main chain bitcoin. If a store accepts bitcoin instead of having customers pay fees you'll accept LN bitcoin and either spend/sell that LN bitcoin or consolidate payments and put it into the main chain.

Unfortunately the US government can pick winners and losers through intense regulation.  Coinbase plays ball by negotiating customer data with the IRS and hiring federal prosecutors to their board of directors.  They disabled the freeross donation account and act in the interest of the state.   
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:03:30
Bitcoin is consolidating usage of memory and electricity while maintaining the most amount of security possible.
A lot of miners are located near powerplants and get a good rate on excess electricity produced.  The competition for cheap electricity and efficient miners makes bitcoin's security efficiently maintained.
Then it comes to blocksize and what can be written to the blockchain while maintaining the optimal amount of security and decentralization.  There's already competition for what can be written to the blockchain.  This drives innovation like segwit and market makers have to keep up or fall behind.  The LN is the ultimate scaleability option and as it grows there will be even more competition to efficiently write data into blockchain.  This is where upgrades like Schnorr come into play.  
Without these innovations taking place now, bitcoin would have to sacrifice either decentralization, security, or scaleability in the long run.

My opinion on ethereum's dapps is that their business model is ridiculous.  What business or person wants to buy individual tokens from 3rd party investors to use a dapp when rootstock can package the same code and use bitcoin.  That way rootstock cuts out the clunky token exchange and 3rd party investor and connects the end user with the application.

@_date: 2017-03-20 16:32:59
That was an interesting read.  I don't understand how Ver can jump from saying introducing Segwit/LN an optional system will result in $1,000 transaction fees and fractional reserve banking.
Segwit/LN is a huge step forward for bitcoin businesses and transactions.  This system will allow users to have control of their coins while using said business.  Whether is an exchange marketplace or gambling site.  If someone tried a fractional reserve system it would be easy to call out, if you don't own the keys you don't on the coin.  Just like how cash is king over checks and credit.  This development that Ver was explaining sounds awesome when you read in between the delusions.
Also coblee was talking about how atomic cross-chain transactions can reduce fees and confirmation times.

Do miners become parasites when they threaten to block development and change rules for their own benefit?
I see this miners blockade as an attack on the efficiency and development of the bitcoin network.
ASIC chips are way too centralized, and now that the biggest manufacturers have the biggest mining operations we're seeing them starting to influence the network for their own interests. 
I'd like to see a PoW change discussed.  This isn't going to be the end of the ASIC mining cartel even if Segiwit/LN goes through.  Also I'm not just talking shit, I have a significant investment in bitcoin, and was considering cashing out if BU got it's way.  
A while back andreas was saying the ASIC chip development would become more decentralized as we close in on moore's law, I hope that is the case 
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:06:40
I don't think they would try that.  They have too much invested and wouldn't want to kill the coin like that.
I think the threats and posturing is a ploy to get money flowing to altcoins.  They can then sell their alts for cheap bitcoin.  Then they announce they have conceded or compromised and bitcoin is up again.  Right now I'm betting against a fork.  Margin trading loans are like .2-.3% a day.  It's all petty manipulation.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:01:58

this post doesn't make any sense, the halving has nothing to do with the blocksize.  Also blocksize is being solved with seg-wit and lightning network.

Been around a long time.  Have you learned what a hardfork is yet?  
A hardfork is a change in the protocol.  The halving is a scheduled event built in the protocol.  It happens every 210000 blocks.  I guess you just learned something new today and I didn't even have to be a *dick* like you.

There's a community agreement that if an ASIC chip is developed the algorithm will change.  They were scrypt like litecoin but switched to lyra2RE after scrypt ASICs were developed, and when there was a suspected CPU botnet they tweaked it to Lyra2REv2 to reduce CPU reward and keep GPUs most efficient.  
It's a cool project that keeps bitcoin's ideals while presenting a solution to ASIC centralization.  But like I said I'm really into bitcoin too so I don't want to be a shill one way or the other.

I use vertcoin as my bitcoin GPU PoW coin, but I'm not opposed to an organized PoW change here either.  IMO this is all going to blow over in the next few days/weeks, everything is being amplified due to a coordinated attack.  Certain factors like the difficulty adjustment will be straightened out soon and these pressures won't have the same effect.  Vertcoin experienced this due to gpu miners jumping coin to coin and added kimoto gravity well which adjusts the difficulty after each block to combat any DA manipulation.  I'm sure something similar can be figured out here if it's needed. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:47:32
The easiest way to get bitcoin is to buy them with money from your bank account through one of the popular exchanges. 
Mining bitcoin at this time is expensive and there are experts doing it barely making margins.  It requires a big investment and coordination.  You have to worry about acquiring the miners, power supply, warehouse, electricity, etc. all while making sure they are running 24/7.
If your interested in mining cheaply there's a coin called vertcoin that forked from bitcoin's code and is very similar. The only difference is their mining algorithim is for GPUs and memory intensive so a powerful gaming graphics card can profitably mine.  They have simple mining guides and a one click miner on their website/reddit.  Even still you won't make much but it is profitable. 
Like other people here said keep reading and researching.  There is a lot to learn! have fun!  My advice would be to buy with money from a big exchange, and play around with other stuff like mining and setting up a node as you're learning.

All we need is bitcoin, but there's also vertcoin that is 3.5 years old and copies core's protocol.  The main difference is that they will remain ASIC-resistant and change their protocol if an ASIC is developed.  They switched from scrypt to Lyra2RE to make scrypt ASICs useless, and switched to Lyra2REv2 to make CPU botnets useless.  They aim to use Core's protocol and keep mining decentralized. 
I hope SHA-256 ASICs become decentralized one day because the bitmain mining cartel is the greatest threat to bitcoin.

That's what this discussion is about.  Litecoin has the same miners as bitcoin which are colluding to change protocol.  Also vertcoin was cheap and is still cheap.

From what I gathered reading from others, what I'm starting to think is this is collusion to stunt development.  
The miners are spamming the network to create a problem that they can "solve" by forking the coin larger blocks.  This fork not only solves their created problem but also introduces a new development team.  Having control over the new development team they have more influence in the future if something threatens their profits whether it be block rewards halving or 2nd layer payment transactions with low fees.  
This is similar to the s2x agreement.  A lot of the businesses signing the 2x agreement may be threatened by future developments in bitcoin.  Developments that automate and eliminate 3rd parties like atomic swaps threaten exchanges etc.  So they subvert the open protocol by coming to an "agreement" and implementing a new development team.

I'm always looking for a solution to miner centralization and the only thing I've found is an altcoin call vertcoin, it copied core's code and has a community consensus to remain ASIC-resistant and is mined with GPUs.  At this point anyone can buy a GPU and mine profitably.  Its mining parameters also eliminate CPU botnets.  But ideally there would be more SHA-256 chip producers and miners would be more distributed vs what we have now with massive warehouses and mining pools.

The issue with the PoW change is that the one planned for October 25th "bitcoin gold" is a premine scam where they fork mine 16,000 blocks for themselves then open the chain for everyone else.
I like Vertcoin because it's a 3.5 year old bitcoin core fork that has a community agreement to remain ASIC-resistant.  Has everything bitcoin/litecoin code wise with distributed GPU miners.  Like core vertcoin's developers are volunteers and some projects are community funded.  All the coins have been earned through fair PoW.

Vertcoin is a bitcoin core fork where the community pledges to remain ASIC resistant.  It's 3.5 years old and has forked from scrypt to Lyra2RE after scrypt ASICs were made.  Then they switch from Lyra2RE to Lyra2REv2 to prevent cpu bot nets from controlling the protocol.  The only way to profitably mine Vertcoin is with GPU miners, and I think this creates a fair balance towards decentralization.

@_date: 2017-10-08 06:12:45
Yeah, but people who didn't contribute generations of work and taxes into the infrastructure of germany.  It's great helping and what not but they're using citizens money that should be going toward helping the citizens.  It's a gamble they're taking, hoping it returns more tax money down the line.  
Government playing with money that isn't theirs is the reason why I support bitcoin.  Let the free market work itself out.

I wonder if core has any plans to do that, that would be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:20:43
Yeah if we maintain price it would prove that these retards are just wasting their time.  It would prove that miners although they choose the protocol to mine on, they can't influence it for selfish reasons.
If we get past this fork with little trouble it will make bitcoin more resilient to these types of attacks. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:04:59


I like the point you made here.  I think it's a bluff to see if they can get a compromise.  If that fails, they'll continue forward to scare the market buy low and then signal back to bitcoin for even more money. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:14:06
Bitcoin gold is a premine scam, there's an ASIC resistant form of core's code and it's call Vertcoin.  It's been around 3.5 years everything has been fairly mined since day one.

Do you think we need government to prevent us from acting like complete retards?  If you did own the bus and acted like that, then the free market wouldn't use your service.  If you owned a share then you'd still be under the rules of what every other shareholder voted for. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:29:44
You don't own the bus therefore you're violating the NAP by not paying the required fee.  You're only purchasing 1 seat and have no right to control the remaining space. 
The bus owner might hire security to handle unruly passengers, but you have to be mentally ill to act the way you're describing.
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:04:53
We will see how it works out.  I'm a proponent of a free market and if those jobs are open they would be filled for the right price.  I don't think government can handle something like that smoothly especially when it requires using taxes to foot the bill.  It's taking a chance and playing with fire.  If it doesn't work out you have millions of people displaced because your government intervened. 
My theory is that nations need constant growth to pay off national debt and unfunded liabilities like medical care and pensions.  The governments took control of many things and dug themselves into a hole, and I don't think they can manage it all properly to get themselves out.  
This is where bitcoin comes in to give the power back to the people.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:39:23
look into vertcoin it's GPU bitcoin been running strong for 3.5 years.  All development is volunteer some projects are community funded, all coins have been fairly mined through proof of work. 
bitcoin gold wants to premine 16,000 blocks to advertise their coin and buy developers.  Right now not much is developed for bitcoin gold, they don't even have a website explaining it.

I guess it really depends on how much the ASIC miners can stand to lose.  This might make the markets fluctuate wildly until this is answered.  The answer will be determined by the centralized mining cartel which allows them to inside trade.
I think miners are greedy and short sighted.  A PoW threat might scare them but that's a huge change and unlikely. If both bitcoin and s2x start to crash I think the miners will start to signal back to bitcoin.
They're not going to ruin their entire business model over trying to gain control of the development team.  This whole controversy is pretty stupid but I assume it's being used to manipulate and gain power and money.  Once the cash flow starts to fade they'll stop.

From personal experience shapeshift is more expensive to use then manually buying from an exchange.  If you're a hodler the convenience is worth the fee, but if you're buying a large amount and want the best value I would make an account on an exchange.

Also trezor has this web page interface that shows monthly trends of your coin movement which is cool.

Hey dude great to hear you're using bitcoin!  Like other people have said 1 confirm is good and more confirmations is even better.  As for fees they are usually around 4 cents per transaction.  The 4 cent fee will prioritize the transaction to be added to the blockchain. This happens usually within 10 minutes and about 6 confirmations every hour.  
This is a cool website to see the network live, also the transactions in the mempool waiting to be confirmed.

vertcoin has been around for over 3 years it's a bitcoin/litecoin copy that's mined with GPU only
right now it's in the 50 vtc distribution period in December it halves to 25 vtc 
The algorithm is LyraREv2 they switched from scrypt when scrypt ASICs came on the scene, and switched from LyraRE when CPU bot nets were detected.
Its community's mission is to remain ASIC resistant.  They're a relatively small community with an active dev team, they have segwit and are on pace to be the first coin with LN between them and litecoin.  They also have 1 click miner in alpha stage development so gamers can contribute to the network without much tech literacy.

bitmain antminer s9 
but the dickhead manufacturing these is manipulating bitcoin, and they have hidden asicboost and other weird features inside the miner.  you have to order them from china it's a real pain.
miner decentralization is one of the biggest problems in bitcoin today.  I hope we get it figured out soon whether it be hitting moores law if that theory is true or having another manufacturer start up compete with them.

Don't want to sound like a shill, but vertcoin is the bitcoin/litecoin copy that's ASIC resistant.  It's been around over 3 years, has segwit, forked from scrypt when they developed ASICs (litecoin), and forked from Lyra2RE to Lyra2REv2 to combat CPU botnets. 
It's a small alt community with an active dev team, no premine scams, no scale-ability issues (although that's a long ways away). 
It fits a niche, but I'm still 95% in bitcoin because bitcoin is king.

damn dude I just read his case, that's fucked up 
They try to paint him as a maniac for trading some bitcoins.  They throw in he had some marijuana a couple years ago and posts about 9/11 conspiracies.  Why is this a big deal?
So why exactly is he getting harassed by the state?  I read he was trading on local bitcoins with out a money transmittal license, but is there any proof on he was engaging in drug sales?
or are they just pinning the illegal ammunition on him because possessing marijuana made him a felon? 
fucking crazy man

this is just the beginning
people in government have collected everything about everyone, and they don't even have decency to protect that information from hackers.
So who really is at fault here? the decentralized network or the centralized network that collected our information without consent and didn't protect it? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:21:40
My theory is BCC crashes in the first 24-48 hours.  Jihan buys them extremely cheap.  He then props up BCC by mining BTC at an incredible advantage and selling some of those BTC for BCC.  At the point BCC starts to have trading volume like etc he will mine BCC with a few of his own miners.  With the monopoly on ASICs he can manipulate the price and still make a profit off selling BTC for cash.  
Think about how much he spent on the network spam, discussion spam, talking heads like ver and wright, "agreements" and manipulation tactics.  Why wouldn't he spend more to have control of the network? His advantage in ASIC chip production, ASIC boost, and cheap electricity is huge.

Vertcoin is a bitcoin/litecoin copy that's ASIC resistant so the miners are more distributed among GPU miners.
hopefully bitcoin will get segwit sometime in the next few months, but in the meantime we have smaller networks developing these upgrades.

@_date: 2016-07-06 18:41:15
Dude I thought your last point was valid.  No matter what 5 btc is worth it's going to be tied to the uniqueness of the bar.  The bar in its original minted form is being issued at a 5btc collectors surcharge.  It's not about the price of what 1 bitcoin to 1 usd equals.  It's about BTCC and their mint the mined block the uniqueness.  So the bet is BTCC says it's uniqueness is worth 5btc, in time it could be worth 1btc or 10btc we just don't know.  USD and exchange values have nothing to do with this.

universal basic income only helps bitcoin.  Universal income devalues the dollar by either printing more or taxing more dollars to be redistributed by the government.
