Well, along with everyone else, so don't feel too bad.

I'm sorry, I know this isn't even close to the point, but I can't let this pass without correction: chicken pox doesn't inoculate against smallpox. You're thinking of cowpox, which isn't even particularly contagious to humans.

Then what's wrong with using the word woman?
Seriously. As a FEEEEEEEEEEmale, when a guy uses that word it makes every alarm bell go off in my head. It's just generally not a great way to start things off.

Don't say females. We're not zoo animals.

There's somewhat more to this story than this:
Basically, this guy claims he got a FinCEN number, but then it magically disappeared. The Feds, not surprisingly, aren't buying that story. Also, his kid was dealing Xanax, which I guess is fine by Libertarians but doesn't really get the federal government in your corner when it comes to handing out prison sentences.

Not trying to be pedantic, but around thirty percent of first marriages end in divorce. If you can pick the right person out of the gate, your odds are actually pretty good.

Did it ever fucking occur to you that there are actual women on this sub. 
Take some of your earnings, buy a ladder, and get over yourself.

Happily married for twenty years and counting, and I got Bitcoin. But thanks anyway.  
I hope you find the person of your dreams, marriage or not.

No. The price when you buy it is locked in.

Oh, Kim Dotcom announced something?
Surely this time something will come of it.

Once you're comfortable with Coinbase, set yourself up with Gdax (the trading side of Coinbase), and you'll be able to transfer fiat and make limit buys for free.

If you transfer fiat into Gdax, it takes about a week (grr), but then you can make your trades for free... as far as trading goes, I've been doing this since July, and every time I try to time the dips I fall flat on my face. Hindsight is a billionare...
