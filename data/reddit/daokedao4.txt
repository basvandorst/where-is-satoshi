Continue? They've been raising their interest rates for the past year and they have to continue raising them since the Fed is raising them. If they don't keep up with the fed you'll just see massive capital outflows as people chase the higher interest rate.

The fed has indicated that it intends to raise interest rates by 75 to 100 basis points in 2018, and will likely continue to do so in 2019. The economy is quite strong right now and inflation is beginning to pick up, and the massive fiscal expansion is likely to worsen inflation. I'm not sure why you think there's a great risk of a recession (depression? No one in their right minds is predicting a full blown depression right now).

What you're describing is inflation. If there is no underlying recovery you just get inflation. The fact that inflation has been so incredibly low trivially disproves your point.


Now returning? What the heck does that even mean? It went out into the abyss when it was printed and then magically reappears a few years later? 


I don't. I believe what the overwhelming majority of experts in the field believe, which is that the economy is quite strong right now.
