Banks will continue playing a part in society, even in a crypto world. It would even be smart to use a bank to store a certain percentage of your crypto, so you don't lose everything in one point of attack. Crypto services by banks sounds great!

I don't understand how this is not causing people to close their savings accounts and sit on their cash... Who wants their hard earned money being loaned out and returned at a loss??
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:59:18
That's what I mean. Whether it's your fault or not, do you really want to lose EVERYTHING you own in one sweep? No, that's why you diversify your savings. Get multiple hardware wallets AND get a crypto bank account.

The bottom is never in for these people. 
1) Oh it's falling, that means it's probably gonna fall more.  
2) Oh it's consolidating, it's probably gonna fall of the cliff again soon  
3) Oh it's rising. Just a pump, I'm sure it's gonna fall again.  
4) Oh it's at 50k? F\*ING YOUTUBE VLOGGERS TOLD ME IT NEEDED TO CORRECT TO 1K FIRST!  
5) -Buy at the top-

Almost 4 years ago at the exact same timing before the halving, Bitcoin was at around $370 after dropping from highs of $490. If time repeats itself, it'll be a big holiday season indeed.
Look at halving cycles, not years.

The spread of this misinformation feels almost like deliberate FUD to make people panic sell.

If you're gonna trade, make sure you're one of the most experienced traders in the world. Otherwise, buying and holding the damn coin will be much more profitable.

The problem is that everyone who barely knows Bitcoin treats it like a "get rich quick" scheme. So you got the cynics who think it will never reach the 2017 high again, and the desperate who hope it will be worth 1 million tomorrow.
I introduce Bitcoin to my friends and relatives as a trustworthy independent money system that is still on the uprise with new developments. It just so happens you may get rich by buying low and selling high.

Hooray, it's the BUY NOW meme!

I understand its point, but I believe it's going to have the opposite effect. When taxes rise, people save more. When their savings accounts are leaking, they'll want to get their money out and save it somewhere else. This is going to cause bank runs.

Good thing I have a hardware wallet already. I've gotten to the point where I don't give a damn what the current dollar price for bitcoin is, or whether it's in a downtrend. All I know is that I have an alternative form of money ready for when shit hits the fan. I must be one of the few crypto holders whose main goal is simply staying alive.

This is just classic panic selling. I'm not seeing anything we haven't seen in the years before. Welcome to the Bitcoin rollercoaster.

2 years into the space. Did I miss the true storm?
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:44:20
Or maybe you should just buy already since it's going down so slowly. You want to wait months hoping it will reach the low that you want? Do you want to lie anxiously in bed hoping it won't shoot up before it reaches your preferred price? Your peace of mind is worth the price difference, I'd bet.

I agree about the blitz pump, and that the price is probably going back to normal... but this happens because of panic selling, just like the pump happened because of FOMO. A price can also correct to normal by going sideways for a very long time.

I wonder if an exchange's shutdown has negative price impact because it wrongly makes people distrust crypto, or a positive impact because it turns out there's fewer crypto available.

Or, I don't know, take a chill pill, diversify your money and work on a peaceful transition between the old financial world and the new one. Educate others about the why and the how of Bitcoin, and try not to sound crazy.

You seem to forget that we can build layers on the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:26:53
And even a global internet shutdown won't kill it. You also have to destroy every miner and full node that keeps the blockchain ledger, because as soon as even a single one of them gets back online, Bitcoin keeps going. This digital thing is near indestructible.

Zoom out more and it looks like we made a double bottom November+December, indicating a major trend reversal. Huge rejections under the 21 monthly EMA. People with empty bags should really buy now or never.

BTC is probably going to be the protocol on which faster payment layers are built. Why? Because Bitcoin was the first of its kind, is now the strongest crypto network and this is not likely to change, and is truly decentralized compared to other cryptos.
