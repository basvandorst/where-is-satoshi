@_date: 2015-01-11 11:36:01
just Litecoin is not in same step in inflation and halving.
i remember Bitcoin before first halving 2$ =&gt; 32$ = 2$ =&gt; 266$
litecoin fallow this scenario !
50% of all coin is made soon 
litecoin start new step 
speack of price when the number of coin go 23 000 000 to 40 000 000 coin 
litecoin grow this year 5 big new ewchange ! price is realy bad indicator for check grow of coin before the first halving.

Most people become more poorer bitcoin thinking that, very well, I earned $ 1,000, they sell their 1 BTC and, two years later, he can buy 0,10BTC. remember that it is a transfer of wealth. The market capitalization of Bitcoin will be X5 minimum before 5 years.

There is another reason, of course. But this is added if a person pays 52M for nothing. a bitcoin that is deflationary is a much better deal. just a matter of time for people to understand.

no plan
I received a mtgox letter a few months ago, it must be declared as soon creditor but for small amounts in € 5,000 I think it causes more problems than anything else.
I'll see if the procedure is simple to be considered creditor.
which we see more of 10 or 20% money back i think. in the best case.
unless new twist in the case of 600K bitcoin.
