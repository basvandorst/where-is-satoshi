Looks like Venezuela could use some good ol'fashioned American freedom.

Buy on kraken and sell on quadrigacx. From one Canadian to another.

Yes, thanks. I. I'm working on that too.

Yes, this is your best option right now. Otherwise, there are plenty of ATMs in major cities across the country but you could expect to pay 6% or more.

Just buy and hodl. I quit trading and just buy the dips.  Bitcoin is still a steal at this price. Show me one Bank that offers you double your investment? Just buy and hodl and watch it grow.

It's not easy to get fiat in and out. Used to be my favorite exchange until credit card deposit and withdrawals came to an end.

Hey, what app is that? I'm guessing it's an Android app, but can't find it in the app store.

Could you write a little review?

Got word from the owner of the ATM, the machine was moved to Metrotown shopping mall in Burnaby. Good to now. He also updated  of the change.

My first thought was Nigerian prince.

Quadrigacx. They have many deposit and withdrawal options including postal money orders. Once you verify your id you can deposit as much as you like. Lowest fees I've seen.

You beat me to the punch. I was thinking of the same thing.

I sent 10 ETH and got nothing back, but was refunded with the explanation that ETH must be sent as a single transaction. So one would have to send ETH to a secondary address to consolidate their ETH and then on to coinvert.io. that was the last time I used their service.

Quadrigacx charges 0.5% on CAD and USD Bitcoin and Ethereum trades.

OK, thanks. That's what I thought.
