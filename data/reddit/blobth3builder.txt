Mental. £40 to speed up his transaction. I bet he could have paid less than £2 for the same speed.

All cloud mining has and always will be way worse off than just buying a Bitcoin with your money.
The issue is to succeed in mining you need to have the lowest possible costs. Only the people who can purchase the equipment the cheapest or get new equipment before others and have the electricity at virtually zero have a chance at making money mining. As a cloud miner you have no control over any of these things. This you are almost guaranteed to be unprofitable.

At least 95% of people who try to do this fail. The reason that they fail is because you are going to make a mistake every now and then, and if you do, what price do you re buy in at. You have to have even bigger balls to trade than you do to Hodl. With a Hodl you set and forget that you even invested for 5 or 10 years and then check back on your investment. With your method you on constantly on the edge, always looking for the next opportunity which then leads into alt coins and scams and before you know it you have less investment than you started with and Bitcoin is now worth 20* the price you paid. Sure 1 in 20 will do great out of it. But the odds are against most mere mortals.

If Craig Wright was Sotashi then I am very thankful he is no longer involved in Bitcoin. I remember people said Sotashi could get a little arsey at times, but no one ever said he was the biggest knob head known to mankind. So I do not believe Craig Wright is Sotashi or invented Bitcoin. Hell I don't even think he has the skills knowledge now to create Bitcoin let alone 10 years ago.

You have to remember that Bitcoin is a global currency. So what might seem like a big promotion or holiday to you may be irrelevant on the other side of the world... And you have to know which counties are currently pushing the price up or down.

It has been full of people doing bounty campaigns for years. Basically you need to ignore posts by people with really high or really low post counts.
