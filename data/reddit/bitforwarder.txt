Another site to look at is ours: [BitForwarder.com](
We offer forwarding options, but can also be useful if you use our service with a block explorer (like block.io or blockr.io) to monitor the transactions.
Our support team is available to help you configure your system how ever you would like, and are available to help with just about any bitcoin project you have going.  Contact us for more information.

I'm glad you like what we've got going!  Hopefully we'll prove ourselves useful in the future for you!
In terms of the alerts, that's an excellent idea.  We may implement such a system in the near future!  Thanks for the suggestion.

We are not a scam.  Not in the least.  We saw a place that needed a service, and we made a service. You can try us out with smaller amounts and see that we are legitimate before working your way up.  This service was designed for ease of changing wallets, etc.  We don't expect many people will forward more than 1 BTC, and our target audience is forwarding smaller, recurring transactions.  If you don't believe it, go ahead and test it out as that's the best way to do anything.

We are working on setting them up, as we see it as a major vulnerability as well.  We will provide updates as they become implemented.

We have implemented HTTPS: 
We hope you'll consider trying us out in the future!
