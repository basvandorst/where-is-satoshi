Bitcoin when fully adopted will have a stabilized demand and will not be deflationary.  


I'm sure by "people" you mean central banks ;-)  
Also, you talk about hoarding as a bad thing, as a dark economic depression.   
However, in these times of  overconsumption, I think hoarding is positive because it promotes  [green economics](

again, I think you are confused. TA is not a way to predict the future.

Not so sure about that considering the recent major interest growth. I would advise to buy asap. The sooner the better. Plus we need buyers to go through that 10k wall.

A lot of newcomers still get scammed by his website. Although I agree that time will come when shitcoins shall die, that misleading marketed project is probably slowing down the evolution of the ecosystem. I think it's fair to think about a way to end it. dont you think ?

What free stuff are you talking about ?
Also you complain about people complaining too much without contributing anything.. But aren't you complaining right now ? Did you contribute anything positive ?

The transition would not be a one day thing. As BTC/USD goes up and as Bitcoin adoption evolves, people will realize their money is worth less and less. More and more people/government will adopt Bitcoin.


I guess your wrong.
Also did you know today's nine richest men own as much money as 50% of the world ?
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:01:33
or a criminal mfer.  
or both
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:36:02
Wtf are you talking about ? 
Tax on everything you buy, tax on your wage, just like today's tax.
If one day bitcoin replaces money as we know it, everybody will receive their wage in Bitcoin. I don't know what makes you think "99.98% will be sitting with 0 bitcoin"
