The nice thing about a market is it’s not a zero sum game. You might have bought btc at 1 dollar and sold for 1000. The buyer at 1000 might have sold for 10000. Everyone made money. Zero sum implies winners and losers.

This is normal stuff if you work for a broker or an asset manager. You have future knowledge of trades your company is going to make that will move markets. It would be trivial to exploit that information for your personal gain. It also creates a conflict of interest as the portfolio manager.

This is the equivalent of getting a your hands on an individual's private key. There's no magic in Bitcoin that would prevent this. As a matter of fact it would have been worse since the unauthorized 850 million couldn't have been reversed.

I'm confused about what you mean by:
Loss protection
Thanks to a security passphrase even losing the gadget means no risk to your bitcoins' ownership.
Are you storing the private keys somewhere else? Can you explain the process of recovering my bitcoin if I loose the TREZOR?
