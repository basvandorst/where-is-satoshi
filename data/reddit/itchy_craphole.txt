Dang, the hostility in here.... this isnt exactly complicated. 
 Regardless if some of you despise Dogecoin for whatever reason, how can you not see the oppurtunity and take advantage of this. 
Even if you don't agree that he IS the most popular driver or in excessive voting..... If he does win, it is exactly as the title says! Great exposure for bitcoin/dogecoin/reddit/cryptos whatever!!!!  This is marketing 101... wouldnt it just be fantastic if more people were exposed to bitcoin!
 Dude is a great dude and he drove a reddit sponsored car! How can you not see the value in this! I don't understand why so many bitcoiners hate dogecoin! What is good for the goose is good for the gander!!!!!   
Vote for him ----&gt;hope he wins----&gt; Then enjoy national tv exposures and countless other sports outlets where they mention the word Bitcoin. Sheeesh!

@_date: 2014-05-05 02:08:42
Please allow me to present my case in an effort to uniform the currencies pronunciation.
While many people stand by the archaic comic Homestar Runner, its was but a small blip on the Homestar webseries agenda. It is and has been irrelevent to the pronunciation of "Doge." The popularized meme of today's world is a seperate entity and has little/no relation to Homestar. In the world he existed Homestar was characterized as a fairly unintelligent individual. He often misspoke, failed to enunciate, and frequently said not only stupid things but pronounced them just as stupidly, ie: JORB. Homestar hit the internet scene in 1996. 1996 people! Thats over 18 years ago. The last time homestar produced new content that gained any attention was roughly 2005. (9 Years ago!!!) Homestar Runner had a great "run" and did a great "jorb" out there in the internet, but at the end of the day, NOTHING TO DO WITH A DOGE MEME! 
Now, enter Shiba Inu, Kabosu. On February 23rd, 2010 pictures of Kabosu were uploaded to the internet. 2010!!!!!!!!!! And only a few years later (aka, nowadays) did the "doge-meme" recieve much praise. So, what can we derive from this? Well, for starters there was a big fucking gap in time. In my semi-professional opinion, marked by the emergence of a Japanese Shiba Inu, it was over 6 years that the 8 second homestar runner "dohje" line was said and quickly forgotten. The importance doesnt lie in the similar spelling, it lies in the details. The details woven in a 6 year gap.
Lets dissect this further....
In that gap of time, memes as a whole became widly popularized. Take for example ICANHASCHEEZEBURGER. They rose to become a top player in the meme world by glorifying funny pictures of cats and giving them a human persona through captions. The comedic aspect was emphasized in the fact that pets/animals spoke in broken english. They used words improperly and hardly put together a proper sentence. And it was cute, so it stuck. If you were to imagine your own cat or dog talking, you might inherently assume they would speak a bit differently. They would certainly try and emulate the human language but at the end of the day they lack years of education and schooling. They are bound to make some mistakes, and we are accepting of that. That is the intrinsic funniness that these animal/pet memes hold. They allow the viewer to relate the meme to their own pet/animal scenerios. 
NOW, a japanese dog...... Speaking broken english with mixed up words and pronunciation. Kinda makes sense. If a Shiba Inu was to ever speak and refer to itself, it may very well say " Hi, I am a doge" in a Japanese broken english accent pronouncing Dog as Vogue.... Hence a hard G. Dough-G! Take a Japanese individual who has very little knowledge of the English language. How would you expect him to peice together statements and words? Probably much the way our dear Shiba Inu Doge meme does. Much, Such, Wow, Many... The list goes on. Whether we look at cartoon comics, or movies, or television shows, we as humans have created a personality for animals. Those personalities tend to always mirror that of the animal. Example: Breeds of dogs take on characteristics from the region they dirive from. Accents become a part of the animals speech. This is not a reality, as animals do not actually talk, but in our fantastical and imaginative minds, we as a culture have contributed to a natural assumption of dialect. I can ramble on and on but at the end of the day there are three main factors that point to Dough-G
1) We need to accept Homestar as irrelevent and nothing more than a coincedent. The time frame leaves too large of a gap. And it has nothing to do with actual dogs. It was mocking a slang ebonical way of refferring to a friend, buddy, or pal. Not an actual Dog.
2) Given the nature of meme's and those embodied in the memes we must conclude that enunciation and sentance structure are natural shortcomings. The animals simply lack the education. Spelling words improperly (cheezeburger) and saying words improperly go hand in hand (doge)....
3) The Shiba Inu is of Japanese descent. It would speak in a broken english/japanese accent. Hence Dough-G and lasty, Dohje sounds dumb.
EDIT: I DONT GIVE A RAT'S PATOOTIE WHO CREATED IT OR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.... ITS DOGE AS IN VOUGE AND ILL DIE WITH THAT BELIEF!!!! HARD G BRETHERON... UNITE!!!!!
EDIT EDIT: and for the record Ive been with dogecoin since days after its creation. And I recall the Hard G pronounciation was much more prominant back then. More than half of the few thousand Shibes beleived it was hard g. And then sometime around christmas this homestar crap started surfacing and from then on it was regurgitated misinformation :( bah...

I have a strong inclination that many coinbase users expect too much from coinbase.... instead of treating coinbase like they would a scottrade or etrade or w/e retirement account,  they treat it like a bank debit card and fuss around too much.  If a customer doesn't understand the policy for id verification or tries to weasel around the imposed limits or send bitcoins to a shady acct,  then yes, I do understand them interfering.   But that's just my impression/assumption...   
For Newbs and people looking to own small amounts, 1-10 bitcoins, I'd still suggest coinbase...
