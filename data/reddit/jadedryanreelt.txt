Obviously everyone in this sub has either tethered or is shorting btc. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:33:41
Nah too much support at 6900
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:33:41
I hope everyone is noticing that any pro btc comments get downvotes. SHORTS GONNA GET REKT SOON!!!
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:39:52
That's just my opinion. I'm not a financial advisor so please do your own research. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:15:43
Sad life to hate something so much you spend all your free time trolling bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:32:02
Yeah everyone should bail so you can scoop it up cheap right?! Or you're shorting and will get rekt soon. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:58:03
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:14:38
Yep, 8k+ by Monday.
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:03:17
Very likely it could drop below 7400 but I do believe 7000 is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:41:48
Or you live with your mom and have no money. Sad life to come here to bash other people's investments.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:29:22
I'm not a millionaire yet (and I'm not relying on crypto to make me one) and this temporary loss of funds isn't pissing me off. I invested money I can live without so I don't lose sleep over dips.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:52:49
8 minutes to go

I'll be fine regardless of what happens in this market. I don't care if it takes 10 months or 10 years to profit but when it's being manipulated drastically it's hurting the market and a lot of people in the process.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:51:46
I hope all these shorting asshole get wrecked again today.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:33:38
It's not dropping below 7k so no reason to tether or sell at this point. Stay strong y'all!!
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:26:38
Shorts will get REKT again soon, they always do.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:23:39
I heard that too.  Gonna be real quiet in here soon.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:18:08
Awesome! You've made $50 hahaha
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:55:47
Of course we're here for the money. However, I fully believe in the technology and can't wait until it's adopted so I can use it as it was intended. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:11:51
I hope these whales realize they're negatively affecting people's lives. I haven't invested anything I can't afford to lose but if this shit took off I'd definitely be able to spend more time with my kids. I make great money but I work 80 hrs a week and maybe spend 4 hrs a week with my kids. Pump btc to 50k and give me the freedom to spend some quality time with them please!!
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:54:51
I should clarify that it's too bad they're giving crypto a bad stigma because I believe there's still a lot of opportunity in the long run for average Joe's to better their financial position in this market.
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:34:00
Shorters everywhere in this thread!! It'll be up to 7700 in a day or 2 max
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:58:41
It's only money, at the end of the day you're still a miserable, scrawny, basement dweller. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:50:04
Yes! I don't own a dime of bitcoin and only come here to check sentiment of this shitty waste of a coin that drags my useful altcoin down to hell regularly.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:46:33
I guess the whales have made enough money to not give a fuck about killing the crypto market. If I was still sitting on the sidelines I don't think I'd buy in after recent events.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:11:59
Love watching shorts get rekt!!
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:24:14
Great move dumbass
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:17:27
I'm a successful real estate agent/investor. I own 15k worth of crypto, none of which is BTC and I'll clear 250k+ this year. I own a home in the suburbs worth 750k, 3500 sqft, pool, shop, 4 car garage which holds my 67 Chevelle. I am by no means heavily invested in contrast to my assets and income. Don't assume everyone here will miss rent or fail to keep the lights on if btc goes to zero, it's a fun hobby for a lot of us. Oh btw that home is paid off and I'm 34 years old.
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:05:38
Laying the sarcasm on thick haha. I'm glad I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-04 22:36:38
Chick with a dick?
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:46:48
Please don't talk like that, suicide is not the answer. Life is filled with hard times and challenges you just have to keep fighting and you will find success.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:10:23
I feel like a pump up to 6900 7000 is coming
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:04:34
My comment didn't age well
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:08:36
I see a paid off mortgage, college fund for the kids and early retirement. Smart move not blowing it all on lambo, hookers and blow lol.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:12:21
 We were just at 6k, don't be mad that you've got fluffy little balls and couldn't pull the trigger.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:46:05
What's being announced then?
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:57:32
I read that soros is actually looking at XLM not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:36:13
It's preparing for a bounce to 9k
