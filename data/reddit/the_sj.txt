Control the supply? Hodl to artificially drive the price up. Basically literally the same thing the community is doing, but on a larger scale.

They can do pretty much anything they want. Regulations, as well as directives _must_ be adopted in national laws. UK and Denmark are mostly exempt tho.

To those saying that it will be impossible to enforce it: It will be extremely easy to enforce it, just make it impossible for people to spend bitcoins in specific countries. And that's extremely simple to do - stop accepting prepaid cards that are backed by bitcoin, and stop accepting wire-transfers from bitcoin companies. Banking system is pretty well designed, put some weight on banks, and they will take care of bitcoin.
Also, try taking a loan or mortgage in bitcoin. Current banking system &gt; bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-13 06:40:29
Never. Bitcoin is going against all market rules, hence why it will never be in position to take over fiat. Right now there's literally no benefit of using bitcoin already.

It has nothing to do with bitcoin.

On every single bank statement I have received, it has always said £75'000, not £85'000.
@_date: 2015-12-13 06:52:28
Haha do you really think any merchant is willing to accept actual bitcoins? What are they going to do with them?
PSA: Every single service that offers to take bitcoin payments for merchants converts them to FIAT monies. Merchants never touch a single bitcoin. They receive FIAT and they don't really care.
Nobody has any financial incentive to promote peer 2 peer money. Nobody makes money out of it. Doing something for free? Haha.

Oh you have no idea how supply and demand works. If those 10 million coins would get dumped into circulation, bitcoin would tank by at least 75%.
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:16:49
And even better, the money in your bank account is insured. Obviously it depends on the jurisdiction you're in. In the UK you're insured for up to £75k in case the bank fails.

Gold has had a pretty much fixed value for the past couple of milleniums, adjusting for inflation.
The purpose of gold these days is to be an insurance against inflation.

It has the potential to go up to $1m per BTC. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s got every symptom of a bubble.

Not really comparable to bitcoin. Real estate bubble was caused by banks completely running out of fucks to give and lending money to people they clearly knew cannot repay what they borrowed, and tried to make money by selling securities backed by those mortgages.
Tulip Mania would be a better example.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:14:36
You’re delusional. There is no justification of the current price. In fact, it is an indicative of the fact that people keep bitcoin mostly as a speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:21:04
If you sell those bitcoins to acquire filthy fiat to buy a car with — yes. But you wouldn’t sell, because in a week you could buy 2 cars for the same amount.
If you’d buy that car with bitcoin, it wouldn’t make a difference.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:02:18
And the price is only going up, because nobody really seems to accept the possibility that it might go down. A classic bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:30:42
And limited supply is also a contributor to deflation.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:00:26
The US government hasn’t probibited it. Businesses are perfectly free to accept bitcoin payments.
Also, the value of currency has got absolutely nothing to do with viability of it. Liquidity and circulation matters. Arguably, the only purpose for currency is to be in circulation. It doesn’t matter whether one unit is worth USD 0.01 or USD 100.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:08:32
False. TSLA.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:26:22
There will be no mass adoption because of the reason I explained in the previous comment. If mass adoption would happen, almost nobody would sell their bitcoins, because bitcoin based economy is virtually guaranteed to have a massive deflation problem.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:29:56
Everything. It’s (the company) worth almost as much as BMW, has a massive debt problem, have never turned profit and don’t produce nowhere near as many cars. Yet they have extremely loyal fan and investor base, and the stock just keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:16:58
Hoarding that leads to deflation, which would be a massive problem in a bitcoin based economy. What’s your incentive to buy anything with bitcoin today, if today you can buy 1 loaf of bread for 1 BTC, but tomorrow you’ll almost certainly be able to buy 2 loaves of bread for 1 BTC? A healthy economy requires inflation, so people don’t hold onto currency, but do something with it. Spending drives the world forward, not hoarding.
Hardly anyone sells, because the price is going only up, and there is still strong demand, because price is still going up. And nobody really seems to even accept the idea that it’s a bubble that might burst and tank to $0.01 per coin. So it keeps going up and up and up. It doesn’t necessarily have to be price manipulation. It’s the community acting like a cult with their goal being “to the moon”. There is also an example of this in the corporate world. Tesla.

The Platinum one. Might seem a lot, but Priority Pass (the unlimited, complementary lounge access) is worth £259 alone, and I'm certain that those hotel room upgrades I've already used are worth even more than that.

I invest all of my excess income. Money loses value over time due to inflation, not weakening currencies. It makes imports more expensive, yes, but my salary is denominated in GBP anyway, so no difference there.

No currency holds its value, inflation is there for a reason. Some commodities do, but not currency.

Except people doesn't lose money on credit card frauds. In credit card fraud schemes, everyone up the ladder is insured. The individual is insured - he doesn't give a fuck. Merchants? Insured. Banks? They are insured too, they don't give a fuck aswell. Insurance companies? Even they are insured. Heil FIAT!

Well, there's the basic card. Offers no benefits, no annual fee, but still excellent customer service, and fraud + refund protection.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:19:33


Do you realise that the entire purpose of any currency is to just be in circulation? The value is entirely irrelevant. Also, for a currency to be viable, it needs inflation. In a bitcoin economy there would be a massive deflation because of hoarding. 
It's not an investment. It's not a currency. It's nothing more than a speculation.
