Another proof that they are socialists because they don't love the poor but hate the rich

Considering value of all of the worlds wealth relative to supply of BTC the maximum value of single bitcoin will easily be over 10million$ in the future. My personal safe estimation is at least 300x increase in value over 20 year period.

On average computers energy effiency doubles every 1.5 years, just because blockchain difficulty keeps increasing doesn't mean that btc is somehow outside laws of physics

But since more competition leads to smaller and smaller profits the number of miners is not going to increase towards infinity. Maybe in the next 100 years the energy consumption will increase to 1-2% of total consumption but this is still laughably small cost relative to benefits

1. Total bitcoin energy consumption is extremely low compared to worlds total energy consumption
2. Bitcoin network will replace other types of systems that consume energy (banking and cash related mostly).
3. As technology progresses so does the energy efficiency

Ah I get it, your trolling this subreddit to sham people to increase the value of your own investments. Energy consumption is not only BTC problem, all blockchain cryptos share the same issue. Anyways discussion is over from my part since you are obviously on a ideological crusade

I think he means stock market. Now generally when there is depression investors seek to put their capital into assets that do not correlate with the stock market. Such assets include inverse etfs, gold and fiat (dollar is risky tho in my opinion) and now bitcoin. Personally I expect bitcoins market capitalization to significantly increase during global depression. It will not be the first priority hedge for the investors but even fraction of global financial capital flowing in to crypto will mean huge gains

Austrian economics does not use modeling because their approach is logically deductive (as opposed to empirical), that is one of the main reasons whole economic school exists.
It's like Germans saying that Americans are joke because they are not Germans and vice versa

The findings of Austrian method are falsifiable, but the validity is tested through the soundness of the logic, precisely because it is a formal science. Just like mathematics is not just speculation even when we do not continuosly keep empirically testing wether 2+2=4 or 6*5=30 etc

Mutual funds have low annual profits compared to bitcoin because they sacrifice profit potential in order to minimize risk. You could make huge profits (with a lot of risk involved) if you 1. focus only on one field 2. buy only single company stock. This is extremely risky and doesn't differ a lot from buying lottery ticket.
Example about extremely speculative investment: one field (cryptocurrencies for example) and one company (bitcoin for example)... oh fug!...

Soros literally punished England from trying to cheat (artifically manipulating pounds exchange rate to keep up with german mark). People who fight government abuse are heroes in my book
