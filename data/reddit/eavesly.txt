Apple has acknowledged quite a few bugs/exploits. With several OS iterations a passcode bypass was discovered and Apple openly acknowledged the issue and reported on the timeline of a fix. 
I'm looking to see if you have anything to offer beyond cynicism and prejudice. 
People are the weak link in security policies. It started when a user raised the risk of compromise (by being a celebrity), it worsened when the user failed to exercise the two-factor already in place, finally it was exploited by an opportunist. 
This celebrity photo scenario is likened to leaving valuables visible in your car. Locking the doors won't stop someone from breaking the glass and while not the victims fault it must be recognized that the user failed to take even reasonable precautions.

I'm shocked you believe this. How many failed attempts should be allowed? Users are NOT that reliable and Apple took time to research privacy and security habits of their users. When they announce Touch ID they gave their data on how many people had no passcode because entering four numbers was a step users found bothersome. And you think the same users are security conscious and Apple is at fault for allowing them to try multiple times to access an account. 


Do you believe tech companies are aware of bugs and exploits and just hope nobody finds out? It is possible for a security researchers to figure it out first.
