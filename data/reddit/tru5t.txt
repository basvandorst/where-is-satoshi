Could he have mentioned that Bitcoin was new technology anymore?

Where do you see that (200 ETH)?

Roger made it clear that the blockchain.info wallet is not suitable for noobs.  If you've been using bitcoin for a few months, you surely know better than using their services (bugs, unstable, hacks, etc.).

Go on, Brian, that's the attitude! Do you have any heart left?

Not sure if it's substantial, but there'd have been no dark-market if it was not for /Amir/Voskuil/Pablo/Jaromil (and others I forget the names of). OB/OB1 not respecting their wishes shows little heart, but hey, keep using libbitcoin, for when the consensus rules will be decided by your VCs. That's what it was made for ;) 
edit: and no, point wasn't trolling! just a reminder to where OB came from. 
“Those who control the present, control the past and those who control the past control the future.”

I will not defend Peter Todd because it's not important.  I will say that out of ALL (main), devs in Bitcoin, he's ALWAYS been the most approachable.  He took money from R3 and he's down with the co-operatives (free of charge).  The neutral persona you're trying to maintain (and I wish that as the CEO of OB1 you'd make it the official corporate mentality of your company), is (imo), because you're trying to do the same. I.e you took money from VCs and your product rides the Co-operatives exchange ethos.  Peter proved himself, OB hasn't (yet), and I truly, seriously, sincerely and wholeheartedly (must keep some heart left), wish you all the best. I sometimes even advocate for OB (anonymity is more important to me but I'm not trying to market this product).  Whatever you guys do, please never forget Orwell's dictum, as Bitcoin gave us the power to change it for the rest of humanity (not sure Classic would agree ;)

Electrum creator ThomasV said he'll integrate Lightning Network in Electrum if it works.

Mike stopped believing in Bitcoin when he took the fat cheque from Morgan Stanley and co at R3 back in November. Bitcoin is free and he can always come back, even if he keeps his 3 year old childish behaviour.

He wanted to attack ETC then changed to mining and supporting it.

Coinbase is starting to hire its army of VC backed devs
