DNA coated polystyrene beads to set flow cytometer compensation on nucleic acids.
This would greatly benefit anyone doing biological research, since you could run both surface marker and nucleic acid stains at the same time, at the instrument, and view data that is valid.
I can explain more if you would like!

I hadn't heard that term. Thanks for teaching me something!

Actually true. I'm more interested in it as currency than as an investment vehicle anyway... But the public is more interested if the price is crazy high!

I am always measuring surface proteins, and nucleic acids on a population of cells from the bone marrow.
We use a BDLSRII cytometer, running DIVA software. You cannot set up a universal negative in that software, because you need +/- gates on cells (stained and unstained) as well as antibody capture beads (stained and unstained).
I want to either help, or just see someone make, a polystyrene 10um bead conjugated to dsDNA... then you could have a universal negative (unstained beads) and each individual color (either dna stain like DAPI,7AAD, DyeCycle Violet etc, or antibody).
This would make cell cycle experiments easier, you could check flow plots as looking good or not on the instrument, during the run because you would be looking at compensated data AS IT RAN!
So basically my applications would be :
positive controls for DNA staining in flow
estimation of DNA content in other cells, if you know the amount stuck to each bead. 
Capture / elution of specific transcription factors (if you used specific sequence DNA, not just general dsDNA).
Probably more applications I haven't even thought of!

Me too!
