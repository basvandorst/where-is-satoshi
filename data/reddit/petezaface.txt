What do you mean by making sure the clock is correct?
**Edit: I checked the settings and noticed the timecorrection option. I didn't realize this was a possible solution, I've never had to synchronize in the past. Thank you so much for pointing that out!**

In my language we group them together as a collection or word-group, hence *is*. Or at least in the dialect I speak. Sorry if I offended you with my faulty grammar.

Thank you for your suggestion.

I'm from Belgium. I made an account on Coinbase but haven't looked further into it, I'll try that, thanks!

I'm actually ready to buy. It will likely crash at some point, but I'm confident it will recover. I'm planning on buying and holding - depending on how the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide continues of course.
The only thing stopping me is formalities: getting account verified, getting money into account, etc.

I've been verified just now, I had submitted Wednesday or Thursday last week, which is why I was worried. Thanks for your input!

I'm from Belgium, so I need to be able to deposit in Euro

Well I'm from Belgium, but I saw that Mt Gox works with Euro as well, that's the reason I wanted to buy bitcoins that way.

What did the deleted reply say? Just so me and others know what the scam is he was trying to spread!

I've just been verified, and I had submitted around last Thursday, so I guess you should get an answer in a day or two!
