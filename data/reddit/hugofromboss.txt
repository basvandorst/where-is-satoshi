blockchain.info store your private key. Encrypted. Which is decrypted when you login.

Looking at their about us page they use "PayCo Financial Services" who seem to be partnered with HSBC?
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:13:10
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:58:43
Not true. They have to sign your transaction. Which means they have your key in the clear during that period.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:15:40
See you there!
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:15:16

What is the URL of the site in your address bar? Is the certificate valid? Also try CTRL+F5 might just be a bad cache.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:28:15
Love it!

If your coins are stored on coinbase. You're not in full control of them. Best thing to do is buy a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger S) to store your coins. They come with a neat UI too.

It's amazing that people just don't stop and think "Did we really just say that?" unbelievable.

When you pay by credit card the issuer (Card company) can recover the money spent and the merchant, in this case coin.mx would have to foot the bill. Meaning you could, buy some BTC with a credit card, ring up the bank say it was a fraudulent transaction and get the money back, whilst keeping the BTC. This is why most people accept bank transfers as it's less likely that the payment will be reversed.

Guess its takeout this weekend then!!! Excellent!
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:40:53
If it was on the address tab, then that suggests you've sent BTC to this address already? If so where did you get the recipient address from?
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:15:03
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:38:43
Anyone got the link to the FT article?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:11:30
Oh, it was several large transfers for localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:08:43
Haha, me too. They're all now gutted of course. Though, they're now trying to convince me its a ponzi-scheme. They are funny. Keep telling them its just the start.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:28:39
Without the private key it is impossible to spend the BTC you bought.
What address did you send them to exactly? Where did you get the address from?
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:30:01
Haha +1
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:49:29
Just happened to a friend of mine doing the same thing. He's got his account straightened out now. I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:32:57
