Most explanations I've heard are technical, and most people don't want a technical explanation. When asked, I tell people 'it's a public ledger of transactions. Everyone has access to read it, and it's secure and cheap to use for anyone with internet access, even in developing countries without banking infrastructure. The added value is freedom from central control, banks, governments, and other middle-men.' Then I answer questions with outcomes instead of technical backend bs.

They use third party companies for banking integrations, identity verification, fraud detection, and probably many other services where your personal info is being farmed / swapped / stored / monitored. They also have a history of working with, training, and developing tool-sets with law enforcement. They've sent your data to the IRS at the very least, and maybe others that are neatly covered in their terms. Yes, personal information is definitely being shared. If it wasn't, they would be unique on planet earth right now as a multi-billion dollar company in SF.

It's a reference to an XKCD comic that's a reference to your password only being as strong as your resistance to torture. Sure, have a 50 character passphrase, but someone can still beat it out of you.

You can barely squeeze out a coherent response and it includes sending people to a financial advisor... People will make their own decisions, and that's how the world should be.

It will make it weigh less, for sure.
