Deutsche has a hell of a lot of issues, and I think it’s safe to say that bitcoin isn’t the cause for these layoffs.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:04:20
Seconding this, I'd really like to know as well. Also, is there a plan to one day phase out BIP49 in favor of bech32 addresses? This may not be necessary, but IDK.

This subreddit is a collection of the following:
-	license plate posts
-	hodl jokes
-	links to Twitter
-	price pump posts
-	posts dedicated to crying about the price falling

So? Just because something can be used for something that many disapprove of doesn’t mean it’s bad. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:24:08
I should’ve added what is hardly seen in this sub:
-	quality discussion about the actual protocols and rules that back bitcoin

Just saw this post, and I think you should talk to Danny (if you would like to know more about the African market. The reason I say this is because he's the CEO of Neo &amp; Bee, and I believe that they have a partnership in Africa with someone.

Just wondering, do you know if there's any ATMs that are owned as part of a group buy? I don't have enough money to buy one outright, but I would still like to have partial ownership in one.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:38:51
Which wallet software would this be? I'm pretty sure it's not Bitcoin-QT, would something like Electrum or Armory do this?
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:08:06
Well it's time for some exploring (I've never really done this kind of address changing before). Thanks for the heads up!

If they're sitting on so many chips like they claim they are, why aren't they shipping them out?

I believe the adage "It's not how big it is, it's how you use it" comes into play here.

Could you explain what a rendezvous point is in regards to Bitcoin? This is the first time I've heard about these and I'm curious as to what they do.
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:34:41
I would love to see Google put a Bitcoin option into Google Wallet as I think NFC payments are still in a massive growth stage. Perhaps Google Reviews could have an option to show only places that take Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:49:20
Just wondering, what proof do you have that this is his account? Reddit is kind of infamous for exposing people as "the real perpetrator" only to have it backfire.

Can we add "facilitates the reduction of gang violence" to the list of Bitcoin benefits?
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:49:32
Great point! It shouldn't be that hard for somebody to come out with a wallet that is compatible with JAWS or NVDA. I would do it except I have a very small programming background unfortunately.

Tor was created by the government and I feel that it's been pretty disruptive.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:14:07
Well if you're way off then I'm even more off, since I had no idea what it meant and you appear to do. It also appears that this problem can be solved by transferring all the funds out of the address once you make a transaction. Thanks!

Silly me, I forgot that all Segwit enabled blocks have the word pie in them. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:15:21
Alright, this may seem like a dumb question, but how would I know that this is the first Segwit tx? Is it because the addresses actually have the word Segwit in them?

Do you think that facts have ever stopped people from shitposting in this sub before?
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:07:50
They hate you because you speak the truth. This sub and the larger Bitcoin community in general is absolutely terrible and is filled with people who refuse to consider negative feedback even if it’s coming from a good place.

I really think LTC really benefits from Charlie Lee being a stable force throughout the dev process. He also does a great job interacting with people on as well as Twitter. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:21:02
I would say that Litecoin should be in place of the singular Satoshi, since it's based off of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:52:21
This is fantastic! Concise, clearly written, and just technical enough for people who aren't really technically inclined to feel that they're smart haha.

Any ETA as to when Core will be released with Segwit address support in the GUI?

I'm seeing a lot of articles today about the new Bitcoin Core client coming out, but no actual date. Is there a hard ETA yet, or not?

If I sell my Bitcoin Cash that I got during the fork, how do I report my gains? Do I say that my cost basis is the price I bought it at (which would be $0), or the price that BCH traded at on its first day in existence?
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:29:40


Yeah...I’d say it’s almost too focused on the price 99% of the time.

I may just transfer my BTC onto Coinbase if only to get 2X, promptly dump it, and then buy more BTC haha.

I hate to be that guy, but could you provide a source? I thought that they were sticking to Europe for now.

I hear that if you put a Bitcoin sticker on the side of the case, it'll add 2 TH/s.

Awesome, can't wait to play!
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:01:54
Depends, I don't have much to give (less than 1 BTC), so it would matter on how much you had to pay in order to get in. Also, I'm assuming we would have to pay taxes on our gains, correct? There's also the issue of who you (and your friends) are, since I don't want to give my money to scammers.

Have you thought about setting up a subreddit for the co-op? That could make communication a lot easier.

That would be awesome, I would be willing to beta test the app if you do create it.

I'm sure WU had to face the same thing at one time. If somebody was able to get funding and could clear regulations, it could be a gamechanger.

I completely agree. I almost thought of putting some money back into it just for kicks. This could be used as a way to teach people how to play around with the market and try to make a profit off of emotions.

@_date: 2013-12-03 00:30:43
One way to verify that you are indeed the bitcoin sign guy and not someone who just took a picture with it is by transferring some BTC out of the account. If you send it to 1NtgJf4znCsA5GJDCbqtowHL2143WyqLkC I'd be more than happy to vouch for your legitimacy.

My favorite quote from the post "How many BTC do you currently hold/own?":


@_date: 2013-10-27 00:49:53


I know you're being sarcastic, but that still makes me cringe. I read Gizmodo up until 2010/2011 when the articles took a real dive and started focusing more on clickbait rather than actual information. Also, the biases of the articles can be ridiculous at times.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:45:27
While I haven't bought land with Bitcoin, I thought I would look and see if it was even possible to do so. A quick Google search landed me with [this]( They have an option to pay with Bitcoin for their land. Also, there is the [real estate]( section on BitMit which has some land.
As for getting started with Bitcoin, there is the Getting Started section in the sidebar to the right which will explain it better than I ever could.
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:58:14
When did you buy them? Remember, nobody went broke while making a profit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:07:31
I wonder what's going to happen to the BTC price when these reforms start getting traction. I have a theory that the reason China is going bonkers over Bitcoin is because this is one way that they can get around the capital controls that are imposed by the Chinese government. If they start seeing other ways to move their capital out of the country (or even in the country), the rise in prices might slow down or even reverse for a bit. As for when this will happen is anybody's guess, but that's my two bitcents.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:57:09


That's the tricky part though. At what point will their definition of money transmitters in regards to bitcoin end? I'm afraid that they'll extend it to any business who accepts bitcoin under the guise of protecting the consumer/money laundering. Hopefully I'm wrong but you never know.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:51:53

If he's worried about security, I will be more than happy to hold some of his coins for him :)
In all honesty though, he should hold onto most of them, if he wants to cash some out he should probably put them into investments/pay off any debt he has.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:28:05
Of course they are. However, any money that goes to actual terrorist groups gets passed through the hawala system which is probably harder to track than electronic transfers between banks.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:14:34
What irks me the most is how if you pointed out how anonymous cash transactions are they would come up with some stupid justification as to why they don't need to have a money transmitter license for businesses that conduct business in cash. If ONE guy from Reddit can track the stolen funds from that Sheep marketplace solely on the blockchain, then I'm sure the government can do just as good a job, if not better.
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:42:39
Why not make a competing service to WU? Sure, you would have the same physical costs (storefront and people), but with bitcoins low transaction fees you could pass on the savings through lower fees and take business away from them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:01:05
I'm curious who else besides Casascius has gotten a FinCEN notice. Also, I wonder how far FinCEN is going to go with this. Will they require ANY business that takes Bitcoin to do this due to the supposed risk? If so that would be extraordinarily horrible.
@_date: 2013-07-30 06:32:35
Only buy as much as you can afford to lose, if you want to invest go to and they'll be able to give you good advise on what to invest in. As for buying and sitting on it, I have like 2 BTC that I'm sitting on mainly because I need to spend fiat on necessities, and hopefully this recent upwards swing will continue with momentum. There are some that say that the next big price jump will occur with the halving of the block rewards, so if you buy now you might reap rewards later on.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:46:46
Actually, the drug dealer logic is flawed (through no fault of your own). The National Association of Realtors has an exemption for AML compliance, as detailed on [Zerohedge]( (which is BS but that's another topic entirely). 
Also, I think we're both on the same page when it comes to cash transactions, we just phrased it differently :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:50:15
I agree, in the long run they're just trying to stick it to the dollar however they can, and BTC helps them achieve that goal.
@_date: 2013-09-29 01:44:40
This just gets better and better and here I thought cashing out at .001077 was bad. I feel bad for people who have held onto this stock.
