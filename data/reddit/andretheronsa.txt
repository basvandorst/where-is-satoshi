No. Blockhain is NOT driving this development. At all. Nvidia specifically did not bank on crypto. They are advancing for games and  ai and self driving cars. Crypto so far just messed up the market.

Exactly my point.
You sure?

Because if it isn't used like normal payments then it cannot take over normal payments.

Shows how great the potential for bitcoin is hey, look at the purchasing power of this anarchist.

Ok. So you buy coffee in gold?

A trade is not a trade is not a trade. Not if you are using trading as a metric for widespread adoption. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:16:41
So not all trade is the same then? You want to track the corner store trades to see adoption, not tech savvy money launderers.

Calm down. It's literally one line of code.

"For a currency to retain its value it needs to be used" Bitcoin. Lols.

But the coaster track is going down?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:04:54
Yea. And they don't. Because banks. If they do I get it back. Why? Because I deal with regulated entities answerable to me and not Mongolian dam builders.

Guys. You can't use market tactics on this. Compare it to MySpace. Where is MySpace on the cycle?

The only thing worse than inflation, deflation. Ask anyone how they feel about it who bought in in December. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:35:54
Trendline. It's going down. And yea we know it's up from 1$. Exactly. Itl go back there.

Gold was traded long before cans of beans...

Wish people knew this. My bank fiat is crypto according to this.

As a South African with government consistantly making wrong descisions (if you think buying at  19k is bad...) I WISH I could use bitcoin to hedge against my own currency and to be flexible to get the fuck out. But I can't. Instead I just fill up my tax free benefits and look at conventional global exposure market vehicles like a duche. Maybe I should buy some gold...
(I've never owned bitcoin but I work in tech and might do some business with blockhain guys and I've followed the price for years for some sick reason)
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:55:52
Sounds a lot like OPEC oil suddenly... 
To be fair. Miners wouldn't just turn off  once the btc goes under running costs, running at a loss is still better than not paying off your capital investment at all.... luckily in the real world there is inflation so a capital investment is just that. Investment.

That is exactly my point! The term encryption doesn't mean security.  It goes for banking AND crypto. Cryptography just happens to be used for cryptocurrancies, it doesn't in itself make it more secure
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:55:43
Wow, I thought the penny was bad, what a useless piece of currency you mined there.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:13:57
Uve heard of interest right?

I live in South Africa and this article is definitely not representative of it's use here. 
People are poor, desperate, lazy and not well educated on mangaging finances.
Therefore get rich quick and ponzi schemes do extremely well here. Google MMM in SA.
Black people see it as their chance to not lose out once again ànd white people see it as a way to avoid the government with the wealth they got essentially from apartheid or to have the money mobile if the country collapses.

No wrong.   
The idea that your money/contract/IOU should be worth as much as it takes to print is literally pre-dark ages thinking.
The domination of the bill and its rarity is DEFINITELY not why you have less high denominations. It's because of value.  
The idea that a currency should gain value because people use it is just as backward. Deflationary currency IS A GOOD THING.  
Gold is not a currency anymore. It is a store of value for people with too much FUD about fiat.  
A national currency has a certain value for SO MANY MORE reasons than a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is literally the hopes and dreams, pensions and tax breaks, investments and welfare, infrastructure maintenance and space science funding.

Mine? I am doing a phd in geology and no one ever even asks for my analysis in my field. 
10% increase in a day is dodgy AF for investments.

You do get that the value of a note is NOT determined by its material and printing cost right?
