I've been tipping emerging artists on they have a weekly music melting pot dedicated to original content from musicians, I've had really positive replies including one musician who said it was the first tip ever earned for their music :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:06:39
One of my favorites is btcs.com, the site price checks multiple retailers to find the lowest price and then you pay directly with Bitcoin

That's awsome, did you get all the tips on your $1 = xxxx bits thread?

If I can afford it I try to give $1 but sometimes 500 or 1000 bits seems enough to get a new ChangeTipper on board :)

Hi Tony, many thanks for the amazing  event, I thoroughly enjoyed the commercials and the tipping on Twitter was epic.
I totally understand if you choose not to comment but what do you think is stopping large companies like Amazon and eBay from embracing Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:18:29
I said it over on BitTippers and I'll say it here... You are an inspiration! I hope you will chronicle your experiences living your "Plan B" because it is extremely pioneering and a fresh approach to financial independence!
And hopefully we can support you with thousands of micro tips if the going gets rough ;0)
P.S. Did you settle on a short list of Bitcoin service providers for debit card, payroll, utilities etc.?
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:19:22

Did some more research on this Bibi Bovet, apparently she has single handedly used her Blackberry to code her own blockchain technology which uses Ethereum running on Counterparty wrapped in Ethereum inside Mycelium secured by a Trezor hardware wallet, you can apparently mine BibiCoin using your flip phone...

I bought some really nice grooming products from Wholly Hemp which would totally recommend;
Deodorant: Smells great and worked ok, probably won't replace my regular antiperspirant / deodorant though

Moisturizer: I got the tea tree oil one and it's really refreshing, smells great and again, a little goes a long way

I agree, feels like the initial micro tip frenzy is fading and people are making real differences with bigger tips and directing tippers to threads in other subreddits where people are pooling tips to make a difference.

I'm hoping that in a couple of years time people will look back and not even think about the 3 cent tips but instead wonder why someone would tip insanely huge amounts like 100 bits... 
TL:DR 100 bits will be worth much more :)

Sounds like that extra time that the big guys take creates a healthy early adopters space. On Bitcoin Black Friday I even found myself shying away from the bigger Bitcoin accepting retailers in favor of the smaller companies that are using Bitcoin like MixedTees and BCRMedia etc.

You may have already thought of this but how about a set of ChangeTip emoji icons linked to various amounts of bits?
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:30:29
First day trying all three;
Deodorant feels great, smells nice without being too strong a scent
Hair wax is awesome, a little has gone a long way
The tea tree moisturizer smells the best and again, a very small amount goes a long way
TLDR; Loving the products so far :)

Robby, Evan, Adam, many thanks for taking our questions:
I've been following Tatiana Moroz's journey through the artist coin creation projects on MyPowers.com and wanted to know how involved you have been with the MyPowers site / crowd funding model? Are there any lessons learned from that project and how close a rival is the BitShares Music project going to be?
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:10:39

Done! I tried to be a smart ass and tip RNLI instead but I don't have my ChangeTip protocol totally down yet, had to tip RNLI separately :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:10:25
I use ChangeTip a lot and it's the most fun I've had on Reddit and Twitter for a long time, I regularly tip budding artists, musicians and charities. It's extremely satisfying to hear that you made someone's day with a thank you that they can actually spend or in most cases pay forward.
If I think the recipient is a crypto fan I try to tip in bits as well, I'm hoping one day people look back astounded that I tipped someone x bits much in the same way we can't believe Laszlo Hanyecz ponied up 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas!
