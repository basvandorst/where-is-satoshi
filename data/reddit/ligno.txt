In this scenario, the phone and the tag would both be required to be tapped(tag only has half the key, the phone has the other half). This would provide high confidence that malware could not compromise the transaction, as it would have to be present on both the phone and terminal and work in conjunction to accomplish the fraud.
Let me sketch it out:
1. Terminal displays address and BTC amount.
1. User taps phone, phone then displays address and BTC amount.
1. User accepts details on phone, re-tapps phone.
1. User taps tag to finalize transaction.
Yeah, kinda clunky. Then again, here is a CC TX:
1. Terminal displays address and USD amount.
1. User swipes card
1. User clicks to accept charge amount
1. User signs on terminal
1. Merchant asks to see card and drivers license.
1. Cashier enters CVV2 code to approve TX.
1. Cashier hands back CC.
Hmm, maybe it is not so bad after all.

The problem with NFC is that it is very scarce at this point. NFC also eliminates every BLE iPhone (4S and up) other than the 6/6+. 
Even on Android, NFC is still uncommon.
Assuming the sensor data is available to the Application, Bump+BLE is available on hundreds of millions if not over a billion phones today.
I'm not saying don't support NFC, but bump is low-hanging fruit and would likely be available on every single phone that this new BLE feature is available on.

A little nuance here would be beneficial:
We want total destruction of governments by making them irrelevant and impotent. We want total destruction of governments through reaching a critical mass of people that say, "You know what, government, fuck you, I am not going to pay any more attention to you. You do not matter."
I don't pay my taxes because I think they are beneficial. I pay my taxes because if I resist doing so and resist enforcement actions that will be taken against me if I do not pay, I will be murdered.
Bitcoin (cryptocurrencies in general) is but one tool, probably the most important thing to occur since the internet itself, that will lead to the destruction of the state. When governments no longer control the money supply and cannot confiscate money, a lot of awesome things happen. WW2 probably would have never happened without fiat currency. If people had to pay for the war upfront and the government could not debase currency, selling people on war would be a lot, lot harder.
Just remember, when you use Bitcoin, you are contributing to the death of your own government. :)

Do you pass those savings onto your Bitcoin customers? 10% discount may help, but it is not a huge incentive for a customer to get bitcoin. Now, if you were to pass the entirety of your savings from Bitcoin on to the customer, that would create large incentives. 
It may even be worth it to you to discount those items with the largest number of chargebacks even more than you would normally save using Bitcoin. 
Give your customers a clear economic incentive to use Bitcoin and they will start using it more and more.

Let me start by laying some groundwork for child rights in a libertarian society without a state. A parent/guardian holds a childs rights in trust. They are not the exclusive owner of that child and the child would have the right of self determination. Without a state, parents could sell their rights to guardianship to a third party. Like the parents, this third party does not have exclusive ownership over the child. The child may decide that their new guardians are crappy and simply leave if they think they can either provide for themselves or find a new set of guardians to care for them that would be superior. As it stands today, children cannot exercise exit and therefore have much, much fewer rights than under a libertarian system. Think of how parenting would change if the child could decide to leave and there was not a damn thing the parents could do about it. Do you think that the overall quality of care and attention the child received would diminish or increase?
The Libertarian view of abortion is roughly divided into to two camps. Those that believe the rights of the child begin at conception and those that believe the rights of the child begin when the child is no longer biologically dependent on the mother for survival. The later group can be further subdivided, but those are the main groups.
There is no need to discuss the rights-at-conception group other than to say that their view creates issues in dealing with abortion and the rights of the mother.
The rights at biological independence groups is much more nuanced. My personal view is that the rights of the child begin around 20 or so weeks. The reason for this is that is the earliest point where there is a statistically high chance of survival for the child outside of the womb. Other's may feel that the rights only begin at delivery, those would be the folks OK with late term abortions.
Let us examine the implications of rights at biological independence. Up until around 20 weeks, an abortion would not be considered a rights violation. If this was the case in real life, the limit would probably be closer to the end of the the first trimester to err on the side of caution and would generally be considered reasonable for the mother to make up her mind in the first three months. Once that threshold has passed, the child now has rights as well. At this stage, we are dealing with what could be viewed as a landlord-tenant setting. The landlord has the right to evict tenants but must use the minimum force necessary to do so. So while abortion is no longer permissible, eviction in a way that causes the least harm is (cesarean). Does the mother then have a responsibility to ensure that the child is given the best possible medical care? No. However, the mother has the responsibility to not prevent others from coming to the aid of the child. Once the mother evicts the child, she no longer has any legal rights to be the guardian of the child. In situations such as this, it is highly likely that there will be charity organizations, infertile couples, or couple wanting another child that will take responsibility for the child. Such individuals who wish to avoid the complications of an early delivery may offer to pay the mother a sum of money to carry the child for longer or even to full term. Considering that we have already reached global peak child (If current trends continue, there will never be as many children as there are today), the value of a child is only going to increase in the future. By opening up a competitive market for child rearing, children are now provided with the best opportunities possible. In opening up this market, abortions would likely become a very rare occurrence.

The context of the comment was paying down on the principle to reduce overall interest charges. There is no argument that owning versus renting is tax advantaged. Cost/benefit depends on the individual. 
For my current situation, I am much better off renting for the next three years(at ~$450/month) because I know that I will not live where I currently do and mortgage interest rates for the country I currently live in are around 10%. My expected income will triple/quadruple in three years and it is at that point that I will look at buying a home that costs less than 2x my annual salary, to be paid off within five years of purchase.
Then again, if bitcoin takes off in the next five years(I'm long-term holding more than 20, but less than 90), my future planning is kind of pointless.

Argentina has currency controls in place along side large inflationary policies. Dollars are in high demand(thanks to the ever declining value of the Argentinian Peso) and command about a 30% markup in the street (bluedollar) versus the official exchange rate. Because Bitcoin knows no borders, the USD/BTC rate in Argentina is pretty close to the US rate. 
Given all of this, with a large demand for dollars, there is also a large demand for Bitcoin. Dollars/BTC are a much, much more stable(and appreciating) store of value to the Argentinian people than the Peso.
If a normal Argentinian goes to an ATM their foreign currency will be converted at the official exchange rate and not the bluedollar rate. I am not sure how has his setup (I remember something about some people being allowed to keep dollar denominated accounts, I do not know if they can directly withdraw USD though).
I know that if I was a tourist in Argentina, I would not be withdrawing pesos from an ATM and taking a 30% loss on the exchange. This means I need to either carry enough cash USD to cover my entire trip(Risky, for numerous reasons), or I can sell my bitcoin for Pesos at an inflated rate, putting me at an exchange rate better than the 30% bluedollar differential. I get more pesos than I normally would have, Argentinians get BTC/USD as a hedge against peso inflation. I don't doubt that currency controls are coming to limit airline passengers to less than $500 USD coming in. This will only drive up the scarcity of the dollar and increase bitcoin demand in the process.
If you are interested in the political ramifications of Bitcoin, keep an eye on Argentina. It is a modern democracy that has an out of control central bank and a government that is deeply insolvent(Sound familiar?). The people have lost faith in the national currency and are looking for alternatives. The tipping point for Bitcoin in Argentina is closer than any other country that I know of.

Is there currently, or will there be in the near future a method of using an offline (radios disabled) Android device as a wallet and spending from that(QR codes) without having to compromise the security of the device?
Basically, an offline android device that can sign transactions (by generating a QR code) and never have to be connected to the internet again(relevant blockchain updates via QR codes)? Thus giving (nearly) the security of a paper wallet but the usability of a hot wallet for QR code enabled transactions? Is this something BIP32 makes possible?
You can get a Android 2.3 device for $20 new (LG Optimus Dynamic) that has a camera(and SD card, yay, backups) and would be an inexpensive way to accomplish this, assuming it is possible.
Edit: So I was doing some reading and it looks like what I described is an Android based Trezor that uses QR codes instead of USB. The question still stands though.

From the cursory reading I just did on ARM TrustZone, it looks like the offline device idea would be a lot more feasible. I am unaware of any Android device present or planned that implements the software hierarchy needed to support TrustZone. Apparently, ARM defaults to secure mode and all of our devices are running in that mode right now, making attempted use of TrustZone pointless since every other app on the OS is considered secure.
As to the balance issue they mentioned, doesn't HD wallets solve that issue? (I'm not expecting you to answer that)
Maybe I have the whole data flow process of Trezor wrong and therefore it is more complicated. 
I assumed it was a simple half-duplex model requiring only two transfer events involving the Trezor:
1. Host computer sends transaction details and any needed blockchain info to Trezor
1. Trezor does its magic internally(change address, etc), signs the transaction, and sends the signed transaction back to host computer.
1. Host computer forwards transaction on to bitcoin network.

All this device does is completes the signature. If you send it a TX to sign and send back that uses the wrong key, you will either get nothing back or a invalid signature.


The current demo is just that, a demo. If wallets integrate this device, it will be nothing more than spending normally on your phone and then holding the NFC tag to your device to verify the TX. This is a step above the Trezor in usability but a slight step down from the Trezor in security (no screen to verify address and amount).

Honestly, I don't care what Bitcoin hits in 2014. I care what Bitcoin hits in 2024 and I think $2000 is more than reasonable as a minimum target for 2024. 
Do I think it will be significantly higher? Yes. If Bitcoin takes over the remittances market as it is likely to do over the next decade, that alone would cause a rise to well over $2000.
The other upside for Bitcoin is going to be the significant decline in the value of fiat currencies. The US dollar is set to experience significant inflation when all those excess reserves that the banks are sitting on, thanks to the Fed's willingness to pay them interest on excess reserves, starts to enter the economy. This has the potential to destabilize the dollar to the point that the petrodollar goes away, opening up a huge market opportunity for Bitcoin.

And I a confident that the cost will decrease and the features increase over the next two years. If not, it is an opportunity for a competitor to jump in and steal the show.


This still does not solve points 4 and 5. In addition, Android phones are not designed with physical security in mind. There are exploits out there that allow bypass of the lockscreen on most Android devices that you have physical(USB) access to.


I'm not a coder beyond bash scripts to suit a specific need. If I stumble across someone that looks like they have their shit together, I probably would contribute $50 to crowdfund development of an app for this, even realizing the limitations of Android when it comes to security.


Besides points 4 and 5, I imagine that most people aren't going to be thrilled with waiting for their Android-Signer to boot every time they make a transaction. They'll go for the old credit card instead.


The beauty of the trezor method is that even if you broadcast the transaction details in plain text, you have only compromised privacy and not security. Now, if you are referring to using bluetooth as a method of tunneling into the device, the yes, that is a concern. Once solved by a specialty device in which the bluetooth being compromised would not be a concern from a security standpoint, only a privacy standpoint. This makes Android, once again, a security threat.


I would trust those android smartwatches even less than an Android phone, at this point. Besides, without that bluetooth link, the android smartwatch becomes pretty useless.
Everything I have listed will be solved, but the solution is still a ways off. I accept that and take the needed precautions to protect myself and my funds in the mean time, only exposing as much to my hotwallet as I am willing to lose. All this means is that Bitcoin is not, **yet**, ready for mass adoption. I still think the NFC SD card I linked is a very workable solution and I hope that a developer/group does the work to make it happen. If it supported a NFC card + pin to sign transactions, I would be one of the first customers at any price under $300. Until the NFC SD card is under $50, it isn't going to see mass adoption. The specific card I linked will likely be under $50 within two or three years, thanks to support of Visa/MC for mass adoption. This card may also be suitable for use with Bitcoin as I have described with nothing other than someone submitting the needed Java Applet to the company making them as they look like they are going to be opening it up for more uses by third parties.

Don't count on saving that $200/month. Most of that will end up rolled back into the house for maintenance and repairs. As long as you feel you can cover any expenses out of pocket, go ahead and pay down that principle(Or, if you are long on BTC, just put it there instead). Change your payment schedule to every two weeks instead of once a month and you will save a lot on interest. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:41:02
You are correct and I have purchased a few [$20 ones just for that purpose]( There are multiple problems with this for the mass adoption standpoint:
1. The Android app you speak of does not yet exist and will probably not exist in a usable form for another six to twelve months. (Granted, the trezor integration is also non-existent right now)
1. Disabling the radios, while trivial from my perspective (unscrew rear housing, disconnect the antenna, place phone in airplane mode), is not something that is good advice for the less technically or mechanically inclined.
1. Battery life is a real issue. Even with all the radios disabled and the device in Airplane mode, I do not expect to see more than a week of battery life.
1. Size is an issue. Who wants to carry around a second phone?
1. We are still relying on the user to secure their phone and not lose it.
A bluetooth enabled Trezor solves these issues in several ways:
1. Battery Life: Can be measured in weeks. The device will be off 99% of the time. It only needs to come awake on a keypress and stay awake for, say, 10 minutes.
1. Size: The device can be about the size of a keyfob and light-weight as well.
1. Security: There is no method of recovering the wallet private key, by design. All transactions have to be verified and the user has to enter a pin.
1. Ease of setup: Setup for a Trezor is a matter of turning it on for the first time and letting it generate your HD wallet or inputting your own 12 word phrase.
I don't even think that a Trezor is even the end game. The end game(until something better comes along) is going to be a [MicroSD card that acts as a Trezor, similar to this, probably paired with a contactless payment card and pin*.]( I still like Trezor better, but this solution is ready for the masses and better on security than 99% of current bitcoin users today.
*The reason for a contactless card is to maintain two factor, something you have and something you know. Even a compromised Android phone won't be able to steal your funds without you authorizing the transaction. If it was pin only, that could be compromised and remotely exploited. Combine the pin with the card and only someone with your pin and card could access the funds. Since it would be a HD wallet(that you kept the 12 word seed for), losing the card is a non-issue since you can always re-initialize the TrezorSD with a new card and pin.
Sadly, the TrezorSD will not be commercially viable for a few years as it would need a large market to justify the manufacturing costs.

This is my understanding of how Trezor works:
1. Private master key is stored on Trezor. 
1. Trezor makes public master key available to computer client through USB storage.
1. Computer client handles all the details of the transaction and puts text file of details into Trezor's USB storage.
1. Trezor reads text file from USB storage.
1. Trezor prompts the user to confirm transaction details
1. User confirms details.
1. Trezor signs said transaction using appropriate key
1. Trezor puts new file of signed transaction on USB storage
1. Computer client reads signed transaction from USB storage
1. Computer client forwards signed transaction to bitcoin network
1. Because the computer never sees the private key, it maintains a level of safety equivalent to that of a paper wallet that has never been used.
If my understanding is correct, this seems simple enough to replace USB storage with QR code(assuming a QR code can convey enough data). Obviously the computer would need a webcam or you could replace the computer with another (online) phone.
As to generating seed for HD wallet, the Android device can read camera data + gyro data to generate randomness, or the deterministic phrase can be manually imported.

41% = 1% Pool Fee
42% = 2% Pool Fee

44% = 8% Pool Fee
45% = 16% Pool Fee
46% = 32% Pool Fee
47% = 64% Pool Fee

This is easily fixed through retransmission and FEC. In this type of application there would likely be overlapping transmissions with different delay times (+/- 5-10 seconds) and repeats until the next block is available. Since each block is typically under 500KB (Just taking a quick look at the last 10 blocks on blockchain.info), even a modest broadcast signal of 200Kbps is going to be able to keep up with the blockchain with ease.
This does not solve the issue of the initiator needing a path to send the data, but it does solve the issue of the vending machine requiring a two way connection. This point is generally moot anyways since many vending machines already have a two way communication path for credit card transactions. 
In the vending machine scenario, I can see the more likely case that the customer needs no internet connection whatsoever. The vending machine generates a QR code/NFC of the transaction, the customer scans/NFCs receives the transaction details his phone, the customers phone(using a HD wallet) generates and signs the missing transaction details and communicates that via QR code/NFC to the vending machine which then transmits to the blockchain.
Other scenarios in which the customer has a two way connection and the vending machine has only a one way is possible through the vending machine seeing that transaction appear in the broadcast.
The thing this whole conversation is missing is that all services do not have to occur within the blockchain. I can send money through coinbase using SMS. Yes, Coinbase is acting as a payment processor, but just because edge cases present difficulties for bitcoin does not mean that no other avenues will become available.

Depends highly on the modulation, frequency allocation(the actual bandwidth), and signal strength.
Let us look at the current best case scenario in use today, LTE Advanced 8x8 MIMO:
Typical FM carrier is allocated 200KHz to include guard bands (spacing between carriers). Of that, there is typically about 50KHz utilized(highly wasteful, they could easily use 150+KHz with today's tech), so let us use that as the target frequency allocation.
The spectral efficiency of LTE Advanced 8x8 MIMO is 30 bits per hertz. So, 50k*30 = 1.5Mbps. Even 2009 standard LTE with no MIMO (probably a better comparison for FM broadcast) has a spectral efficiency of 16 bits per hertz, yielding 800Kbps. Granted, you are going to need more FEC the longer distance you want the signal, but one could fully expect over 500Kbps for the current power, coverage area, and frequency allocation of a single FM radio station.
DVB-T is tied to a pretty crappy modulation scheme by comparison(kickass for 1997 though) with a maximum spectral efficiency of 4 bits per hertz with a typical efficiency of 2.8. Let us use the typical to see what DVB-T could do with 50KHz: 2.8*50k=140Kbps.
I'm leaving out overhead for framing and such as to not complicate things, but the numbers are close enough.

So, what you are saying is that you will only purchase from sellers that meet your specific need for trust? Good for you. Just realize that you have limited your own options for sellers of goods and the sellers that meet your requirements may charge a premium for having such exposure. If you are willing to pay the extra price for the "security" of knowing the real identity of the seller, that is entirely your decision to make. You will probably stick to purchasing items from established companies and there is nothing wrong with that.
As to your scenario of the guy selling the fake $2k laptop. How likely are you to purchase a $2k laptop on ebay from a seller with zero feedback score? I know that I would not.
The entire point of the proof-of-burn is to bootstrap your credentials. New entrants are going to start small and build up a reputation. It is the value of that reputation (and therefore the willingness of people to do business with them) that is critically important to a seller. The longer you are established and the more positive reviews you have, the more people are willing to trust you. Just look at SR and how much business sellers with 1-star averages do.

Let them downvote. As long as they continue to use decentralized cryptocurrencies, they are contributing to the eventual dissolution of the state they love so much.

Thanks, you guys are doing great work.
Will you guys be adding support for HD wallet generation? That looks like something in serious need of good randomness.
Along that same vein, I know you guys are working on the whole HD wallet thing for the standard client. Do you think you guys are going to add support for your client operating in a strict offline environment to let a radio-free/disabled Android device act as a cheap Trezor? That is, put in the components needed to do offline signing on one device and support the transaction process for that to interact with an internet connected Mycelium device through QR codes?
There appears to be some work in this regard, but no one has made any significant progress in over a year.
If it is unclear what I am asking for, this guy has sketched out the concept:

Wrong. Power levels are low especially since all it is doing is beacon xmits. VSWR levels won't get high enough to trigger an automatic shutdown much less fry anything. We're talking power levels well below 23 dBm and momentary bursts at that.

Yet the only way for the state to "protect" property rights is the wholesale violation of property rights. Yeah, no thanks. I would much rather voluntarily pay for someone to protect my property rights, at least then I have the option of picking the best option on the market that is suitable to my needs and pocketbook instead of being forced at gunpoint to pay tribute.
To all those that will disagree with this notion, exactly why does the state have the moral sanction to do things that, if an individual or small group did, you would find horrifying? At what point does a group become large enough that they have the moral sanction to commit such actions?

I may not have been clear enough. What I was describing is exactly how transactions using QR codes for payment at POS works with the only difference being the vendor acting as a carrier for the signed transaction instead of AT&amp;T. Let me elaborate, I'll show the process for a NFC/QR Code transaction today and then that of one where the vending machine acts as a carrier:
(you can swap QR code for NFC)
1. Vending machine generates QR code with destination address and amount to be sent.
1. Customer scans QR code
1. Customer's phone generates transaction data, confirms address and amount to send.
1. Customer confirms transaction and customer's phone signs transaction.
1. Customer's phone sends signed transaction over 3G/Wifi to Bitcoin network
1. Vendor sees transaction in Bitcoin network
For the vendor as carrier, change item 5 and 6 to:
5. Customer's phone generates QR Code of signed transaction.
6. Vending Machine scans QR code of signed transaction.
7. Vending machine forwards signed transaction over 3G/Wifi/POTS/etc to Bitcoin network
8. Vendor sees transaction in Bitcoin network
Security difference between the two methods? None.

For now. Even Bitcoin is still way too complicated for the average user, but it is getting better every month.
In three years Trezor-like devices are going to be sold for under $50, less than you pay for a [nice leather wallet]( The Mycelium Entropy is starting life at $40 and the cost will likely drop significantly in that same time frame with a volume ramp up.
We are literally approaching the day when all someone needs to get into Bitcoin securely is buy a Bluetooth/NFC Trezor(yeah, not yet, I know) and pair it with their phone. As Bitcoin ATMs deploy, the hurdle to getting Bitcoins for most people drops.
In three years I can see the instructions for getting into bitcoin going something like this:
1. Buy Bluetooth Trezor
1. Turn Trezor on, write down and keep safe 12-word key when prompted
1. Install Mycelium on your Android/iOS phone
1. Pair Trezor and Phone
1. Link Mycelium with Trezor (Trezor sends Mycelium the master public key)
1. Go to Bitcoin ATM and scan phone
1. Insert cash into ATM and now you have bitcoins
1. Repeat steps 6 &amp; 7 as needed
For all the complexity of bitcoin, this whole process will not be much more difficult than getting a new bluetooth headset and using an ATM, something the average person can do.

Yup. The least profitable will be squeezed out. This will lower the overall hashrate and provide more profits to the miners still going at it. It is an interesting case of the market rewarding the most efficient actors and punishing those that cannot adapt quickly enough.

Yep, I get that. So in keeping with the stated purpose of RBF, how does FSS RBF and RBF differ except in that the replacement TX in RBF can be whatever you want and the replacement TX in FSS RBF must be(at minimum) the exact same as the original TX + an additional miner fee?
Is the complaint that you cannot readjust the miner fee back down? (retract your bid, so to speak)

Yes. The market, like mother nature, is an unforgiving bitch. If your business makes one mistake, it can be game over. Businesses that fail to meet the demand of their customers and fail to provide a superior product (price, quality, quantity, etc) that meets the demand of the customer will quickly find themselves out of money. When they liquidate their assets, other entrepreneurs can buy up what is useful at firesale prices and kickstart their own process of competing in the market. Failures of businesses within a free market are a sign that there is healthy competition. Competitors look at the failures and try to see where they fucked up so as not to repeat the same mistakes. 
This is why, in a free market(not what we have today with mercantilism and crony capitalism where government regulations greatly inhibit new entrants), businesses will tend towards a natural limit on their size and scope. That limit will be different for every sector. As a business grows too large and gets too set in its ways, the market will shift under its feet and the more nimble competitors will profit from the shift while the slow to change large corporation experiences losses from a failure to predict market conditions and meet the needs of the customer.
**tl;dr: It is survival of the fittest, the businesses most fit to serve the unrelenting demands of their customers.**

Add a locking bit? They're adding a whole new feature that nodes are going to be using for RBF, adding this as part of the RBF spec should be trivial.
To take things one step further. Make all RBF enabled TXs declare which output will be the one that can be modified on the initial TX. That way merchants can have their setup to reject RBF transactions that target them as the changeable output.
Thinking about it like this, it would be superior to FSS.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:03:49


I really don't get the RBF hate. It is an optional feature and all you have to do if someone sends you a RBF transaction is make them wait until you have a confirmation before finalizing the sale, trade, etc.
I mean, it is as simple as merchants saying fuck RBF and RBF wont be used.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:20:40


Well, that is different. I can see why they would resist FSS RBF in that scenario. FSS RBF gets all the benefits of RBF with none of the drawbacks and torpedoes any plans to force transactions off the blockchain. 
Eventually I can see most transactions taking place outside of the main blockchain, but that will be a fairly slow evolution driven by ever increasing fees (not even necessarily in BTC, the fee in BTC may remain the same while the value of that BTC is driven up enough to make the fee unattractive). I dislike the idea of central planners dictating the time and place for the transition.
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:20:20
How about we change the structure of a RBF to make it unattractive to scam.
RBF can change the miner fee and ONE output, that one output will be locked for all future RBFs of the original TX. This means that, at worst, RBF can be used to make a donation to miners and screw the recipient. The sender can never get their BTC back through RBF redirection.
I'm still not a fan of RBF and I can see some downsides of FSS RBF, but this seems like a good compromise.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:00:09


The hell if I know. I cant see a use case for redirectable output RBFs other than fraud and "oops I'm a dumbass, can I please not burn this BTC." FSS RBF makes sense in that you can just bump your fee if the TX isn't going through.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:28:09
So help me understand this. (This may not be how FSS works, but it should be if we are eliminating drawbacks)
RBF voids the old TX and replaces it with a new TX. Generally(99.9% of cases assuming nothing nefarious) the new TX will be identical to the old TX + a different miner fee. 
FSS RBF voids the old TX and replaces it with a new TX. FSS guarantees that the new TX will be identical to the old TX + a different miner fee.
Can the protocol not separate the miner fee from everything else? Or are you specifically speaking to the fact that there will be a minimum overhead for FSS RBF because you must source from a minimum of one additional input coin(+ extra change outputs) for your FSS RBF because you can't decrease your change to make up the additional miner fee?
If so, it seems like pretty minimal overhead for the benefits.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:41:13


I am wholly unfamiliar with the specifics of how RBF/FSS RBF work. Can you explain how locking the destination address to the one in the original transactions does all those things and not locking it avoids them? Does the protocol not differentiate between payment and change addresses? Even if that were the case, is the solution not to just specify that the RBF must have the original output amounts and addresses at a minimum? This avoids the issue of having to figure out what is spending and what is change.
