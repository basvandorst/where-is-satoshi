Why don’t you just transfer it out of CB to your wallet?

No it doesn’t. US only, at least that’s the case last time I tried.

Yes you can. This is my process. Buy BTC on CB using my Canadian Visa card. I take BTC out of CB and put them on my personal wallet. When I will sell, I will make an account on a Canadian exchange say, Quadriga. Transfer BTC from wallet to Quadriga account and then sell for CAD.

Just to add, if you are Canadian, CB can be tricky. You might be better off finding a good Canadian exchange so there’s less transferring and hassle with getting CAD. I’m only using CB because I’m currently in the US and based on my vpn I couldn’t use many Canadian exchanges. But I will be switching when I get home.

Well the general advice is not to store your Bitcoin on the exchange because should the exchange ever get hacked you lose your money. A wallet only you control is much safer. Now if we’re talking $100 or something, it’s probably not worth taking off CB because the transfer fees will eat up your Bitcoin. I use $100 as a small amount but it’s really whatever you feel safe with. Should you transfer it to a wallet and want to sell in a month from now, you just send your Bitcoin back to Coinbase and then sell at that point, however two things to note. First you’ll pay Bitcoin transfer fees for going CB-Wallet and then Wallet-CB. Secondly you can’t sell on CB if you want CAD funds, you’ll have to use a Canadian exchange. CB hasn’t support CAD for a while now. Let me know if that makes sense, I’m on mobile so typed it up quickly.

Just compare the fees between CB and Quad because that’s basically the only difference. Both are exchanges so not a good place for long term BTC storage. Maybe Quad gets another point because CB has gone down a few times due to is immense popularity recently. But long term I feel like a Canadian exchange is probably just easier than CB. And ya the transfer fees suck but that’s how BTC works so there’s no escaping lol. If it’s not a large amount just leave your BTC on CB and wait till the fees get a little lower maybe a few weeks or so.

On the purchase screen there should be a link like "increase your limits". Probably have to provide ID. Try doing it on a computer, might be easier.

This is nothing new and I will wager to say that all of Reddit is affected by these bots/websites. It is amusing how they are paying bots to try and take down r/bitcoin but claim that their coin is the true coin. Cant be that good if you need to buy bots to keep up appearances.

This makes sense, thank you.
I do remember reading something about an SEC decision/discussion so I will take a look at that, but your post gives something to think about for sure.
