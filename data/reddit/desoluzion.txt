I've tried contacting my bank but reached a pre-recorded message saying that no one was currently available &amp; wouldn't be until business hours. I'm not sure if it's all of the Holiday processing or what, but I am certainly going to remain vigilant in contacting them. Would like to think they WOULD be operating 24/7 all 365. Thank you very much for actually offering advice &amp; understanding my situation, as opposed to these serial downvoters.

Thank you kindly for your help, I've submitted a ticket &amp; have also emailed them. Really appreciate the positivity, I don't understand why others would be so cruel as to believe I actually made all of this up, to what benefit? It's unnerving to say the least.

You would be mistaken, why the hell would I go into great lengths to post all of this, if it wasn't the case? What could I possibly gain from doing this? ��

Aren't emojis MEANT for expressing your current emotion online? Please stop trolling.

You're truly an asshole, if you only knew what I'm fucking dealing with.

Hadn't yet, it was literally the first step to even setting up my debit so that I could purchase the BTC.

Thanks for your contribution or lack thereof, definitely helped ease my situation, ugh.
