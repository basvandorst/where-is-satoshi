Gold is also artificially tied to it's price, roughly same sum buys the same amount of flour, bread and horses today as 1882 (in gold).

The thing is, it doesn't have to replace fiat. There are multiple currencies right now and I really don't see that changing any time soon. (Even if only for the simple reason that it is so easy to safely record transactions in a blockchain data structure)
 Single chain may mean additional security, but how the fuck do you expect to orchestrate transactions (for example) from the outer rim of the andromeda galaxy? 
Future physics may change this, but as things are now, things start to break at the latest when light speed is not _enough_ to send a transaction to a block in a reasonable timeframe.
The "only" solution with current technology is to run multiple chains ("alt-coins"), so that when physical signal coverage starts to become an issue, we can create even more localized chains that are backed with holdings of another currency in another network, for the people at insanely far distances from home to use for daily interactions, that are then traded for the more established currencies (with less liquidity obviously) when moving between coverage areas or we're yet again left with money that cannot be freely moved on a whim.

Gl with that, you guys don't seem to understand that at it's core bitcoin(and every other currency in a blockchain data structure)  is _just a fucking list of funds_, every block is **literally** filled with text such as "x sent c to y" represented in a different format along with some additional restrictions and parameters,  it cannot "really" be blocked without also blocking any and all communication between computers in the world, if the specific port used for the traffic between nodes is blocked on a hardware level, we just change the port and or use literally any other already existing chain, there is no way to stop it unless pretty much _everyone_ who is participating stops participating.
Revolution started with the concept of p2p file sharing and has slowly but surely lead us to this, rip requiring trust between two parties in order to exchange value.

Not just gpu's, they would have to ban representing numbers in binary, again, gl with that.

In the event of a hypothetical 51% attack of that scale we fork from the last normal block, business as usual within a week no matter what scenario. Side chains (alt coins) provide failover while the switch is made.

Well, there is no forced redistribution, so technically... Yes? You won't gain or lose any tokens, but the rich generally won't feel pressured to use them

You are describing inflation, there is only deflation in btc, moving the decimal only makes more slices of the same existing product

You definitely don't own your body, but no one is going to come over and swll your organs if you miss doctor payments, but if you cant afford property tax (property rent*) they will take your home.

LN is a separate custodial system. It is not connected to the core program in any way.

If it’s not open source you don’t know if there is a secondary hidden layer of transactions

Or if there was another 1.5billion USDT printed recently, wonder if that has anything to do with it

That's the whole point of having them on an exchange, though. The exchange owns all currency deposited to it and hands out IOU's in return, if they actually sent btc to different wallets every time someone makes a trade, the transaction fees would kill trading.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:57:31
By that logic banks are not custodial

This is simply not true, you can force the blockchain to behave however you want, with literally millions of different ways to generate “free” coins from the network if no one can inspect the source. Starting from masked transactions that temporarily hide coins that you own yourself to artificially raising mining fees and forcing majority of blocks to follow a before set pattern, so that you could choose which blocks to mine. If there is no transparency, there is no accountability.

Besides, who are we to define "too much" when "too much" wouldn't even land you a base on another planet.

You mean capital gains tax?

Meanwhile when I was 6, I was absolutely obsessed with scrooge mc duck and wanted more than anything to secure more funds.

Nobody is talking about it because the coins were returned to original owners from the attacker that initially claimed them, it was the right course of action no matter how you try to spin it.
Miners should not act with malice towards people on the blockchain.
