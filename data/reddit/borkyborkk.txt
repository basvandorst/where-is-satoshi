I’m no expert in this but I think that the price rn would be steadily going up instead of dropping since we just had a correction at 10k. Hopefully I am wrong though since I’m tryna get into the action too

you’re most welcome my fellow HODLer. Sometimes I can’t control my third hand, it gets excited near bitcoin

No worries. You can start by finding exchanges for bitcoin. The one that I am using is Luno, it’s pretty user friendly so I would recommend you to start there.

What does HODL mean??? I’m new to all this 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:27:10
relax brother. The price will most probably go up again. This is just the nature of the market, the price is now reacting to bad news about bitcoin and hopefully after it fades it will rise again. Just HODL BABYYYY

Yes you can. I started with 100$ worth of bitcoin. The long term chart is looking great for bitcoin. The price always bounces back and breakout from its former high and that is exactly why people are HODLing it.

So basically holding?
