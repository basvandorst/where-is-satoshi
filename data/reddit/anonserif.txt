I’m still mad at Satoshi for selling the code to microsoft. My friends don’t think it’s a big deal but what if microsoft decide to change the way mining blocks works? eg they could lower the graphics so that miners dont need GPUs or ASICs to mine blocks anymore, or they could change it so wood pickaxes are actually better than diamond and there’s nothing we could do about it?

yea and who has coins who is left to sell?
hodlers just won’t. People willing to sell when price drops probably have already.
There are no genius marketing manipulating whales out there to sell now (if they even exist, as if they were such geniuses they’d have sold a month ago not be thinking of doing it now).
however who is willing to buy? None of the above. 
Maybe this is why volume is low.
Would mean this is the new bedrock price, quite a bit higher than what it was last year suggesting btc price is growing over the long term.

short term buying and selling feels more like gambling on a whim. Lots of people find it impossible to time it.
Buying and holding for years is still a gamble that bitcoin price will rise over the next few years. But that feels less like a whim and more like a shrewd bet that bitcoin as a technology will develop more and become more prevalent.

Just a reminder, when you see people talking about bull markets, bear markets and whales, it’s not some financial jargon, it’s literally bears and bulls being bought and sold on the open market and the occasional whale. The CEO of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, had a vision of a currency based upon the trade of large mammals. When someone tells you bitcoin is based on thin air ask them how much thin air can you get for a whale? can you buy a bear with thin air? A bull?

Interested to hear ppls theories on what factors affect price movements.
I currently think the price rises when buyers outstrip sellers. So the current flatness means buys and sells are roughly equal.
when the price goes higher than most ppl think it should be more ppl sell which drops the price.
Bull run and crash happens when ppl think or fomo into a rise with momentum expecting it to continue coupled with holders holding on while it rises planning to sell at the top. But eventually the buyers are exhausted - all in - then it takes only a few ppl to think it’s time to sell to cause a panic sell crashing the price.
Eventually it drops so much ppl start to think about buying again, figuring it’ll go back up (there’s now history of this). Also by then lots of sellers are used up as ppl have sold all so it’s easy for it to kick off again.
In the long term some ppl expect it to increase which is why they hold. But given enough time, if it doesn’t they sell. This is why over months if the price doesn’t jump it slowly drops over time, eg after 2018.
Thoughts? Ideas?

@_date: 2019-07-27 13:03:49
that’s not necessarily going to help. When some people sell they find they replace the stress of it falling with the stress of it rising.
I’ve observed some people who bail out and then it rises actually seem *more* devastated then those who stayed in and it dropped a lot. I don’t know why but a big part of it may be human need for community - if you bail you are on your own. If the plane then soars away with everyone on it you are alone with whatever stress that causes.
If you stay on the plane and it crashes you can at least have loads of other people in the same boat (plane).
I think the best strategy if it’s too stressful is to sell *some*, maybe even half so at least you are still in and really the stress is likely due so the proportion of commitment (savings) being higher than tolerance level.

before the dotcom bubble people outside tech thought it was just some nerdy computer thing. The idea people not into computers would ever use it was not on their radar. This was before mobile phones too.
The subsequent dotcom bubble was when ppl realised and fomod in. When the crash happened ppl thought yeah of course these online shops aren’t really worth millions why did we think that would work. 
But now amazon is billions.
I’m not saying bitcoin is as big as the internet would be, just that there are parallels with how it took many years of development and people realising ways to use it before it took off as a platfork. In the initial years it looks niche and too full of problems and lacking use cases.
Think the same happened with cloud computing.

“Fuck off!” you cry through the thick smeared glass, but to no avail.
The mutant quickly finishes his work and holds up fingers demanding payment. 2 Satoshis! No NO NO you shout!
“Where’s my fuckin’ money?!!” roars the mutant and raises the crowbar.
You slam your foot down on the accelerator hard. Wheels spin and screech in the toxic swill. A crash as the screams of the mutant mix with the crunching of metal. You hodl your foot down on that pedal, hodling is how you got into this mess, perhaps it can get you out too.

it might drop or not in the short or medium term but I find it highly likely that it’ll be much higher in the future.
it’s a technology that is under development and so far it seems to be dominant over rival crypto due to network effect. 
So as a technology it has a drive to be improved with each passing year. Everything improves, education about it, the tech itself, exchanges, services. Even more people willing to use it with each passing year as the younger generations emerge, so the market is increasing. Over years innovators will also have a chance to have eureka moments and build stuff that helps adoption.
I see bitcoin as being like the early early internet, where lots of people were doubting its usefulness to the everyday person. Too slow, too complicated, why would anyone ever shop online? Using money online is a terrible risk! we can just drive to the shops.
Will it suddenly explode like the early internet? I don’t know you have to decide for yourself.
That said if it’s stressing you then stop buying so much and start making some savings elsewhere too so you aren’t mostly in bitcoin, cuz every investment is a risk and going all in on anything would be stressful.

This is a problem with centralised exchanges that are limited in number and succeptible to censorship.
The answer is peer to peer decentralised exchange allowing two individuals to directly exchange two different coins with each other without requiring a third party.
That way you’ll always find someone willing to trade your “bitcoin that government x doesn’t like” for some coin they hold.
It becomes almost impossible for any ideology (eg that coins can be “tainted”) to dictate to others that don’t accept that.

Who makes the decisions as to how the bitcoin protocol evolves? Isn’t this a form of centralisation?
If a government were to get developers under their influence onto the development team they could control the future evolution of the protocol. Eg BIP 99852 requires nodes to check that a transaction is signed with a valid citizen’s ID. BIP 104443 dictates that half the transaction fee be sent to a government address for taxation purposes.

do the majority of nodes and miners really review all the changes and the philosophical reason behind them, or do they simply update to the latest version?
The devs seem to be the ones choosing and planning where bitcoin heads. Eg scaling vs security vs anonymity.
What I’m trying to figure out is to what extent the devs authoritively control the long term nature of bitcoin this way, how many of them there are, is one dev dominant, how do they decide what to change/implement with bitcoin and where do they decide this. Who controls who can be a developer. Is there a criteria that bars eg a group of devs paid by a government from contributing and taking over control by majority rule? 
To a large extent nodes have to follow where the rest of the network heads, so there’s only limited ability for node owners to resist a change they don’t like if the rest of the network don’t really care.

Good points. Yes currently bitcoin transactions are too slow and fees too high, especially for small transactions. There is no easy fix as the slowness is currently required to keep bitcoin secure with the number of users it has. The high fees are a side effect of the slowness.
One solution is the the lightning network which sits on top of bitcoin and is designed to allow fast small transactions with low fee. This is currently under development.

1. You make lots of small transfers from Coinbase pro to the same receive address over time which adds up to a large amount 1btc.
2. You send 0.001 btc to a friend from that address
3. Your friend is so pleased they have their first bitcoin they publicly post about it on Facebook, including a screenshot of the amount
4. Bad actor sees this and looks through recent transactions for a 0.001 btc output. Finds it, looks at where it came from, finds that address has had 100 small payments amounting to 1btc.
5. Even if your friend didn’t name you, bad actor goes through their friend list and tries to find contact info for as many people as possible.
6. For each target, bad actor crafts a phishing email that looks like it comes from coinbase. In it is a chronological list of 100 transactions with accurate dates and amounts. The message reads that they detected possible fraud on your account. Did you send 0.001 to someone yesterday? If so simply click the following link, login and verify.
If you send lots of small amounts to *different addresses* then to send a small amount from a single or two of them it doesn’t expose the full amount in all
If you are btc poor like me though, well i don’t worry about it. The trick is to buy high, sell low. That way you never own enough btc for scammers to bother with.

Finding a utility for alts is a problem sure, but there is an easy solution to any problem these days - all we need to do is put all the alts on a blockchain.

the difficulty in creating a valid block is finding the correct hash for the new block that allows it to be added to the blockchain.
A miner could create blocks that only contain a transaction to pay themselves the reward. In reality though miners are motivated to stuff a new block with as many of other people’s transactions as they can to collect the transaction fees (this is also why setting a higher transaction fee incentivises your transaction to be confirmed faster as there is limited space in each block and miners tend to pick transactions with higher fees)
As far as transactions go each block really is just a container for hundreds or thousands transactions.
transactions are effectively validated before they enter a block. A miner would never want to put an invalid transaction into a block as other nodes would detect this and dismiss the entire block as invalid, and the miner would therefore lose all the earnings from that block they had spent ages mining (as the block wouldn’t be accepted into the chain)

I can’t see how that dump trick really works. 
it’s like selling a bit, causing the price to begin falling then continuing to sell as it falls, indistinguishable from panic selling.
Hoping for the price to continue falling to buy back in seems prone to the opposite happening given the whale just took out a load of sellers on the way down and has made a dip attractive for buyers.
Not to mention if they try to buy back in lower with a large amount quickly they get the same raw deal in reverse.
I wonder how many large sells are by whales who hear about the trick, try it, and discover the hard way it doesn’t work.

I don’t understand why a games company would want to put assets on a blockchain, let alone the bitcoin blockchain.
I’d want to put them up on a centralised server I completely control so I can add, modify and remove them easily. Not have them distributed across computers I don’t control in some over complex way that’s just begging for some exploit that no one will understand when I say I have no control over my own assets to be able to fix the problem.

My reasoning is that a crash is against so many interests that if caused by a bug I am sure there would be enough will to fix it, ideally in a way that minimises loses, but as a nuclear option a hard fork prior to the impact of the bug.
A consensus fork can damage the value of bitcoin - eg bch - in a limited way but its like a larger scale version of how forks can occur through mining on the blockchain itself. Everyone follows the longest chain and eventually the smaller branches are left in the dust - eg bch - the biggest risk is really personal - make sure you don’t follow the wrong chain

I think what you say is important there should be a safety net built in at any single point of failure. If someone figures out how to easily generate low hashes without needing to trial and error then they will be able to mine blocks instantly.
I’m guessing the crypto experts response to this will be “you guys just don’t understand how unfeasible that is” or “if sha256 can be broken like this the world has bigger problems than bitcoin”. But I’d think why not put the safety net in in case that’s wrong?
ECDSA is known to be succeptible to quantum computers. Sha256 is thought to be resistant. But who knows.

Idk I saw a talk by the lead of bouncy castle crypto last year who said he thought an encryption breaking quantum computer was just 10 years away (and that was in response to people working on it claiming 5)
While it’s not just a problem for bitcoin, other users such as banks being centralised does give them a chance to cancel transactions in the event of a catastrophe. With bitcoin there is no capability to do that.

it cannot reach zero because I would be willing to spend $100 to acquire all 21 million bitcoins just as a collectors item at which point I would only give them to someone else for considerably more. Now multiply that behaviour by how many people were willing to do the same.
As a collectors item alone it has a non zero base price, a low price though.
On top of that though is speculation that the price will increase at some point. The lower the price gets the lower the total volume and so the easier it is for sudden fomo or a few whales to surge demand and cause price rise.
None of this would work if bitcoin wasn’t limited in supply.

Segwit is slightly more important than improving capacity. It also fixed a problem where parts of a transaction could be legitimately altered - ie not in an important way - but which would change the transaction id.
This made it impossible to reliably chain transactions together offline and submit them, because if the first transaction’s id can alter by the time it gets on the blockchain then the second transaction is now pointing at the wrong thing.
By making sure the transaction id doesn’t change segwit makes it possible to generate a chain of transactions offline and submit them all at once, which is important for how the lightning network works.
Someone with more knowledge might want to correct this if I’ve made a mistake, but I think the above is fairly accurate to say.

Interesting idea. It couldn’t really be a separate blockchain though because they’d have to be in sync so much that they’d end up being effectively the same chain anyway.
If you want to add multiple hashing and encryption algorithms you can do that on the one existing chain.
Sha256 is not technically encryption but yeah I suppose mining could be altered to require two hashing problems to be solved each using a different algorithm. That way if someone did break one for the purposes of mining they’d still be time limited by the second. But I think Sha256 is considered quite safe and I doubt miners would accept such a change and would refuse to run it.
The bitcoin script used to secure bitcoins on the chain already supports different hashing algorithms.
At the moment only ECDSA is used for signing transactions. A new option could be added to specify a different signature algorithm. That way an amount could be locked behind two separate signatures of different types, which would require both be broken. I suppose that would be more secure...
Not sure if the whole snorr signature stuff is going to replace ecdsa or be exactly a kind of second algorithm that can be used.
as it stands to steal money today would usually require breaking Sha256 and EC at the same time so it’s largely not a big issue.

you can say it’s the same but only in the same way a cassette tape is the same as an mp3, in that both can contain the same music. The mp3 is more flexible though, transferring for example. Which is going to win in the longterm? My money is on the more efficient medium.
Both gold and bitcoin have unique downsides, but a lot these diminish over time for bitcoin and increase for gold.
Eg the newness of bitcoin presents some risks but this will directly diminish with time. The limited supply of gold is at risk in the longterm as technology allows greater amounts of gold to be discovered and mined.
