At least the [post office]( is always open!

do you think if you had 1000 monkeys with 1000 typewriters they could reproduce it in 1000 years?

Its no different to postal voting, which at least in the UK (im not sure about other countries but doubt its too different) is available to anyone who checks the relevant box on their registration.

It's worth pointing out that it isn't an official Kraken app

Looks like it was on purpose? From the article:

Not really, he's lumping it in with printing money out of thin air. Saying "you think bitcoin is ridiculous, this is even more so...".

Yeah I agree, I just meant from a normal everyday consumer's viewpoint there's no immediate advantage. Long-term it would seem they would save money as shops would save money on bank transaction fees and cash handling meaning they could lower their prices, but its unlikely that supermarkets would list 2 prices for diff pay methods, so you end up paying the same as someone with a bank card anyway.

Yeah I was thinking, wow the Queen goes to a really crummy looking dentist..

It's funny that you have to say "please" to a device you own.

I would think it would be "krah-kin".
On TV i've always heard it as "cracken" though, so maybe it's an american way of saying it.

I'm not sure we are. From what I understand (and I haven't used it yet) it looks like Circle pass on the payment for this fee to your CC company for you, so on your credit card statement it will show as 1 transaction, but Circle will show you the fee itemised.

Thanks for the answer! Could you briefly describe the process someone would do that once they have access to the cloud backup? Would they still need my password at least to access the coins? I noticed Blockchain sends a wallet backup to email, is that the same thing? Would I just encrypt it in a zip file or something?

They don't. It costs me €0 to transfer to Kraken within the EU, and €0.09 to withdraw euros. Then buying btc from them has .2% fees. So for €80 of btc it would cost €80.41 including 2x conversions and the withdrawal.

If I have btc stored in an online wallet like Blockchain with 2fa, what ways could someone get access to my coins other than them having access to my password and 2fa device?

Just to let you know, if you use a Halifax Clarity credit card there are no international processing fees or exchange rate loading. However you will still pay the standard "2.9% card processing fee".

Think it was a double up on, ie "when you enter a transaction" or "when you make a transaction".

In the "new world" sense, Europe is the "old world". That terminology is used only in a historical sense, not for economics/power.

And have you? Assume its a pawnshop?

In the UK payments from bank to bank are free &amp; instantaneous 24/7. Despite bitcoins benefits, I think it will have a hard time catching on here considering normal banks are cheaper and faster than bitcoin for normal day-to-day things. Its benefits here for normal consumers now only really relate to international transfers and full control over your money in a cash-like way.

I reckon, when I had to learn that there was 100 cents in a dollar I was all like whaaaaaa, you expect me to remember this shit??

You seen Meat Market in Covent Garden? It's certainly no fancy restaurant and a burger will cost you about £8-9. Five Guys isn't much better. GBK, Shake Shack, Byron, all charge around that price for a burger.
If anything, being a "street vendor" in Silicon Roundabout would allow you to charge more.
