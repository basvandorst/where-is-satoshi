I am Korean
and it is clear that current gov wants to ban it.
I think they can't, but they will surely impose new regulations
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:01:14
actually Bitcoin in Korea is still about 30% more expensive than regular market price.
there is a reason coinmarketcap decided to exclude korean exchanges for now
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:51:36
actually there arethree major reasons
CME shorts
China plan to Ban crypto including mining
Korea regulation

stock market
crypto market tanking together lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:29:05
think everyone is afraid of how tether will turn out in
Senate crypto hearing.
plus whales can do wutever they want to do at this point lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:22:15
this is not your theory lol
this  has been goin around since december.
but yes  i believe tether is one of the reasons why market is falling
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:04:06
Its OFFICIAL
THIS IS THE  2ND WORST CRASH
AFTER MT GOX!!!
or on its way to THE worst crash in crypto history 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:16:16
these crashed always happen after big bull run
last year, bitcoin was priced 2200~2500 usd in july.
and 1000 dollar in january.
still it is still hard to predict the future price of crypto,:)
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:23:59
many chinese people do still trade crypto 
by using huobi pro and korean bithumb
but i do think  the gov wants to shut it down for good tho
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:18:04
was thinking more like 5k ,
and if tether turned out to be scam
it might go down to like 2k
