Many people including myself saw it happen. The video on youtube doesn't show it because its the same video from the archive. 
Hopefully a video will turn up.

It was first thing this morning at the end of Panel 1 with the law enforcement people.

This happened right after panel 1 of the NY bitcoin hearings this morning. 
Does anyone have a backup of the video or screenshots?
This briefcase exchange is actively being suppressed on the net, if you have a backup of the video please share it!
This is was the man who handed off the briefcase.

It takes all of 5 seconds to trim off the end of a video.

I checked my IRC logs from this morning, someone reported seeing a screenshot of it posted to Weibo but it was quickly deleted.
Also, the youtuber in the OP must have had it online. Otherwise he would not have been told to remove it. I know the channel of the youtuber in question but i do not want to compromise his privacy.
Are there websites that cache deleted youtube videos?

No, this was very obvious and happened after the hearing ended while the camera was still rolling. See the OP for more details.
