They really need to trim and force to upper.

I was sure it was Palladium. A precious metal, as well as an ancient artifact  It also fit the later clues (which I thought were still for that one.
Silver (although precious) didn't have any missing super crazy artifacts as far as I could find. More hauls of coin and bar.

I agree this is better than nothing (or ebay's method), but it is quite possible for someone to lie, ask for further compensation (while feigning outrage that the honest party is clearly "wrong"), while holding the deposit hostage. Sure, it is risky to both parties, but the "ok, I'll agree that it just went lost in the mail/wrong address/etc if you pay me 50% instead, then we can both get our deposits back" has a decent chance.
I'm not saying it will happen (or often), but it is still possible to attack within these rules. Yes, it is much harder. Yes it requires an aggressive, manipulative party, but ebay shows us these exist.
The previous transaction record will be key, but this can be spoofed: if I have several accounts who cross-trade, then I can build up a history.

clearly it isn't. I've tried it in many ways. I'm not sure if it is kosher to mention it prior to the close though.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:06:03
Very much so. Mine is also super clever :)

Ah yes, while trimming would need to be serverside, all caps could be done.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:54:13
tried so many things.
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:46:40
I am convinced I know what it /should/ be.
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:22:58
At least he spelled it correctly..
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:25:49
Yep, still don't get it
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:02:01
These are all simplifications of 
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:46:00
haha, I was still working on all those clues on the 3rd.
Also :(

Should things like "The" always stripped off the front?

1. Buyer &amp; Seller put bitcoin at risk
2. Seller sends Buyer goods
3. Buyer receives goods
4. Buyer pays Seller
5. Seller disputes.
6. Buyer must now pay extra or loose 3x the cost. (2x in risk, 1x in already paid) (buyer will settle so as not to loose their risked, but will extort some settlement)
Unless transfer from buyer to seller happens within this exchange system.

not as in one and only one hint per bin?
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:12:48
Sadly I'd figured that out. That's why clues 4-6 were cruel ;)
@_date: 2013-07-30 15:48:30
upper right red arrow "if bob didn't get it..", which implies alice (buyer)'s transaction is unknown to the exchange, and can be disputed.
