Currently Bitcoin mainly competes with fiat and banks. The main measure for transaction costs in there is the ratio of the fee in fiat to the value send in fiat. In this competition we are measured by this dominant metric. As soon as we have beaten the fiat system and only compete with ethereum or other altcoins we can switch to satoshis per byte.

2x, i.e. "two times" makes it pretty clear that it is two time the block size of SegWit. SegWit8x would mean SegWit block size times, which is not what is proposed.

So you define a node as BitcoinCore, version 0.14.2. Well, I do not agree.


Bullshit, clearly there are not 10's of thousands of "BitcoinCore, version 0.14.2" nodes, not even if you count all BitcoinCore nodes ( and even if you count all unique (listening) full nodes it's not 10.000.

So basically they break the agreement they signed to, after they conveniently got what they wanted (SegWit). This is what I would call a scam, also to their users which took their signature of the NYA as a commitment. Politics aside, I can only disencourage everyone from using their services of this is how they treat agreements. Today it might be the NYA, tomorrow the conditions of your bitcoin prepaid card.

Satoshi was such a noob, inventing this overly complicated "proof of work" mechanism to define the true chain. In fact all we have to do is to trust some developers to define the true chain!

Good luck to the new chain on the block!
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:05:09
There is no "the community" which agrees or disagrees. Parts of the community did agree to the SegWit2x agreement (me for example, although I didn't sign it) and another part disagreed. I think we'll find out which part is larger in about three month. I hope that the vast majority goes along with SegWit2x, because it is what ended the stalemate and is a reasonable compromise between both sides. However if people who did not sign the agreement want to stay on the legacy chain, it is their right to do so.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:35:43


Well, I beg to differ. As far as the name (i.e. "Bitcoin") is concerned I don't see the big difference between a soft and a hard fork. If 90% of the community want Bitcoin to change and make that change happen, then Bitcoin has changed. If 10% want a change and make that change happen, Bitcoin remains unchanged and a new altcoin is created. This goes for softforks (USAF, if it had caused a chain split) as well as hardforks (Bitcoin Cash). If the ratios are not that clear,things get complicated and I would agree that the unchanged chain has a somewhat stronger claim on the name bitcoin in this case.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:53:11
I really don't see how you interpret 


 into this quoted section, unless you meant "node" to refer to SPV nodes (in which case you comment wouldn't make sense as 8mb are no problem for SPV nodes)
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:05:28
The 2mb hardfork formulation in the nya was somewhat ambiguous, granted (although I do think that all signers understood it in the current SegWit2x formulation). But that is not the point Bitwala is making, they nowhere complain that they understood the nya differently, they don't ask to change the implementation or anything. They pretty clearly state that they will break the agreement and scam the other signers, unless core supports SegWit2x. Also they conveniently do so **after** segwit has locked in, as if they just now realised they don't want the agreement.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:20:24
Which has exactly **nothing** to do with LN...
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:04:11
I really don't know. Most people don't run a full node. SPV nodes don't necessarily need to update to accept the SegWit2x chain. Also, one quarter of the full nodes runs explicit big blocker software ( so if only a third of the current BitcoinCore nodes switch to SegWit2x, the majority of full nodes will be there. Along with 90% of the miners...
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:53:43
So, you say the number of (full?) nodes is what counts? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:52:34


If the default option (as in the case of bitcoin.com and viaBTC) is to go along with the agreement, I think it would be ok. I didn't like bitcoin.com and ViaBTC doing so and I would prefer if it won't happen to the 2x part, but as far as the agreement is concerned, I guess it is ok.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:04:12
I think it is rather you who does not understand what (crypto-) currencies actually are.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:16:10
OK, then why don't we unite and do the 2x hard fork? It has overwhelming miner support, which will most likely result in only one surviving chain.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:53:03


Interesting formulation, I thought there has to be consensus in order to change to rules of bitcoin. But if 70% of the miners disagree with a change it is them holding SegWit hostage?


In other words, break consensus and try to force a rule change. Which would have most likely failed.


There were reasonable people who tried to prevent the cahin split that would haven been caused by the UASF, but were also concerned about the bitcoin network congestion at the time (in particular bitpay). They agreed on a compromise which would active SegWit and a 2MB hardfork, in order to move bitcoin forward an overcome the current blockade.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:08
This is a great feature, no doubt about it. But if that was all Bitcoin is good for, it doesn't justify a 65 billion dollar marketcap.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:41:52
Well, reading all his replies, you might even be right about solex1 thinking EDA is a bad thing. I am not convinced it is, though. Thanks for the honesty, I guess we will find out whether EDA leads to a catastrophe. Until then we can both believe what we want.

@_date: 2017-08-25 17:00:11
They provide good reasons why they plan to stay on the SegWit2x chain. However in the statement it sounds like "miners will do SegWit2x and we will follow", when in reality they too signed the NYA committing them to SegWit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:55:59
Not directly, which is why I asked if it is what you meant.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:32:19


Well, I guess you can say it like that. Still I would say it's a misuse of language, ambiguous at best. In this logic also the statement "The entire american people endorsed Donald Trump as president!" is true, because that is how the federal election works.


Nah, that's not true. Softforks are also consensus critical and can be enforced by a miner majority (some core developer even claims that his super-minority UASF-movement forced a consensus change).


You could say this about many mutually exclusive aspects of Bitcoin, e.g. the title of the whitepaper was "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", not "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Settlement System". What "Bitcoin" is changes in time and that's ok i guess.


Looking at the whitepaper I would say Bitcoin is the blockchain with the most proof of work, but this is debatable. So feel free the explain where you see "If a hard fork proposal doesn't have overwhelming consensus, then it isn't Bitcoin" in the whitepaper or any other early day bitcoin publications.


Did I?


Sorry, apparently I missed the message in the genesis block saying "Property of thieflar and friends!".
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:18:55
Main difference is, most people back then actually understood how Bitcoin works and a fair share even understood the code. This has changed, partly because the code has evolved and became more complex, but mainly because Bitcoin started to attract mainstream users. Today there is a lot of blind trust, that dev "know best. You can't even blame the Devs for that, but this is what makes this more an issue than in the early days.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:48:39
My point is, that I believe the current market cap is due to investors (e.g. myself) believe that Bitcoin has more potential than solely relatively cheap cross-border transactions. Should it turn out, that it doesn't I am pretty sure market cap will crumble. But I am hopeful it will not come to that because Bitcoin does have potential for so much more, the question is only what will be realized.

Well, yes, those fundamentally opposed to SegWit did in fact split off today. But most typical big blockers support the New York Agreement (SegWit2x), which the miners activated with 80%+ support through bit 4 signalling, which in turn enforced SegWit signalling (through bit 1 signalling). This is why the UASF was a non-event today (SegWit, already 100% signalled). SegWit activation was their sacrifice in the NYA and now they expect their part of the deal, i.e. 2x hard fork in three months. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:13:09
I do like the idea and Adams introduction reads great: "With the service, everyone will have free access to the Bitcoin network, in any corner of the world, including the estimated four billion people not currently connected to the Internet, due to lack of availability or affordability.".
Still Blockstreams Chief Strategy Officer Samsung Mow tweets "[Bitcoin isn't for people that live on less than $2 a day. ]( And I guess he is correct, living from less than 2$ a day I wouldn't buy a 100$ USB satellite receiver and pay more than a dollar to do a bitcoin transaction...
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:40:01
I am well aware of the difference between the two, but why should this have any impact on the name or whether something is an altcoin? 
I can easily propose a softfork which fundamentally alters Bitcoin, e.g. completely forbids transactions of any kind, but allows up to 20MB of cat pictures stored in extension blocks. Still I would not call this Bitcoin, although all legacy nodes would accept the new blocks as valid.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:49:29


I don't think there is a chance that it will not happen. It will. The question is how many people go along with the fork. Judging from the signers of the NYA, I guess the vast majority of bitcoiners will go with SegWit2x, but of cause I don't know for sure.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:18:01

Hard to say. But if currently Ethereum has less users then bitcoin, requires a higher bandwidth, has a larger total block chain size and still has more active nodes, my prediction is that 10TB in say five years won't change that fact.

So why is everyone so worried about SegWit2x? Either 
* it is unsuccessful and all core supporters can be happy,
* it is successful because it has overwhelming community support, then this overwhelming majority can be happy,
* it successful because "a group of CEOs can simply get together and unilaterally change bitcoin", in which case Bitcoin was a bad idea to start with and would have died anyway.
So what is all the excitement about?

How do you define an argument, then?


Which of the things I brought up do you consider unrelated? And unrelated to what? The question whether there will be a (successful) hardfork to SegWit2x?


In which way? What means define in this context? There are currently nodes which are not in agreement on the rules, so are the rules defined by the majority of nodes? Or how does it work in your opinion? Also how do you define node? Is a node a mining node, a full node, or any node connected to the network?


This very much depends on you clarifications to my previous questions.

The whole point of a decentralized system is that there is no "core". There might be a group of people calling them-self "core", but if this makes them the defining persons in Bitcoin, then decentralization has failed. Personally I think I will call the chain with the most proof of work "Bitcoin", as that it is the fundamental idea of Bitcoin. However I know that there are problems with this definition, especially in situations of rule changes, so I might change my mind if I hear a better one.

It's their right to claim the Bitcoin brand if they have majority support, which we well see when the fork actually happens.

Except that he didn't. E.g. 
" The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." - [ Satoshi Nakamoto](

Well, I sure hope so. I think 80%-90%, of the miners are on board, several important economic nodes (e.g. BitPay) are in support and also most people I talk to (in person) too. Note however that most developers from the de facto standard client BitcoinCore are still opposed to SegWit2x, as well as several very vocal individuals on this sub.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:16:40
He is a developer and one of the early contributors to Bitcoin-QT (which later became BitcoinCore).

There was some re-factoring and decrease in code size in 2014, but with "early days" I assumed we are talking about pre 2012 when there were around 50.000 lines of code. Today its around 450.000. See  (obtained by a simple run of gitstats on the current repo).
I do agree that we should be careful with all contributions to bitcoin. But your conclusions seems to be "Don't worry about Blckstream, because there are other (former) developers who are somewhat shady."?

It certainly is not what I wrote. SegWit2x is a compromise which I do support, but definitely not what I would like to have if **I** could choose. The whole idea of the NYA was to bring Bitcoin forward without a contentious hardfork. Unfortunately "core" did not agree and is now campaigning against SegWit2x. Don't get me wrong, "core" is perfectly in it's right in doing so. But if a group of Bitcoiners, e.g. the NYA signers, decides to hardfork they are free to do so. And if their fork assembles a majority of the community, it is also their right the carry the name Bitcoin. I really don't see why everyone claims this is an attack on "core". "Core" is free to join the NYA and support SegWit2x, and I would welcome if they did. If they don't, they don't, but it's not like "core" owns the Bitcoin brand or the network or anything like that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:16:17
This would be the case with or without EDA. The main difference is that thanks to EDA the periods of "zero blocks" (which are actually periods with very slow blocks) last some days instead of several month or worse.

In order to participate in the PoS mining you will (most likely) need to run a full node. **If** the technical difficulties of PoS are overcome by the ethereum developers, I guess many people would participate leading to a lot more full nodes. But I am somewhat skeptical on PoS and I think the ethereum developers are as well, last thing I heard is they won't change completely to PoS in the next release but only allow 5% (?) of the blocks to be minded by PoS.
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:20:58
If this really was Bitmains plan, the best course of action would be to accept SegWit2x and make it a noncontentious harsfork. There is no way Bitmain could gather significant support for another hardfork anytime soon.

This is speculation taken from thin air, not backed by any data. In fact it is not what we see for Bitcoin Cash, which was mined at severely inferior profitability for two weeks and is now that it is more profitable we don't see an instant switching of hash rate towards Bitcoin Cash.

You are making wrong and insulting assumptions on a completely unsubstantiated basis here, but please go on. Sure (in theory) you only need one node and the majority of hashpower to enforce a softfork.

@_date: 2017-08-23 12:01:22
Minimal simplified explanation: SegWit introduces a blockweight limit of 4.000.000 which replaces the old block size limit of 1mb. Each byte of data of non SegWit transactions costs 4 weight units, as well as the transaction part of SegWit transactions. Each byte of the Witness part in SegWit transactions has a cost of 1 weight unit. The ratio of transaction data to witness data varies depending on the transaction. Assuming everyone switches to SegWit transactions and the average transaction stays the same, it is expected that SegWit allows blocks in size of ~1.7mb (which is often rounded to 2mb, which is where the 2mb come from). However a "worst case" block could contain (nearly) 4mb pure witness data, therefore the hard limit on the block size is 4mb.
People use this discrepancy a lot to fit it into their narrative, e.g. talking of SegWit2x as 8mb blocks, although the average block would be ~3.4mb by core's own estimates.

No, I don't think this is what he meant (see his comment).


The [NY Agreement]( said:
* Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
* Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
Which was a compromise to avoid a chain split, yes.


This is mostly speculation, but yes viaBTC and bitcoin.com provided certain support to Bitcoin Cash by allowing their users to opt-in mining of it.


I beg your pardon? This is exactly the NYA, nothing new, no thread, but simply what the signers agreed upon.


Well, as far as viaBC is concerned I somewhat agree. Although they did not break the NYA in a purely juristic sense, they acted in bad faith here, creating the prediction market for BCC and doing all that advertising and mining for BCC. For Bitcoin.com I don't agree, simply giving your users the **opt-in** option to mine an altcoin, is ok in my eyes. However there are several other signers of the NYA from both sides which did not do anything but to abide it. And after all an Agreement between many parties is not nullified because one or two parties quit.

Still you have to monitor all transactions to prevent the other party to from settling a previous state of the "off-chain", e.g. one were they did not yet make a significant payment. You can prevent this by publishing the current state in time, but this requires you to monitor all transaction.

It is a bit more complicated than that, because this transaction could also be replayed, I.e. you might have to do this several times and move the coins to different addresses on both chains. But yes, in principal this idea works.

So let me get this straight, you are basically quoting Luke-Jr, who suggested this, as "That is what is being proposed as part of hard fork", although this proposal never found any traction (because of its obvious flaws)?


No one talked about the transaction, only about the Witness-data.


I mean that you could use any discount factor x and still limit the blocksize to 4MB using the block weight limit. Of cause it is the combination of the two which define the blocksize limit, but the factor also has other purposes, while the weight limit does not.


I am very unhappy about the Bitcoin Cash fork, but after all it is a minority which forked off the main chain, using strong replay protection, so that is their right I guess. Who am I to judge? Most miners did not fork off to Bitcoin Cash precisely because of the NYA! They signed an agreement which included SegWit and a 2x hardfork, which is what they abided. The best way to bring Bitcoin forward is to work together and not against each other and most importantly not by dividing Bitcoin into several (economically) small chains, which each won't have any reason the exits any more. This is what they respected.


Firstly I don't see where you got that they **actively** reject advise? They did not incorporate suggestions brought up in the night, on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, concerning a leaked version of the agreement? Really, a meeting of many people at a conference, should trash their agreement and start discussion anew, taking into account "advice" from people who [actively rejected]( to take part in the meeting?
Secondly, there is a difference between "rejecting advice" and simply having another opinion. So far I have not seen them actively rejecting advice and your links definitely don't provide a source for that.


Wow, resorting to insults because of a lack of arguments, I guess? I have to say I am quite disappointed, as I though you might be a reasonable person and it could be worth having a discussion with you. Sad how reddit proves me wrong time and time again. Don't expect any further replies.

I agree that it's a bit handwaving, but I would argue that SegWit2x is more backward compatible than a POW change, e.g. Mining Hardware will still work and most SPV Wallets will support it out of the box. But you are right that it will be the market who decides which chain(s) will survive and claim the Bitcoin brand.

@_date: 2017-09-07 15:40:45
I assume with 


you mean SegWit transactions, right? Adding these to Bitcoin was integral part of the NYA, therefore the SegWit2x chain does support these transactions in exactly the way it was proposed by core. In fact they activated the original SegWit BIP (by means of a new activation mechanism, though). Right now there is no chain split, so Segwit2x=Core chain. Both use this transaction format, wallets upgrade to use it, some already did ages ago. Note however that a non-updated wallet will still work perfectly and will only be unable to send Segwit-transactions (and won't verify them). Now in November there will be a hardfork to 2x blocks. Adding two-way replay protection on the hardfork side would mean that old wallets would break (in contrast to the SegWit upgrade) and would have to be updated in order to work, so the developers decided not to do it. But this is a completely separate issue from the SegWit transaction format, is it not?

Not all of them. And then there is me who wants to have the benefits of SegWit, in particular I am curious how thing like LN will evolve. But I also don't want to cripple on-chain scaling. 2MB is a compromise, the best solution in my opinion would be [BIP 103]( which increases the blocksize at the rate of technical improvement, thereby keeping the centralization pressure at its current level. And I don't think I am the only one who actually want's both of these.
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:23:34
I guess you should get your history straight ("original" and "new and improved"). However you fail to see that also a community split is not the same as a hard fork. The community got split (over SegWit/Blocksize) leading to the Bitcoin Cash hardfork, not the other way around.
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:18:42
This is correct of course. However I don't see how bitcoin can prevent censorship. It certainly did not for its own platforms. I mean it's nice that alternative platforms banned by Paypal and credit cards can use it to collect donations (although I don't have any sympathies for gab and consorts), but this is just giving them the opportunity to create a censored platform them self, not really solving the problem.

The New York agreement included the activation of SegWit and the 2x hardfork. No one complained when SegWit was activated by the NYA, only now when the second part comes.

Which was activated because of SegWit2x. That was one of the points of the New York Agreement.




Not by intention. They invited Core to the agreement meeting and would still welcome them.


This is plain bullshit. SegWit2x was a compromise to activate SegWit and a 2x hardfork. They did not "copy" anything, but activated SegWit.


A reasonable approach.


This makes no sense because SegWit2x was exactly about activating SegWit as it was.

Assume further that each of these new users wants to put down 1000 Dollar each, that's 333,120,000$ per day. At the current market cap of 61,211,071,094 this is actually an increase of only ~0.5% per day...

They propose a consensus change, that's all. They don't advocate "changing code", e.g. Bitcoin Classic has its own code base and will be compatible with btc1. If "core" chose to follow the consensus change they could cooperate it into their client and no one has to change away from code. The thing is that you believe that "core" should be in charge of the consensus rules, but I don't see why 18 core developers should be the ones deciding these rules for the complete community. The NYA threatens cores consensus authority which is probably one of the reasons they fight it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:51:17
If the vast majority of hash power switches to SegWit2x, the legacy chain will be non-viable and has to to a POW-hardfork. At that point it makes much more sense for the minority chain to implement replay protection and require **all** wallets to upgrade then the majority chain, which most users want to use. 
That being said, I don't know whether SegWit2x actually has vast majority support. The only reliable metric I know is miner signalling which currently shows &gt;90% support. I for sure don't think that the sentiment of this highly moderated subreddit is a useful metric to judge community support, but if you know any further metric I am interested.

They need at least one of their peers to upgrade, not the complete network.

Fair enough. Nonetheless I will run btc1 and support the SegWit2x compromise which I believe is the best way forward for Bitcoin at this point.

I have no reason to doubt they do represent the given numbers. But I don't think it's that bad. They won't be able to push through major decisions without majority support, which however is hard to measure. 


Did any of the signers raise this issue? I agree one could argue about it in the agreement formulation, but this didn't seem to be any issue.


The meeting was at the consensus 2017, where many "Core" developers participated and e.g. Blckstream participated ([speakers]( ). So many could have been there and they most certainly could also have taken part in digital form.


This is opinion based, I would not agree that it is "badly designed software".


The reasons not to use the hardfork bit is not to break compatibility with certain clients, see e.g. [here]( You can agree or not, but this issue was discussed with arguments for both sides and it was decided not to use the hardfork bit.
The rushed timeline is the result of a political debate, i.e. the NYA. This was in fact not really open for technical discussion. But waiting for a reasonable date for a hardfork was what prevented real progress for the last 2+ years.

So who would that "technical community" be? Apparently it does not include the maintainers of all non-core Bitcoin clients and also not Gavin Anderson who Satoshi installed as his successor. So please tell me how you define "the technical community".


SegWit2x and the NYA is not meant as a taking control of bitcoin by anyone. Every current core developer is welcome to contribute to SegWit2x and core would also be most welcome to implement SegWit2 themself.


How would you be any judge for that? Jeff Garzik has a long history of contributions to Bitcoin core, so probably you actually run code by one of these incompetent developers.


Why would they be subject to tighter government control than current core developers who are employed by companies to do so?

I think you do not understand what SegWit2x is about: It was a compromise reached, which included the activation of SegWit and a subsequent 2x hardfork. This was always what it was about and it successfully activated SegWit. Writing only "2x" purposefully neglects this fact. Also core was always welcome to support SegWit2x, this was no anti-core agreement until core attacked it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:03:51
You still have the history wrong. The SegWit proposal was there long before SegWit2x. SegWit2x was a compromise precisely because SegWit was controversial and was not activated for over a year. 
But who is the "we" you keep talking about? 
As far as compatibility is concerned, no Satoshis original Bitcoin client would not work as intended. The original client included the miner, which would now almost surely produce blocks that would be rejected by the network. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:39:17

It was part of the agreement which also activated SegWit and brought as the first substainial progress in 2 years. I could definitely also get behind a HF with lots of neat updates on top of a blocksize increase, if there was a clear timeline for it. But this is something which did not happen to appear for the last two years. But please: Do surprise me.

It obviously was.


58 companies representing, around 90% of the miners (by hashrate), 20 million Bitcoin wallets and over 5 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume.


There was no serious doubt what the agreement entailed and what not. If you disagree please elaborate.


unfortunately, true. However it is important to know that representatives from all sides were invited, including core.


What is wrong with that? Core tries to convince us that it is a bad idea...


Which? They did not realize everything people suggested, because they had reasons not to. That is not the same as ignoring objections.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:57:53


Are you talking about Gavin Andresen, who Satoshi installed as his successor and Jeff Garzik, who both happen to support SegWit2x?


It is easy to have a group universally opposing something if you kick out all dissenters.


It could be that these are reasons for some of them. But that does not mean that they are right. Do you really want to leave all decisions concerning Bitcoin to [a group of 18 persons]( who also seem to have a tendency to remove people with different opinions? That seems to be a fatal single point of failure to me. 
Actually the point I wanted to make with in the comment you quoted, is that it is quite treacherous to be silent about your objections all the time until the part of an agreement you support (SegWit) is fulfilled and then completely switch to condemn the agreement once the part you don't like (2x) becomes an issue. This is not technical, this is just nasty politics which shows that blind trust in those "core"-developers is utterly misguided.

@_date: 2017-09-08 16:37:49


Your point being? SegWit2x included SegWit which is what I wrote.


That's propaganda. Firstly the "the devs" (with which you probably mean "core"-devs) were invited and refused to participate ([source]( ). Secondly it was not universally opposed by all "core"-devs, e.g. Jeff Garzik happens to be the maintainer of the SegWit2x reference implementation and was a "core"-developer at that time. He was removed from bitcoin-core not long ago, probably for his support of SegWit2x. So, yea if you kick out all supporting developers you end up with "universal" opposition... .


Which hard facts would that be?

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:37:12
Do you mean the "Silbert agreement" or Luke's proposal?
The "Silbert agreement", as far as I understand, is based on  and will increase the block size accordingly.
I think Luke's hardfork proposal will allow non-SegWit transactions to use up to 2MB, while at the same time reducing the block size also for SegWit transactions to the same 2MB (from 4MB). I did not yet spend much time on his proposal, so I might be wrong here. But so far I have to agree that I don't see the benefits of this proposal.
While I do appreciate that Luke seems to be willing to help reach a compromise here, my comment was meant to support the general call for compromise and open-mindedness in the title of this post, not the proposal itself.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:08:19


Why do you think that any compromise has to contain the activation of SegWit and a hardfork? I think that this is something really hard to achieve, because in the current situation there is almost not trust what so ever between the two parts of the community. In particular this sounds a whole lot like the previous HK agreement which both sides say the other side has broken. In other words if the hardfork was to activate first, why should a SegWit supporter trust the bigblockers to also activate SegWit? I seriously doubt that even 5% of the users would agree to such an agreement. On the other side, if SegWit was to activate first, why should any bigblocker trust the SegWit supporters that they will participate in a hardfork later? It is not like hardforks become easier or safer just because SegWit has activated. If I had to guess I would assume that even if such a compromise was reached, the hardfork would still be contentious with a minorty chain of at least 10%. The whole problem is that trust was nearly completely destroyed in this debate. I am all for the idea to let these wounds heal and let the bitcoin community come together once more, but this will take time. And honestly, reading the replies to your post on both subs, it think it will take a LOT of time! Much more time than I think we have to reach a compromise in the current situation.
Therefore I would like to argue for a "trustless" compromise, after all trustlessness is one of the main ideas of Bitcoin. The two possible approaches I currently see are either SegWit+XMB as a hardfork or Extension Blocks. Both approaches have in common that there is  only one activation step, therefore the whole "compromise" is implemented at once without requiring one party to trust the other.
SegWit+XMB as a hardfork:
* This would be quite challenging to implement/test/deploy in a reasonable time frame. However if there is consensus on this I think it is easily doable. See ethereum which conducted even a somewhat contentious hardfork in much less time that we have.
* If the compromise does contain a hardfork anyway, there are is no extra danger added by doing it in one hardfork altogether.
* It would allow a much cleaner implementation of segregated witness (also available as a BIP) than the SF variant. 
* It would allow all changes which need a hardfork, are already well tested and enjoy consensus to be deployed.
* An explicit change to prevent hidden/open Asicboost can also be included.
Extension Blocks:
* Can be deployed faster, as it is a soft fork. Therefore probably  a better solution for the current scaling issues.
* Removes the necessity to hardfork for scaling reasons.
* Solves on-chain scaling if chosen to increase to block size reasonably.
* Allows off-chain scaling through LN, by fixing transaction malleability (at least this is the information I have, correct me if I am wrong).
* The SF can also include a change to prevent hidden/open Asicboost can also be included.
Of cause I haven't worked out the details and I am not one of the key experts. But I think that those two approaches are a very good basis to build upon. At least if people are actually willing to compromise and not just to deceive the other side.

5th rule oft this "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."
So can someone plesse explain why this obvious Promotion of a USAF client (USAF client: No risk, All other clients: Very risky!) is allowed on the front page? Even IF Segwit has "overwhelming consensus" (which I don't believe otherwise it would be active by now), BIP148 definitely has not. This is pretty much by definition, if BIP148 had overwhelming consensus, there would be no need for it.
Don't get me wrong, I am all for removing this rule, because I think Bitcoin is in an unprecedented crisis and we need an open discussion on ALL possible solutions. But using moderation rules to suppress even the discussion of alternatives not in favour of the moderators while allowing this post, which is nothing but a direct call for a contentious chain split in the current situation, won't help reuniting the bitcoin community and is legitimately called censorship.

@_date: 2017-07-27 16:47:55


You could have spend the 13 seconds to click on the link and get the context, but well: Here I copy pasted it for you:










The discussion is about wipeout protection. Not about when the hardfork should happen. It is good practice to divide your topics and keep the specs as simple and isolated on these topics as possible.


Now you are just trolling. You understand pretty well, that filling this single block acts as a wipeout protection and is not used as an argumentation for larger blocks.


Doesn't SegWit solve the quadratic hash problem? After all, the 2x part is only meant to activate after SegWit. So assuming a significant part of users will be using SegWit, I don't see how quadratic hashing will be an issue. The absolute worst case would by the way be that an attacker could create an transaction which is 4 times as complex to process, while they would have to pay fees for the complete 2mb (actually pay fees for two non-witness mb).


Care to elaborate or provide a link?


This would always help, yes. And I agree that 6 instead of three months would have been a better timeframe.


This is something which can hardly be done by the developers of on client. But yes this is fundamentally important.


This would be fundamentally different. The way you propose it, the (theoretic) max block size would remain at 4mb. The way btc1 handles it, it is increased to 8mb. But more importantly, changing the discount relation would seriously mess with the SegWit incentive model! There is a reason for a factor of four: 


Yes, but this is something bitcoin as a whole lacks, and can not solely be blamed on the btc1 developers. There have also been many big blocker proposals, which were rejected by core. It is not like bitcoin had a working governance model before btc1.


I would have liked that, but apparently spoonnet did not have the same level of support.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:26:56
I don't know the complete conversation which took place, so please excuse and correct me if I am making wrong assumptions. But to me it looks like as if you would have been welcome even under the premise that you won't sign ANY agreement and only provide technical insights. And as a matter of fact I think it would have been great if you did, especially because there were a lot of "political" participants (while some of them are certainly notorious trolls, I definitely don't agree they all are), which to a certain extend lacked technical insight. But we nevertheless need them, because we are in a political debate right now, whether we want it or not. How much centralization is acceptable? Which transactions are "dust" or "spam"? How valuable is on-chain scaling and how valuable is off-chain scaling? These are all (mostly) political questions for which there is not purely technical answer.
The fact that the people involved did not consider feedback on an early draft, during a night which they probably spend discussing with other people present at the meeting is unfortunate, but really not their fault.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:28:23
If this was the case and some evil entity wanted to corrupt bitcoin, there might be a reason for a chain split. However this is still questionable because if the intention of this evil entity really is to corrupt bitcoin, it can simply follow us to the new chain. Bitcoins open and trust-less structure makes it hard to prevent that.
However at least for me this is an abstract discussion because I don't believe anyone involved in this compromise wants to corrupt or destroy bitcoin (Ok, maybe there are one or two, I don't know all of them). There are different visions, different needs, different ideologies, personal frustrations and social incompetence which make a compromise so hard to reach. The problem here is not that one side is trying to destroy bitcoin.

I don't see how it is "FUD", because apparently you agree that bitcoin needs a solution rather quickly. In your Opinion this solution is a UASF. That is OK, but I don't agree.

I think your definitions make sense. However one has to distinguish between a good technical definition and a description for what the word is currently used. If it is about a good technical definition, I would say that a MASF and a MAHF can happen indifferently of whether or not a majority of miners is involved. As UASF and UAHF both need to coerce miners into accepting the changes, it makes sense to define those as requiring "An economically significant fraction of Bitcoin purchasers". However I would say it also involves "Bitcoin acceptors" (e.g. BitPay) and exchanges, not only purchasers.
In practice however I do think the main difference between calling something "user activated" or not is whether there is some flag day at which the fork will be (contentiously) deployed, or whether there is effort spend in establishing and measuring consensus (e.g. by signaling) prior to activation. At least that is my current observation, but I would agree that it should not be part of a technical definition. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:14:47
I strongly disagree: Those who signed the NYA are morally bound to fulfil it. That is the whole point of an Agreement and the miners actually showed a lot of trust by activating SegWit (at least BIP91) first. 
Nevertheless, everyone who was not part of this agreement is of cause free to do what ever he or she likes.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:49:40
You wouldn't. If you personally don't want the hardfork and want to stay on the other chain, that is totallay fine by me (in a moral sense at least. I would prefer if we all agree on the same chain, but well if we don't, we don't). It is about those who signed the agreement and to some extend those miners that signaled bit 4 for the NYA.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:58:04
The picture of the mempool is somewhat misleading. If the amount of transaction exceeds the block size limit by only one transaction per block, the mempool will grow significantly (by one transaction every 10 minutes, until they transactions start to get dropped after 14 days). At the same time if the the number of transactions fit in the block size the mempool basically stays at zero. 
In order to judge whether there actually was a spam attack you should look at the [actual transactions per day]( (Even better: all transaction send, not only confirmed ones. But I didn't find a graph for that.). Looking at that chart I am not convinced this was an actual spam attack. More likely a peak due to japan legalizing bitcoin, as there have been similar peaks in past also shown in the graph.

No, it is not very powerful, still I think it provides some pressure never the less. The same way ETC provides pressure preventing the next ETH bailout.

This "cooperate hack" claims to have support of at least 58 companies located in 22 countries, 83.28% of hashing power, 5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume, 20.5 million bitcoin wallets. You may agree with the NYA or not, but this is more measurable support than any other proposal had in the last two years.

@_date: 2017-07-20 13:09:17
In its [statement]( Bitmain (Jihan) said they will support the NY Agreement. That is why they are signaling BIP91 as this is the way BTC1 implemented the NYA. Concerning the fork, they said that SHOULD the NYA fail to look-in before August and therefore the "UASF" forks of, they will fork of with a "UAHF" as well. So far it looks like the NYA is successful, therefore the "UAHF" on first August will NOT be supported by Bitmain (at least that is what they state).
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:08:35

There might be a nasty period of disgusting public television program coming up. 
In this particular case however, I guess you can keep your dick. But so far Bitmain supports SegWit2x and not the Bitcoin cash fork. I hope and am confident that it stays this way assuming everyone abides to the NYA.
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:06:01
So far Bitmain [stated]( that they will support a UAHF if and only if the New York Agreement fails. This means that, as the NYA seems to be a huge success so far, Bitmain will abide to the NYA and not switch to BitcoinABC (at least this is what they say and I am optimistic they keep their word on this one). 
Please correct me if there is more up to date news on this, but so far I haven't heard anything.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:02:55
In my opinion the "UA" in both "UASF" and "UAHF" are merely euphemisms for a contentious hard/soft fork, which doesn't bother to signal or establish a measure of support in any other way. So yes, "UAHF" and "UASF", edited my comment accordingly.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:28:05
Sorry if this was disambigious: Of cause only those who signed the NYA (and to some extend those who signaled it via bit 4) can scam the miners. Everyone else is free to run whatever software they want. I am not sure how this would turn out if the fork comes and all signers abide the agreement, but I don't think nodes are the only factor.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:00:28
Ok, thanks for the clarification. I still think it would have been great if you were there (of cause not signing anything you don't support). But if this was the case, I can understand and accept your decision.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:36:17
"The New York Agreement is a joint effort of the global Bitcoin community. As one of its signatories, Bitmain has actively supported the smooth implementation of Segwit2x and will continue to run the btc1 software on all our mining pools, namely Antpool, BTC.COM pool and ConnectBTC, in the foreseeable future."
"As we have previously stated, Bitcoin.com believes that behaving with integrity and upholding agreements made is always the proper course of action. As such, we continue to remain committed to supporting the Segwit2x proposal, which has received broad support from Bitcoin industry and community alike."
Even [ViaBTC]( only **allows** its users to actively opt-in to BCC, the default option remains the NYA.
So which big blockers are you talking about exactly?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:07:52
Well, yes if successful, I would agree the name "UASF" is somewhat appropriate, although it would still mean that an economic majority forced miners to comply, and not necessarily the majority of users (as in individual persons). However especially if unsuccessful I don't see where there are users involved. Either there is at least one miner which contentiously activates the soft-fork and splits itself of the network, in which case it is more miner activated I would say, or there is actually no miner in which case there is simply no UASF at all, because in the end users cannot create a chain split. Well, ok, there might be some full nodes which keep rejecting all new blocks, but there would really be no benefit at all.
I do agree with you on the UAHF part, except that as I stated above it is a contingency plan, which bitmain says they will support only if the NYA fails.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:50:13

How about looking at the spec concerning the the activation time?


If by "you", you mean the btc1 team, of which I am no part, then: yes


Gosh, it serves an technical purpose! With this argumentation you could also dismiss  the complete witness data as spam, as it is economically irrelevant.


The whole point of activating SegWit is based on this "assumption out of zero real world data". So you want to argue against SegWit activation here?


Anyone can create an pull request, so this really proves nothing. Nevertheless if you think quadratic hashing is an issue, convince people that they need to take that into account. So far I haven't heard an argument "based on real world data" that this will be an issue for SegWit2x.


Sorry for asking you to be constructive. Also mind that I did **not** propose this hardfork.


Sorry, but apparently you don't understand how SegWit works. There is no separate factor for legacy transactions. There is separated-witness data and non-(separated)-witness data.


So who makes the decision what is "technically more sound"? It is an illusion to think that there is always an objective better or worse in this case.


It is true that "core" has lost a lot of trust in parts of the community. However I don't think that this is the main point in not using spoonnet. I think the main reason is rather that spoonnet simply isn't ready yet, something most people agree on.

* ~~25%~~ ~~50%~~ 25% You can claim you money back from investigators who sized it, but this requires time, extensive identification and proof of legal origin of the founds.
* 30% Parts of your money are gone (taken by former btc-e insiders). You can claim the remainders from the investigators as above.
* ~~30%~~ ~~35%~~ 25% chance your money is gone forever
* ~~25%~~ 15% btc-e is not affected at all and will come back online in the next days.

Since we are talking about the foundation of a monetary system, it might be a good idea to use a design which won't be crashed into a wall by the next best idiot. Not saying that we don't need innovations, but a rather conservative approach is in order here.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:56:15


For example the Chinese bitcoin round table (which already represents a majority of hashpower) [declared](
"3、 We’ll immediately start testing btc1 ( software and join testnet5 based on SegWit2x proposal, and deploy it as soon as possible after the release of beta version."
Right now the vast majority of blocks [signal for bit1 and bit4], which is the way btc1 implemented the first part of the NYA. This might have been copied by other software, so it is not proof that miners actually run btc1, which is why I put (derivations of) in my comment.


Depends on how you define "failed". The condition did exactly what it was supposed to do: it protected the 2x chain from wipeout. Someone mined a whole lot of blocks by connecting a vast amount of hashpower, normally unseen on testnets, to prematurally fork the network. Still the wipeout protection worked as intended. Or why would you disagree?
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:21:44
The thing is the difficulty adjustment, which won't happen instantly. Therefore in the beginning, even if you are mining the USAF chain completely alone, your reward (per time / per Hash) is the same as if all miners switched to the USAF chain. Therefore if the USAF-chain is valued lower, the incentives are actually pretty much against mining it. This of cause changes as soon as the difficulty adjustment happens, which I guess is also the point where exchanges would assume that the USAF-Chain will stay and start listing it.
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:51:37
So this would apply to the contentious UASF, the NYA activation of SegWit and the NYA increase of the Base-blocksize? This would actually require the UASF and the activation of SegWit at 80% support to become a hard fork... .
I think replay protection is good, however I am not sure whether it is feasible in all cases. Plus as described in other threads, it is possible to protect your coins yourself also without replay protection. I hope that an automation of this process will be added to the major wallets. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:20:55
These 20% are (mostly) financed by the collected transaction fees, which bitcoin.com does NOT pay to the miners. I am somewhat annoyed by this misleading advertisement, because in my opinion transaction fees are part of the block reward.

My personal experience with Cex.io a complete catastrophe:
I created a cex.io account about a year ago and used it for small trading (around 5 BTC). Since they had very attractive conditions for euro withdrawals, I decided to go through the verification and use cex.io to withdraw some of my trading profits. I started by withdrawing 100 euro which worked without any problems. I then transferred around 20 BTC to cex.io and ordered the withdrawal of 10,000 euro. Two days later I received a mail from cex.io, which stated that in order to complete my withdrawal request they need additional information. In particular they wanted me to fill a ~6 page form with information on my residence, my employee, my family, my social media accounts etc. ! Furthermore they request me to state what the origin of these founds was. Note that I already did verify in advance an according to the (advertised) terms of use was allowed to withdraw 10,000 euro per day! I replied that I am not willing to fill out the form they send as it was largely unrelated to money laundering (social media accounts, WTF?) and provided them with a complete transaction history proving my trading profits. After two weeks they replied that as stated in their terms of use and AML/KYC Policy they may require ANY information from it's customers if they feel like they need it (which is actually written there). Furthermore they stated that my proof of origin of the founds is not sufficient, however not stating how else I could prove it. In my reply I asked how exactly I should prove the origin and that I want to know the reasoning why they think they require my social media accounts in order to fulfill my withdrawal. Nothing happened for about one month. Then an automatic mail came, stating that they are still working on this issue, but the support staff is overallocated. Two weeks since then, no response. I feel completely tricked by cex.io and they still hold my founds hostage. I am currently trying to find a suitable lawyer to press charges.
To summarize I can only strongly warn everyone from using cex.io for amounts larger than ~5 BTC. Read the Terms of use and AML/KYC Policy carefully before agreeing, they reserve the right to request basically any information from you, even *after* you passed verification. They reserve the right the freeze your account and hold your money hostage if you fail to comply:

The point is that this is probably the last time they can fork off without SegWit. Otherwise they would have to explicitly remove SegWit again via a hardfork. 
But yes, this is actually the reason why I personally don't support it. It already assumes that some signers won't abide to the NYA, before anyone can tell. The whole point of the NYA was to prevent a chain split and I am hopeful it may actually succeed.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:04:02


I agree, the documentation/organisation is currently in pretty bad shape. 


A draft of the complete specs can be found [here]( the important issues are linked in [this mail]( The hard-fork activation will happen at "bit-4 SegWit activation + 144*90 blocks", i.e. at 10 min blocktimes three month after bit4 activates.


No, all economic information (i.e. how much money is send from which address to which address) is contained in the non-witness part. The witness part only serves the technical purpose of authenticating the owner (which could also be done in other ways). So the reason to have the witness data in the block is purely technical, not economical.


I don't think so. I have not heard this being proposed anywhere, neither that it was accepted in btc1. Please provide a source for this claim.


This is a strange way of putting it, I would say the rule "block weight ≤ 4,000,000" is what limits the blocksize to 4MB and not the discount. The discount is in a way what makes this possible while being a soft fork, by allowing a maximal of 1MB of non-(seperated)-witness data. What do you mean with "Segwit2x already violates that"? Obviously SegWit2x increased that to a theoretical maximum of 8MB, but that is the whole point.


No, unfortunately we are **not** talking about science here. At best we are talking about an engineering task, but I would argue that even this is not true. To stay in your example:
* Science: Yes, there is a real difference between a O(n^2) and O(n) algorithm (science). 
* Engineering: For the current Bitcoin this means absolutely nothing (if we ignore BU/EC for now). Being O(n^2 ) or O(n) means the [asymptotic computational complexity]( scales as n^2 or n. This has zero relevance for the current Bitcoin or Segwit2x because both have a maximal block size (1MB and 8MB). It could very well be the case that the O(n^2 ) algorithm has an actual computational cost of 7*n^2 OP, while the O(n) algorithm has actual computational costs of n^3 / exp(n^(1/6)) + n OP. See the plot (  ). So in fact the O(n) algorithm would have higher actual computational costs for all possible inputs in the current Bitcoin as well as the SegWit2x version, although having the superior asymptotic scaling.
* Political: Let's assume we have an algorithm which is actually cheaper for all allowed inputs and not just in the asymptotic scaling. There are still a number of reasons **not** to use it in Bitcoin although it is technically superior. First and foremost there are patent risks (which I currently don't see in any open proposal). The second is code complexity. If the technically superior algorithm is much more complex theoretically and requires vastly more lines of codes to implement it, it might also be a bad idea to use it in Bitcoin. The decentralization of Bitcoin is about eliminating possible attacks through redundancy. This goes for mining, the networks (fullnodes) as well as developers. If we make the Bitcoin protocol so complicated that only a handful of people in the world are able to completely understand and maintain the code base, this would be a major attack vector, e.g. for a government. Also a lot of the empowerment of being "your own bank" is lost, if you don't rudimentarily understand what you are doing by running a full node. Let alone that more complex algorithms are much more error prone in the implementation. 


Yes, as I said i think spoonnet is superior in my opinion, although I have to admit that I haven read/understood all the details of the proposal. However the reason I personally support and advocate the NYA/SegWit2x is not a technical one. From a technical point of view, SegWit2x is of cause bullshit: Activating the "SegWit as a soft fork hack", if we are going to hard fork anyway? I mean it's a smart solution, but still a hack which will incur a technical debt. Not taking advantage of the opportunity if we are doing a hardfork to also implement other great changes (e.g. spoonnet)? Having an ad hoc blocksize increase which is not based on any real data and does not provide any future scaling (unlike e.g. BIP103 or spoonnet), only postponing the scaling problem?
Yes, this is a vastly non-technical compromise. Sure! Granted! But at the same time it is the only compromise I see out there which **might** be able to heal some of the wounds of the Bitcoin community, make people work together again. Possible avoids stupid contentious chain splits ("UASF", "UAHF"). Let's us focus on real improvements again. If Bitcoin wants to succeed we have to stop spending all our energy fighting each other. All the more, as Bitcoin is under attack, e.g. by altcoins like ETH, which offers much less "cypherpunk" and much more "large enterprise" experience, still cannibalising on Bitcoins market share. Or by governments, e.g. US agents taking down a eastern European Bitcoin exchange (btc-e) because they did not comply with US AML/KYC policies, wtf? I fear, that if this scaling debate lasts another two years, or if the community splits with the blockchain, Bitcoin won't have a bright future and will be replaced by enterprise friendly and state-controlled blockchains. Of cause that doesn't mean that we need a compromise at **all** costs, but after all SegWit2x is not the worst that could happen, wouldn't you agree?

Yes, unfortunately the NY Agreement was a back room deal, but this does not mean it's not an agreement, as it established consensus on how to proceed between formerly divided parties.
While I was obviously not part of the meeting, I do support the agreement, as I believe it is factually (not technically) the best way forward for Bitcoin. This means in particular also support for the 2x part, as it is an integral part of the agreement. I hope that the signers of the agreement will also abide to this part, as everything else would mean to right out scam the parties which wanted this part of the deal.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:09:23
This depends in how well Bitcoin cash does in the meantime. If it has ~10% mining support and therefore working transactions and if it is traded at some value at several exchanges I think it is a possibility. Just like I think that ETC might become dominant over ETH if there is another controversial bailout. But sure thing, these are speculations and we both don't know the future.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:45:58
Well, I personally don't think that this is a good police, because in my opinion we should also be able to freely discus proposals that are not (yet) official BIPs, for example the current extension blocks, or emerged consensus. The fact that e.g. EC is implemented by a controversial client should not ban it's discussion. If however a client aims at contentiously changing the Bitcoin protocol, I am totally ok with its promotion being banned (this goes for BU as well as UASF-Bitcoin). 
In this particular case, Lukes post clearly does not promote BIP148 in the sense that it should be implemented by bitcoin core. Instead it promotes the contentious activation of BIP148 in third party clients. In other words, if someone started a post promoting the use of (unnamed) third party clients implementing BIP101 and advocating a contentious activation on August 1st, 2017, wouldn't that post be deleted?
I appreciate the fact that it is hard to stay neutral in moderation, especially if one has strong opinions oneself. And I would like to thank you for your response, I didn't know about the exception of BIPs from the moderation rule. Still to me the existence of this Thread feels like a hard bias in the (applied) moderation.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:11:48
Yea, looking at [the current average]( it's ~255 BTC transaction fees per day. Assuming 6*24=144 blocks per day (slightly underestimating), this gives 1.77 BTC per block in average, i.e. 14.% of the base block reward. So currently bitcoin.com subsidies it's miners with ~6%. Note however that they increased the "extra reward" from 10% to 20%, when fees spiked to &gt;400 BTC per day, i.e. way more than 20% of the base block reward. I wouldn't be surprised if they reduce the bonus if the fees stay at this level.

Nevertheless it makes me sad that this kind of compromise was only possible in a closed door meeting and did not emerge from an open discussion of the whole community. I know there are lot of reasons why it didn't and why this kind of decision making was necessary, still it makes me sad.

Sorry what am I looking at? Who is this Jim and why is he an authority on Jihans/Bitmains position (genuine question)?




Fair enough, I would say. If I was being scammed by the other signers of an Agreement, I too would act accordingly. 


Don't know, [Bitfinex also introduced BTU tokens]( although there was not even a date for the fork (and actually there never was a fork). Also the volume of 5 million in 24h in BCC markets sure indicates quite some interest in the trading pair, which in turn means profit for ViaBtc.


It is a compromise, so of cause this not exactly what big blockers wanted. In fact it is not really a good deal for them and their vision of Bitcoin, a single 2x hard fork and no plans for the future. Still, until now they abide to the NYA, which I respect.

Why do you think so? One of the main objection of miners has always been, that SegWit/LN WITHOUT on-chain scaling will force users to off-chain solutions, which would seriously decrease miner revenue and thereby also create problems with the incentives balance of bitcoin. So agreeing to SegWit if coupled with on-chain scaling sounds is no contradiction.

@_date: 2017-07-21 15:30:08


As I said:


I would not call that a chain split, because there would be only one chain, which is rejected by some nodes after a certain block. A (real) chain split would only happen if there is at least one miner extending the chain under the new rules from this point. Nevertheless I do agree, that by threatening to reject all blocks which do not follow a new rule set, a clear economic majority is able to coerce miners to do their bidding. 
If you want, you you can call a PoW change "user activated", however this would most likely be a "UAHF" and not a "UASF".

Well, [Bitfinex]( [Bithumb]( [OKEX]( and [Btcpop]( have announced support for Bitcoin cash. That is two out of the three largest exchanges at the moment. So it is not true that there is no interest from other exchanges. 


This might be true nevertheless. No way I could tell.


It is kind of understandable that they hedge, because the NYA puts them in the endangered position (SegWit is soon activated and they are dependend on the honour of the other signers). Still I think the hedging is more 95% NYA and 5% BCC.

Well, we **risk** that exchanges running on fractional reserve go bankrupt, with everyone who still had coins there **loosing** them. I guess that is by intention, but that is a real risk of real losses. And no, this would not nessecarily happen anyway. The world banking system is happily running a fractional reserve system since ages, and everyone knows that if everyone withdrew their money at the same time the system would collapse.
Not saying this proof of keys is a bad idea. Just be realistic that exposing exchanges will lead to losses.

It is already live. Actually most miners currently use (derivations of) btc1.
 &gt; What form of "wipeout protection" does your implementation currently offer? Wipeout protection prevents the legacy chain from ever being adopted by segwit2x nodes - even if it is the stronger (more proof-of-work) chain.

It could certainly be something we don't know yet, no way to prove or disprove.
For me the ASICBOOST theory does not add up. Read for example the [statement of the founder of KnCMiner]( In particular if Jihan really implemented ASIC Boost it would probably have to be a completely separate chip design. Considering that the development of Chips is the major cost, having two separate designs seems unreasonable. And If they really have two chips, why not sell them as well? If they really have a patent they can name the price and this would certainly be the best way to "protect" ASICBOOST, i.e. having many people use it.

The incentives apply to economic nodes just as well. If there is a risk of being wiped out by a reorg, economic nodes are, to a certain extend, coerced to switch to the USAF chain. If there is no such threat economic nodes could choose mainly according to their ideology. But I guess most economic mode won't take a side, i.e. follow the longest chain.

Why do people think that holding onto their bitcoin will magically increase their value? BTC has serious scaling problems, blocksize is small (probably forever), LN not at all user friendly and other scaling solutions (like Schnorr) promised last year are nowhere to be seen. And even if these problems are solved people need to spend their Bitcoin, for it to become a useful currency and make it attractive for businesses to accept it. So start working on Bitcoin or at least spend those coins whenever you can, if you want it to actually challenge that USD in the graphic.

It has to have some point to start with, as it can't just randomly connect to IPs hoping that there is a full node running which answers (well it could, but that would take a long time).
Changing the seed addresses is consequent, because if a chain split occurs, which unfortunately seems rather likely, you want your clients to connect to seeds which are on your chain. The seed addresses removed are by people who mostly expressed opposition to the NY Agreement and at least in one case explicit support for UASF, so these are very unlikely to be on the NYA chain.

I think Jimmy Song is missing one important possible defence of "the miners":
Implement a soft fork, which (after the USAF flag date) rejects all chains that do not include at least one non-segwit signalling block. I.e. all it does is make the USAF chain invalid. This would make the chain split permanent and thereby eliminate all factors in the game theory caused by the thread that the "miners" chain in contrast to the USAF chain can be wiped out by a reorg. In this scenario therefore, there is no additional incentive to switch to the USAF chain because of fear of reorg. At the same time, from a miners perspective, this is much better than a hardfork, because all miners (also those signalling SegWit) which simply follow the longest chain are kept and not forced to the USAF chain.
I don't want to advocate this proposal, but I think it would be the best thing for the miners to do in case USAF gains so much traction that it becomes a serious threat to them (which I currently don't think it will become). Also as far as I can see there are no real downsides at all, except possibly orphaning one or two non-usaf but segwit blocks around the flag date.

Depends on what you mean with "prove your ownership" in this context. Either you imply the cryptographic proof IS ownership, as it is the case for (on chain) Bitcoin. In this case it obviously does not work for gold. If you mean that I have a cryptographic certificate which proofs my ownership versus some other party, yes I is certainly possible, e.g. [onegram]( (I don't know the details of onegram, might be a scam, but the principle is certainly possible).
However I fail to see how this is relevant. The problems I have with banks are not caused by me being unable to proof the ownership of my founds.

How are knife and acid attacks related to arabs? Christian people can't attack each other with knifes?

Nah, as I said: this should be done. I just don't agree that there are no risks.

So I assume you have no argument to present. Well that's unfortunate.

This is basically what BIP103 suggest (see  In my opinion a very reasonable way to increase the blocksize. However keep in mind that most likely this will NOT be sufficient to keep the fees constant at Bitcoin's current growth rate, i.e. in the long term we need more than that via other solutions.

What is the point? You trust their Hardware has no backdoor, you trust their Software has no backdoors, you probably wouldn't even recognize if there were. Why use Bitcoin, why use lightning? Such people would be better of to use any open source SVP wallet if it weren't for this unnecessary blockchain congestion.

What you say is correct, however if you look at the mining support of ETC you clearly see that it dropped very low and stabilised when poloniex added ETC trading. So many miners first switched to the hard fork and switched back to ETC after some level of support was visable. I don't say the effect of being the "default" doesn't exist, but I am not sure how big it actually is.

Well, if Bitcoin adoption continues to grow and you keep the blocksize looked at 1mb forever, which many people here advocate, users are actually forced to use it, because on chain fees become inaccessible. Therefore if LN is to be the main scaling solution it should better provide a similar level of decentralization. If it is only one piece of many (which I would certainly support), a certain level of centralization is acceptable.

You think banks are unhappy with the fractional reserve system?

This is the important factor. The effectiveness of your Lightning Hub directly scales with the amount of money you can put down. If the on chain fee for opening/closing a channel is each 0.005 BTC and you put down 1 BTC in a channel in the worst case (only one direction payments) you pay 1% fee. If you put down 1000 BTC you only pay a fee of 0.001%. Speculating that a well connected Hub has ~100 Backbone channels the world divides pretty easily into those which can put down 100.000 BTC and those which can only put down 100. Actual users will of cause prefer the HUB offering 0.001% Fee instead of 1%. Of cause one directional payments is a worst case scenario, however assuming a random walk for the payment direction only worsens the situation for small amount channels as the expected imbalance grows with sqrt(x), where x is the amount transferred.

So how come there is not a single [arab country]( on that list, assuming it is a "well known fact" that acid assaults are popular in their culture?

Yea, they definitely should have stolen your bitcoins before publishing their findings. Such amateurs.

Sure, but nevertheless there would not be a wipeout of the original chain. Any node could decide to return to it by updating.
