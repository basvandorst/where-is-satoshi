Bitcoin is full money... starting to lend money via btc with interest will most likely result in creating btc that dont exist.

You can join pools and pay a fee. E.g. hashnest: buy Gigahashes and pay a 28% fee on every block antpool mines. The rest goes to you. Iam currently invested in there. The ROI time is around 6-8 months. You can always sell the Gigahashes you bought on the website at any time. Supply and demand. I recommend you do your own research and don't let anyone tell you where to invest your money. Many people don't even understand maths and invest in those sites and don't understand how it works. Always understand what you are investing in. Simple rule

Hi there, most typical online wallets that I know of are blockchain.info or coinbase. Not recommended for larger numbers of btc. Research cold wallets.  No idea about that converting process.
Maybe someone else can help you with the converting process. You should read alot to make sure you understand the majority of what is happening.

Buying an S9 unit with $0 electricity fees would be a return of around $7-8 per day. It costs $1464 + $120 for the 1600 watts powersupply. With rising difficulty it will shrink slowly each day.
