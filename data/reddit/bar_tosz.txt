I agree, and think that probably investing in BTC would give higher return but also I think that investing everything into one crypto is risky and more diversification is required. I am still keeping my BTC but also moving some of it into alts.

That article is from 2016 so not entirely true anymore, 2017 was a great year for Alts and many people got reach thanks to alts.

I wont be "jumping around alts" I did my own reaserch and selected coins that I believe will increase in value and will be holding them while keeping part of my portfolio in btc (probably larger part). If you think that btc is the only chosen one with best risk/gain ratio you might be ass-fucked by the market.

I am now going to do the same but still waiting for BTC to pick up to 15k USD at least, dont want to sell in dip. Probably will put it into RFQ, at least most of it.

Agree again crytpos are just a gambling tbh and should be treated as such. 
What I meant was that i.e. lately BTC is going constantly down but other cryptos are going up (i.e. XRP or XRB) so keeping all in BTC is not as efficient as in different coins.

59% would be when you have extremely low credit score and you want a credit card to build it up... Most people will have APR between 18-25%.

I am the other way, really trying not to buy more... lol

UK fee is 2.5%. APR varies between 18.9% to even 59% depending on credit score.
