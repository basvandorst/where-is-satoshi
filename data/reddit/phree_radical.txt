I was moving some dust using raw transactions and guessed too low at the fee.  I watched the transaction on blockchain.info to see if it got into a block, for about two hours.  I decided to just try the same transaction again but with a higher fee, and it was included in a block very fast, instead of the old one.  So yes, absolutely

Neat, donated 3¢ to a charity

Which email provider notifies you about failed login attempts?  By the way, mtgox database (including customer data) was stolen:

Yeah, ALL of it is going to be in tiny outputs that will make the transaction large :)
But with patience and the raw transactions API or some alternative client, OP can combine them without a huge fee, and just patiently wait for it to confirm.

I think there are obstructions to global trade because of capitol controls by governing entities, more so than due to it not being profitable enough

On top of that, if you add this address to your wallet, your client freezes esp. when trying to send money.  Seems listunspent doesn't have a way to filter out the tens of thousands of results and it can take like 30 seconds (bitcoin-qt freezes for longer than that and fails to send money).

Basically, we built the world's strongest supercomputer to tackle this problem.

Wow.  Seems like you should be able to co-control addresses, having them in your wallet without having to worry about your wallet unexpectedly sending money to them...
Thank you for the warning.
