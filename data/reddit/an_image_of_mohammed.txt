@_date: 2017-12-09 00:05:51
Can you eli5 this?
Dimon and his minions buy over the past few months what? A million BTC?
Then BTC gets to the CME to be traded. 
Now what do they do? Start buying contracts that say the price of BTC will drop. 9K? 5K? 2K?
After buying these contracts they start selling their million BTC en masse crashing the price of BTC and then cash in their contracts as well? 
This plus the other holders of BTC who now panic and begin selling their BTC further exacerbates the crash further increasing their profits on their short contracts? 
Then BTC is left naked and impoverished at sub 1K value again? 
Am I getting any of this near the mark of what you're proposing? 
Remember, I said ELI5....

Is that deduction (kinda pun intended) true?
I don't mind the logic behind taxing the company once. Then taxing me once.
Taxing the fruit of my labors AFTER already taxing my labor seems to me like double dipping. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:23:26
On the contrary. Those are the people that should be taxed the most. The make money by literally doing no work except for using other people's money....
Look, there's a lot wrong with the taxation system and I'm not qualified to fix it. 
It may simply be a rich man/poor man perspective on my part. 
Or ignorance (idiocy as you said). 
But there's something very wrong about treating my income, which is paltry compared to those that are rich, the same as those that make 100x and more what I make.
And again, what a company like Meryl lynch makes versus Joe shmo.

Ok, to put it another way, WHY is profit taxed?
Why are you so able to accept this as normal and regular practice?
I understand that there needs to be a communal pot that everyone in society pays into.
Taxation is how that money is collected.
How are the government and its citizens going to decide how the money is collected and on what it is spent?
I'm not entirely sure of the basis and reasoning for these laws and am the first to admit my ignorance.
I also know that human nature demands that when there are rules, there will be those that seek to undermine those rules for purposes of gain.
At this point, I'm just being curious.

I make money by working.
They tax that money.
I take my post tax money and buy seeds. 
I plant the seeds, nurture the plant for seasons, protect it from the winter, then when it gives fruit, I enjoy that fruit.
The government has no right taxing that fruit. I already paid my taxes on that money I earned.

Shouldn't there be? In a better world I mean.


Perhaps that's how it should be viewed, however, with the way the government taxes us, I feel (and I can't be alone in this) that it's a penalty for earning.


You've mistaken my questioning for defiance. I'm not advocating paying no taxes. I understand that taxes are one of the lubricants that make government and thus society, work.
I do want to pay taxes. I don't want to get raked over the coals or "penalized" twice for my work.
Having said that, many have explained that I'm not actually getting taxed twice, just once in different types of situations.
Again, this is for the hobbyist, which you pointed out isn't distinguished in tax law.


So am I! Paree Louys! (It's Sunday morning here).
I was born and raised in the US and understand that taxes are an inherent necessity in a well-working government.

Not that I'm asking for advice, just thinking out loud, the smart move would be to sell some BTC now, before the December 9 extravaganza, then wait and watch for the aftermath through the new year. 
If BTC crashes and burns, you made some money. 
If it doesn't, you still have some BTC and some cash you can use to buy more BTC, especially if BTC ends up becoming more robust if it survives the wolves at the door....

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:16:36
I do see your point.
The fact is that we're protecting a fucked up system of taxation because changing it *might* allow the rich to keep more of their money. 
The whole thought process behind the tax code, that is as unwieldy and bulky as our DNA, is outdated and anachronistic. 
The problem is that any new tax code written is going to be done so by the rich anyway, so there's no chance in hell that it'll be fair for the working class. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:18:18
Obviously not.
A better system of taxation needs implementation. 
Of course, those very people you mentioned (and more) will be vociferously against anything that makes it harder for them to earn money while doing essentially nothing.

I don't consider it arguing! I'm trying to learn to see a different viewpoint.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:18:24
I disagree.
I made $50 in profit after all that work. And that was in my SPARE time.
In this example I should pay the government about $1 of my $50 as a nominal tax, if any at all.
I do see your point, I just disagree with the premise.
Again, this is NOT a watermelon farm or farmer. This is an average person who is growing watermelons in their backyard on the weekends and tending to them during the week, after work.


This type of reasoning I don't understand (unless I'm misunderstanding your point). Why are you penalizing me for caring about a 2/5ths tax (that's a LOT) on labor I did in my spare time with money I earned and with money that was already TAXED by the government?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:43:10

With regards to "Trading for other Crypto"
If you bought one crypto solely for the purpose of buying another crypto - so there was no profit/loss made because after you bought the one crypto you traded it for another crypto....
Do you have to pay any tax? Sales tax? Your comment made it seem like the reason you were paying tax on this type of transaction was because the original crypto you were using to buy the second crypto increased in value before you made the "crypto swap".
My question is if you buy one crypto with another crypto immediately, without any gains or losses on the first crypto, is there a tax involved?

Okay. Again I understand. But I don't agree with their reasoning or application.
Granted, the way you explain it seems to make sense. 
However, when I think of my own fruit,  I don't care. I don't want it taxed after I used post tax money to create my wealth. It seems like stealing/double dipping on the government's part.

My issue is more of an question I guess.
I'm part of that VW diesel debacle. So I'm getting over 21K to replace my TDI.
My plan was to purchase a vehicle, final price with everything, out the door, 24K. I have enough to cover the difference.
But yesterday I was in a mental zone thinking.... Cars are bad investments, they lose value, blah blah blah.... What would a "smart" person do with a 21K+ windfall?
Well, I don't think they'd pay off their car. I think they'd get a car loan and invest that 21K someplace....
That's when the thought hit me. I could almost become one of the "21ers" or whatever it's called...
Otoh, I can buy the car outright and with the monthly payments I save, I could buy bitcoin over time.
So that's where my question/post originated from.
It's up to me and what I feel comfortable with. But I suck with money. I constantly vacillate and always end up with buyer's remorse regardless.
But thanks for your advice!

I'm not disregarding  the effect of what you pointed out.

Not trying to argue.
I'm only pointing out that use of gdax - free trading advantage of its fee-less transactions)  requires up to 10 days (depending on the type of account you hold with Coinbase) and that the inexperienced should not simply assume that the process is immediate without some lag/delay. 
Just pointing out this fact for the uninitiated.

So is the US :D
However both our nations have huge issues in economics, infrastructure, racism, poverty, and maybe even healthcare. 
What's healthcare like in Brazil for an  average citizen? What needs to be reformed?

Wow. Is he that clueless as to what bitcoin is or is he acting ignorant?

But the world is a different place today. If enough major countries decide to switch out currency and make another one besides the greenback the world's reserve, this can get even uglier for the US.
Certainly you won't deny that the US is more and more appearing like a sick person with lavish clothes on. Seemingly rich and opulent but underneath, decrepit and ailing, falling apart.
Between our infrastructure, healthcare, rich - poor gap, and political structure (binary, corrupt, already bought), the future (unless the course changes) does not bode well.
No one can predict the future, however...

I'm  posting this here even though it is not directly related to BTC or crypto currencies.
However indirectly, I think it is a very good and cautionary tale and one of the reasons I believed in bitcoin and crypto in general. 
This quote from near the end of the article is what really got my attention:

So maybe I'm dense but here's the problem I see with this type of advice: You can't buy coin on gdax until your money is in Coinbase. Getting your money into Coinbase takes time. It's not instant on the basic levels. So unless your ahead and take into account a lag time of up to 10 days, you're not going to be able to place orders on gdax until your money clears in your Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:06:17
:D All good! I can't stand the US and it's stubborn clinginess to outdated measuring systems. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:23:55
Oh. Well that's confusing. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:11:16
Why would this even be allowed?
Could I send xrp to a btc address?
eth to an xrp address?
ltc to a bch address?
Doesn't the "sending software" have a set of rules it applies before allowing you to click "send"?
If a business doesn't accept American Express, it won't let you put in AE cc 
What am  I missing? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:05:54
My guess is that as the ship is sinking, like rats, the upstart new world currency is where these countries go to/switch to.
It won't happen until there's a new currency to switch to.

How are you in the 21 club with only 1.6 btc? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:56:14
A stroke? Head injury?

Ahhhh shoot! I confused the 21 club with the 1 in a million club!
Thank you for correcting me!

I saw this in and was like, wait. WTF? So the whole DJIA and Wall Street are shedding weight by around 5% in two days? No wonder BTC and crypto in general is taking a hit.
Sigh. Perspective.

I disagree with your assessment of the hardware wallet.

Yes!

They're including "dual-monitors, sound, and desk and chair".
That's going to add a bit to the $1200 estimate. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:45:28
Well some believe that many of these are weak hands that bought at way higher prices and can't tolerate the risk of losing more so they sell at a loss and take the hit.
My ill informed guess is that hodlers hodl (for the most part) and panickers sell.

What if a government like NK, or pick one, decided that hacking Bitcoin is in their interests?
Could that type of government level attempt overwhelm Bitcoin and its supports?

Another Trezor question:
The words (16?) that are your recovery seed, do you choose them or are they hard coded into the Trezor?
Sorry for hijack.

The videos on Calculus are simply amazing, to me.
I've never understood the thought behind the math and was always frustrated with that. Couldn't finish Godel, Escher and Bach, Took Calc I twice, tried to teach myself.... Nothing worked except the video by 3blue1brown

If Bitcoin is adopted as another currency of trade, how large a share will it have to incorporate before people "stop checking" what it's worth compared to "XYZ Fiat currency"?
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:27:54
That actually was better/simpler. Thanks.

I use Trezor.
Every week or so I move my Bitcoin from Coinbase to my Trezor.
I lose a little due to fees so I try to minimize the number of times a month I move coins.
