Ya watching one's money move is awesome and almost addicting. I've gotten quite a few friends into it myself and it's great bouncing thoughts, questions, and ideas off each other so we can better understand crypto and all the opportunities that come with it.

I'm kind of a newbie too and I had a similar question. See this post. 
I ended up buying a Trezor which is a hardware wallet. They give you your own private keys and offer a coin splitting tool when forks come up. So far I would recommend it. It feels much safer than having my coins on an exchange.

What is the dollar backed by? nothing... just consensus. Consensus that paper is worth something.
Mining a bitcoin costs over $1,000 in electricity (probably more don't quote me). This in itself proves that it has some worth. The real backing is the that people from all around are coming in agreement that bitcoin has value. Consensus=Value

Question. There is 16.6 million bitcoins and counting in "circulation" now. I have a coinbase wallet which I used to buy 1 bitcoin over a month ago. Do I even own my very own bitcoin? I feel like there is not enough bitcoin for everybody to own one especially with all the hype. What happens when it runs out?

On it. Stoked to see what the future holds
