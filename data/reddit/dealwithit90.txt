I bought 5btc for £43.04 in January 2013. People were laughing at me back then.... *Insert super fucking smug face*

You say that, I have a tendency to make rather foolish investments every now and then. Ended up losing about £8,000 on my alts portfolio in the space of 6 hours when shit starting kicking off with scam ICOs...

If anyone got in around $500, or less, they're inevitably in a happy place right now! ��

All you bloody Reddit folk have made me nervous, I've just sold 1btc for a solid £8700 profit.... I'll take it.

Sorry to here that my friend. I suffer from extreme anxiety, health and social anxiety to be exact. I got into cryptocurrencies as a way to fill my loneliness, a hobby I guess. So ultimately, I have all this 'lucky' money, but nothing really to do with it. I spend hours watching the markets and do very little else with my time. I consider myself a somewhat intelligent introvert with a talent for noticing trends and patterns, hence my interest in crypto. 
We do have our problems, I hope you can become comfortable in this world, something I am also trying to do. 
Best of luck bud and thanks for being honest. It's very refreshing.

I sell bits here and there... I mean, I have sold minimal quantities and made £3k profit and now I am just sitting on the rest. So if Bitcoin suddenly dies and death overnight, £3,000 profit from a £40 investment in 5 years still isn't too bad.

The biggest issue I have with bitcoin is resisting the urge to sell... And also resisting the urge to brag about the fact I got so god damn lucky.

But it's so hard to stay humble! ��
