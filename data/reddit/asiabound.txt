That is essentially the model we're looking for.  Has anyone here used them?  If so, what was your largest transaction?  Any idea where they reside geographically?

Not looking to be a middle man.  We're simply looking for a way for fiat customers to pay us in BTC without jumping through additional hoops.  
There are a variety of businesses which cater to helping the consumer spend their BTC with BTC accepting businesses.  but so far it seems few options existing for helping business owners receive BTC from customers which only use fiat.

Hope you had a safe landing.

Does bitstamp allow payments to be wired in from various parties?

That is am awesome Villa.   I live in KL and have property in Lombok.  Indonesia (like the majority of Asia) does not allow freehold ownership of their property by foreigners.  Leasehold is the only secure way to hold property there.  Not really related, but one neat thing about Indo from a business perspective is the effective corporate tax rate is discounted to 12.5%.

Input would be from Telegraphic Transfers (TT) aka Bank Wires.  Orginating from US companies.

bitstamp owns coinvoice?

I might try that where I live.  Aware-ing is caring!

Senders (customers) are primarily US based.  However the receiver (seller) is not.  Receiving BTC directly will save time &amp; expense while not directly moving the OTC market.  My employers would prefer reduced paperwork &amp; increased privacy over what OTC exchanges offer.
