How the hell am I taking "advantage" of something ?  .
@_date: 2014-01-12 06:18:59
it connects to p2pool.org  .

I could not have been more clearer ""p2pGUI" a GUI for mining using p2pool.org"
"Its a GUI interface to mine using p2pool.org. It uses BFGminer. "
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:30:50
yes ! ..
Im using BFG miner . So people will have an alternative if they dont wanna use cgminer and vice versa :)

Option Will be added in the next release :)

Here is my take .
The attacker managed to upload a php shell using a file upload vulnerability (probably an attack like this  using this shell that he uploded he back connected to your DataBase eg:localhost:3306 (using DB user and pass stored in config files,which he could have read using his PHP shell).
So now that he has access to the DB he can modify the "news" table directly without it generating any logs.The newspage.php would look up at the database and load the news that he injected using the same process as the normal news.  (logs are made only when if the attacker had used the admin page to modify, which you say didn't happen). 
I am a security researcher . So you can massage me if you have any doubts regarding this or want any help :)

Yup .
