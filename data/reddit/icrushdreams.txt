Bitcoin is a new idea hardly a decade old. It’s not that easy to overtake such an established asset (possibly the most established anywhere in the world).

Maybe that’s because Binance (and most other crypto exchanges) charge a % based fee..
NASDAQ’s revenue is diversified across various aspects of the entire exchange, although they mainly consist of trading fees (0.00395/share), data services, broker services (charging brokers for protocol access), and derivative trading fees (0.46/contract). All of that is before the rebates given to large volume customers.
Of course Binance does the same rebate for its larger volume customers, but it’s still a different business model. Charging a % fee to trade on a stock exchange would never fly. That’s something that only crypto traders are willing to put up with because that’s what’s available. I suspect if the market matures then we’ll start seeing flat rate exchanges and their profit numbers will start to look more realistic.
Binance’s profit is as high as it is because the market has little competition which gives them no incentive to lower fees to something we’d realistically see in the stock exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:22:43
Broker fees being that high are still a legacy of stock exchanges and brokers being phone-based systems. Now that almost everything is digitized that fee is quickly coming down and on its way to ~$1-2 or even free. But these fees aren’t from the exchange, they’re from the middleman due to the overhead costs (customer support, transferring funds, software, etc). Even then, it’s still flat rate and not a percentage.
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:47:16
No exchange "makes" you avoid taxes, or "lets" you get around them.. If an exchange is based in the US and is licensed then they have to report your total volume to the IRS and it's then up to you to file separately with your transactions and what you made. However even if they don't do that, or if the exchange isn't in the US, you're still supposed to report your transactions and what you made (plus file FBAR if you have &gt;10k in foreign accounts).
Even when say Coinbase doesn't file a 1099K for you (if you don't trade enough to hit the limit), you're still supposed to report it yourself.

If Nasdaq started charging 0.10% of every trade, high frequency traders and market makers would leave, liquidity would become terrible, less people would trade stocks, and more likely than not companies would start trying to get listed on the NYSE (or perhaps another would appear in that case).
Nasdaq and NYSE are playing a low margin game on purpose. If they're charging just enough in fees to maintain razor thin margins, it's both unfeasible and impractical for other exchanges to gain any ground against them.

The entire point of a negative interest rate (from a monetary policy perspective) is to balance out an under-target inflation rate. The -0.50% interest rate is a response to German inflation coming in at ~1.2% this year which is below the target of 2%.

Exactly... some people (i.e. not the diehard enthusiasts) prefer it to be easy to use and may find storing your own bitcoin to be complex, and if anyone does it incorrectly then their money is completely gone. At least with Coinbase there's another party involved to help you out.
If you're that concerned that Coinbase is going bankrupt tomorrow and taking your money then you can go make your own wallet, but it's nonsense to try and enforce that policy on regular users that really don't want to/shouldn't do that.

Do you want Bitcoin to become a currency people use for transactions or an investment/security people buy because they suspect it will go up? It's significantly harder for it to be both - it's not a currency if nobody wants to spend it since they all think it's going up.
In the currency use case, paying 10% extra for it is stupid since you will just be buying something with 10% less purchasing power than you used to have.

Gold has a fundamental value as a precious metal that gives it a constant demand. If gold was an ugly useless stone then it would be worthless.
Bitcoin has no fundamental use like gold does. It’s value is derived from its ability to act as a currency and that’s why people buy and use it. If everyone only bought Bitcoin to hold it and do nothing then it would be worthless.
@_date: 2018-11-06 04:03:24
Banks can hold your private keys for you and keep them safe. The concept of private keys holding the key to your entire wealth (even with a hardware wallet) is by no means simple or intuitive to average people. They don’t care to jump through the hoops for 100% security.
I’d argue the closest thing we have to a crypto bank is Coinbase and they’re not far from one if they added a few more services.

Gold has fundamental value as a precious metal. Bitcoin’s fundamental value is entirely derived from its ability to act as a currency. People buy gold regardless of value because it looks nice and can be used as an electronic component. If you aren’t willing to spend it, then Bitcoin’s only “feature” is numbers in your digital wallet.
The only trait that Bitcoin shares with gold is limited supply. Aside from that, it needs to derive value from being a currency since that’s what it was made to do and that’s the entire point of it.

It’s a lot more than a few more seconds and certainly not flawless.
NFC is *one* tap and it’s completely done and cleared in less than 5 seconds from there.
For crypto, you need to unlock your phone, open the app, wait for the app to launch, scan their QR code, make sure the amount is correct, hit send, then wait for the tx to be sent out and seen by their POS. It’s definitely a lot longer of a process.

@_date: 2019-05-17 19:35:40
If you only want to store your money then most people have no problem using bank accounts. You have to provide a tangible advantage other than protection from governments since most people don’t have any major issues with the way their banking system works.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:22:57
I think that if push comes to shove, though, the central banking system will optimize that 2-3 day clearance time much lower than it currently is. Nothing they're doing really requires waiting that long so if they want to I'm sure they can get it way down. And once that happens, Bitcoin will have to compete on other aspects.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:47:22
But you’re banking on someone else wanting to buy your BTC for more than you paid for it. The underlying value of your BTC, if nobody else wants to buy it for more, is nothing. Whereas stock in a presumably solid company generates earnings and dividends.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:49:10
So if we were to hypothetically get a clearing house reform where banks could transfer money directly between each other, the only advantage left for Bitcoin is its immunity to government/third party intervention. That’s a hard sell for average people, isn’t it?
Even then, so long as services like Zelle exist that are willing to bridge the gap and make instant payments possible, I don’t think most people would mind using it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:01:19

@_date: 2019-05-01 17:07:54
Of course, which is why that never happens. A stock that profitable would never be worth $0 since it has underlying value (in the form of dividends) that makes it worth more than that. Bitcoin, however, does not. You have nothing to fall back on if people don’t want it anymore in favor of something else (fiat or another crypto).

@_date: 2019-05-17 18:12:24
I agree. Lots of work to be done before Bitcoin is fully superior to fiat. I do think it'll happen, either Bitcoin or some other crypto with new technology to bring to the table, but at the moment in it's current state I simply cannot see Bitcoin going mainstream without further development.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:27:58
But that already exists in most people’s minds in the form of Venmo/tons of other similar services. You have to convince people to want to switch from being able to instantly send fiat for free domestically to one where the currency constantly fluctuates and there’s all these nuances they need to learn to use. Tough sell.

@_date: 2019-05-14 18:16:15
How is that relevant to the discussion? Your original point was that it's a good thing for Bitcoin to go up due to fiat currencies inflating. But if goods increase in cost proportional to fiat inflation then it's a moot point since the buying power of Bitcoin in that scenario remains constant.
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:12:04
Your comparison of a price increase equalling dividends is akin to saying that Beanie Babies are a sound investment since they’ll always attract new buyers at higher prices.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:52:57
The company still generates revenue (-&gt; dividends/buybacks) though in addition to the demand for stock on the markets. If my stock is $100 and generates $5/yr in dividends, then even if people decide the stock is now worth nothing I still have my dividend payments to keep me afloat. Whereas if people collectively decide Bitcoin is now worth nothing then there’s no underlying value behind it that will drive the price in an environment where supply &gt; demand.

That doesn’t address the (much more common) use case of domestic transactional payments.
Bank wires currently take around a day for international payments, but services like TransferWise can make it happen in minutes if you draw funds from a card and Xoom regardless of method.
Let’s not act like Bitcoin is perfect and blows its competition out of the water. It has plenty of room for improvement across the board.

Market cap =/= revenue. Which company is larger depends on the metric you use to decide.

Source on traditional payments costing 2% of GDP?

But if fiat currencies begin rapidly inflating then so would the cost of regular goods (groceries, rent, etc) relative to them. You would need to measure Bitcoin in terms of its ability to buy bread, not fiat.

The savings isn’t that huge when you take into account they’re going to end up converting it back to fiat to pay everybody.

So you just want investors to get in on it without regard for its usefulness? Wtf is the point then? If you just want BTC to go up in price without caring about its acceptance and usefulness as a currency then you just described a bubble.

They aren't the ones doing the trading, they're an exchange. Exchanges have expenses - server maintenance, employee salaries, and stolen funds, among other things that come out of their tax bill. It's a normal business expense.

We're going to look to an asset that tanked 90% last year in order to escape what is a worst case of 4% inflation? The volatility is really not worth the hedge at this stage. As a currency Bitcoin has a long way to go before it has a case to be made as a hedge against inflation - especially when there are perfectly stable treasury bonds you can buy, many of which outpace inflation.

If a given currency inflates and the cost of goods relative to that currency doesn’t go up, then the cost of those goods relative to any other currency would be rapidly decreasing. You can’t get a gallon of gas for 50 cents anymore. That’s a result of currency inflation making gas cost more, not gas prices being higher.
