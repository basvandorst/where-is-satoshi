Seriously. I’m starting to believe this sub is full of high school kids who put $5 in and think they won’t have to work a day in their life. 
The mental gymnastics to explain off Microsoft’s abandonment of crypto is mind blowing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:05
You were gamed in a volatile market. It’s time to accept that. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:10:50
Jesus this advice is cancer.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:23:13
This post seems more like shilling than the one they’re complaining about. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:17:34
The original article from CNBC said South Korea was going to ban the exchanges...
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:17:11
This is just cringeworthy now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:42:42
I've got money in BTC and I agree with him completely. The constant posts here that are dumb memes or overtly optimistic are doing more harm than good. Now's the time to start calling out the weaknesses in crypto and demanding a better system. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:21:55
Glad this news is making it to CNN...wait...
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:11:37
This is still a thing? Seems desperate.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:00:43
It's either that or the 12 year olds trying to give investment advice on vaporware. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:27:28
Stop with this trash. Accept the market and make your next move. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:25:06
Just wait 2 week’s convert back to fiat and then buy what you want!
Face it, Bitcoin has been completely volatile and hasn’t been picked up by retailers. 
If it’s to have the future we all want, there needs to be some changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:13:52
Yeah, I started investing earlier this year and figured this sub would be a good resource. Holy hell was I wrong. 
My guess is 1 of every 10 giving advice actually has sizable skin in the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:05
Yup. I sold at 14.3 last night. I woke up and was shocked to see it near 16. I have no regrets though. A correction is coming and things may change drastically on December 10.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:43:41
I have a Gemini account but I like that CB makes it easy to do on mobile since it's a 24 hour market.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:00:42
Only difference is he's still making money on his investments while crypto investors are not.
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:59:23
This sub is garbage. Just a bunch of kids who probably don’t own any BTC to “hold”. Market has been plateauing all year and there’s now quality conversations happening. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:16:35
Though the timing is suspect, the content isn't. Nobody has disputed the material. Same with the DNC leaks. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:20:58
Wikileaks is the primary source. They have never been wrong either so what's the problem?
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:20:28
When has Wikileaks been wrong? Whether you feel like they have an agenda or not is one thing but they've never published anything that hasn't been true.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:27:00
Because it’s cringe af. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:17:27
I just got it last weekend. Atari games FTW.
@_date: 2018-10-14 15:55:59
You must have been waiting a while since the price hasn’t done much this year. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 05:44:53
Holy shit this is cringe. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:04:51
This is seriously the dumbest advice if you’re serious about investing. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:15:33
They are awesome. I traded my Model S for a Model 3 2 weeks ago and am loving it.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:19:38
Buying is fine if you have faith in the future....
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:18:10
Yup. My initial investment was over $10,000. Having a bunch of 12 year olds telling me to HODL everyday was annoying as hell. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:38
I just sold some stock in Chipotle and bought some tonight. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:41
Yeah but I got Dogecoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:20:07
Especially rights after a $3K down swing. 
"I lost thousands then made hundreds!"
@_date: 2018-11-02 05:14:27
Price still at $6,300. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:02:58
All contributors. Means nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:50:56
How do you mitigate risk in such a variable market? If you charge $10 for a product and the value of that $10 becomes $5 in market value, how do you manage that business?
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:33:50
Because a random Redditor has “inside” info. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:56:10
The pendulum swings way farther on BTC though. When was the last time the market moved 20% in a day?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:54:17
DOW down 4.6% today with actual economic reasoning behind it and is completely regulated. 
BTC down 20%+ right now and has been sliding all 2018. 
Can we stop trying to tie this to the actual economy?
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:23:56
Still makes no sense. Even if you sell right away the fees alone would cut into your profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:58:17
No doubt. I’m starting to think the rally last year was market manipulation rather than actual value being accrued. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:07:55

Well the value of gold does change and it's a precious metal with finite quantities. It's a tangible item that can be exchanged for a market value.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:16:07
I invest in stocks and am scared to invest in crypto for this reason. Does it only have this value because people agree that it does? Is there anything backing it or actually making it worth what it is today?
I've had friends make a killing in crypto but it just seems to volatile. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:57
DOW lost 4.6% today. BTC is down over 20% right now. Plus the stock market has fail safes and is regulated. 
Let’s not pretend this is apples to apples. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:24
Oh wow. An airline nobody here will fly is using a near obsolete currency. Sure this means HODL.

And already back under. These celebrations at 9K are just cringe since it’s like 50% of its peak value.

It is if it was part of a pump and dump to inflate the value. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:29:45
I think I found you on Google Maps. I’ll definitely come by if I’m in the area. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 04:19:46
I’m in the West Valley and work at the studios in Burbank. Where can I support?
Also, business question, let’s say you take $1,000 in BTC payments and it loses half its value tomorrow, what becomes the plan? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:02:30
Who is to say it recovers though?
