No, you havent, but i wasnt initially talking to you bro, the other guy up the thread implied it.
-"Why dont you have a debit card"
-"most people outside the us dont have a [considering what he was replying to, i assume he meant debit] card"

There isn't only 1 idea that you believe in, sometimes they intersect but are not wholly compatible.
I am pretty sure you believe in the idea of wikipedia just as much as the idea of bitcoin. The fact that wikipedia doesnt support BTC should not be held against them, they might have reasons that you (and I) ignore. They are sufficiently "good" to get a pass on this sort of stuff.
There are businesses out there much more deserving of your ire and grandstanding.

You cant really spend it on everyday items, that makes it inferior.
Ever tried to pay at the toll with Bitcoin? Get yourself a pack of gums? Provide a proof of funds for a mortgage?

Wikipedia is an ad free website with loads of helpful information that most of us use daily.
Letting your bitcoin fandom get in the way of helping something good is just self important.
You're being an arrogant jerk, that's all. Give or dont give, they're not losing sleep over it. No one cares about your money.

Do you know many adults in the western world who dont own a debit card seriously?
I mean, in vietnam, uganda, peru or papua new guinea why not, but thats a tiny percentage of the reddit userbase that...

You can pay with a "normal" plastic card too, debit or credit, can't you?
I dont have a credit card either (uk) and I remember donating a few months ago
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:21:50
He also said debit

Then get out and do something, is anyone holding you hostage?

Let me rephrase, it has nothing to do with the political party called Conservative, nor any other. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:34:34
Sorry, I just cannot see what's conservative about bitcoin. 
It's a technology, it's neutral. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:26:23
Boohoo, a website on the Internet is not to my standards but i don't have a choice, I need to be on it! What can I do? 
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:46:23
That statement is true or false depending on how you define "inferior", but yes Euros have no value when buying grocery at a k-mart in Nebraska. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:21:34


no, they don't.

Link to Bitcoin is...?

Simply get fucked. 
You're not French, you don't get to decide what's best for us.
We know better than you and your ilk what is and what is not French. You know nothing about us, and your "international anti-globalist" (WTF???) movement don't care for us, it is only a power play for YOU, not US. 
We don't fall for your type's international interferences into our elections and acts of hostility against our Nation.

This guy gets to define who belongs in BTC, take note. This guy fucks.
You're a joke mate.

Whatever my political opinion, which you do not know, the comment I responded to is factually inaccurate. I have noticed a pattern in American accounts believing that the cultural axioms they know are valid through the world.
They do not know or understand us,  and their most popular news network lies about us. 
In the same way that I do not comment about the roots of the conflict in Northern Ireland because my knowledge of the situation is incomplete, they should not voice opinion about the roots of conflicts in our countries. It is usually based on mistruths. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:37:27
I would recommend that Americans refrain from commenting on a situation that they neither understand culturally, nor possess facts to understand factually

The EU is part of my identity. It is my home and my sovereignty. Like everyone in Europe, I vote for the EU Parliament.
I am French, Spanish, German, Italian, Irish, Greek, Latvian, etc.
Those countries are sister countries, and I love them like I love my own, we share history, we share culture, we share values.
Vive la République, Vive la France, Vive l'Europe.
Our challenges are our own, and the truth is not that you care about what happens to the people of Europe, or even know anything about the complexities of their identities. 
The truth is that only with our disunity would your country be able to compete against us. That's what is behind this, you just wish your country was more than the shithole it is.
We share nothing with people like you, even if you think that "white culture" links us. There is nothing similar between our French/European culture and your version of Russian culture.

Repeating pre-chewed lines here mate. EU Parliament is elected.
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:54:17
You are entitled to your views, although I am sure you will agree that there isn't a legal framework anywhere in Europe calling for unlimited refugees. That would be disingenuous and/or misinformed. 
Moreover, I mean... We're all really busy strongly disagreeing with one another already, not sure we need foreigners to enlighten us with their "opinions" and shoddy similes. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:51:39
It's also a particularly popular way to launder money... 
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:59:08


Le Pen spent the whole campaign decrying them as being "neo-liberal globalists" and you think they're Trotskists??? hahaha
And even if they were... EU Parliament is elected by the people, whom at last count was still sovereign.
