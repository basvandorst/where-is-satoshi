Question : for bitcoin I just need to protect my private key to use my bitcoin because everything is in the blockchain. In lightning network look like I need to keep some sign transaction to keep channel open and close it later.  When the channel is open we need to protect this transactions from computer crash, virus, hack, corruption, stealing.. ?  What happen if we loose then ?

I have to believe a guy on twitter that saw something, because the other guy on twitter told me it's a good guy that tell the true ? We talking about 2 billions of US Dollar in a bank account of a company, it's so hard to find a simple respect firm to just check and confirm ?

Tether is not a exchange, it's a currency that the only value is to be back by Usd.

All transaction of bitcoin ever is in the blockchain and is store under 10 Go.  How MtGox can't have a simple log of every transaction done or fail on their side ? Transaction malleability or not they should juste look in some log : "Oh ! We try 1000 times to transfert bitcoin to this user"  a user that they have bank information and everything that is need to open a account.   I'm a programmer and I can believe they stupid enought to not log anything or do some balance check somehere. ( sorry for spelling, english is not my first language)
