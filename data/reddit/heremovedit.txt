Don't use the app store, put it on website.

I'll probably just say fuck it and buy more silver and guns. I don't know why people don't look at guns as an investment. They don't depreciate,and I have guns that have increased in value as much as 300% in 10 years.

I'm sort of gambling on one of them gaining ground now that BTC is starting to get spendy. I'm still kicking myself for not keeping what I had a few years back. I think this time around I might just sink $50.00-$100.00 on some of the emerging currencies as a long term gamble.

The commercial real estate market is still primed for a crash. The Asian bond market is fucked. If Detroit is successful with a bankruptcy the risk for municipal bonds and bond holders changes significantly.  I might just start hoarding kitchen matches and body body bags because there's barter value and demand for them in any crisis..lol

I live in militia country, if they to take anything it'll be moot point. In the western states many of us are well armed and prepared to die before letting anyone confiscate our guns , land or other assets. I'd rather go out on my feet defending what's rightfully than starve in some prison camp. Luckily for me I live somewhere where the local and state govt. share that sentiment.

I probably have the money for hardware/electric bills but it seems like the stuff being made right now is a rush job and delays may take away a good chunk of money. I'm not looking for short term profits, more like total payout over 24-36 months.

LTC @ $36.00 usd as I'm typing this, lol

How many of you know about
This is one more way to make BTC more palatable to merchants and the public.

Currency is typically linked to the economy of one nation, this isn't. Stocks are dependent on earnings this isn't. This behaves more like a "fantasy" metal.
Platinum started out being basically worthless too, people were making stove pipes out of it.

It's an open discussion, not everyone believes every theory put forward, but we're willing to listen and discuss it. The established financial world views you guys the same way.

The first time around it was sort of novelty and I looked at as a 6-12 month window and just wasn't that impressed, I started paying attention again when BTC was around 40.00. I think this time I'll be a speculator on a few and just buy then hold .

We know, one reason those of us on the fringe aren't adopting is the whole liberty dollar fiasco. A lot of people saw liberty dollars as a safe alternative currency. By all means it should have been, most of their business was in physical metal(gold/silver) coins. The company had their own mint and followed all rules for an alternative currency. Then they made the mistake of putting Ron Paul on a coin during an election year. We all learned that when the FEDS decide that you're a threat they'll do whatever it takes, to take what's yours.

I think they might be having technical issues due to increased traffic. Two days it logged me out of my wallet and I couldn't log in for 24 hours. It wouldn't send the auth key by sms or phone.

Thanks, that helps the only.decent contact/investor scenario I've found is waiting for ASIC gear to ship. These are people I know IRL, who are basically looking for capitol for a farm. I have a real world businesses so there are some tax write offs for me. But if it works it would be a return of around 20% which is pretty attractive.

This is why there's room for more than one alt currency. But this is already acting more like a precious metal  than a currency or stock.

Is that because of consumer confidence or lack of publicity?

As somebody who's into traditional stuff too, there's risk everywhere right now. All the metals show evidence of price manipulation. Rare earth minerals hinge on Afghanistan getting their shit together enough to mine, or Japan and China slugging it out over dredging rights.  Oil is a big wtf, because of the dollars instability and the fact that there's an abundance of it, but not enough refineries.

I'm still on the fence about LTC, the average person is just starting to hear about Bitcoin. I'm not going all in with digital currency but I'm looking for something else in car of dollar collapse.
