I think the intended term was "private citizens" having those weapons, not "people" in general.

Happy cakeday!
Thanks to and you (and a handful of others, who RES is not forthcoming in reminding me of), I've been able to follow a few people I trust and watch them comment on stories I'm trying to learn from. I've been following this emerging technology for over a year now and this subreddit, with you as one of its ambassadors, has been an amazing help! Keep helping out and making this place newbie/casual friendly. :D

He means half his private key (as a paper wallet). If OP has half, and OP's friend has half, neither of them can spend the money in the wallet without the other.

There's some *financial* gamble in it, but even if my breakeven time is long or nonexistent, I'm interested in doing it as a mathematical/computational curiosity. I'm a mathematician, so I'm interested in BTC mostly for that reason.
I mostly just feel unsure about this because I feel like I need to talk to an experienced/knowledgeable bitcoiner one-to-one, someone who's deep in the mining aspect and the culture, and figure out all the little details.

I'm not quite sure I understand this response. Could you clarify?
I think what you're saying is that gold has value as an investment but people do not regularly transact in gold, disproving my example. But we're not trying to make gold a common currency; it has industrial uses, too, but those are not the only pressures on the price of gold. We're trying to use BTC to establish a new currency and a new payment network. And if we don't *use* BTC actively, instead just holding it, then it loses its utility *as a decentralized method of moving value*.

The same people who have interest in holding them as an investment also have a reason to spend them. If Bitcoin is not actively used as a currency and is just held as a hoarding tool, it will quickly lose its value over time, similar to fiat, because the value in a currency is strongly correlated with how well you can exchange it for goods and services. If nobody is transacting in Bitcoin and instead just hanging onto it, then you see where this is going.
Thus, despite the rising prices, investors have a strong interest in promoting the spending of BTC, including spending some of their own holdings so that the rest of what they own retains its usefulness.

Thanks for the informative and well-written post. Presenting the ASIC buy-in as mostly safe and out of the "super early experimental" stage has encouraged me to seriously look at doing this- well, mostly. My problem is that I still don't understand all the aspects of this and I don't know anyone I could sit down and talk to about this one-on-one, to help me better understand.

Effectively, you've generated two different pairs of secrets to share with 1+2 and 3+4. Interesting.
