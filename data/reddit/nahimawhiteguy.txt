I don't really understand why you feel the need to defend him. I wasn't even criticising him, though admittedly I've responded to the antagonism in kind since my first comment. 
I had a quick listen to some bits again to make sure I'm not going mad. The guy skips syllables, no doubt about it. And now that I've had another listen, I would add that he says "kinda" and "like" a LOT. An awful lot. Nothing wrong with that, but it really doesn't support your notion that his eloquence is beyond me. 
(Incidentally, his rapid speech reminds me a little of Stark's!)

I am racist, but he's not in Australia so I couldn't care less. He speaks too quickly and it's very unclear, that's a fact regardless of his race and I'm finding it increasingly bizarre how defensive people are about it. It feels like one of the rare situations where I'm maybe the one *least* interested in his race!

Some Caribbean hooker said it, if I recall. It's a Caribbean hooker though, she'd probably say "Hitler did nothing wrong" for $3.50, with a blowy thrown in for the fun of it. 
Maybe McAfee paid her to shit in his mouth. Maybe he didn't. I don't think her word counts for much either way.

Got me! I'm insecure, that's why he talks quickly.

That probably felt like such a zinger but it doesn't make sense and doesn't have anything to do with my comment. I can't tell if people are leaping so irrationally to his defense out of respect for him or to white knight the negro. It's weird either way.

It's a great way to make a beautiful car instantly trashy. 
It's a Huracan ffs, it's perfect just the way it is! There's no need to be an Aventador-poser with aftermarket scissors.

I don't think that's fair, most people grow out of that phase in early childhood. Perhaps just a lack of socialisation?

Low IQ. Very low IQ.
