Is it possible to program into the core bitcoin protocal a limit so as to ignore or dismiss any hashing power from one source that exceeds something like 30% of total network hash?
I know thats sort of unfair and perhaps sneaky, but its far better than the alternative.

I understand that they can afford as many ip's as they need to hide their hashing power if all blocks are submitted freely and the only identifier is their IP.
For shizzle.
Well, perhaps the bitcoin wallet/program needs to integrate a mining program that can take advantage of GPU's and ASICS and has a list of the top 20 pools, as well as a p2p option. Maybe have a limit where if a pool is approaching 30% hashing power you cannot select that pool to mine on.
I know that the pools can pretend they aren't hashing as much as they are, but these are at least some ideas to avoid going close to 50%.
It's a very serious problem and we need some solutions.
Rather than people saying "this is bad" and not suggesting solutions.

Hmm, does overstock sell tampons for BTC?
That might help.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:10:24
Not sure, ip address?
I know they can switch ips or submit half from this ip, half from another.
I dont know enough about the protocal.
Perhaps there is an identifier linked with submission of blocks, perhaps tyere needs to be.
I am unsure though.

That's good service, good luck finding service like that at the mall! lol

I'm just saying, the post wasn't about the retention. 1100 days retention isn't a big deal these days. 
Do you want me to list the features i like and dislike about the services provided by xsusenet?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:23:21
Well, just show him the daily updates about their service department verifying users. 
Though at this point they should be pretty caught up and shouldn't be making you wait a month.
Just phone them, they have always been good to me.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:18:34
That's for the free account, retention 10 days...
 shows you the options with 1100 days of retention....
Lol, I don't care about the retention (in this case), I care about Usenet providers taking bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:11:42
lol, you guys are awesome.
Hey, they're accepting bitcoin, neato!
That is all.

Thanks, I didn't know about that sub
