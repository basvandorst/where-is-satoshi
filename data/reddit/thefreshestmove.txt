you're forgetting Roman Shtylman (bitfloor) 
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:20:00
who are you exactly? (pardon my ignorance)
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:46:39
what does try mean? how many days? you need to connect for a meaningful amount of time to determine if it does or doesn't.

Calling 95% of this sub "navel gazers" love it.  First half was amazing very interesting subject, haven't finished the second half yet.
edit: damn i'm embarrassed that i haven't listened to more of these.  the part where they talked about VCs/big money treating BTC as a goose laying golden eggs and they want to catch it and use it for themselves, damn man.  good shit.  it's about the principles. fuck i'm fired up. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:07:59
I'm having a hard time talking to my grandpa who is a financial adviser and insurance salesman about bitcoin because he doesn't like that there's little regulation.  I plan on showing him this.

NEED version with sound
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:17:52
I think a few of the group tried but this was years before regular people might have cared. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:43:34
the worst part is i was folding for almost a full year after learning about bitcoin instead of mining myself lmao HINDSIGHT.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:42:37
do you have an ltc address as well?
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:29:53
Roman Shytlman stole millions from myself (8btc) and hundreds of others with the exchange he ran called Bitfloor.
If you were also scammed by Roman please contact me, or see @_date: 2017-10-14 13:56:07
what's your public address my boy? recently recovered one of my 4 year old wallets. let me throw you a bone. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:32:08
and then sit on it :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:49:02
It's dropped 6% since you posted this! :D
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:02:13
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:01:18
Ah, thank you. I did not see this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:44:23
the wolves howling to a btc moon is fucking gold.  probably going to be my first btc purchase :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:08:49
awesome! i'm thinking about getting a giant [B]( for my car.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:23:29
that's frightening 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:41:40
good idea
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:40:02
I'm sure the people who care about the ideals of bitcoin would take the precautions necessary, like SR, if people really want something they'll find a way.
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:50:11
someone will find it soon. haha
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:22:00
Thank you so much for this! Now I just need to be able to have all the knowledge to talk about all of those things. Your outline would help if I had a better understand of everything myself. There's so much to learn!

I wonder if he'll let others donate to the prize pool.  Personally I'd love to give .5 or .75 BTC.  This is amazing. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:23:00
this is a beautiful comment
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:54:50
I didn't really attempt to answer either. I would guess that it would crash hard, but it would still retain some value.
@_date: 2013-03-25 07:52:59
i would also like to know this
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:16:22
Well, at this point Joe isn't able to buy beer at the corner store... I think SR is more than enough to give bitcoin worth for quite awhile in the event of outlaw.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:28:18
i can't believe how many people are taking his comments seriously. 
edit: did i miss my cake day for the 3rd time? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:25:48
hey adam
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:22:46
hey man i'm also looking to get coins from them. seems like we have a decent number with them. i have connections with lawyers in my area and i'm going to provide them with this to see where that goes.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:40:34
sweet! make it sexy!
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:26:21
No idea. I'm not interested in making that speculation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:37:08
The ticker just took a shit.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:54:16
Could you give a short outline of what you say to people you're introducing bitcoin too? I've been doing the same but I never say the same thing.  I want to be more clear... I've turned into a btc evangelist (not a needy pushy one), but wish to do it in a better manner.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:17:39
Now, I'm usually not a person to put my input into online discussions, nor am I 100% bitcoin informed but... Say this did happen, how would the government know who is still using bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:51:34
i want to do this now, but my mining.... haha
edit: first cake day i've been around for! woo!
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:03:25
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:28:11
awesome, please get back to us!
@_date: 2013-04-07 06:08:53
I saw a few days ago bitfloor was having some issues.  Is this still the case?

I have different plans :)

"80% of $100 bills go outside the US" 
is this true?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:35:21
What degree are you working on?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:39:34
thank you
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:09:44
OP pls
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:59:59
"..., ok?"
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:02:55
Less fees buying every fourteen days instead of daily?
edit: or maybe i'm misunderstanding and you'd come up with different figures at the end of the year with each method?
edit2: [7]
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:38:07
i bought in march too! :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:49:13
Take some time off!
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:33:57
Sigh, hope I can get my BTC from bitfloor :( they've been holding 8 of my coins for months.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:32:40
how is it easier to get into?
edit: all you people with the whole number complex need to get over it....
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:30:02
ya, this is why i opted for 2,500,000 satoshis
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:48:48
Brothers! I put in 500 at $69, hope you see the same profits!
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:49:42
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:18:52
Seriously... Makes no sense
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:09:06
one of the biggest draws to btc is it's anonymity. by having an account tied to an email you surrender that.

i'd definitely have more incentive to have some coinage ready if i knew what would be available. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:53:16
Poor college student :/ the money I spent on coin was money I could waste at the time.  It was always nice to think about how tight money was and then remember my bitcoins.  I was planning on sitting on them (most of them).  In it for the long haul :/ hope I get something.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:00:07
i'm sitting here at an easy [4] munching on a bag of cheez-it party mix :)
