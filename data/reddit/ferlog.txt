I am/was in a similar position and I can understand your frustration, I had 6 transactions stuck, you could try this 
A lot of reddit users have been able to get their tx accelerated this way, 
this can help you maximize your chances with a basic script.
Neither of them was good enough for me, took me hours with the script to get just 1 of them through.  
I ended up using
Found this on another reddit thread.The man is a true professional, he has been talking to me through the whole process via telegram, letting me know when each tx has been accelerated and confirmed. I am not gonna lie I was hesitant with paying upfront but its arguably the cheapest solution compared to viabtc and btc.com (btc.com wanted 570 usd for all 6 of my tx, while these services were 30 usd per tx)
I am in no way affiliated with any of these site or advertising anything, I am just a guy who lost two days of sleep thinking his tx would be stuck forever sharing my personal experience.

just had 3 windows open with different TX on each, but nothing seemed to happen on the hour, script on chrome just became blank and i got no message, tx id and captcha was gone though. Can't tell if i made it through.
Also, you suggest multiple windows... should i do like 5? 10? 20? how hard is this in general?

Yes i know, those are  the  tx from the bitcoin atm i purchased bitcoin from with cash. I called them and they said there was a problem causing the transactions to be given very low fees. They said they will use an accelerator at 5 USD per tx , which i assume is 
That was 12 hours ago, still nothing on any of those TX.
What can i do?

Glad I could help, check if its just your child transaction being stuck or if  the parent ones are preventing it from going through in the first place! Also some wallets have RBF and CPFP like electrum, maybe you are able to get it unstuck that way. I do not know much about either but there are a lot of posts on this subreddit about both , check them out

Thank you very much for this information by the way, I have been infuriated with how unprofessional those people running the ATM are. Putting insanely low fees to save some money... I will trying on every hour till 6pm central.
Last question how many windows do you suggest? 1 per tx? 10 per tx?

Can i leave my pc open and run this? it seems like i have to do 6 tx, since some of them have parent tx that are also unconfirmed.That would take hours even with luck.

Yes the last one is the one I issued through blockchain before I realised that the parent ones were that low on sat / byte

Is it the free version of the premium one that you are suggesting ?
