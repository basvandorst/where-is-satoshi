While "plebs" might not be the correct and easy to understand term, what I mean by that is the people who are actually going to invest into crypto. The noobs or first-timers if you will. Imo you should care about these plebs because there are the ones who will invest into BTC over BCH, or potentially vice versa. 
Of course people will do their research, but when the price skyrockets and fomo hits in, people just buy whatever they see, in panic. Easily seen by how we skyrocketed to 20k in absolutely zero time. 
What they want? If *they* require you to explain why one is better and or worse than the other, for them to actually buy and get interested in that said coin, wouldn't you stand up and explain to them exactly why they should? 
The BTC vs BCH war will never be won if people chose to stand on the sideline and say "no thanks" while the other side is busy pounding arguments etc. on the first timers. 
Then again, I do agree most people would probably question wtf they are about to buy on the exchange when they see it's only worth like 1/7'ish of the price, but that will still make them aware of it. And since it's **cheaper** they will think "hey, that's also bitcoin but cheaper??" and research into that. Then you won't be there to tell them anything.

Exactly. Which is why I think it's better to inform people what's what, instead of ignoring it and taking to the pitchforks when someone mentions BCH/anything but BTC. 
Well, I wasn't really thinking a couple of days.. I was thinking more like, forever? And update it at a regular basis while answering questions newcomers has? I mean, this subreddit is at almost 1 million subs soon, so I think we both know which of the two shouts loudest. 
Anyway, you're the mod so you do you. I respect your opinion as well, and I do agree that people should be capable of doing their own research. 
But giving out some helping here and there wouldn't hurt, is all I'm saying.

You might be shooting yourself in the foot by doing that, as people confused with what's what will just go to whatever they discover first.
Plebs that just google bitcoin will obviously get the .com site up first, and whoever looks on twitter will get the BCH one there aswell. People who's never heard of crypto before sure as hell doesn't know what BTC or BCH means, let alone "core" and "abc". 
Instead of trying to just "let it die" why not inform people, instead of letting them make up their own mind, which obviously hasn't got a fucking clue how to do that?

Yes, but "the dip" isn't always guaranteed, and even if it is, are you able to buy in at the exact right time? The real question is how long you're going to hold'em for.

Easiest way: Go to coinbase, open up an account, get verified by sending in your info, register your card, buy Bitcoin. 
If you on the other hand, have literal cash, I think you should go to localbitcoins.com and see if there's someone you can meet in person to buy from. 
You also have to set up a wallet to keep your BTC in. I recommend Exodus because it's extremely easy to use and I feel like the developers/owners are good people. I've also heard Electrum is really good. 
**I would never ever** store my crypto's on a phone or on an exchange. You never know what might happen in these early times.

Depends. Do you want to become a millionaire, or do you want some quick money in the next months?
If the first one appeals to you, buy whenever you want, and hold until you hit 1m. BTC will just keep rising in price, and I don't see anything stopping it. My bet is 4500$ or close to, within 2018. 
If you want some quick bucks. Buy  which should come some time next week when people sell off their gains.

No. When you've bought BTC through Coinbase, you transfer those to your wallet. And btw, when you do that, take a look and see how fast it goes. Compare that to a bank transfer these days which take what, 12-48hrs? It's pretty amazing to witness. 
And when they're in your wallet, they won't disappear. 
Nothing within the bitcoin industry at this point won't just "disappear", IMO. Coinbase and Exodus has waaay too much going for them to just bail.

Yeah I might've constructed that comment a bit wrong. Wanted to say "not a lot of cases", and with that said, I've only heard of MtGox so far.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:33:49
Oh I'm not actually betting. I just think it'll be around 4500 at the end of the year.

It's stored on a server as far as I know, heavily encrypted and well secured. I haven't really heard of anyone just "loosing" they're crypto's so far, but if you're nearing a good amount of BTC which you feel uncomfortable to just have stored on a desktop wallet, I would get a Nano Ledger S. Basically a USB-stick which is just like a physical wallet.

Hopefully it'll be a nice sell-off in the coming week and people will have a chance to get on board!

That, is fucking hilarious!

1hr ago, I bought 100$ worth of BTC. Got one email saying it went through, then on my transactions list it said I had bought another at 120$. Few minutes later I got an email saying that 120 order had been canceled. Also said I bought my 100$ at a BTC price of 3500$, so yeah.. I think their system is just suffering some bugs due to high influx of traders atm.
