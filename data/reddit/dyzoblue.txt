So, you are suggesting one set the price in real money, say $2000 per month, and then accept whatever amount of bitcoin equals $2000 each month?
You are making my point for me. Bitcoin isn't real money, it can't be used to negotiate leases. You need real money to do that.

Bitcoin has a maximum transfer rate of 2.7 per second, or about 230,000 per day. If every Greek tried to use it, they'd have to stand in line for 47 days between each purchase.

As someone who has been both a landlord and a renter, I can't imagine agreeing to a lease from either perspective using bitcoin. As a landlord, I wouldn't agree to lease an apt for 5 bitcoins per month for the next year, because I have no idea what 5 bitcoins will be worth in real money a year from now. As a tenant, I'd have the same reasons to reject the concept.
This is why bitcoin isn't real money. You can't use it to form year long contracts. You need real money in order to negotiate leases.

Your best bet is to sell your bitcoin now before it's value drops even further and invest in something that will actually gain value over time. Or just keep it in cash, that is bound to not lose 80% of it's value over the next year.

It's "probably" not that high? Wrong. It is not going to be more than a percent or two. Absolute maximum. It is not "very possible". Only very very stupid people think 80% USD inflation in a year is "possible".

BTW: All it takes is a fork in the code, and that 21 million becomes infinite.

By not buying any, I bet against bitcoin every single day. I've been paying attention to it for about a year now, and I've been winning my bets the whole time.
Odds are very good that Bitcoin will continue to lose value over the next year. Regardless of how bitcoin performs, there is no chance that USD will lose 80% of it's value over the next year.
Let's check in at the next Bitcoin Bowl to see how USD and bitcoin are doing, OK? Oh wait, BitPay is going out of business, so there isn't going to be another Bitcoin Bowl.

Correct. And in order to increase the 2.7 tps rate, most bitcoiners will have to share an opinion. Given the fact that we are talking about a group largely made up of male teenage libertarians, I don't see consensus being an easy thing to achieve.

It is as simple to change as getting everyone involved to accept the change. Which makes it just as easy to change as changing the 21 million cap. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:17:41
Neither is 21 million coins. Changing the block size, or the 21 million cap, are equally trivial and equally difficult. All that is needed to do either is get every bitcoin exchange to go along with the change.
I find it odd how bitcoiners claim the 21 million is carved in stone, but the block size is totally flexible. They are both identical in flexibility.
And if people like Mircea Popescu have their way, neither is ever going to change:

The law of supply and demand says you are wrong. We are increasing the supply of bitcoin by $1 Million worth each day. That means an extra $1 Million worth of demand has to be added each day to hold the price point.
If we weren't adding that $1million worth of coins each day, the extra demand that is currently coming in would be increasing the price.
Likewise, if demand weren't increasing each day, the price would be falling.
The new coins are absolutely costing the bitcoin community $1 million dollars a day. And what do they get for that? They get 2.7 transactions per second, or one transaction for every $4.

I just pointed out 2.7 transactions per second, $1 million USD miner payout. Try the math, maybe I'm wrong.


Right, by using a centralized off-chain system that isn't bitcoin.
So why not just use USD? As long as it is an off chain system, what is the advantage of making it Bitcoin?

And the mining reward is paid for by everyone who owns bitcoins as a collective. It is the cost of running the bitcoin system—a system which can handle a maximum of 2.7 transactions per second.
Which means bitcoiners, as a whole, are paying at least $4 for every transaction that takes place on the block chain.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:08:54
The whole bitcoin system can only handle 2.7 transactions per second. And that system comes at a cost of $1 million USD per day (the miner payout). That's $4 per transaction.
In what way is bitcoin good for small transactions?

@_date: 2015-03-17 22:44:41


Yes, there is a hard limit of 2.7 transactions per second. And I linked to the mathematical reasons why. It doesn't matter how many miners are mining, it is a function of the size of the blocks in the block chain.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:01:15




Look, the bitcoin community pays miners $1 million a day to keep the system running. In return, the bitcoin community gets around 250K transactions from that mining system.
You can try to obscure those facts all you want, but any business person will tell you that means the community is paying $4 per transaction.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:27:15
Each day the supply of bitcoin increases by 3600 which are given to the miners. Each day, that increase in supply costs the community who hold bitcoin a million dollars. In exchange for that million dollars, the bitcoin holding community is allowed a combined maximum of 250K transactions.
I really can't make this any simpler for you. (And I'm starting to think you are trolling me, because hidden costs aren't a complicated subject matter.)

[Actually, it is 2.7 transactions per second, not 7.]( So if there were 10 million bitcoin users, each one would only get to make 8 purchases per year. Thank goodness bitcoin will never be adopted by that many users.
