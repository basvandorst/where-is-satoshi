I have now, and personally I still rather not be the person who laughs at other people's perceived misfortune.

even when you know it's wrong?

I'm a full stack web developer, I'll provide as much useful feedback as I can in terms of UI/UX and whatever resources I can sniff out on your site.
I also have many devices on hand I can test with.

I just recently launched [ELI5 Bitcoin]( as an informational site for beginners.
Next  is another site that covers advanced topics such as multi sig, cold storage, P2SH, BIP38, etc.
After that, I plan to come up with some service similar to purse, but not amazon related.

thought of a future use case scenario.
If you're Amazon, and you already have a lot of supply chain tasks being done by robots, wouldn't it be possible to eventually go 100% automated with the internet of things?
A customer places an order, drones/robots in the warehouse will be notified and already know if the item is in stock, which exact model, where it is , etc. It retrieves the product(s), places it in packaging where it gets shipped out for delivery by a drone.
All this without a human worker needed. Faster, and more efficient, and cheaper (no wages).
