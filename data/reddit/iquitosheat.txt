Yes, because the products would likely be the fruits of slave labor. They actually set up a "high-end" slave labor camp, for the well-behaved slaves, called [Kaesong]( South Korean companies "paid"  North Koreans to work around $400/mo. to there, although they probably only got to keep around $100. Knowing this, the owners would smuggle in things like Choco-Pie snacks. This became so popular that for a while, South Korean Choco-pies were used as a sort of proto-currency in the north. 
The only way (we little people) can support the North Korean people in their fight against the evil dictatorship is to not give the dictator money, and help smuggle information in, and people out.

Could you elaborate? I don't understand. What makes all the others not real?

If everyone else is on another chain, you don't need to worry about accepting transactions, because there won't be any, right?

Source? There is absolutely no way to quantify that. In fact, the only metric we have is very clear: nobody wants to mine 1x (&lt;10% support). 
I can prove that, whereas all you can do is make baseless conspiracy theories.

Isn't Segwit2x just exactly the same thing as bitcoin, but with 1 constant changed? It seems a little unfair to put it in the same league as POScoin and BitCrystals.

I don't understand. What's a Wells Fargo Lightning Hub? What does that have to do with Bitcoin and Blockstream? I thought Blockstream was just paying some developers to enhance bitcoin itself?

Please support BCH!
Now you can't say that anymore.

So you're saying it's hard to find total strangers to gamble millions of dollars with?
Cool story.
 &gt; The fact that they're not going for it demonstrates that they have no such confidence.
You've used conjecture to make this point, because you have no real data. The only data we have (miners actually MINING blocks with intention signaled) says your wrong. I'll be the first to admit, "you might be right", however at this point, you don't have facts on your side. Sorry. 
The fact you can't find people to do your public quazi-legal gambling scheme with proves nothing.

We're talking about a slave state. You can see the slave labor camps [from google maps]( You can hate Trump and his sanctions, but it's morally reprehensible to give money to anyone trying to profit from the misery of the North Korean people. Not giving money to the people responsible for such evil is the least we can do.

No, I'm only interested in doing this with Greg. Honestly, I think he doesn't actually have the bitcoin, despite his position. I'd be surprised if he had more than 10BTC.

Every exchange, save Localbitcoins, I've ever used offers at least Etherum and Litecoin. Most offer more than this. And LBC operates basically like craigslist with escrow, so people can easily use it to exchange more than simply BTC-Fiat.
