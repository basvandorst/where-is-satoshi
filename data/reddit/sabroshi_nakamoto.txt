Imagine being banned for 7 days for telling people to buy Bitcoin.   That is my sentence from r/CryptoCurrency for telling people in the daily to buy Bitcoin.   
How shameful is that?

This drop needs to happen quick - so I can buy more.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:29:49
is the prophecy right, $9200 for July?   We came close earlier with 9600...but looks like we might be going lower.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:03:43
well considering the stock market is tanking, Deutchebank clientele is withdrawing something like $1 billion/daily lately.... there's several reason that can be linked as causation to this recent bloodbath.
Not to mention the prophecy.

9 minutes.  Any leak(s) on what is forthcoming?
@_date: 2019-07-16 04:48:26
150,000 - 3,000,000

I love waking up to buying the dip in the morning.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:20:05
lol - Mnuchin did not announce anything new.  Just reiterated that current regulations are in place to protect investors, etc...   White nationalists love BTC apparently.  Libra is bad.   
This is definitely bullish for BTC in my humble opinion.

What a great day to be a maximalist.

Let's hope they are much higher.  I hope to be retired by then.

Willy Woo is correct and he is wrong.
Correct:  BTC will have a 1T+ Marketcap
Wrong:  Woo claims it will happen in 2023;  It will happen before January 1st, 2023.

i'm sure it is but the administration sucks at clarity
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:43:16
Ah, Good old FDR setting up the rich banks - then 11 years later, the real nail in the coffin, the Bretton-Woods Agreement.   
That is until Bitcoin came along to play spoiler alert to the super rich's yacht parties.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:25:40
We need to get over this resistance or we will consolidate again at lower prices.  
Which we should be buying if that scenario plays out.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:44:09
New investors are misinformed - we both understand this.  However, the question is, what is being done to change the misunderstanding that potential investors have?   As stupid as it may seem, BTC outreach programs are needed - in the sense people just need to educate the non-coiners and explain to them what it is, how it works and then show them the pro's of BTC over fiat, then let them make their decisions.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:30:39
Do not become married to it.  If the intent it to trade to make money, do not question your calls if you have done the proper analysis on what pricing points to buy/sell at.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:00:57
Bear being bullish - irony.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:24:44
It is a nice offramp from BTC to crypto payment options - fee/speed wise.  Other than that, I keep my BTC.

**I AM GOING TO HOLD BITCOIN TIL I DIE**
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:08:04
I find the opposite to be true - It feels like fall 2017 around here, with more and more people asking about or talking about BTC and cryptocurrencies in general.

It's the solution for the global crisis

Depends what side you are on.  Is BTC the next viable store of value option?  If so, who cares about the TPS.   If you want BTC to be a payment option, then the Lightning Network solves the 7 tps limitation - as more nodes come online.
I have posted about this before, but in order for LN to be viable, companies like Casa need to develop even more user friendly plug and play nodes and someone needs to develop a merchant payment LN set up (I think there's a few companies in the midst of doing this) and begin to market it to their clients and potential clients.  Once businesses see they can set up on the LN and pay a fraction of the fee in relation to VISA/Credit Cards, it will be a no brainer for them to make the switch (at minimum, add the option).  
Ripple does nothing for the space other than help the banks infiltrate it.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:20:31
When can i pay my bills via LN, that is my question.

That is because you are smart and do what you should....buy.   Buying high or low will not matter in the end - unless you are talking whale money.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:14:35
You should lead off with the fact you need to copy the bitcoin symbol from somewhere first...then go into the how to.

Has Craig ever mentioned Hal Finney as a close companion?
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:38:00
They do not possess all of the gold. Country reserves do hold the most percentage wise - and i am sure countries are plotting trajectories on how long it would take to buy in a solid position in BTC to potentially manipulate it as well to save fiat.  
Honestly I think their time has passed though, with the amount of BTC in play - and the OG whales are not selling the bulk of their BTC anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:03:34
Yes.  If you are worried, use a VPN like someone else mentioned

Apple killing it these days with innovation I see.
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:49:08
Great for the hopium addicts - but I doubt we see BTC over 15,000 by end of this year.  We all need to be patient, accrue as much BTC as we can before the halving and enjoy the ride into 2021-2022.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:10:30
Very nice - glad to see some countries moving forward with adoption quicker than others.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:02:06
Best advice, as there are no real user friendly/popular ways to get the mainstream to pay in BTC - yet.
@_date: 2019-06-05 22:39:31
Hard to complain about an app when all they support is BTC.   You do not need anything else.

Bitcoin is the future....even Pat Sajak is getting on board.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:33:08
How so?   When the next significant correction comes and Bitcoin is under 7k, what will it feel like then?
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:13:23
No problem - just offering constructive criticism as I followed the steps and thought that was out of place as I went along.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:29:43
Depends what the originator defines a bear market as.  We have definitely seen bear cycles with BTC - as it cycles through the prices on it way up.

Exactly.   The "crypto" experts on MSNBC or whatever channel are not helping with this process at all and our "conferences" are by large, lacking the professional environment.  I have attended a few that seem to be more a long the lines of a niche, comicon, weirdo convention vs. something productive for BTC or the space as a whole.  
We really need to step our game up and start putting our best foot forward - including the people that represent this space on TV.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:33:50
That is pretty smart.  Legal and no end of revenue.

Warren is smart as people give him credit for.  He just took a lot of risks that paid off more than they have failed.  Such as most wealthy individuals.

Do people really think UBI is the answer to any of the U.S.'s issues?

Downvoted for speaking the truth, rubbish.  I agree, everyone should be buying the dips.  Is not that what we are trained to do?

Apply for a position that your education/experience might potentially entice an employer to hire you.  It is that simple.

Incase you were wondering who they were:


@_date: 2019-06-07 15:12:41
That's one take of what could happen - more of the bearish take.  The other take is by 2022, BTC should easily cruise to 100k range, just purely based on it's historical trends.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:57:02
Those fines look appealing to the masses who think that is a large sum of money - yet they do not realize the amount of money these banks steal/generate on a yearly basis.  
In ten years, the concept of a bank will be a heavily secured physical location to store BTC wallets for old people.

There is some beautiful seaside golf courses in Bulgaria.  Beautiful country.

good luck with the research.  You should probably clarify what you define to be an "early adopter" though.  Just a thought.

Fear typically does not bold well for those wanting to make money.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:28:53
Definitely.  Moved on from petty drug sales to having people develop complex trading bots to help them control the price of BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:35:44
I do think most of them are wiser/older and understand the magnitude of BTC and what it is bringing into this space.  I do not think they want to dump it so hard that it will just scare everyone away - but they want to keep it reasonably price for awhile before ramping it up to numbers most of us speculate it to be at one day.

I will gladly sell my gold to an Australian for a premium - I will take that money and buy more BTC.
