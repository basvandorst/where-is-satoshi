Just be careful, as I’m sure you know, you can lose a lot of money really fast if you mis-time things on Margin trading!

They offer margin trading so you need to deposit funds in their account and, if your margin drops under 50% you get a margin call and need to deposit more funds or they close your position. Given current BTC volatility they may not offer x5 leverage (they change what they will accept all the time based on market conditions )

Honestly who knows, but I’m guessing a drop after 10k just because of the sheer symbolism of it.. and who know what will happen once BTC futures start being traded next month - that should act as a magnifying effect on market sentiment, so maybe bigger highs and bigger drops.
Or maybe it will just keep going up.
Nobody knows

Up til now here hasn’t been an effective way to ‘short’ BTC - ie to sell coins you don’t own in the expectation of being able to buy them back at a cheaper price once the contract is due for payment. When BTC Futures contracts start, large institutional investors can effectively take bets on BTC either going up or going down - this should have a magnifying effect on BTC prices - or bigger rises and bigger drops. No-one yet knows what the true impact will be
