If you set that fixed amount to the exact same amount of total interest what the fuck do compounds matter?  
I have taken a bunch of accounting and financial math classes where amortizing a loan was a part of the course. 
For example, lets say that I get a five year (60 monthly payments) loan for $20,000 to buy a car, at 5% interest that is $2,645.48 total interest for monthly payments of $377.42.
In an Islamic country I could just charge that same fee of $2,645.48 for a loan and the payments would be the exact same.

I would say that is the major difference. As far as it keeps building up, like I said you could charge late payment fees that are equal to whatever the accrued interest would be.

but he didn't turn a million into a billion.  He inherited tons of real estate that was worth hundreds of millions. Property in NYC, where prices inflated like crazy.  
Not bothered enough to look for proof, but I am pretty sure Trump actually performed well below market averages, if he had liquidated all his stuff and put it in an account earning 5% interest he would have done better.

You could charge a late payment fee.  Is that what you mean by interest on top of interest?? Missing a payment? Because it is pretty basic math to amortize a loan and see what the exact amount of interest paid will be.

Sure you could sell it on your own for market value, but that means having to find a buyer.  
The concept of buying and selling you lay out also applies to stocks, but with stocks you have the bid-ask spread.  The bid price is the price that a broker would buy a stock for, the ask price is the price the broker sells a stock for. The ask price is generally always higher than the bid price, creating the bid-ask spread.
Sell your gold shops have to turn some profit, if they bought and sold at market price they are doing work for free.
