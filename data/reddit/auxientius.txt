I was able to grab 38.8 coins. My first experiences with bitcoin this last week  have been a rollercoaster.

Good point....printing now

Oh right I see, I am new to Bitcoins (4 days or so now) and I have read a bit about MtGox but didn't really know what (may have) happened.  Interesting stuff.

Likewise, there are almost none in my country.  Guess looking at other options now.

Yes, from what I understand, Bitcoin was actually originally banned in Thailand but now it is restricted to trading in local currency only, foreign exchange is illegal.  Is this enforceable in the BTC world?  Prostitution is illegal here, too.

I think people missed the "at this point" in your statement.
@_date: 2014-10-22 05:41:18
Very compelling argument!

I live in Thailand, and Bitcoin is growing here fast, particularly with local foreigners who are wanting to send money back home to their families (i.e. Philippines) and have many, many issues.  What does it take to enable this to use different currencies?  I would be interested in purchasing quite a few of these and spreading them around.

It's funny, 24 hours ago I was wondering if this would work, how complex it would be, risks etc. - now I'm sitting here with my money successfully moved without any hassle at all, and actually have a little bit left over due to the exchange rate difference for the BTC in the destination currency.  
This is really really cool.
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:34:49
Ahh, I see.  What classifies as a lot of money?
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:00:26
Can you recommend any good offline wallets?
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:32:39
What stops someone from selling coins to themselves in large numbers in an effort to alter the price artificially?
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:28:02
Which AML regulations?  The place I purchase coins with?
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:21:26
Cheers, I managed to successfully move about triple that without hassle into two separate countries.  It was surprisingly easy, and actually fun playing with the buying part of the markets.
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:46:34
Haha funny you mention that, I actually threw in more cash than I needed expecting to lose out on the exchange somehow given it was my first experience.  So, since it went quite well, I have 4 coins to play with now in the Thai exchange, which is quite fun actually!
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:19:10
That's a really good idea!
@_date: 2014-10-21 08:24:26
 
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:26:11
Outstanding, thank you for your help!
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:05:18
What if the owner of the exchange itself is the one doing it?
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:32:47
The results look pretty conclusive to me.
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:29:02
Ideally I would be trading as quickly as possible, looking at trends while it does vary somewhat day to day, it does not seem like a huge jump.  How quickly can you realistically trade?  I guess it depends on the provider?
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:49:25
[Das ist good!](
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:01:42
That was a really interesting read, I learned quite a lot from that.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:26:15
So because I use Apple I can't use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:51:40
I learned two new words today!
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:58:58
MERRILY CONTINUE!
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:21:39
That doesn't hold any relevance at all.
@_date: 2015-11-03 09:52:01
Haha yeah I live in Bangkok, a LOT of advertising uses the Bitcoin logo and even the coin itself on advertising everywhere.  That's going to get confusing soon...
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:03:51
Oh they do, but the sudden increase in a similar looking currency sign they can copy off the internet means it gets used more.
