I'm OK with that. I've never been much of a wordsmith.

The "you aren't authorized" message goes away not that long after signing up. The login in acts funny at first too but it fixes after awhile too.
I hope your wrong about something going on over there. But I don't have any information to counter you with.

I dont know anything about you but a lot of beginning investors have this attitude. Then they lose their entire investment. No big deal you learned more than you lost. But then they do it again and again and again and before they realize it they are 5 years older and still have no good wealth built. I did this myself and want to help as many people as possible avoid the same. But other than that bitcoin is way more fun than the real world I dont want to go back

Didn't they say they were confiscating bitcoin form all active accounts to pay for the server upgrade?
EDIT: nope

The bots would lose money on the spread even if they did have predictive power.
It looks like the bots are being used for a more dubious reason.
Source: My senior design project was an automated forex trading bought that had predictive power but couldn't beat the spreads on much more liquid markets.

I can't either, I'm a bit nervous as to where my profile went

I'm an investment advisor. It will not double every 6 months. For the love of all that is holy please do not quit your job yet. You can't really retire with your money still in something as volatile as bitcoin. So you need to do the math with the money you have in something that probably gives you less income.

I didn't say it can't happen. I said it won't happen. It's more of a "big numbers" thing. Even if bitcoin is worth $1 trillion It will take awhile for that much money to flow in. Look at AAPL last year. The stock was easily worth $2000 by any conservative value model. By any normal growth model it was worth 10's of thousands per share. It "could" have gone that high because all of it's competitors did but there wasn't 4+ trillion USD that could move into it. They simply didn't exist. Eventually  bitcoin will reach it's true value. Luckily speculation allows this to happen quickly. Once bitcoin reaches it's true value it will simply appreciate at the rate of inflation. The only way for it to appreciate above inflation is for it's utility to increase. This is what happened in housing. Housing was increasing faster than inflation because having a roof over your head has a perceived value that is greater than holding a dollar. But eventually housing was brought back to reality because a house is a house not an infinite money making machine. Same thing with bitcoin eventually it is going to be a bitcoin. This will happen in your lifetime.

Or because it's easy to curve fit anything and the more complicated your model is the worst the curve fitting and curve fitting kills time-series prediction and anyone this smart should freaking know that.

You sir are too educated, I feel a bond. Yipee for depressive realism.

Anyone can give investment advice. People make remarks like this all the time. Even extremely wealthy, well respected, and successful traders make really dumb comments about valuations on TV all the time. Just watch CNBC for 5 minutes.

If I remember correctly it was actually a pretty successful scam

lol, holy shit

Think about how many people are trying to trade bitcoin. Then consider the statistical distribution of their "perfectness". Math, Statistics, and the Universe would probably implode if at least several people did not accidentally do it perfectly.

More than one person was selling. Millions of USD were flying across the exchange all day. It was probably just guys jumping ship instead of trying to force the price down.
