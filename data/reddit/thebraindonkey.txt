could you please sell so it will go back up? Thanks!

Stop talking. You are interrupting my grip strength training on the sides of my desk.

I could get behind this concept. Stop talking  in terms of dollars, we should now price bitcoin as a value of pizzas.

While most can easily claim significant "wrongs" from their past, very few can claim true and inarguable "rights". Congrats of being one of the few who do in fact at least try to make the world a better place. High five.

Wow. BC just jumped a bunch of level with that. I too am suspicious, but I am trying to figure out how... lol

If they regulate it, they validate it.
They don't, so they can later claim it is illegal when it is found be used for something they deem terrible because some congress person got offended or is making a name for them self.

Probably the deployment script has a typo in it. /s
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:43:58
Thanks! I will take your word for it. Username checks out.

Ho lee shit. I wish I could find my old one. I had about ten 50's and was at the time like that was cool, meh, then forgot about them. I could use 50 grand, need a new roof and some plumbing done, lol

Thanks! Thats what I thought, but Jesus this tx is taking forever to get even 1. I will consume more relaxing substances and watch the news which should overshadow my worry about my BTC...

LOL. I just read that and honestly was like "why have I not heard of these?". I need more fucking coffee. Have yer uptick.

Probably. But I just meant 1000 is so long that either we won’t be recognizable as us anymore, we will be gone as a species because of war, or all those things will be so out of ancient that best case you could become rich from them being antiques.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:48:18
I wasn't meaning evolve naturally. I meant if you look at the rate of technology and science progression, we won't be recognizable as a species in 1k years. 1000 years ago we just cut off body parts. Today, we replace them with cybernetics and such. Yea I wast clear, but you got there anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:05:31
Yea... I am utterly shocked. This state is normally so close minded and slow. This is way bigger than I think people are realizing.

Hatchet and gun still applies, because after a couple days of that level of goody two shoe-ery, a murder spree will seem normal. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:53:45
hehe agree with all of that. 1000 years of technology evolution (if we survive it) will be so insane IMO that you probably would just stroke out when you arrive. if you look at the tech progression, it is exponentially advancing, at least in spurts. 50 years ago, we sent the most advanced piece of tech to the moon ever made. this year you can buy a phone that can simulate that entire mission, while playing games, while talking on it (when it actually works as a phone for once) and all the while collecting more metrics and data about your environment every minute, than probably the moon landings did in a day. Thats nuts.
I wish I could see it, if we make it as a species. That would be amazing I think.

Agree 100 on the other hand, hatchet and gun. Gotta fight the mutants somehow.
Edit commas are hard

Shorthand for bullshit?
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:41:40
SHhhhhhhhhh. You will scare it away!!!!

I would suggest writing it on the 100,000 Philippine Peso printed in 1998. It's about the size of a legal page, so you won't need as many pages.

It was My Fault. Im like Midas, but with Lead.
I bought at exactly the high point (147) and then it went to shit.
