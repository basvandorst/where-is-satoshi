Wait, so you're calling this guy a complete scumbag and yet as pig as he gives you some back (not gonna happen, btw) you'd be willing to write a glorious review, essentially helping him rip off other people?
You're just as bad as him. You got got. Don't fuck over other people just to get your hundred bucks back.  
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:47:20
What, one for the past five hundred?
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:00:07
Ahhh I see what you mean now. That's much better :)
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:31:37
This is Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-12-21 11:28:28
Just search "bitcoin qt debug console" and you'll figure it out.
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:07:32
So do something about it
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:37:26
You can open up the debug console and use the command dumpprivkey, then import it into a light wallet like Electrum.

Everyone is hating on you right now but I think it's very nature to own up to your mistakes like this.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:22:31
Anyone with half a brain knew it was a scam.
Obviously some didn't, but I think a fair percentage of BTCS&amp;T investors knew it was a ponzi and were just banking on getting out before it collapsed.
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:30:03
Bullshit. If you bought on fundamentals and potential then you wouldn't be selling 10 months later. Your buy and sell decisions were completely based on price and your expectations of its future movement.
@_date: 2014-10-28 23:24:33
They just asked me to do an app for them a week or two ago, so I'd say there's a very low likelihood that this is a scam of any sort.
I talked to Andreas a few times. Real stand-up guy. I highly doubt there is anything malicious going on here.

The date is September 19, 2014.
The current price of Bitcoins is ~$400.

Check out Gridcoin and Curecoin.
I'm not sure if they actually work as intended or are secure since I haven't researched them much, but there are certainly people out there who are attempting to execute your idea.
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:30:39
Proud of it? Glad about it?
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:14:21
You sure about that one? $1 = ~8 CNY
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:22:10
Take a step outside yourself for a second and realize that these types of posts are highly bullish. Once the suckers finally commit and make a move (in either direction) it's time for the trend to reverse.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:39:10
Maybe my post came off wrong. I didn't mean to imply that you didn't deserve reimbursement (did I say anything of the sort?). I was just saying that you only lost a few days worth of work... Which in the grand scheme of things isn't the worst thing to ever happen.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:25:13
That number is **heavily inflated**, because it accounts for the sum total of all balances unpaid, which includes the absurdly high compound interest which was never really attainable. Lots of people put in 50 BTC, had their balance "multiply" itself a few times, and then receive nothing. Doesn't mean that pirateat40 ever really had those coins.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:58:25
Try Laos or Vietnam. It'd be upwards of 10k kip/dong for a coffee.
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:42:07
Really? I have found it completely unusable on my mobile device. You can't scroll or zoom at all.
@_date: 2014-08-03 11:38:09
$0.60? That's less than most people would spend in has driving to meet someone on LocalBitcoins. Where I live the closest person buying BTC is 20 minutes away (under market rate I should add). The closest ATM is walking distance. So they are saving me time and money.
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:44:31
You said you needed $400 more which you make in a day or two. So you make $200 a day. You lost $600. So it's really not a huge deal for you. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:06:01
The dark green would work just fine.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:31:42
I'm hesitant because I would like to have to option to monetize it or sell it in the future. 
I have opened the source code for the encryption/decryption of API keys. That can be found here: 
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:40:58
No, look up the term "limit order book." Essentially the people bidding the highest get to buy first and the people asking for the lowest get to sell first.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:23:31
Oh man, this is great news. Anyone who was around back in August 2012 will remember that day. $15 seemed high at the time and it just dropped like a rock when the news hit.
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:16:46
Nice! I've been saying they should add that for months!
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:32:16
RX-8, zoom zoom!!
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:26:58
The date is September 19, 2014.
The current price of Bitcoins is ~$400.

I was arguing your, just saying that "glad of it" threw me off.
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:12:59
You can already trade all Kraken currency pairs on Android with zTrader.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:58:38
Actually, that's not entirely true. At one point SR banned the sales of weapons and created a separate site called The Armory.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:16:55
I'm pretty sure that the announcement read: "To make it clear: Selling weapons on the Silk Road is 100% banned."
So yes, I believe they banned it.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:50:24
So what's the point of the trezor?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:12:39
Wtf? Did he say anywhere in his comment that BTC needs to outperform all other investments?
There is a systemic problem in the Bitcoin community where everyone assumes that the price needs to skyrocket. I'm glad the price is going down so that we can flush out this new generation of get rich quick people. 
10% per year would be fantastic.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:30:54
Bitcoin's startup/IPO happened long ago. I got in at $2. I'm sorry that other people convinced you to be an "early adopter." We're already at a several billion dollar market cap.
Lesson to be learned here: don't listen to people on the internet, especially when they are telling you how you can make money.
I saw your posts on BitcoinMarkets.
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:08:51
Which I then sell from my balance...
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:46:15
No, but I have a large amount of friends who don't have Coinbase accounts (whose new accounts would lie dormant) who would gladly take a percentage of $75 for free.
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:11:22
This sounds very exploitable...
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:57:53
Then I'll be really happy too. But I won't be nearly as upset if we're down 50% again.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:24:42
Well... I guess it is life-changing to get your net worth chopped in half in just one year.
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:43:11
Better yet you can simply have a reference to the private key memorized.
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:09:10
Eh, what you're talking about is still the get-rich-quick mentality.
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:02:15
Go back to the post from a year ago by the same OP as this thread. Same mentality. He lost 50%.
@_date: 2015-09-13 04:20:47
Sure, if you ignore one giant fact...
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:35:35
Oh, sorry. I can see how 


was completely implied by


How did I miss that?
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:47:57
I'll bite.
There are some actions that are objectively less responsible than other actions.
Putting 90% of your money into one asset fits that definition.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:39:14
Finally, the get-rich-quick mentality of the BTC community is dying. 
Someone get me a wooden stake.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:45:02
Ouch. This is painful to read...
Sorry, just being honest.
@_date: 2015-09-12 15:52:28
Well this is just nonsense...
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:35:30
He could have gotten 2x the coins if he'd waited a year though.
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:24:50
Assuming that just because sentiment is low that it's a good time to buy is very dangerous. Look at the results of OP from a year ago if you want proof. He was thinking the same thing (blood on the streets, buy) and still got rekt.
@_date: 2015-10-30 13:32:06
I very clearly remember a long post he made in the SR forums in 2012. Every day, he thought about the possibility that he could get caught and spend the rest of his life in prison. He said he had reconciled with that fact and was ready to accept that fate, should it happen. Very heavy stuff.
@_date: 2015-10-15 06:55:37
They bought high and sold low, or missed an opportunity to buy low. Simple as that.
