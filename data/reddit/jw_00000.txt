Or maybe the other way around: first publish them so they're open to public review, and only deploy them afterwards?

You can't create a self post and add a link too. When you submit something to Reddit, it's either a link (title + link, no description text) OR a self post (title + text, no link).
So edit your post and add a link in the description text to whatever you're talking about. And try to actually state your problem/question in that text too.

Uhm... only the subreddits you're subscribed to show up on your frontpage. For visitors who aren't logged in a default set of subreddits shows up. So if you create an empty subreddit and don't link to it from somewhere, no-one will find it...

This is what I also heard. Also, if you want to know whether your Gmail account was hacked, in Gmail, at the bottom of the page, it says:


If you click the Details link, you get a list of the IPs which last logged in into your account, and the time and date this happened. By checking this list, you can see if your Gmail account was effectively broken into.

Ah OK... That would work, if he wouldn't check that you're upvoting the post he submitted.
