The PSA mentions two suspected attack vectors: (1) DNS poisoning, (2) BGP hijacking.  
(1) DNS poisoning: When you put "[wallet.trezor.io]( in your browser's URL bar, your computer will ask a DNS server "what IP address does [wallet.trezor.io]( correspond to?".  That DNS server will likely defer to other DNS servers to find the answer, and all of these servers may cache results.  An attacker who has hijacked some server involved in the chain of lookups could have it return an IP address corresponding to a server under their control.  [  
(2) BGP hijacking.  Say your computer's DNS query came back with a legitimate IP address for [wallet.trezor.io](  Your computer will then send data packets there, and those data packets will be routed across the internet via various "routers".  Each of these hops maintains a "routing table" describing how to send packets to the next hop.  These routing tables are updated via a protocol called BGP.  BGP allows one peer to "advertise" itself to another as being able to handle traffic for some segment of IP addresses.  Unfortunately, there's very little security built into this system and some peers will blindly trust advertisements from others and update their routing tables accordingly.  So, BGP can be used to hijack and reroute internet traffic.   [
