If she's suggesting this is some rule (not sure why exactly as most businesses use bitpay or coinbase as a bitcoin to cc proxy too) then all of her transactions have to be only to businesses that take bitcoin directly (hint most don't and won't).
I'm not a fan of anyone making rules for an article then breaking them whenever they feel like it. I mean of course she researched this prior to doing it.
I mean she's choosing to move into a crackhouse (she already has see her twitter) with bitcoins than rent a hotel room with bitcoins or use billpayforcoins.com to pay her rent. That doesn't sound like it's heading in a good or sane direction any real world bitcoin user would make. She's making it much harder than it needs to be.

I respectfully disagree. If they accept bitcoins then they so should she. P2P. Why create artificial limits on how or who to spend her bitcoins with? 
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:53:20
No she didn't she could have used  to pay her rent or even use  and just rent a room indefinitely.

More than abit it's insane when there's an EASY OPTION TO PAY RENT WITH BITCOIN.
She claims she has already moved maybe next time she'll google alittle harder before resorting to crack...houses.

She's not a layperson. She's supposed to be a respected journalist who apparently decided instead of paying her rent with  that moving into a crackhouse was a better idea.
I'm not sure how many layperson's would make her choice.

...And I have officially moved into a new home that accepts Bitcoin as rent. It's a renovated crackhouse... still being renovated."
Not sure how this helps her professionalism...if it's a joke it's an atrocious one for a Forbes writer if it's real she needs to fire her realtor...

The correct answer was no.
But the timing of things can make one wonder as this was posted May 5 2013 and only 4 days earlier on May 1 2013
" Who needs Bitcoin coffee when you can get Silk Road cocaine? "
Are there any rehab clinics taking bitcoin yet? Now THERE'S an untapped bitcoin market.

Why hasn't she used BitSpend.net yet? She can order from any website with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:17:55
Right? Well I'm asking you since you brought it up.
Can you quote me where she said she's not using any bitcoin proxies? TKS.
It's not the weirdest thing she's moved into a crackhouse according to her Twitter. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:34:15
"still being renovated" to quote her word for word.
"...has chickens on the roof, and got hot water six months ago (phew!). Communal showers....."
Sounds pretty bad to me (don't get me wrong I love hot water and cooked chickens...not so much showering with abunch of strangers) and WHY would anyone advertise moving to a crackhouse (current, former, future)?
Did you have to share your showers with everyone in the building?

Hey Kash instead of living in a crackhouse (not sure who's idea that was but it's just bizarre) just get a hotel.
Owned by the same group as the PizzaforCoins.com website you ordered pizza from.
Or pay your rent with billpayforcoins.com unless you really feel moving into a crackhouse is a "better" idea.
Or better yet fly to another state or country that has more mainstream bitcoin users like Germany.
NOW THAT WOULD BE A BITCOIN ARTICLE WORTHY OF FORBES.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:25:25
100% agree. Except for the last part. I would find it shocking she didn't research it beforehand I mean she IS supposed to be a journalist right?
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:42:54
Then why would she do the opposite and order from PizzaforCoins.com? Not to mention  They are just a bitcoin to cc ordering proxy just like BitSpend.net. The ONLY difference is PizzaforCoins.com just does pizza places...that do not accept bitcoins...while Bitspend will order from any website including pizza places just like PizzaforCoins.com

You lost all interest and respect when you decided to move into a crackhouse instead of using  to pay your rent with bitcoins.
Seriously are you ok? Because no sane person would do that.

Use bitinstant and send them directly to your wallet. Don't use Mt GOX. Promote bitcoin decentralization.

It won't end well.
