Instead of eating, I try getting calories in. Sugary drinks, gatorade, that Muscle Milk stuff.

If you're legit asking, I saw them on the Pandora and Agora markets.

Maybe you can buy a sense of humor with bitcoins. 
 I'd imagine that at this point any bitcoin &amp;  illegal association activities are already as formed as they're gonna be, and people still seem to be using Btc. 
Besides the only people who will regularly see these pills are the people intent on selling or taking them. I doubt that'll do much "brand damage"

This year's good pills are the dominos and the bitcoins. Supermans if those are still around. 
(I'm sure all the people who come to this sub just to talk bitcoin are horrified at all the drugsy talk happening!)

Okay, buying it from a dude in the bathroom is obviously a poor idea. 
But if there's one thing we have decades of evidence to, it's that banning outright doesn't work *at all.* The better thing would be education.

Ugh, first SR now this. Can I submit dark markets to the BBB?

You're preaching to the choir, I used to do that till a shitty pill gave me an awful weekend. The issue is bad pills are a "that only happens to other people" problem until you get whacked. 
It's easy to purchase home test kits, and online vs from rando sketchy is WAY less a gamble. 
It's just people don't do that, and it's hard to get word out about "hey try this for your own health and safety" when any drug talk is so taboo.
