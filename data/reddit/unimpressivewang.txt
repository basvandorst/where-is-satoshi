Kai-wun is providing the best advice here. Right now, all your eggs are in the same basket. Read the sidebar of r/personalfinance and find out what to do with a windfall of cash. Learn about emergency funds, retirement accounts and how they can provide a historically safe return, and asset diversification. I was a teenager during the financial crisis and I understand the distrust of financial instruments rampant in this subreddit, but I also understand that money invested in a diversified portfolio immediately before the financial crisis has by now doubled in value.
Also realize that you will have to pay taxes on the income you receive when you sell. You have big kid amounts of money to handle here, and need to take the steps to get big kid financial knowledge. 
By all means, keep a bit of bitcoin in an extremely safe wallet as a long term crypto investment, but realize that diversification will keep you from losing it all. Diversification will in fact help you grow your money long term while providing reasonable assurance that it won't disappear.
