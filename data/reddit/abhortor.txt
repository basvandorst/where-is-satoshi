What if coinbase goes under? How do I keep my bitcoins safe from something like that as well? Should I open an account in gdax?

Yea but it costs like 10-15% of fees to buy and sell right? Or just to buy? If it's for both, someone who bought at that price if 10k would only break even now.

How do I control the keys to that wallet? I just use coinbase's bitcoin wallet. Every time I make an exchange, it changes the wallet number. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:48:20
That and every bank account anyone has.

Why did coinbase lose top spot? Was it because fees increased?

It would be nice to hold small amounts of bitcoin in a soft wallet on my phone. Like if I want to send someone btc. And for larger savings I would store it in a hard wallet.

Everyone has mentioned soft wallets other than the one I am thinking to use: Abra. Is there something wrong with Abra that I am not aware of? Or is it just as secure?

Coinbase Pro has incredibly low fees. Idk why nobody talks about them. It’s like a .15% fee if you limit trade

Can you show me this math?

If you want to get into this “day trading beating the market” path then I would recommend dollar cost averaging 80% of what you can afford for the long haul. Never selling. And then use that other 20% to buy and sell daily. And in this case, yes, definitely sell that 20%. But hodl the 80%

Did nobody get the joke?
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:04:44
I was going to buy this evening because I didn’t have time yesterday and when I got to my computer I saw the 20% jump and got sad :(

I’m not complaining about Coinbase. I’m very satisfied by the exchange... I was just asking how to make private keys.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:58:57
Can someone explain? Are these independent people acting as an exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:15:57
Should I sell now and buy at 8.2k?
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:03:51
Probably wire transfer
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:12:04
Where can I find this chart?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:00:17
What app is that
@_date: 2019-09-27 10:10:09
And the name of this app? Also it’s definitely a scam
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:02:05
It’s been that way for years man, you can r/iamverysmart this entire sub
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:14:09
So do you buy now or wait for 4K
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:20:46

Actually it’s closer to $700 mill Longs were liquidated

If a quantum computer can complete calculations faster than 51% of miners then it is a problem and I wouldn’t be surprised if a quantum computer in the next few decades could do that.
