You can use TREZOR with [Copay]( to create multisig wallets as well, beside you can use it to manage your smart assets and log into websites. It keeps developing and new features are being added continously..

I have to agree with guys here.. GPU mining is dead already.. you would have to buy ASIC miner or rent the hasrate somewhere..
but anyway.. If I remember it right Slushpool doesn't even support Guiminer anymore as it is buggy like hell.. They support CGminer and BFGminer only while those two apps are for ASIC miners..
but anyway.. if u decide to go for some asic miner or rented hashrate, I would definitely stick with Slushpool.. they just released beta version of new website and it's really a big step forward again
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:31:45
The multi-signature has a one big disadvantage in compare with plausible deniability.. if "your kids would held at gun point" you would rather move the Earth to make the transaction signed with all the ledgers, because the attacker already knows there is some bitcoins..
While with wallets hidden behind passphrases attacker will NEVER know there is more bitcoins than you actually gave him already;)

It's such a bad idea to use exchanges as a wallet.. people should finally open their eyes after what happened with Mt.Gox, Bitstamp and so on.. I mean.. It makes sense to use exchange if you want to trade! However in such case I would just use it to buy/sell and then transfer btc into safe place.. 
Be your own bank.. Use TREZOR..

very fresh TREZOR review here:
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:19:02
you are right.. "plugin and backends are original, because trezor do not opensource that".. poor you.. if it was opensource you didn't need to do literally anything:)) I'm kidding.. I appreciate your hard work on the localization at least:)
and I see why you didn't change much on the webwallet.. it makes it easier to "adopt" new versions of mytrezor in the future, right?
With all the respect I will stick with the original.. I don't see the reason to save money on something like this.. it's one time investment and trust in well known and widely recognized developers has a bigger value than price of the device in this case for me.. 
not worth to save couple $ when you plan to store bigger ammount of Bitcoins in it
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:27:18
and the beautiful girls in here!:D
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:50:49
I think the original idea was this: "We also wanted to allow people to extend and build upon TREZOR"
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:40:33
Hey guys.. it looks nice.. I just can't appreciate it's a COMPLETE copy of the TREZOR including the webwallet.. guys.. it's completely the same..  you even didn't make the effort to change the layout and design and so on.. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:07:07
I don't think there is such threshold.. I would say it depends on what kind of situation you want to use the wallet for.. 
- Do you need wallet for everyday spending? 
- Do you need wallet to work with your mobile phone? 
- Do you need wallet to receive coins and occasionally send a transaction? So it can be stored at home?
- Do you want just a wallet or do you want to have some additional features included (such as possibility to log into services, store passwords, manage smart assets etc.)?
I would first find answers for those questions and then have a look which wallets will satisfy me;)
@_date: 2016-01-06 10:02:28

@_date: 2016-06-16 07:49:20
Take the seed as a "master key" for all the other keys, which are derived from the master one in your TREZOR device. You write the recovery seed down on the paper or store in Cryptosteel (never ever store your recovery seed online/digitally! Once you do so, consider it compromised). The private keys never leave your devices.. In case you lose your TREZOR you can recover all the private keys from the recovery seed (+ passphrase if used).
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:32:30
sorry, typo:(
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:16:30
historically some people preferred Electrum over myTREZOR.com because of better privacy. Since SatoshiLabs [switched backend]( to open source [Bitcore]( this point is not valid anymore as you can run your [own server](
You can see the overview of features available in Electrum (and other TREZOR compatible wallets) in [TREZOR Apps](
Otherwise I would say it very much depends on your preferences. mytrezor.com is sufficient and better option for most users. I would use Electrum just in case you want to see all the change addresses (which are not shown in mytrezor.com.. it seems to be quite complicated concept for big amount of people).
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:17:29
Yes, they are.. We are waiting for re-stock, they should be available during July
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:54:09
I will just add that [Show on TREZOR]( can be found as that "eye icon" next to receiving address in [myTREZOR.com](
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:02:00
you can always build your own TREZOR as did:

@_date: 2016-06-07 15:16:03
I'm so happy we have the HD wallets now.. Such ease of use! 
I would suggest the same way to retrieve OP's coins..  And then go and buy a [TREZOR]( :)
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:04:16
Exchanges are not generally safe to store coins as you usually do not hold the private keys.
I would suggest to use Electrum / Mycelium to sweep the private key from your paper wallet. Why? Both are HD wallets, both are possible to recover via recovery seed and both support [TREZOR]( hardware wallet so you can improve the security even further.
@_date: 2016-06-07 14:50:23
Paper wallets are nice to recommend by power users, but they sometimes forget to explain how to spend from them:)
I would suggest using Electrum or Mycelium to sweep the private key. Both support TREZOR so you can get your coins from paper wallet directly to ultimately secure hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:22:34
All you need to know is: ultimate way to secure your future bitcoins is [TREZOR]( it's worth to spend this little money to get a peace of mind and ease of use in one device.
[Here]( you will also find a links where to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:53:18
I would say you can use TREZOR safely without any problem as it has all the security features to perfectly fit your need:
1] recovery seed - 24 words generated when you set up the TREZOR. You write it down on the paper or save it in [cryptosteel]( .. That's a thing you should put into the blast-proof safe.
2] It has a PIN protecting against the unauthorised physical access. The [PIN matrix]( is made in very smart way and it scrambles every time you enter the PIN. 
3] You can also use [passphrase]( to protect you against the so-called "$5 wrench attack". It simply creates a new wallet for anything you enter, so you can fake a wallet with small balance to give to potential attackers and they will never be able to find out there is some other wallet if you don't tell them. Additionally it protects your funds in case somebody would find your recovery seed as it behaves as a [25th word]( of the seed
4] it's good to have TREZOR around as you can use it to check and confirm the generated receiving address is truly generated by TREZOR thanks to "[Show on TREZOR]( feature (it displays the address on device screen). And also you need to connect TREZOR to your computer/phone when you want to send the coins as you have to physically confirm the action by pressing the button.
With all this I would not be afraid to have TREZOR around with me, I think it's protected enough:)
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:21:39
You can definitely trust this reseller: 
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:57:08
And Mycelium works with TREZOR directly:)
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:20:33
Just because you don't depend on any specific backend server and all of them have specific features / usecases..
For example you probably won't carry your laptop to the shop to pay your bill with bitcoin while it's easy with Mycelium and TREZOR.. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 09:01:32


Once you type the seed words in right order into the computer, consider your seed compromised.. We always recommend to save the seed offline.. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:03:57
In general you don't want to keep bitcoins on potentially compromised computer.. wallet file can be stolen.. password can be snatched by keylogger.. if you use it on offline computer, then it's inconvenient to spend..
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:12:44
I was talking about using the devices as a "wallet" which was their original purpose..
And about the U2F.. So what you are saying is you want to protect even the U2F with additional passphrase? Do you consider it necessary? The device itself is already a second factor
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:54:04
That's what OP mentioned as passphrase
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:44:59
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:26:29
There are two official resellers operating at Amazon.com: in-ear-com and SavingsZone
@_date: 2016-11-10 11:55:18
But that's not a mistake of the TREZOR design.. 
TREZOR has a smart way how to enter PIN so it's just question of your trust to people who you gonna tell it to / be paranoid to hide it from.. If you use the same PIN as on your bank card, than it's your problem..
When you thing about it you could be forced to reveal every secret if the right torture methods used on you. If you had a device protected by eye scan.. You might rather give up your eye than have a family killed.
Only protection against this is multisig and even then you could be forced to "push" the other key holders to sign such transaction if you are in grave danger..
Otherwise TREZOR doesn't require you to log into google at all, that's an optional request in case you want to use TREZOR Password Manager.
@_date: 2016-11-15 09:01:24
Of course you can switch the paper for something more resistant (ie. Cryptosteel).. I was talking rather about the security, not safety of the seed
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:44:08
Store the seed electronically is not recommended
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:26:16
I meant to use the principle in "offline" mode without the need to use the actual tool, otherwise you need to type the seed into computer again..
@_date: 2016-11-14 12:30:55


That's why there is the possibility to use passphrase on TREZOR. You can create multiple wallets hidden behind various passphrases and make some fake transaction history with a small balance left. You can give away that as a decoy and insist there is nothing more.. So called plausible deniability.. However again this security feature is only as strong as you are..
@_date: 2016-12-14 11:33:23
I don't see the point here? You can use both with one hand, you can set up passphrase on both, you can use python tools in Windows on both.. 
Difference is you can use TREZOR with passphrase without the need of using python scripts.. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:34:38
Hardware bitcoin wallet which can be also used as password manager / U2F (2FA) token / for logins (including SSH) / for secure messaging / encrypting/decrypting GPG etc. More information in [doc.satoshilabs.com FAQ](
You should buy one if you care about your security / privacy..
@_date: 2016-12-20 09:17:28
Have you seen the [TREZOR vs BMW]( I think KeepKey wouldn't do that well:)
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:17:24
why to give them a hard time when they can do it easily with TREZOR?:)
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:01:21
You can try Copay instead of offline Electrum, it [works well]( with TREZOR
@_date: 2016-11-15 08:57:13
Always keep in mind the more difficult setup you make, the bigger chance something will go wrong.. Like you forget some important part and then you are not able to recover the funds.. I would personally prevent to scramble the words unless you are 1000% sure you will be able to recall the key how to put it into the right order again (pattern you memorized already or are able to memorize and remember it 20 years later)..
You can also use so called [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( which actually means you separate the seed let's say into 3 parts (3x 8 words of 24 word seed), you write them on 3 papers, where on first paper you have 1/3 + 2/3, on another paper 2/3 + 3/3 and 1/3 + 3/3 on the last paper... You hide them on different places and you need to have 2 of them to put the seed together.. 
This works even when one of the papers is destroyed, you still have two to recover the seed.. Even when potential attacker finds one part, he would still need to force the 8 words, which is pretty good security still
And I would definitely recommend to use the passphrase
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:34:43


I know you didn't open the device, however I have read somewhere the chassis is glued together? Does the device feel solid (when you shake it for example)? 
If it's true I'm just wondering how it will handle transports..
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:17:53
You need a bitcoin wallet.. You have an overview here:
Mobile or web wallets and exchanges are the "online storages", where possibility of getting hacked is higher then if you store your private keys offline. 
Offline desktop wallets are not really easy to use for "noobs".
Paper wallets are difficult to spend and it's "just a paper"
For you purposes I would go for hardware wallet as it combines security and ease of use;) You are also saying you want to diversify your funds, so it shouldn't be a big deal for you to pay some money for it (it's worth it).
Then you come to two possible solutions which you can buy straight away:
- [TREZOR]( - costs $119, free shipping.. ultimate security, it costs more
- [Ledger Nano]( - costs €34.80, free shipping.. cheaper, good for multisig, bit more difficult to set up as it requires the device to be initialized on "clean" computer (they provide the tools to do it tho)
There are some more coming out, but not quite yet (if you don't want to buy clones)
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:55:51
I believe it doesn't matter how fast you are in the world of malware and keyloggers
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:50:18
How do you know it's much faster and easier to use than TREZOR? They are not out yet as far as I know..
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:33:34
And if I'm not mistaken guys are working on implementing TREZOR support for Copay as well..

Oh, I didn't know that.. sorry, edited
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:25:12
You can use the Chrome Extension for easy setup &amp; recovery of TREZOR..
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:57:18
You are not asked to retype the seed when initializing TREZOR.. The device will show the seed again on the device screen so you can check if you wrote down the seed properly.. You never have to type the seed into computer unless doing recovery.. and then it's in random order as you mentioned..
Just to clarify:)
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:04:07
I believe you could expect that bitcoin community will want to see the code if you claim it's open source:) Would be better to publish the code before posting to reddit.. no digging, just saying:)

[deleted]? does it mean problem is solved?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:54:07
Can I ask you please.. Do you have your own personal experience with TREZOR? I do and it never took me 10 minutes.. It's usually done in few seconds.. It's true it takes little bit longer when your spending inputs from mining, because it has to check the whole transaction where you received the coins, but it's the only way how to be 100% sure.. 
I don't know much about Case because I didn't have chance to try that.. However I don't like the idea of biometrics used in this way and also I don't believe anything where my private key is hold by someone else.. Stored in someone's else vault or whatever..

@_date: 2016-09-06 12:01:02
From my experience all loses of bitcoin from TREZOR were caused by a user's mistakes.. Most common issues (in random order):
* didn't write the seed properly 
* switched the seed words order or didn't write down some of the words for "improved security" and then they forgot about it 
* set up the optional passphrase and forgot it 
* lost whole or part of the seed

Exactly.. paper wallets might be safe untill you want to spend them




TREZOR is made in a way that you don't have to rely on SatoshiLabs products. You can perform the [device setup]( in various ways and then you can use TREZOR with any TREZOR compatible wallet, for more details please see the [TREZOR Apps]( manual.




Understand Electrum or any other wallet as "frontend", while TREZOR is the "backend". Wallets like myTREZOR.com, Electrum, Miltibit HD etc. are just an UI where you can see the transaction history, you can create the transactions and broadcast them and so on. TREZOR is doing only thing: singning them! The strength of TREZOR is it doesn't leak the private keys whatever "frontend" you use.




Again please check the [TREZOR Apps]( manual.








Btw, there is a third option. "Ledger wallet nano s". It's arguably the most up to date device, although Trezor seems more reliable imo.
KeepKey is a clone of TREZOR. It is very similar, it has different case and some minor changes in the features. TREZOR is a pioneer, TREZOR was first and is continuously adding more and more features like [TREZOR Password Manager]( [Labeling]( [2factor authentication ]( and many more. It also supports some [major altcoins]( for quite a while already. 
You can check the [TREZOR blog]( to find more information about recent releases
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:03:35
It's shipped from Czech Republic if you order from [buytrezor.com]( directly
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:25:02
There is no active promocode at this moment
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:28:05
I would say TREZOR is good to save any amount of money.. If you believe in Bitcoin technology and you believe the value will rise in future.. What is $200 nowadays can be $2k / $20k / $200k in the future! You never know.. 
You can use TREZOR with PC or cellphone, you can combine with other wallets, it's compatible with plenty of coins, you can use it to store open assets (with Coinprism), now with TREZOR Connect you are getting password-less login and much more.. 
TREZOR provide real peace of mind! It's easy-to-use and most secure wallet currently available on the market developed by people well recognized by the community..

There is no such domain as trezor.com related to the TREZOR device. You probably mean mytrezor.com. It has been developed because there was no other compatible wallet when TREZOR started.

You can initialize the device using [Chrome Extension]( as well.

Just give it a shot and try to win;) But anyway.. when the BTC price goes up.. it's cheaper to buy one.. relatively:)

Store in TREZOR.. paper wallets are not really safe when it comes to spending

I have the same problem, reported to Electrum on Github:

I would just add an [explanation](
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:05:53
Yes, it's still the same.. [2%](

also do not forget that even the Tails live CD is not 100% secure as your BIOS can be hacked..

TREZOR actually doesn't require mytrezor.com .. it's just one of the options.. Otherwise you can use Electrum, Mycelium, Multibit and so on.. all work with the device
and btw. there is also the possibility to use it to log into pages without the need of username and password, SSH login etc..

I have to agree with redpola.. unless there is something like BIP70 widely implemented and you still want to encourage people to start using bitcoin, you need to make it easy for them.. 
Nerds do not mind random strings of numbers and letter.. Normal people prefer to actually see the name of the person or service
I also see the potential to actually encourage people to DO NOT reuse addresses if labeling is used.. Imagine a situation, where you decide to give someone your receiving address and you label it straight away "from Mike" for example. However Mike doesn't send anything and you forgot it meanwhile, then next time you want to use fresh address, you gonna see the last one is labeled as "from Mike", so you will skip it and use another one.. If you didn't have a label there, you might send the same address to someone else..

[Winner]( was announced already

Do you think TREZOR is not?:)

Can I ask why would you definitely recommend KK to your family and friends then?
