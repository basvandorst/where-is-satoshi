Sure is.. 
Fuel the rocket. Let's go!

Whales getting ready to dump the market down to 3k, then buy it all back up again super cheap and pump it hard. Fun times ahead..  ��
Let the games begin!

I see Vietnam is listed as illegal. Yet there is lots of blockchain development in hochiminh city. And bitcoin cafes.. 
Something not right there

More likely to prevent bitcoin getting mass market adoption when google is clearly pushing for Ethereum to be bigger. Its well known that google employees are mining Ethereum

Im selling items and accepting Btc Now. Had someone pay with Btc the other day. The people willing to spend it seem to be the miners who have a card rig, separate to their day job. So its like a little bonus for them. 
Oh to have the funds for a card rig..

Now they can find out who the wealthy BTC holders are that travel internationally if they spend at an airport vendor ;)
Sneaky sneaky

Why not? 
You have their face, tx time and amount. If they used a main wallet to pay, could you not reverse look up the address to see the balance. Well at the least it let's security know that person has crypto

The math problem is how the bitcoin network verifys transactions and stays secure. Literally unbreakable unless the whole internet goes down or global warfare takes it out. You realise anti virus software hasnt worked in over 10 years and every computer is hackable? This is a fight between the corporations and Tech nerds fighting for security and privacy. There's no stopping it now, it's gone too far. Join the revolution or complain. Up to you

Running a global network requires large amount of energy. The internet currently uses a hell of a lot more. Bitcoin will scale to be more efficient and globally useful. Also the demand for more electricity is providing more revenue, which in turn is adding to renewable energy sources. But you can thinking its bad, I'll buy your Btc

Listen to the whole thing if you can
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:18:56
Just from looking at market depth. Nothing fancy

buy support for btc is dropping quickly on exchanges by the way. Be prepared to endure emotional trauma in case of plummet.

I haven't looked at grin at all. If its still around in a year then maybe. There's just so many other projects to look at, the risk of brand new ones is quite high is all.

It has a lot of fun useful options that could turn into real world application. 
Such as instant micropayments in games. 
I want to see a call of duty where every time you kill the enemy they automatically send you a few satoshi. And you lose one for being killed,obviously.
Adds a new level of competition to gaming.
An afternoon slaying noobs could turn into a free beer ;)

Not yet. Its the new hype coin for pump and dump. I don't bother with brand new coins until they have a bit of history. Bitconnect was the new cool coin once. And we all know how that ended
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:48:32
Also blockstream global coverage of satellites, and hash rate is still growing despite the price. Good times ahead
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:33:01
Its all an educated gamble. The massive amount that was just purchased is unlikely to occur again soon in my view. So selling off a little bit now and buying back lower could well be the best move. You just never know for sure. 
If I was at home instead of work id be watching the market and shorting btc most likely

I think the whole concept they are going for is open and unfiltered. It's up to the users to regulate between scams etc by reporting them. Facebook is censored and controlled, so is reddit. I've switched from fb and reddit to mostly twitter. Reddit is no longer what it used to be, its become popular and now full of reposts and bullshit. 
Twitter is a digital version of the real world. Yes, you can get tricked by people who lie to you or present false info. But that happens without social media. Instead of relying on the platform to do the work for you, it requires using your brain. Which seems lacking in a lot of social media users. 
If you start filtering one thing it'll just continue to get worse until you end up with another facebook... 
If you are stupid enough to send money to a person offering free Ethereum then you deserve to lose it. DYOR. Stop relying on others to do it for you
