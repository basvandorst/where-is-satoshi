I’m not 100% following.  I took BTC from my bread wallet on my phone, went to send BTC but scanned the Bcash (apparently how I have to say it) Qcode on my Exodus wallet. Are you saying I need to recover that BCH wallet as a BTC wallet?

I don’t know what/who Tone is?

Nah, transaction already completed.  So first thing I did, after saying “god damn bitcoin cash”, was take BCH off as a visible wallet in the Exodus portfolio.

Hey this was a huge help.  Thank you for the awesome information.  I was able to recover the funds!  They got transaction feed a bit so that hurt, but hey I thought it was completely gone!  
One last question- Now that I exported my bcash private keys from Exodus, is there anything I should do to that Exodus bcash wallet, in the event it needs to get used later?

Yeeeaaaaahhh- I’m never gonna say it like that.

So if I don't want to worry about setting my own computer security is the best option a Trezor or an e-wallet (i.e. Breadwallet)?

So if I have bitcoin in my Coinbase wallet, do I not own that?

Thanks for all the replies so far.  I know it's an extremely difficult question, and one that is mired in assumptions.  Maybe the best question is what could the buying power of a bitcoin be in that timeframe.  I don't believe all the fiat currencies will collapse, so I guess the best assumption can be made around BTC being one of many of the current available currencies.  Is it just too difficult to estimate the buying power in ~5-8 years from now?
