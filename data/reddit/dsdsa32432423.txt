It's a centralized solution, but if a few more popular wallets implement it it would quickly go a long way towards solving the zeroconf issue. The next step will probably be (my speculation here) for bitgo to implement some kind of centralized payment channel system so none of these transactions (between their members) need to be committed to the blockchain either. Suddenly no fees and no scalability issues. :p

probably  - but i'd also recommend getting a  account in order to send cheap SEPA transfers to EUR exchanges such as

Just pay using your centralized payment provider.. since almost all of them have integrated bitgo and bitpay has integrated bitgo instant confirmed transactions including in persion PoS via bitpay's ingenico integration are already here.. it's a centralized solution but the vast majority of bitcoin users keep their coins on a wallet/exchange anyway.

Bitfinex, Bitstamp, CoinHacko, Fold, Korbit, Kraken, SFOX, ShapeShift, Genesis Trading, and Unocoin now support bitgo which makes zeroconf safe (because bitgo will never sign a double spend transaction).. so zeroconf transactions from any of those popular wallets are instantly acceptable with no risk. It also works with bitpay and bitpay has their ingenico integration - so instand risk free in person PoS sales should be already quite feasible using any of those wallet providers.
