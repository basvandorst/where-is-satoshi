This is what made me think the guy was legit.  His reply to my concerns:
"Like I said before, youre more than welcome to come by my office and inspect the units until your comfortable I have nothing to hide or have any intention of trying anything funny.  I have a ton of emails that i have to sift through and determine whether they are serious buyers or typical craigslist scammers so it is what it is,  I'm only making about $750 profit on each of these units while other sharks are trying to double up by charging $8-9k. So if you want to buy from them, be my guest.  If u buy from me, you can either pick it up and pay cash or you can pay by bitcoin and ill ship it to you next day and give you the tracking number the same day you submit payment.  Those are  my terms, take it or leave it. I already sold one of the 4 units and I have a buyer who wants to take two by tomorrow which leaves only one left if he does take them.  So I cant guarantee availbility.  let me know what u want to do.
According to mT GOx:  1 btc=380 so I need 5500 /380  = 14.473 btc + Shipping = 14.7 btc

Yes it was my own stupidity, I agree.  That's what you get with trusting people.  It's just sad and this is for informational purposes to stay away from this guy.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:27:41
Right, that's what it was since I am sitting on piles of cash already I need more of it.  Get bent.  This isn't about me this is about warning people.

Sorry I didn't get a screen shot first.

I sent this guy 14.7 BTC today to address 1Gkrm8hJivvLbkBsZgTqz2eDMLqKBgthMu with no response.  Avoid this guy like the plague.  He goes by the name of Albert.  Got to love CL scammers!

I didn't play but watched it unfold.  Today was the worst I've seen of it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:23:35
Because I am impatient, naive and dumb.  It's not his fault for being a low class asshole it's mine for believing people are actually inherently good to others.

Yeah live and learn.  Glad you didn't get burnt on it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:22:22
And only time will tell what overall effect this will have on BTC?  People are in serious panic mode right now and need to be calmed somehow.
