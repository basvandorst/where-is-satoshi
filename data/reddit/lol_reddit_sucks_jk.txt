It just gets more and more insane. Still HODLing!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:44:24
LOL, you're back
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:07:00
thanks for the paraphrase
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:06:15
yes, and then it went up to about $1150, and then dropped back down to less than 800 like 2 weeks ago, and now it's back to $1000. 
welcome to bitcoin.

She is not a soccer mom. We're safe. For now. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:07:20
LOL I hold enough BTC that I'm not worried about the amount I purchased. He'll get his key! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:11:50
oh shit i wasnt thinking i got too excited 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:04:56
Interesting question
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:03:04
its not unsafe. its also not as safe as it could be. 
also i know someone holding 42 bitcoin on coinbase who is unfazed
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:16:25
yo you gotta convert something
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:03:19
i'm working on it
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:05:24
i missed the low point but i got in at 3800, 3900, and 4000 respectively. that dollar cost average. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:06:47
also it doesnt matter how many bitcoin a random stranger on the internet owns
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:54:26
Do not feel sad. You are in on the ground floor of a revolution. Be proud. Be happy. HODL and buy the dips!
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:05:54
if you saw my earlier comment, i have a trezor on the way. so this will be short lived. i do appreciate the concern! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:39:46
let me think about this and get back to you
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:01:03
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:22:38
You are the true original
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:27:37
you suddenly gave me the urge to want to count all the dollars and calculate the amount of bitcoin that would be
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:22:45
yes a trezor is on the way
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:58:58
i get that. its sometimes hard to remember the big picture – that we are a part of changing the world for the better and that this is just the beginning of taking control of our financial futures. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:10:11
Oh, she is an influential woman in her community. Bitcoin will be bought. Don't worry about that. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:58:44
its better to hold your own keys for sure, but i wouldn't say its inherently unsafe, depends on the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:37:53
lol what are you talking about. i'm saying convert usd into btc. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:51:05
hopefully you're right, and i can't wait to laugh at this
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:31:45
THEY WISH
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:59:08
i've just left it in there
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:47:26
now HODL
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:31:55
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:21:44
that's awesome, good for you for being that early. i hope you post something technical for me to read. thank you for writing. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:39:32
here's your very own [jump to conclusions mat](
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:48:15
yeah, i hope you bought it
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:40:24
you sir are quite the contrarian in comparison to all the other folks in this subreddit. i like you.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:20:49
gonna be a wild ride! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:40:56
ill get there waiting for the next dip
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:39:34
nice try! 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:54:48
i'm talking about the 8000 dips that have happened already. we'll get some ATH this week. then wait for the next dip. and buy that shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:10:01
I just think that not a lot happens day to day with Bitcoin. Sure, there are some exciting things that happen sometimes (Segwit, the Great Fork of 2017, FUD, etc). But realistically its not like following a stock which has a lot more variables to pay attention to. 
I think this is why people get excited about price movements, its one of the few tangible things that we can all identify with and talk about.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:01:35
nah she didn't buy at ATH 
she waited for the dip
she doesn't fuck around
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:28:36
i certainly understand the charts. now you should open your mind and understand that what i am doing is educational for this child. it is not about making him rich. and time will tell what is useless and what is not. not some overly aggressive redditor who is getting combative for no reason on a comment thread.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:34:50
honestly think it will be funny to be like "here's your S&amp;P500 worth 200% more and here's your bitcoin worth 200,000% more."
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:25:48
thanks! you keep going too! HODL!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:00:16
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:56:43
honestly, any amount of BTC is more BTC than most anyone in the world has. feel proud of that and keep HODLing and keep buying the dips. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:10:37
i wasnt implying that there was currently any major dip
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:38:36
nah, she's an early adopter usually. we should have some more time. HODL
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:41:33
also the random decimals make me feel better about spending bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:20:24
the real point is to show what the difference will be, seems much more interesting to see what happens btwn BTC and S&amp;P. 
will be illuminating, even if we all think we know the answer (that obviously bitcoin will crush S&amp;P)
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:03:47
how? i'd have to delete the post
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:36:53

[buy the dip](
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:15:26
$400k is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:09:48
YESSSS (also i have a trezor on the way)
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:58:44
if youre posting on here, you probably own some bitcoin, and i dont consider anyone who owns any bitcoin to be a pleb
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:04:55
I'm going slow and steady. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:45:40
talk to me when it dips $800/coin in a day
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:39:29
No it proves that I realized it doesnt matter
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:53:00
Looks great

CHEAP COINS + PAY DAY
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:59:56
if you have read my other comments you'd know i have a trezor on the way. no need to keep preaching.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:41:09
read the book "Early Retirement Extreme" but don't listen to everything it says, some of it is too insane. but it will give you a good starting place for a philosophy to save money. save as much money as you can. 
and good luck w the newborn!
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:50:54

I'm at 4x returns and still HODLing. Just fucking hodl unless you desperately NEED the money for something in your life.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:56:23
if you need the money that desperately you probably shouldnt be investing
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:28:40
actually it only made me $817.70 richer
the dips are what are insane though, i sometimes "lose" thousands of dollars in a day. makes HODLing interesting. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:59:32
im using this next time thank you
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:18:22
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:31:36
the thing is i already own a car. fully paid off. and i'll drive it into the ground. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:45:40
As you know this is already happening
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:21:56
No one begged yesterday (my $4700 post was on the front page). People asked actual questions about my investment strategies and how I accumulated this much (also this isnt a lot compared to people I know -- my friend broke $200k in Bitcoin holdings yesterday) and advice on how they should buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:23:51
i'm not sure. i'm in the US. maybe try bittrex or kraken. not sure if coinbase works overseas? maybe it does.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:01:38
not yet
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:56:12
may you have a blessed day sir
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:38:03
Good job keep HODLing
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:52:38
will be old news when we hit 4900

CHEAP COINS + PAY DAY
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:41:50
i disagree. 
you don't drop all your cash on a single dip. you spread it out. 
if it dips further you buy more, you 'dollar cost average'.
at the end of the day we're all betting on the survival of bitcoin and the hope that it will continue to thrive in an increasingly shitty fucked up world. a few fractions of a bitcoin bought a few dollars apart will be negligible over time. 
good luck timing the market. let me know how that works out for you. 
buy when it feels like the world is ending. 
hodl when the euphoria sets in. 
sell only when you need the money for your life not because of price fluctuations. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:45:29
buy a little. a small amount you feel comfortable with. then after you watch it for a while add a little more. repeat this for one year. report back. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:19:49
You're doing God's work
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:48:34
hey now
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:44:44
Who cares how many coins anyone else has. We are all on our own journey. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:10:15
been in the game a year. trezor on the way. thank you for your concern
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:28:50
not converting to cash. when/if the time comes, i'll cross that path when i need to. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:34:33
nothing good in life comes easy my dude
earn that shit!!!! good luck out there. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:47:46
Started buying a year ago around $600. Then just kept buying every time I had the urge or saw a dip. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:33:46
they are fine. my parents been saving money for retirement for so long they don't need my help.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:27:52
the cool thing is i can do whatever i want with my money/bitcoin. appreciate the concern. if i lose all my bitcoin, that's my problem. but again, i do appreciate the concern. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:22:32
im already invested in other things and if my bitcoin holdings reach $400k then what we're talking about is a paradigm shift and most other things would not seem that attractive and i'd keep hodling. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:09:10
actually you can. good luck retiring on 400k.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:40:55
lmao love you mean it
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:22:35
when its being wild i typically avg in. ill buy a little at a price im comfortable with. i keep cash around so that if it dips further i go in a little more, only buying more if it drops to a decent amount less than when i went in. if it goes up a lot ill just hold steady. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:11:14
