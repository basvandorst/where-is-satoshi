This doesn't make any sense. The reason hoarding is "bad" (which it isn't) is because it reduces the supply of available bitcoins, thus driving up the price. So what? 
If you spend bitcoins and then buy with them, you are doing literally nothing to the available bitcoin supply. The only difference here is that the business ends up with bitcoin. So you're either subsidising businesses procuring bitcoin, or you're not because they're using BitPay or something and never see it. Most likely the latter. All while incurring the fees of purchasing bitcoins (which is how you're subsidising the businesses in getting bitcoin).
"Hoarding" (otherwise referred to as "saving") drives up the price, which brings speculation and media. This in turn allows more people to become informed about Bitcoin. "Hoarding" as opponents describe it means these people will NEVER spend their bitcoins, which is a complete strawman of the situation. People hold on to bitcoins because they perceive them as increasing in value (with respect to USD, for example). However, USD are increasing in value with respect to a certain laptop, as well. Does this mean that a "saver" of dollars will never buy a laptop (which constantly depreciates)? Of course not. Eventually savers will spend bitcoins on goods and services. The admonishment of savings is irrational and Keynesian crockery. This will not cause the Bitcoin economy "to slow and die." 
Instead, if you are concerned about "hoarders" or the lack of Bitcoin adoption among merchants, you should support the creation of Bitcoin lending/investment services, which will loan Bitcoins to Bitcoin-accepting startups and provide incentive for "hoarders" to put their saved money to good use in contributing to investment.

If you're saying what I think you're saying, you're saying that Bitcoin is fiat because we've declared bitcoins to be valuable?
My impression of fiat is that value is decreed by the state and through laws (e.g. dollars must be accepted as legal tender to resolve debts). 
With Bitcoin, there is subjective value (I mean, there is subjective value for all things of course). And the intersection of everyone's valuation of bitcoins (supply + demand) along with purchase gives us the price of bitcoin (some might call it the "value"). I would not call this fiat.

I don't see how this is the case. Difficulty follows price, but price doesn't necessarily follow difficulty. Price is determined by demand. 


Nope. Price spikes are probably more easily explained by higher exposure/liquidity of Bitcoin, and recent good news. Once ASICs come out, you won't suddenly see a flatline just because it's now 'easier' to set up a mining operation. If that's the case, when mining profits are low (i.e. when there is high difficulty relative to hashrate of the current tech), you'd see the price go up. And when mining profits are high, then the price would go up. Then you're saying the price is only going to go up, which doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

There is a large difference between payment methods and currencies. A currency should act as a store of value as well as a unit of exchange, and various other factors. Bitcoin being used only as a payment method not only overloads the blockchain, but also ignores the entire point that the value of Bitcoin is in the marriage between the protocol of transfer and the eventually finite supply of bitcoins. Using bitcoins as a substitute for USD ignores half of the purpose, and it won't result in a growth in adoption.

Raspberry Pi runs an operating system off an SD card, so you would just need to build MinePeon onto the card and start the Raspberry Pi with that card. Then all it should take is hooking up to the ASICs.

The problem isn't the coupling of the two, I don't think.
The problem is that once a private address is known by more than one person, it becomes essentially useless (because more than one person can spend the coins). 
Bitcoin cash is easy enough, so long as it is treated as cash. In general, one would expect as long as a sticker is on a bill, it would be trusted to hold however much is listed. It could easily be verified by the public address. And then you would literally just hand it to the person to pay them. The only reason to take off the sticker would be to "deposit" the bitcoins (use the private address to send bitcoins from the bill to your account, similarly to depositing cash at an ATM).
The problem I'm trying to state is that while a public address isn't strictly necessary, it is useful for verification. At the same time, stupid people might "load" the cash bill with bitcoins (it would be like making a $1 bill be redeemable for $5 worth of gold or something).  
Calling/labelling it a "load" address is irresponsible because it will be treated as the face value by anyone accepting it, unless it is checked (and even then, what are they supposed to do? Accept the non-face value? They would have to cash it in immediately).
The difficulty of splitting a physical bitcoin into two cards is ensuring that the two cards (one public, one private) refer to the same address (fraudulent cards could have a public address linked to an account with greater value than the address pointed to by the private address).

I don't think they are mutually exclusive. What I'm trying to say is that someone could decide to make a Bitcoin credit card, with some of these features.

I don't need your condescension. I know exactly what I'm talking about, and I understand how the fractional reserve banking system works. I never said they held back any money from loans.
The banks don't print the money, and they aren't given "privilege" to print. The Federal Reserve puts holdings into the reserve accounts at the Federal Reserve for the banks when the Fed prints money, but the banks play no part in creating that money itself. The only true role that the Federal Reserve plays in the specific system of fractional reserve banking is to potentially bail out the banks that fail due to situations such as bank runs. In particular "The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur." In this way, the Federal Reserve does in fact guarantee solvency of banks, or in my words


due to the fact that the Federal Reserve would likely print to maintain solvency of banks (and in this way guarantee deposits in the case of a bank run).
The only specific property of a fractional reserve banking system is that FRACTIONAL RESERVES ARE HELD (meaning that the rest is generally loaned or invested). A central bank is not required for this to happen. It just happens to be intrinsic to the current system.
How about you go fuck yourself now? You're obviously the one who doesn't know jack if you think a central bank is requisite for a fractional reserve system.
This conversation is over.

So I'm working under the assumption that as you generate these addresses, they belong to you.
The basic premise is that in order to get a collision, one will almost certainly have to create more addresses ("fake") than already exist and may have bitcoins in them ("real"). Because of this, you're increasing the probability of a collision by increasing the space of assigned addresses, but you're also increasing the probability that an assigned address belongs to you. 
The goal of a brute force collision search is to maximise the probability not only of an overall collision, but also to maximise the overall probability of a "useful" collision.
Imagine this scenario: I have a bag of marbles, coloured red, green, and clear. Clear would represent unassigned addresses, red for a currently assigned address that is not yours, and green for an assigned address that is yours. Now the collision search would basically randomly reach into this bag of marbles, hoping for anything that isn't a clear marble (except there are wayyyyyyy more clear marbles than coloured marbles). If you pick a clear marble, take it out and replace it with a green one. 
So you can see that the probability of picking a non-clear marble (i.e. the probability of a collision) increases. At the same time, the probability of choosing a green marble (i.e. the probability of running into an address that you own) also increases. What happens to the probability of pulling out a red marble? That probability (i.e. the probability of collision with an address that is not yours) remains constant. To make this model more accurate, we would say that every so often a clear marble would naturally be replaced by a red marble, and that would model how the number of legitimately used addresses is increasing. However, as long as you "pick" more quickly than a red marble is generated (which you would have to to stand a realistic chance of getting a collision), then the greens will outnumber the reds after some time *t*. (And it is likely that t will be small to increase the usefulness of such an attack)

No, you misunderstand how [fractional reserve banking]( works.
The reserve holdings are a percentage of the amount of money deposited that can be received on demand. Fractional-reserve banks loan out actual cold, hard cash from the rest of the reserves. The current system isn't some magical system where banks can print money to loan out. Banks don't hold all their deposits as their reserve and then loan out a multiple of that because that would literally require them to have the ability to print on demand, which they don't. 
This isn't about books. This is about the fact that there are multiple demanders and suppliers of money, and the fractional-banking system takes advantage of that fact. A bank can loan out 90% of the money deposited, but that doesn't change the values that are in each bank account. This isn't the same as loaning from your father because someone else isn't depending on him to give them that $100 back at whim. 
The bank doesn't lend out more than it receives. The bank simply lends out ANYTHING. However, this yields an effect that increases the money supply due to the fact that individuals with holdings don't experience losses in their accounts while people with loans do have more money, physically. 
The only difference under this system is that the money supply cannot be physically expanded, but it still creates a credit expansion past what is "safe", since it could lead to the failure of the entire bank. Fractional banking is still possible, even without a central bank. A central bank for fractional banking purposes only serves the purpose of potentially guaranteeing deposits by printing, but this is not required for fractional banking *per se*.
If you still disagree with this, read [this post](

There's no way you'd only be getting 0.39 BTC/day. Even the most ridiculous of assessments only puts the post-ASIC adoption network hashing rate at maybe 270 Th/s, with a 0.2%/day growth or so. It'll also become impossible for the current GPU miners to make any money, so there goes probably 20 Th/s. We'll likely only see the difficulty rise to 40M in the short term (next 4 months?), and that's still 0.75 BTC/day.
EDIT: Also, ASICs will be much more cost efficient than FPGAs ever were, even with the difficulty increase. You're assuming that all the FPGA and all the GPU miners adopt ASIC, which just isn't going to happen. And the best projected sales from BFL, Avalon, etc. from what we know definitely don't add any more than 300 Th/s to the network.

They are still wrong. What limits the growth is still the block reward. If the block reward was 10 BTC permanently, regardless of the difficulty in cracking, is still determined by the reward.
And each new puzzle doesn't necessarily get harder to crack. In fact, if bitcoin is underproduced, the puzzle gets easier to crack. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of how Bitcoin limits supply and growth of that supply. 
If the block reward gets larger, the growth will increase. If the block reward goes to 0, the growth will stop.
Difficulty is always set to approximate 6 blocks per hour, which means an increase in the money supply of 6*block reward every hour. Nothing to do with difficulty unless 6 blocks per hour are not achieved. Nonetheless, the difficulty doesn't set the growth, only regulates it such that the actual limit is enforced. It is the consequence, not the cause.
EDIT: I'd also like to point out that long after the growth of bitcoin supply stops, we'll likely still see difficulty changes based upon transaction costs / competition in mining. So difficulty doesn't necessarily correspond to growth or attempts to limit growth.

Yes, the question is when you break even. If you receive one sometime within the next few months, I would expect break-even in fewer than 5 months, but by then the difficulty probably will be such that you'll only be making $100 or 200 a month at best (using a BFL Little Single).
AFAIK, there are no patents, it's just really hard. And it will be essential for mining, yes.

This isn't really accurate. I mean, yes, it makes sure that it is limited, but it only limits it to the current block reward. The actual overall limiting factor for the amount of Bitcoins in existence is, of course, the block reward.

Actually, yes. If everyone wants bitcoins, the price will rise. Even to the millions, if they're perceived to be worth that much. And the value of bitcoins? Dependent on how many people want them and how many of them there are (and how much those people want them). And everyone will want a currency that is easy to use and stable. The question is, how much will they want it? And the answer to that question will likely lead to an equilibrium (the market clearing price) at which buy quantity = sell quantity. 


This is the equilibrium. If people are only buying for growth, then maybe they'll sell, but what for? Certainly not dollars at that point. Bitcoins would be so widely used, they'll have to... buy a loaf of bread?

Speculation is a means to arrive at a valuation. 
By investing in Bitcoin you are deciding to agree or disagree with the current valuation (or trend). 
One can certainly argue that the creation and implementation of Bitcoin globally constitutes the creation of wealth as it is essentially a deployment of capital to facilitate financial transfer. That effectively increases wealth for everyone involved.

It's not really copying fiat, because it is in fact backed by whatever is in the physical address, which is verifiable. 
It really would act more like a debit, though. You could treat it like cash, but it would be verified at every transaction. What I'm saying is that it wouldn't make any sense to load EXTRA if you're treating it  like cash. So while the public address should be there for verification, calling it a load address is really silly for something that's not supposed to be a debit card.

But it's unlikely that you could just spend 2 BTC in a 1 BTC world all at once. Granted, you would see inflation skyrocket -- and that would suck -- but you would think that people would be hoarding all around if there were major deflation (i.e. they would be saving, not consuming), and so there would be low interest rates because the actual supply of money is unlikely to get down to the point where a single person will be able to do what you're claiming.

A few details to critique. 
 as more transactions are done in bitcoins, it is likely that the wealth of the government would drastically decrease. Especially notice that dollars will start to be worth less and less. This brings me to 
 note that if bitcoin started to become a viable threat (insofar that it became mainstream), the value of bitcoins (and the exchange rate) would drastically increase, meaning that processing power would increase, and the relative value of mounting a 51% attack would also increase drastically in the native currency, especially if governments continues to deflate the value of their currencies. 
 a government attack on bitcoin when it is a significant part of the economy could feasibly lead to large economic problems. This could cause some issues for the governments seeking to destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-04 12:44:05
I suppose I agree in many aspects, but if we're talking strictly by definition, fiat can be debased from face value without any material modification. To debase a gold coin issued by government, I would literally have to shave off parts of the coin -- something that can be noticed and discovered. Gold certificates as money can be debased, but only if gold certificate substitutes are accepted, so that's less of the same (because this is more of a result of fractional reserve banking and not government). Now getting to fiat money -- normally paper money -- debasement is as easy as printing more, which is very difficult to discover.
So there is a slight difference, but for most purposes, I think you're right. What's important is of course that bitcoins are secure and finite, so we won't get inflation after they've all been produced (and therefore no perverse incentives to deplete savings by promoting spending).

Edit: although not particularly what you're talking about, it touches on a lot of important points.
[Won't loss of wallets and the finite amount of Bitcoins create excessive deflation, destroying Bitcoin?](
Edit2: I'd also like to point out the "21 million" is actually very approximate. It's a geometric series that converges to 21 million. However, the amount of bitcoins in the economy will constantly be growing. If deflation reaches extreme levels, mining will be profitable again without transaction fees, and in any case, the amount of bitcoins produced will probably be relevant again. The result of this would be the equivalent of a tax decrease to where individuals would have more money without the burden of transaction fees (or as much transaction fees).
@_date: 2013-02-20 17:39:34
You're making the assumption that prohibition of a medium of exchange is equivalent to prohibition of a natural commodity. This is not true.

Because everyone seems to think that we should just use Bitcoin as this cyber-transfer replacement for PayPal, and that completely misses the entire point of Bitcoin. The coins will re-enter circulation, but the net demand for bitcoins will stagnate as a vessel rather than as a store of value.

This is based on the assumption that spending is more important than saving. Hoarding is not an issue if as a result, more money becomes available in the form of loans, which allow economic growth through investment.

But he tested 1000 nonces with low difficulty and high difficulty. The SAT solving algorithm solved the 1000 nonces on high difficulty much much faster than 1000 nonces on low difficulty, probably due to failure to meet constraints. It seems like this means that it actually gets *faster* for a higher difficulty (since the length of the hash remains the same, regardless of difficulty, the input is effectively the same, but with more constraints, i.e. more leading zeroes). I think that more constraints means that the search tree is reduced, which means that higher difficulty naturally leads to lower run-time.

Sorry, I just have to point out...


Unfortunately, this is simply untrue. So I'm not sure if I should read the rest of your post.
See, everyone values a bitcoin differently. Subjectively. There is no intrinsic value to a bitcoin. There is no "true" value. In fact, there isn't even a consensus. The price reflects a bitcoin's demand per unit relative to each dollar unit, not its value. 
So is there a correct/true price? I doubt it. People will be unlikely to universally agree upon how much a bitcoin is worth, and with varying factors, like the total supply of bitcoins, it becomes unlikely that this will ever be.


This is not necessarily true, and this is not even important. And you're assuming that people don't buy back in. Or spend bitcoins for goods and services. The overarching benefit of bitcoin is going to come from stability. You see the inflation of the dollar? People are sending their money to Bitcoin not only because it's a good investment right now, but because it doesn't get inflated.

Technically loans by fractional reserves do in fact result in inflation of the money supply, due to the fact that they're based on reserves that are only a fraction of the total deposits. If 100BTC were deposited, and I loaned out 80 of them, I've effectively created 80BTC, since it is assumed that 100BTC in the back can be accessed, even though only 20BTC exist. The actual number of bitcoins themselves does not change, but the behaviour of individuals and the calculation of economic bitcoins does.
Edit: In any case, the multiplier ends up being 1/R where R is the reserve ratio for fractional reserves.

False equivalence between anarchy and disorganisation.
False assumption that government is necessary for society and organisation.
False assumption that use of what is provided implies support for the means by which such were supplied.

Not really -- you're applying laws of cryptography to the material world, but this is purely within mathematics (edit: and information exchange). This applies to information, and so that applies to Bitcoin, which is immaterial, in most senses. An example of this is in types of auctions where individuals place their bets and the highest bidder wins and pays the 2nd highest bid amount. While you could do this with a trusted authority (sending all the bids to an individual and trusting him/her to tell the correct winner and amount to pay) you can also do this very easily with cryptographic methods minus the trusted authority.

Technically Clark-Moody uses a special candle charting method. 
Basically, if it's green, the price is above the previous close, but the open of a time period is disjunct with the close of the previous. So if the price is overall lower than the close of the previous time period, but it has increased during the current time period, you would see a hollow red bar. 
Similarly, a filled green bar means that the current time period opened above the close of the last time period, but during the time period, the price has decreased. 
This allows some better interpretation of momentum. Hollow = going up now, filled = going down now, red = lower than last time, green = higher than last time.
If you're mathematically inclined, hollow and filled represent the sign of the weak derivative, while red and green represent the sign of the difference of the current price and previous close.

Nobody who ordered this month will get their device first.
The first batch of chips goes directly to satisfy orders from June to July, and the way they are distributed is the 1/3 Shipping Plan (which is a way to make sure upgrades and "new" orders -- that is, not upgrade orders that were placed from June to July -- are balanced in how they are satisfied). FIFO doesn't happen for the _rest_ of the orders until this first group of customers is satisified. It's still basically FIFO. I guess if you ordered in June and someone else ordered in July, they might get it slightly before you, but it won't be that I (ordered in January) will get mine before you if you ordered in July, IIUC.

@_date: 2013-01-02 18:53:48
I linked three different posts earlier that addressed many different facets. 
The monetary base (maxing at 21 million BTC) cannot be physically expanded. I am not depending on banks telling the truth. In fact, fractional reserve banking relies on essentially lying about how much money they have and the confidence that depositors have in the bank. Without FDIC guarantees or a lender of last resort (e.g. central bank), that means that it'll be more precarious, but not impossible, for fractional reserve banks to exist.
Of course it is dependent on the amount deposited (since that's all the banks can loan out), but the upper limit on the effective money supply is the total monetary base. That is, max(final deposits) = 21 million BTC / reserve rate. 
When I say that the money supply is expanding, that is assuming that we accept money substitutes (in this case, bank "guaranteed" numbers for our accounts) as money. In the case of a lack of confidence, the banks cease to be able to inflate. However, I feel that this would only result in higher reserve ratios, not a total lack of fractional reserve banks.
In essence, the Keynesian position just lacks mentioning about confidence in banks and therefore acceptance of money substitutes. The Austrian position on the post you reference seems to speak to exactly what you're saying, even if the language is somewhat obfuscated.
Edit: The main thing people seem to have trouble taking away is that there is a difference between the monetary base and the money supply. It is possible to inflate the money supply without increasing the monetary base. Fractional reserve banking does this through lending based on fractional reserves, giving people the impression that there's "more money" than is supported by the monetary base. That's pretty much it.
@_date: 2013-01-02 01:08:44
Actually, there would be fractional reserve banking. All it would take is loaning out any amount. A deposit/full-reserve bank doesn't create loans.
Banks effectively increase the money supply because they lend out some of their reserves, increasing the risk of not being able to supply a withdrawal demand. The money supply increases to a multiple of the reserves. If the reserve holdings are 20% of deposits, then the actual money supply has been multiplied by 5, effectively. However, these banks would most likely become more unpopular, since there would not be any way to bail them out (unlike under the current system). More bitcoins couldn't just be created to bail out those banks. It is likely then, that the change to the money supply would be relatively constant, and it would not get as out of control as would the blatant creation of bitcoins.

It's easy. Create a function that maps from R to R^2x2.
f(x) = [x x^2 ; x x^3 ]
Now we could plot those row-wise, and voila
Alternatively, if it is confusing to have an x refer to a graph (And I simplified by having x also be the x coordinate), you could just map to R^2 and consider each row a y value.

I understand what you are saying, but he explicitly states time values in seconds, so unless I'm completely misinterpreting what he's saying there, then it would seem like it breaks the difficulty system.
EDIT: Would it somehow take more nonces with higher difficulty than on lower difficulty, even though the search tree is reduced? That doesn't really make sense to me.
I guess the nonce would be longer, but that's the point of having more constraints, isn't it?

@_date: 2013-01-31 16:30:57
But with 300 of those running at ~68 Gh/s, we shouldn't see the network increase by any more than around 20 Th/s, or roughly 95% (network should about double from Avalon devices). 
That means the resultant difficulty should be about 5,700,000.
Edit: Then we assume that BFL ships another 20,000 units at an average of about 7 Gh/s, and that adds 140 Th/s to the network, which means that the resultant difficulty would be ~25,000,000 after they all come online. I'm expecting this to be sometime near the middle of April, personally. (I also think they're inflating their numbers a bit, and expect the difficulty to only be at about 19,700,000 around that time.

When you bet closer to the event, you get less of a payout, while the individuals who betted earlier make more. This gives you more of an incentive to bet early, which makes bets gain momentum if they're interesting.

So the idea is kind of muddled the way it was presented.
Here's what they're really saying:

@_date: 2013-01-07 15:44:18
Test buys wouldn't be sufficient. Just because the merchants don't charge the tax to the consumer doesn't mean they're not complying with the tax. They could simply claim the tax is part of their price so long as the tax finds its way to the government (and it would be difficult to prove that Bitcoin transactions had actually happened in this case).

Strategy does play a role in the frequency and severity of losses. For example, use of a Martingale depends on statistical awareness that a series of losses is very unlikely (as is a series of victories). In the short term, this can be profitable (although, of course, still up to chance). Having very large reserves enables the Martingale to play more effectively. If you were to have 100 BTC, and you start a Martingale round at 0.01 BTC, you would have to lose 13 times in a row before you would no longer be able to bet. When betting on SatoshiDice's 36%, this will occur 0.3% of the time. 
So the luck is simply whether you get that losing streak early or late. Now you can probably see *how* such a strategy can be effective, and it is based on the thought that for relatively few rounds of the Martingale, it is unlikely to happen (just as you would say that a 99.7% win rate is almost a guaranteed victory). This is markedly better than betting at random (as this will more quickly put you at the mercy of house rolls unless you get lucky once).
But at 100 BTC, 0.3% of all rounds will absolutely bankrupt you, which is of course, a very frightening prospect. 
Only wager that which you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-02-07 14:39:56
I'm not sure, but my impression is that they'll initially have something like 20,000 units to ship overall. Given their track record on shipping other products, once they ship, I'd guess they get something like 5,000 units out per week (maybe ~40 Th/s/w), if we're lucky.

Look, you want stability, but stability leads to more liquidity through greater acceptance. More liquidity increases the price, which causes volatility. So stability causes volatility and volatility also (unsurprisingly) is volatile. 
So what do you do?
Well, right now, you want to put the cart before the horse. Instead, the liquidity has to come first. Once a considerable amount of business accept bitcoins, for example, then the upside of bitcoins will start to self-limit (since the most you can do is have everyone accept them). Right now the market penetration of bitcoin is so low that it's heavily volatile. 
This reduction in potential liquidity will naturally lead to reduced upswings. This will cause the value of bitcoins to stabilise. 
Of course there's a catch: what businesses are going to accept a highly volatile currency that likely will become more volatile before it becomes more stable? *Those that think they can make money.* Businesses that really want to grab the Bitcoin market by the throat could offer huge discounts to users of Bitcoin with the expectation of increased value. (This will incentivise already-established businesses to do the same if they start losing market share just because of payment options)
The number of THOSE businesses is pretty low. Why? It's pretty risky. What if the price of bitcoins doesn't increase? Well, those judgements are supposed to be made by entrepreneurs. No risk, no reward.
If you really want stability and you believe in Bitcoin, start a business. and offer steep discounts for bitcoins. The price of Bitcoins will eventually skyrocket, and then stabilise in the long run.

I fear that the result of this will be to -- for lack of a better term -- "peg" the demand for bitcoins to the demand for fiat currencies. If the devaluation of such currencies reduces demand for the currencies, Bitcoin would suffer, while realisation of Bitcoin as a currency-commodity allows recognition that bitcoins can be advantageous in any scenario. I almost wish that there would be a service that would allow payments in USD and automatically transfer bitcoins to the merchant instead.

Probability. There are 2^160 addresses available. In order to have a 1x10^-5 % probability of a collision, you would probably have to try (at random) in the neighbourhood of 1.5x10^40 addresses. 
Looking at [this]( chart, we can make a reasonable assumption that over ~2 years so far, there have been an average of about 25,000 unique bitcoin addresses used each day (being generous), which is about 18,000,000 to date.
That means of all the total addresses that would be in existence after attempting a collision (today), about 1x10^-33 of them would be "real" addresses. This means that to get a "reasonable" probability of collision with a true address using brute force, there would need to be something like 10^30 times more addresses. Even if a trillion real addresses were generated every day for 100 years, you would still need ~3x10^13 more real addresses to exist have a 1/10^10 chance of getting a collision with a real address.
Of course, you could always just get lucky.

The total supply, yes, but not the marginal supply. The difficulty adjusts based on overproduction or underproduction dependent on whether the difficulty was too high or too low. So if the actual hash rate of the network increases dramatically before the end of a difficulty period, you could see a lot more bitcoins mined than should have been, and the difficulty will slingshot upwards accordingly -- but not until the next week. But basically the supply will increase more than it would have until it readjusts.
