A friend of mine got interested in bitcoin beginning of 2017. Told him to buy btc. He thought price was too high and wanted to buy lower. Btc went up all through 2017, he never bought the dips. Finally, in November he wanted to buy.  He did, but then drank the alt cool-aid and started telling me that bitcoin was outdated, slow, old tech and praised ripple, cardano and electroneum. I really tried to talk him out of this. He invested his live savings. And lost 95%

Why less appealing? The fact that lost coins are gone forever just shows how incredibly secure the network is. No hacker, no government, no agency, no company - no one ever can move your funds. As long as you keep your private keys: Your keys, your funds. But also: No keys, no funds.  For the first time in the digital age, something digital is actually scarce. Digital scarcity is one of bitcoins key features.

imho it is the total confusion in the entire crypto field that causes such articles.  half the people don´t get the basic difference between the computerscience breakthrough called bitcoin and the scams called altcoins. the other half thinks that a simple name for the way an apend-only database is organised is the "underlying tech behind" bitcoin and keep telling us that this buzzword will change the world. what a shitshow.

a private key is a "number" that allows you to move the funds related to the private key. it is literally a key. the trezor device keeps your keys offline. The seed list you get when you initiate your trezor IS this that key "number" -just encrypted as a word list.  if you lose, destroy your trezor or if it gets stolen or if you can´t find it anymore, you can take your seed list and punch the seed list into a new trezor, which will then make your bitcoins (keys) re-appear on the new device. 
anyone who finds your seed list and figures out what that 24 word list is, can do the same. so it is very important to:
\- never store the word list and the trezor at the same spot. even a minor fire can destroy both at the same time = btc lost forever
\-hide your word list very well and have copies at a different location (in case of fire) 
\-don´t put "bitcoin seed" or "trezor seed"  as a headline on that piece of paper.

what you experience is the same that lots of other bitcoiners who "have seen the light" made. It is nice to know that even those who began as altcoiners are capable of seeing through all the garbage and lies the shitcoin marketing industry is pouring out.  i also found it strange that especially IT folks, who should be able to grasp the beautiful concept of bitcoin, are dismissing it even harder than average people.  maybe because they know what a joke the internet is when it comes to security/safety they can not imagine that of all places it is really the internet that has born the first ledger in human history that cannot be forged/altered/changed secretly.

Great answer. Altcoins are no technical competition, but the altcoin market as a whole competes with bitcoin for investment money. 50% market dominance means that a big chunk of invested money goes into scams = into the pockets of the altcoin issuer.

[ 
This article from May 2011 made me immediately send some money to MtGox in Tokyo. Btc price was around $8. It took the banks several weeks to get my money to MtGox. It arrived at the day of the forst major peak of $31. I bought right away and from that moment price started to fall all the way down to $2. 
If I would have waited until November of 2011 I could have scored 1000 btc. If there had been a way to transfer money quicker to Tokyo I would have scored 350 btc.  I did buy 100 btc back then. Sold all of them in 2013 when price went above $60...  Price went over $1k in 2013.
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:10:23
No, I don´t close any door. If there are improvements possible they should be included into the bitcoin protocol. 
Your definition of decentralized seems to differ from how I view decentralized:
decentralized is like being pregnant. a women can be pregnant or not, but not "more pregnant" or "a little pregnant". If a crypto is decentralized it has no single point of failure. Only bitcoin falls under this category. All alts have single point of failures = not decentralized = scams. 
80% hashpower in a single country?  China dominance is a fairy tale. Can you present any facts about your 80% claim?

If any newbie happens to read this thread he/she will really get confused. The sheer amount of misunderstandings, wrong perceptions and false analogies must be overwhelming. Bitcoin is our only chance for monetary freedom. It is a historic chance and we have only one shot at it. Altcoins are private companies with mostly nothing but a big marketing devision. Altcoins are the opposite of monetary freedom.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:52:33
Interesting. When btc had its first bear market (bubble popped...) almost no one expected it to come back. Usually bubbles create such a brutal bear that stupid stuff doesn´t get a comeback.   Now bitcoin is going through its 3rd or 4th bear. It is not set in stone that it will make a comeback. But all the shitcoins are clearly dead. No comeback for complete bullshit (=all alts). I don´t get why people think alts will come back. None of them has a use case. No demand other than speculation. It is like speculating on airline miles. I mean you could speculate on airline miles - but not after the fact the airline mile bubble has popped. No one believes the shitcoin narrative anymore. There will be no comeback. Get out of alts and get (back?) into the only thing that has a chance to turn around yet another time: bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-01-22 19:15:14
Well I guess me asking politely for some examples is not working here.  No single entity owns the bitcoin protocol or can force any protocol changes on the users.  In contrast to that e v e r y  altcoin project is either owned by companies, or a small group of people that control circulation/issuance and/or other important parameters completely. Not a single altcoin is decentralized as bitcoin is.  As they are a l l not decentralized, they are controlled by people that do it for profit. Those people have a strong monetary interest to sell you their shitcoin. Because the money goes to them in their big pre-mine pockets. Not the same with the only decentralized crypto which is bitcoin.  
Now, if you doubt my statement please give an example about an altcoin that is decentralized = not a scam.  It is really much easier to talk about some examples than to go through several thousand altcoin projects in a single post.  Honest question: do you really think that there are altcoins that are not scams? Which ones?

That is the hodler´s dilemma.  Everyone is asking me why I haven´t sold at the top.  The thing is: If it was an easy thing to do for me to let those "once-in-alifetime-chance-to-escape-the-rat-race" coins go, I would have sold at $250 or $600 or $1800 or $2500. The only reason I own bitcoin is because it is almost impossible for me to sell them. I just cannot do it. I wanted to sell at $14k and $12k, but could not. Sold significant part of my stash around $8.5k and it felt terrible. Well, yes and fuck me, I bought back way to early. Buying btc... easy, fun, cool. Selling btc... a psychological nightmare.

There will be at least one more huge run-up. Wallstreet and big money have witnessed the 20x btc did in 2017. They looked closer and found out about the 100x in price of 2013. They know the protocol is robust. They don´t trust the Mt gox kind of exchanges, so they are just building their own infrastructure/onramp. Next bull run will be epic. Maybe in two years, maybe in 5 years, but it will blow fiat value of btc hodlers into the stratosphere.

This is the power of online marketing. The scammers are still able to lure every 2nd dollar invested towards their hot air scam ballons. When will people learn?   Imagine the internet in the 90ies. Huge potential. Imagine marketing idiots trying to come up with 2000(!) "better" internet protocols, not willing to contribute towards the real internet, but instead scamming the sheeps into "new internets".  What a shitshow.

A btc buyer that does not suffer a 40% dive right after he invested will not become hardened enough to keep his stash through the future ups and downs. Even through the super-bull year of 2017, when the price went 20x within 12 months, there were 40% dives. Scary dives. Be thankful if it does go down another 40% before bull cycle starts again. You bought close enough to the bottom. I had sold 2/3 of my stash around $8.5K but I bought back to early. Got to greedy when I found out that I almost double my stash.
