Charts like this can indicate orders coming through an exchange with forged timestamps, i.e. not in proper chronological order. Or it could just be a glitch :)

price of the inconvenience and fees of cashing out to dollars is priced into Polo bitcoin usd valuation. Doesn't matter a shade if the sell price on coinbase is also $20 higher and that's where you cash out USD.

BU fork is absolutely going to happen, and those comparing it to "violence" are acting like ridiculous cry-bullies.
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:26:35
At this rate bitcoin will hard-fork to BU in no time! :)
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:58:42
All I hear is core shills spreading FUD, while the price of BTC drops through the floor. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:33:22
No it's not. Manufactured consensus is a despicable tactic.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:21:16
BU has more hashpower than segwit. BU is BTC now, get used to it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:17:49
hahahaha. no.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:56:59
That will become an untenable position once the majority hash-power forks to the BU chain. Unless they like waiting 2 weeks for confirmations on a minority fork.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:09:52


That's pretty ridiculous. Satoshi consensus is a proof-of-work system and that system is designed to protect the rules of the network from cybil attack. If you want to change the rules of the network, you need 51%+ of the mining power. That's how bitcoin works and that's how it was described in the bitcoin White Paper.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:33:27
No it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:59:12
Interesting. LTB profile pages look quasi-broken recently... 
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:46:48
This is insanity. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:57:02
Doesnt matter. Volume went to nearly zero on those exchanges. Everyone switched to localbitcoins and they can't stop it. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:55:01
All it needs is support from the miners. That's how Nakamoto consensus works. That's how Satoshi designed bitcoin. If you want a coin that can have the rules changed by a popularity contest or a central cabal of programmers, what you want is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:52:14
Funny, thats exactly how I would describe Blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:37:00
Yep, he also set the original blocksize at 32MB.

Food stamps are already paid for using money stolen from the citizens in the first place, so they are really just "repatriating" the food.

Funny, Armory project died from lack of developer support, right?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:50:58
My prediction is that there will only be one BTC going forward, and it will run on the BU chain. IF BU hard-forks with a majority of the mining power, then BU is BTC, and BlockStreamCoin is just BSCoin. A smaller chain with a smaller hashpower is not bitcoin, and it won't even survive even two blocks without a HF difficulty adjustment to keep a "minority fork" alive.
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:50:28
So you want those people to shut up, is what you are saying? lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:11:43
Oh absolutely, it will happen soon. It will only take the support of one or two more mining groups for BU to have 51% support from the miners. Support is defined by the signals embedded in the blocks they find. I would definitely advocate for a contentious 51% fork at this time to implement on-chain scalability and to "eject the core" from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:07:59
Cool. Do it after we merge an update for bigger blocks, and flextrans to solve malleabillity afterwards.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:00:55


Except that BU has more support from miners than segwit signalling. The largest miner in the world just started signalling for BU. If there is a BU fork, it will be with at least 51% of the hashpower, meaning if any other chain wants to survive, they will have to hard-fork their difficulty to remain a longer chain. Meaning Segwit would be a HF altcoin, BlockstreamCoin (BSC).
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:48:52
Looks like a segwit cybil attack to me. BU has more hashpower, which is the only thing that matters. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:44:41
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:57:01
It will be funny when the BU fork occurs and this guy has to eat crow for supporting the core.
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:02:22
Pretty sure this is what they're going to try in China also. You want to withdraw bitcoins from exchange? Gotta put them in a state-held multisig wallet and then ask for their permission every time you need to make a transaction. It's sort of like having an account at a state-sanctioned bank, where they hold your bitcoin instead of you.
@_date: 2017-01-26 12:19:20
Thanks for your pedantic insults. I will make a note to downvote your shit in the future.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:55:29


Hope those other payment corridors open up soon! Do you really think it's likely that the US-Mexico remittance corridor could get shut down?
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:21:10
Yep their Mexico corridor would specifically get shut down by this law. They transfer dollars to pesos, that's US-Mexico remittance. No bank in the US would service them.

Boycott Trezor. Fuck segwit and fuck Blockstream.

There's no chance Segwit will ever activate on bitcoin. Erik lost all my respect for siding with the core on this issue.
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:10:28
Because of segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-25 03:42:44
Literally makes no sense. The flipside of that could read "Andreas says bitcoin mining could be 2000% more energy efficient, and opposes it."
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:09:44
SegwitCoin is not Bitcoin. The time for comprimise is over, you killed that idea in Hong Kong. Let's hard-fork to Bitcoin Unlimited instead. Time to eject the "core".
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:41:28
Boycott Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:26:45
How can I make sure that I don't accept any coins that have gone through a soft-forked transaction chain?
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:39:54
I will never hold or accept Litecoin for payment, specifically because of this. SegwitCoin is for central bankers and shills.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:39:10
God, I fucking hate "economists".
@_date: 2017-04-10 02:29:56
The miners decide what is the "most-used" implementation. There's no consensus mechanism in git pull request merging, as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:42:19
If you choose a fork that doesn't have majority of miner support, you are picking something that is not Bitcoin. SegwitCoin, I guess, we can call it. Or BankCoin. Not Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:50:55
Cool story, child.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:09:09
Sure it is, shill. Go pump and dump some more altcoins. Segwit is a scam.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:14:01
Sounds like a backroom deal among banksters trying to control the fate of bitcoin. We need more people to get into mining and support BU.

Can't wait till the Segwit debate is over, and the "core" is ejected, and we finally have on-chain scaling, with Bitcoin Unlimited.
