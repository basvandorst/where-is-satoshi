you write a hash of that something to the blockchain, so you can later proof that that samething has existed since you wrote it's hash to the blockchain.
now, the question is - how do you  generate a reproducible hash from physical objects (i.e. air jordans) ?

you want someone to sell you btc without even attempting to get authorization for the CC transaction? good luck with that.
there is nothing stopping you to steal the bitcoins after the fact. you can reverse the charge by calling your CC and telling them it was not authorized, because it wasn't. you get a refund and whoever sold you the bitcoins gets fuckt

that's not how most exchanges operate. fees to buy are usually some small %, not a fixed amount. so buying in chunks wont cost more.... unless the price shoots up in the interim.

short story: i ordered 1 of these mugs the other day  from pimp'd [same seller i assume]( , paid $15.xx with PAYPAL (OH NOES /s)
then the mail broke my mug, (i think they broke it while inspecting it wasnt DM drugz, because the international package looked a bit susps without a return address).  so i paypal dispute that bitch quick. to send a replacement the seller asked for evidence (a pic) ; and now i am waiting and hoping mail doesn't break it. 
moral of the story: how would i have disputed damaged goods on openbazaar? this seller seems to be honest, but the question still stands.

for years fee use to be 1%, then they jacked it to 1.5% but with min of 15 cents, so buying less than $10 meant you over paid
since the other day the fees changed to some sort of sliding scale 
* $1.99 for buying $100-200, 
* $2.99 for $200-300
* 2.99+ some % for &gt; $300
on top of the inflated price a few dollars GDAX spot price.
