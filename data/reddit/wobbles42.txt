There is a piece of paper, right?  A corporate charter?  It's a person.  We can jail it.  Physically take the document, and lock it in a cell.  Give it a cell mate.  Hopefully it doesn't get torn up.
All the people doing business under that name?  Guess they aren't a registered corporation anymore.  Can't access assets.  Can't do business.
It would only take about three of these before the bullshit stopped.

Redhat in particular is a major US military contractor.  They are also the ones funding a large amount of low level kernel development, as well as systemd.
I've never seen any hard evidence to back the conspiracy theory that Redhat is deliberately increasing complexity and attack surfaces in the Linux ecosystem, but it does kind of make you think.

Individual creditors are acting rationally.  It is only in aggregate that the system is irrational.

You reverse engineered his proprietary algorithm.  To prison with you!

This is why more and more people have above average IQ's.  As the average goes down, it becomes an easier bar to clear.

No individual creditor does this.  It is the commercial banking system acting in aggregate that causes this situation.
Each individual creditor acts rationally.  The trouble is that all (or at least many) creditors lend on a fractional reserve basis.  Each dollar is lent more than once, so there are potentially multiple dollars of interest due on each dollar.  No individual creditor expects default -- but the math says it *has* to happen somewhere when the growth stops.
The same phenomenon would happen with Bitcoin if it were lent on a fractional reserve basis.  This phenomenon is a product of the lending system.  It ends up being worse with fiat because you can have organizations that print money to keep the system stable, so it grows larger before it collapses.
We had banking bubbles back on the gold standard though, and if finance moves to Bitcoin we'll have Bitcoin denominated banking collapses too.

This is analogous to the bank situation.
When one party controls enough hash rate, they determine the "consensus" view of the ledger.  Your bank is effectively in this position with your accounts 100% of the time.  There are reputation and legal disincentives for them to abuse this position, but the degenerate case of "cryptocurrency" when someone monopolizes the hash rate is essentially "unlicensed unregulated bank".

Oh, it was a joke.
