Stifling innovation is a big con. We've come so far in such little time without it. Sad to see things grind to a halt.

We are at a point were node saturation has occurred. For every additional node on Earth the marginal benefit is diminishing considering the nature of the vector attacks which threaten bitcoin. Efforts should be directed into setting up several nodes in space. A few on the Moon and at least one on Mars to ensure the longevity of Bitcoin in the face of a much better funded and equiped adversary

Coinspot won't even load the deposit option page since last week.
BTC markets has stopped Poli payments but looks like it still accepts Bpay.
Which exchange do you use Paypal with?
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:56:19
Of course there is. Proof of work is the only trust protocol which exchanges a commodity (value separate to the underlying asset) for the security of the network. Proof of stake, proof of importance e.t.c are essentially backed by themselves. If the cost of securing the blockchain went to zero (think perpetual renewable energy) then the security of the network and hence the price of bitcoin would be compromised. In other words, the less the securitizers have to lose the less secure the network becomes as a result of opportunity costs.

Those coins are purchased with coins which were purchased with fiat which was obtained by individuals who are on the balance of probabilities from first world countries and therefore also on the balance of probabilities indebted.
I have a suspicious feeling your attitude would change if you found out it would prevent the death of your mother or child or sibling. If you were genuinely willing to sacrifice your own family only then would i respect your belief.

A crypto mule is like a drug mule, except instead of drugs they conceal a node.

Fiat is any money lacking intrinsic value. That which is given legal tender by centralized authority with no value added at any point. Bitcoin derives intrinsic value from the blockchain, and in extension, thermodynamic expenditure. If faith were to vanish overnight, trust and hence intrinsic value remains. The same can not be said about fiat. That's the difference.

Innovation at the cost of innovation.
Less of more or less of less? which is more concerning?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:32:49
My argument is that the marginal benefit of an extra node on Earth's surface is rapidly diminishing and that new nodes should be setup any other place except for this. It is the same philosophy as when you diversify your crypto-portfolio. I would gladly sacrifice 1000 nodes on earth for a node in space.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:23:08
Yes. I would cash up to the eyeballs in Tether and hope the ship stays afloat long enough for me to make my fiat conversion/withdrawal - which takes a minimum of 3 days according to my exchange.

Coinspot has a message saying all AUD deposits have been stopped (from all banks) until further notice, and i heard the other Australian exchanges are similar. This started less than a week ago.

No, i think your partially incorrect chowder. ludvig - To use your metaphor i would tell them to vary their exercises because that would increase their gains due to muscle confusion a lot more than doing the same exercise thousands of times. Only nation states have the capability of taking out a satellite in orbit but any terrorist group can get their hands on an EMP. None of this is really important at this point though. I agree further node expansion on Earth is sufficient for now.

thanks, ill check it out
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:47:25
Most of the nodes on Earth are subject to the same attack vectors. For instance, an EMP attack could take out a cities nodes, illegality could (over a sustained time) close down a countries nodes and solar flare half the worlds. We need to distribute nodes across as many known and unknown vectors as we can. Think undisclosed remote locations, bottom of the ocean, miles underground in bore holes, crypto mules, space, black holes, parallel universes, Justin Bieber concerts etc.

If bitcoin reaches projected growth levels the only choice you will have is to use your fiat for toilet paper. Even then it's not so great as most are plastic.
I understand your textbook premise against inflation and debt, but with that attitude you will literally never get to the moon. Debt will take you and your friends to the moon stopping at perpetual energy village, cancer free town and global cooling city along the way.

Investors seem to think the only way is up. This is just a reminder that there are far more variables which could lead to a crash than there are for continued booms.

@_date: 2017-12-26 03:22:30
That is correct. It is a hybrid. Given the cumulative cost of energy used to secure the network since 2008 there will likely never be another protocol which can match its level of security. Hence the decision of most new coins to adopt other less costly methods (POS,POI etc). If you were to skim speculation of the top of its market cap today bitcoin's price would not drop below the intrinsic value attributable to the cost of securing the network. it will continue to become more valuable given it's proof of work monopoly which will be used as a cornerstone foundation of trust for not only existing and new software but also crypto-currencies in general.

By "we" are you including the NSA, CIA, Mossad and other well-funded deep government entities who have consistently proven to be a the forefront of cryptographic developments?

Go ahead, remove the post. Control and curb open debate instead of countering with argument in order to strengthen your position. Bitcoin is nothing special. It can be duplicated by the banks with the added benefit of fraud detection and the introduction of multi-sig accounts subject to judicial review.

All seems good unless Bitcoin tanks, lightning network fails, lightning network succeeds but leads to bank owned hubs, tether continues to print tokens and fails, bitconnect ponzi collapses, ethereum gets hacked, unfavourable regulation is passed, bitcoin energy costs get too high, bitcoin mining fees drop too much, Monero bulletproofs succeeds, optional privacy fails, exchanges require KYC/AML reporting and public keys are recorded by government giving them a list of every coin any person using an exchange has purchased, privacy coins are deemed illegal (coupled with KYC/AML exchanges), Bitcoin is found to be created by deep government like SHA256 or Tor, Satoshi sells his 5% (now 8% considering burnt tokens) stake in bitcoin, Large whales sell their stakes in bitcoin, other countries follow chinas lead in banning exchanges, central governments release their own tokens (like russia is planning to do) and require all taxes/rates be paid in that token, the internet becomes centralised due to the repeal of net neutrality laws, bitcoin or monero is found to be use din a major terrorist attack, bitcoin or Monero is found to being used more and more for drug trafficking, the 1% of fiat holders (rothschilds) decide to purchase a major portion of the crypto market using a small portion of their fiat, quantum computers developed by deep government are found to be able to match public keys to private ones... I will stop there because i have other things to do.

Loaning doesn't drive innovation when your merely reshuffling the distribution of a static monetary supply.

Yeah, this is a recent thing. Looks like BTC still accepts Bpay. I guess i could use Bpay to purchase Bitcoin there and then send the bitcoin to my Coinspot Bitcoin wallet to then exchange it for Altcoins. 
Shit that we have to go through this hassle/double rate payments as if investing in crypto is illegal.
