If there are fake accounts with negative balances they will show up in the tree. If you look at "Extracting tree for mark" at  you see values and corresponding hashes. If somewhere down in the tree are negative balances they would show up in this tree.

You can use the “double and add” algorithm explained [here]( under the “scalar multiplication” section. It is however a lot of work to do it by hand, you’re better of using a crypto library like libsecp256k1

Such a system could probably be created with Ethereum

Yes it has to publish all nodes between the user and the root. But the total amount of each node is given by the sum of each nodes below that. So adding fake accounts with negative balance will show up at some point along the tree. If they are far down the tree they might not show up for everyone (since at some point they might cancel out with other balances) but they are guaranteed to show up for some people.

I think you are making a mistake in reasoning (or maybe I am haha). But the point of putting negative balance somewhere in the tree is to lower the total amount (=the top of the tree), to make people think the exchange only has, say, x-1000 BTC instead of x BTC.  
If you put a fake account with -1000 BTC, and counter it with a fake +1000 BTC, you don't gain anything. The total amount is still x. 
If you have a insider who actually owns 1000 BTC and pair it with a fake -1000 BTC, the total amount reported will be x-1000. But this insider owns the 1000BTC so the total amount owned by the exchange is actually x-1000 + 1000 = x BTC. So the point is, if you want to steal y BTC from the exchange you actually have to own this y BTC, meaning you are not stealing from the exchange at all, but simply moving around your own money. The only difference is basically whether you include your own money in the calculation of the total amount or not.
Edit: to add to this, say your co-conspirator isn't actually someone that works for the exchange but some external person. You steal y BTC and everything is OK, no one is the wiser. But this breaks down when your co-conspirator tries to withdraw his money. When he does this, the actual amount the exchange owns (provable with the blockchain) is now smaller than the amount it should have, thus notifying people something is wrong.

You are right, a single private key is 256 bits. But under [BIP32]( you can use a master seed of up to 512 bits to generate a whole bunch of them :)
