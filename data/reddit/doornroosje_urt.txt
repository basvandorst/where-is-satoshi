I don't see news-sites charging per article. The news world is changing a lot in the last years already and is already becoming more dependant on advertising than ever to battle 'free' news being publicised just about everywhere.  The music industry, yes, I can see this. The film industry as well, as a crowdfunding kind of thing. Gaming industry maybe, but it'll take someone to budge.

To be honest, I started exactly a week ago today. I had heard of bitcoin before but that was about it. It was extremely helpful to get a few bits so that I could send them between my online and offline wallet to really understand what happened. I don't think there's anything wrong with people wanting tips to get them started.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:20:48
Haha, it was a little bit, but I do tend to agree. The only way is up!
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:59:54
Silver is the safer option. Bitcoins could bring higher profit margins. No one can truthfully say what you should do but you.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:30:49
Exactly! And the more people want bitcoins, and the more businesses accept bitcoin, the more we all win!
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:51:06
I highly doubt that they have someone in charge of their twitter account that is in a position to take the money. It's most likely a PR person, who should have no control over the money.  
I will be donating to Children in Need as I do every year, but for something that I value so highly I want to make sure the money gets there, and not unimportant, I want to make 100% sure it goes to the right person/organisation.
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:41:40
That's awesome. Hopefully we will all be talking about the days where we got 40 bits by talking about 40 bitcoins on some reddit thread in a few years! ;)

At the end of the day, bitcoin is a currency. Currency is used to buy stuff, and if you need the cash for Christmas then you made the right call. Sometimes people get so caught up in saving and hoarding because they might one day get rich from it, that they forget what it actually is they are holding.  
Good on you for finding a purpose for your cash, and hopefully we see you 'invest' again soon.

I'm not sure if it's Changetip or not, but the downward trend seems to be broken for now regardless. What Changetip definitely does is create more interest in the general concept, which in time creates acceptance.

I think going towards popular bloggers/celebrities/technology knowitalls etc. in the hope they tell their following about the merits of Bitcoin might be the best shout for exposure.

It's alright. The rollercoaster is good for the market. A bubble(implicating a massive fall afterwards) would be far worse than the current state of affairs.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:35:09
I have decided to base my tipping to popular vloggers on youtube. Follow my lead and tip them with at least 2$. The more people get involved, the more chance we have of these people making a vlog about us that will attract A LOT of attention!    
  
     
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
So far no tips are collected, but I'm sure if we add more, they will just have to check it out!

You played with multiple wallets to test them and sent 10.09 bitcoin around? Bloody hell mate. I sent 10 satoshis back and forth for that purpose just in case something went wrong! I hope you find it back somehow, but I'm afraid they may be lost unless you find access to the wallet again..
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:17:17
I would love to believe this. I think changetip is great for the community and as a result for the price of bitcoin. It generates a lot of interest, and hopefully many more people that want to own bitcoins. In my opinion the price can only increase, especially if we hopefully get some famous people on board too.
Really though, you pluck prices out of thin air. The fact that you think the basic unit will be bit, does not mean the price will automatically increase to represent bits being the same value as cents.
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:34:53
I would love being able to use changetip on steam. I imagine Valve would rather make a system of their own that would benefit them alone though.  Also, I hope the techies reference was not a fluke.

I moved from the netherlands to the uk and went to open a bank account. I had great difficulty as all banks found I had no credit history in the uk. It took me going to 4 different banks before the Bank of Scotland took me in on an extremely basic account. (Can only take out money at their machines/no interest) Made me feel like a criminal.

You link your reddit, youtube, twitter etc account on  You create a wallet there and move funds between freely.
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:14:07
I've mentioned this on a few posts recently, the problem that we face is that we're depending on third parties that already make their money. Bitcoin being accepted in game stores is one thing, and might eventually happen, but whenever people make posts like this they want in-game microtransaction to be in bitcoin as well, and quite frankly, and game developer would rather use a self-made system that they control so that they earn more money out of it.  I agree that the gaming industry would be ideal for bitcoin to move into, but I fear we will face a long and difficult struggle before we get there.
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:58:00
Unfortunately there aren't many places to buy bitcoin via paypal because of chargeback risks. You can definitely buy parts of bitcoin in many places via a credit or debit card though.

@_date: 2014-11-14 14:12:03
To be honest, I would avoid tipping their twitter account because we have no idea who holds the password to the account. I know the organisation is huge, and in a way that only makes it less secure. It is likely many people have access to it, and the chance of theft (no matter how unlikely as they all promote the charity even more so than we do as donators), is there. Don't underestimate how chaotic things will be for the organisation tonight. There will be hundreds of extra people in helping them out that normally wouldn't, and with so many areas to focus on, they may just lose sight of what happens to this extra source of income they didn't even know they had. Until we know that a secure changetip account is set up by the organisation I find it too risky.  It would be a far better idea to try and contact them and have them set up an account either in advance (now) or after tonight.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:32:56
I definitely think that exposure for changetip and bitcoin is extremely important. For the same reason I've been tipping vloggers and bloggers on youtube and twitter recently. I think your sentiment towards exposure is great.  
Of course the risk is relatively small, and I am probably overly concerned. At the end of the day, all donations today are very important, and I'm very glad that there are more ideas coming along to raise money and awareness every year. I'll high five you for trying to come up with something new!  
In any case I strongly believe in the charity and I hope that regardless of tips happening or not, they bring in a load of money today. (And I'm obviously looking forward to S club 7 reforming tonight as much as the next guy)

I don't really understand how this would make any difference from him just turning his dollars into bitcoins after the sale, but it adds to visibility and credibility of the coin, I guess.

They do get paid. Reputable artists have put their items into tournament tickets for a small percentage of the ticket sales for years.
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:43:15
When we tip youtube channels, we should probably aim for vloggers, bloggers etc. PEople who can spread the word of bitcoin onto potentially hundreds, if not thousands of people. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:36:20
May the coin be back on the up from here onwards!
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:56:23
They can co-exist. There is no reason to choose one or the other. Coinbase has an easier implementation into existing websites, but changetip has a huge advantage on social media and forums.

The most I have tipped myself was multiple instances of $5 for tipping Tuesday on youtube.  
The highest I received I think was $5 as well from the changetip ceo for giving feedback on the system in its current state and what I think could/should be improved.

That's if you only count reddit. I intend to tip a lot via youtube tomorrow!
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:52:11
It sure looks like it. I'm convinced changetip has something to do with that.
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:48:12
Accessibility of information is extremely important. And sensible person wants to know exactly what they get when they spend money. If we want to convince the world to adopt bitcoin as their currency of choice, we need to be able to put down compelling arguments why exactly it's the better choice. And we can only do that by highlighting the currencies weaknesses.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:16:19
I'm not really sure what is causing this. I think it's safe to assume we are on the way up, and some people are cashing out early to make some profit. Ofcourse these people think the market will get a downward trend, but really it's them that cause the instability. When they've all dumped we can only go up.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:18:52
This is my wet dream.
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:56:01
I've made 8 $5 tips last Tuesday to youtube vloggers. None of them are collected either. To be honest, I don't mind too much. It just means I have more tips to make next Tuesday!
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:48:07
I've noticed a huge difference in outlook from the media and I think real bitcoin enthusiasts are finally being listened to. Our arguments for the currency are very strong, and the belief in the system appears to be rising. Now all we need is more wider media attention.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:17:28
Alright. Firstly, $8.000 dollar would really not influence the price of bitcoin one way or the other, so don't worry about that. If the price is to go up even 1 cent, it won't be because of your 8k. At 8k, you're still a small fish, no matter how crazy to you this may sound.  
In general, investing in Bitcoin could definitely be something to look into. Always be sure to look into the market though. Look at the trend for a while, and try to be as sure as you can that you step in at the right moment. You can try placing an order below the current price. You 'might' miss out if the price only rises from now on, but in the most likely case you'll be able to buy slightly cheaper than you otherwise would have.

That's brilliant! I imagine it might be a lot easier for a lot of people in China and Korea too. Who would have thought though, that we would hear success stories from Africa already, even though a big part of Africa has hardly seen computers. This story really pleases me.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:04:52
Well, they need value eventually, but the biggest thing they need is acceptance. A currency that no one accepts can't keep itself afloat. Once people start accepting the coin as currency the value will increase on its own accord.  
Some cryptocurrencies plan to specialise in certain areas. To name a few, Reddcoin is aiming to be the 'social' coin. They are working on networks that would make sending redds to friends and family as easy as 1 click. Even easier than with changetip. Another example is the Guldencoin. The Guldencoin is trying to gain popularity among Dutch citizens who would like to see the Netherlands step out of the Eurozone.  
A lot of altcoins fail and many more will continue to fail, but the reason they exist is because there is room for more coins eventually. it's just that they are trying to figure out where the room is and how they can step into it.

Personally I use electrum on my pc. It has a very simple layout and works flawlessly.
@_date: 2014-11-09 11:49:32
It didn't go wrong perse. The problem with extreme rise of value is that many people jump ship the second the price rise stagnates. As soon as people jump ship, the value drops. What you need to remember is that the general trend is what's important. Since two years to now, the general trend has been for the price to go up. Short term market effects shouldn't matter too much, and that includes the peak of last year.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:46:20
Firstly, my comment was in no way specific to this lad in Ghana. While he has obviously had access to computers without any problem, I don't see evidence anywhere that my statement was wrong. Secondly, the definition of bigotry is as follows:    
"Bigotry is a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.[1] Some examples include personal beliefs, race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or other group characteristics."  
  
While my comment may be ignorant to some extend('may', as again, I don't see you disproving my statement), it's far from bigoted as my comment makes it very clear that there is no dislike in the slightest. Again, in your own words. Try educating yourself.

Faucets are definitely a possibility, but be aware of VERY slow process. A lot of faucets have extremely low payout, and have a minimum you need to get before you can withdraw. It may take weeks before you get anything.  As for this subreddit being friendly to beginners, it is to some extend, but you might find more suited to your needs. Good luck!

Ultimately the price going up means more people buy bitcoins, or less people sell them.  
To get the answer you are looking for, it is likely that the price going up is generated by a lot of recent interest. Stories of whales popping up looking into bitcoin, changetipping people going viral-ish and a general excitement about the future combined does a lot of good. the more people talk about bitcoin, the higher the price goes.
