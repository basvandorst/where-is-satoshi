*Bitcoin portfolio* of...Bitcoin?
If you're trading it at any level you do need to keep track of what's happening to the trend, though at this point a lot of the longterm trend worries are in (IMO)... But you never know for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:57:23
Still holding 1.25 myself, I was at 3 for a bit but I can only rationalize 1.25 as it's all house money at this point.  If the trend starts to stabilize upward again over the next days I'll add 0.25 again here and there... Right now it could go either way so I'll wait for it to work itself out.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:31:55
I've been using Robinhood for BTC trading, no waits/holds on buy/sells and no fees.  I wouldn't keep my long-term portion there though.
Also, what you're describing isn't shorting, or I could be misunderstanding the goal.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:11:21
I'm not sure I'd call it textbook in terms of being useful at least, it's a formation within a week coming off a spike down and the shoulders are barely a bump in the road.
The fact that the bottom of this formation is bumping on the 3month/overall uptrend is what matters to me.  If it goes back to 9200 or below is where my main concern comes in.  holding ~9500 is what I want to see.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:19:01
Where can you short it?

Enlighten me on your interpretation of historical cycles in relation to real estate.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:06:49
The general trend is broken, that's what I see.  Anyone's guess from here short term, IMO.  Likely a bounce soonish, but the trend doesn't look the same anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:02:05


The problem is you never know when the next recession will be, and how bad/if it will impact real estate.  You could wait another lifetime paying rent waiting for a 2008-level great recession that may never come....all the while you're getting the "rent" tax every month you wait, it's hard to overcome that rent loss, especially with interest rates this low. 
Granted, I would have a hard time being a first time buyer at these prices... We were lucky to have things together enough to buy in 2012, when both real estate prices and interest rates were bottoming and borderline irresistible in this area.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:01:39


if there are "too many stupid" people making the price go up, doesn't that make them the smart ones (for a while at least?).  Though, I agree the trend has looked soft for the last several weeks, more buyers coming in could have easily proved me wrong.


Exact numbers for a complex series of events over a prolonged period of time, there's the signal of someone to not listen to.
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:06:19
Your argument is arbitrary, you provide no reason why this mythical altcoin has value.  Just a gamblers hope it sounds like to me.
Bitcoin solved a problem, reinventing the wheel with a new name just obfuscates its value.  There may be a handful of specialized coins in the end, but it looks like the market has figured out you only need one.
Bitcoin wins or no coin wins for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:03:59
I don't understand people's hopes on the halving and remaining bitcoins to be mined. There are ~15% remaining total over a prolong period of time.  For something that jumps around 20% in a day, what are you expecting? It seems baked into the cake or nominal at best to me.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:17:13
Depends on how much you have saved/invested already.  It's the best speculative bet there is IMO, but you have to be on the right side of the trend with this kind of volatility, which you would be on at this point.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:51:48
I mean he's kind of right if it doesn't break its old high in the coming year.  It would be the first time it happened so far, and I imagine will put continuous long-term selling in play.
There will be an ATH that is a peak at some point, infinity isn't possible.  Who knows if it's in the past or future at this point.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:35:40
Pretty easy to fail if you come home to  no money, no career/work history and no family at 25.  After burning credit (if you can get it) and being forced into menial jobs you're put in a situation where you're constantly one step away from the homeless doom cycle, then you're really fucked.
He said he has family, which is probably the most useful thing he could have, so it's a good time for risk if you're gonna do it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:11:56
A binary bet for you, many other ways it could play out.  I'm in the camp of fiat and Bitcoin (almost all other alts dying out) existing together for a prolonged period of time.  It could even start stabilizing at these levels for all we know.
Also, comparing gold and crypto is difficult.  The "hardest money" is subjective, they are both finite supplies, but only one requires electricity and the internet to maintain its existence.
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:03:08
Picking an individual isolated and small country that is failing isn't a good comparison to what happens if the USD/US fails.  For the USD to fail we're talking a situation worse than the great depression across multiple/most developed countries.
You could be going into a situation where the internet itself is compromised/unreliable if we're talking global collapse.  You think people are going to put their "money" into thin air when there is so much doubt? I'd rather have hard assets at that point.
That's just one extreme scenario, there are a million potential outcomes, some up some down... and if ~2008 taught me anything it doesn't necessarily play out like you'd expect, especially in the middle of systemic failure.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:42:46
Hard to know what early is.  You've seen so much pump you expect it to never end, but it will.  Whether or not the peak is now or not is completely unknown, depends on people continuously believing long-term.
@_date: 2019-11-23 03:57:26
You can apply that logic to equity valuations as well.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:36:43
You essentially described inflation, which has worked for lifetimes.
Even if fiat collapsed, how do you think it will play out? Look at ~2008, the obvious choice of precious metals declined with stocks while the USD rose.
If fiat is usable where you are it is going to be the immediate choice.  Until crypto has that it won't compete.

I don't understand what your analogy is trying to prove.  FB went public with an IPO price near $40.
A more accurate analogy would be having shares of FB when it was private at the beginning...when it was worth pennies.  Like the guy who got paid in shares early on to paint a graffiti wall and made out with $100+ million.
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:34:04
The whole thing is comparing apples to oranges.  Gold was one the first universally accepted arbitrary stores of value.  You'd have to compare gold to shells, beads, and other various goods at its birth of usage.
If you compare market cap and make time irrelevant, gold is still worth much more than bitcoin and likely will be for a long time to come...but that's a silly comparison too.
I own both in decent quantities, so I'm rooting for both, this subreddit comes up with some odd hype trains though.

I don't love the idea of comparing (a) stock to bitcoin in the first place, I was just playing off the previous commenter's analogy.  That was just the best analogy I could make for stocks vs. bitcoin.
The initial point was the fact they're comparing the beginning of somethings existence (bitcoin) to something that was already established (gold).  You're going to get wildly inaccurate growth comparisons anytime you do that.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:47:37

If you plan on selling in the short/medium term, it's great and avoids fees.  If you fear RH failing like other vendors have before it could be a bad time.
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:07:26
RH for trading (spreads are decent considering no fees, certainly better than 3%/6%), Coinbase for the remaining long-term 1 BTC.  I may send it to myself at some point, haven't decided.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:42:36


I personally can see that happening (at least in special cases, and useful for a backing value), but it doesn't mean today's valuation arbitrarily makes sense.  There will be bag hodlers at some point, even if bitcoin does everything they hoped... I just don't think we're there yet.
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:36:56
If it falls to 4k again I'd assume it's going much lower, complete long-term chart breakdown.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:14:12
It's technically a good spot to sell some if you haven't sold any, it's the first true breakdown of this run (IMO).  I just sold a little and will sell a little more when/if it recovers more...fading out to keep only the house money/coin on the table.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:46:13
I find it weird how these two (and many gold/crypto bugs) can't see the commonality of the two.  Two finite resources that have value because people need a basis of something to communicate/transfer value.  The utility and application purposes are the variance.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:51:57
From my stand point:
6.5-3.5k(4.2k avg): averaging to 2 BTC, and 0.25-1BTC for trading purposes on RH.
(wait until the first sign of (non-daily) breakdown)
8k: sell 1BTC, leave the remaining with almost all house money, resume trading when it makes sense again.
Can you blame me? I win either way and get to sleep at night.
...it's ok to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:23:47
Depends on what percentage of your savings that is, &gt;100k in savings for 3 IMO.

At best were in a transition scenario where fiat still has more power, pays the bills.  At worst crypto fails and you have nothing.  I don't like having all my eggs in either basket.

You can send your coin to yourself on coinbase, until you do it anything could happen in theory though.

Why this particular set of altcoins? Always seems like a random grab bag.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:28:34
In my opinion, if crypto is to succeed, you need one universal "backing" coin for almost all scenarios, similar to how US currency used to be backed by gold.
I think if Bitcoin doesn't succeed in that regard they all fail, if various/most altcoins fail it doesn't necessarily impact Bitcoin.
So from my perspective, putting eggs in arbitrary baskets is just an unnecessary risk.
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:46:43

I don't need the money in the short term but I consider my previous position over-exposed, but believed a pop would happen...it happened and the obvious part is over.  The trading is done on RH which has no fees, you could argue on the spreads but they don't compare to fees so far.
I have no intention of selling the remaining 1 BTC, that's the long play.
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:45:36
Yes, the 9000 pop immediately sold off and this just broke down the overall trend.  Considering I've near doubled my money and had a lot on the table it's time to trim, I said I would once I saw this happen.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:43:32
The stock market (SEC) has rules to stop some manipulation(ex. uptick rule).  Crypto is the wild west.
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:58:22


I agree that this has all the makings of the first innings of a longterm (in terms of BTC hyperspeed) market, as every BTC bear market has been substantially above the previous so far.  But what if I'm wrong? Someone is going to eventually buy too high and there will be no more boom.  My trading portion will essentially stoploss itself away, securing profits at some level while my house BTC will keep me in for the long game.


Arbitrary DCA with an extreme boom/bust cycles is nonsensical, if you see consistent breakdowns and a prolonged period of no buyers coming in you don't average down.  You gotta let it burn itself out, no need to be a part of it on the buying side.
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:34:55
Not OC, but I'd say both.  I like the idea of an uncontrolled universal currency enough to invest in it.  I only think BTC is necessary personally, so that's the only one I own now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:44:20

@_date: 2019-06-10 01:38:36

Great for a trading portion though, couldn't beat the fees otherwise.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:13:07
You're less richer too.  Risk management works better than koolaid drinking, if it keeps going down I get to enjoy having only the mostly just house money remaining, if it goes up I win too.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:04:16
The massive amount of altcoins is what made me stay out until this cycle.  The question that needs an answer is "*what purpose does this solve that isn't solved by another coin?*".  The answer is almost always nothing, and when it isn't you don't know if it's the coin to solve the problem in the end.
Bitcoin has so many logical outcomes where it makes sense to be the "gold standard".  Seeing its market cap outpace the rest is comforting this round.
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:52:38
What is it you believe is going to happen?
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:10:25
The advantage of trading is it minimizes your loses once the peak is in, assuming your strategy is to sell the "lower lows" and buy once the stabilization is leading towards higher highs.  If the stabilization never happens you're already out before the falling knife logic comes in.
That said, I believe in BTC enough to keep the house money in hold mode for now.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:44:32
I've followed more of a 2-3 "knocks" on support/resistance rule (minimum of a week of chart data).  If you look at the yearly chart you'll see the reverse effect before it broke down from 6k to ~3k (months of lower highs knocking on 6k).  Then after that, months at 3k where it kept knocking at 4k with higher lows until it popped.  Similar logic happened on a weekly timescale in May at ~8k.
It's one of the most simple indicators there is with charts, and it's actually proving the demand level as compared to seeing mythical creatures (aka "barts") in charts.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:38:11

A bit of a false analogy.  It's more like having multiple versions of gold.  Silver and gold have their own inherent differences and applications, the majority of these shitcoins have duplicate (or no real) application.

@_date: 2019-09-12 03:31:12
You seem fairly knowledgeable, a question that had been running through my mind is:
What happens if someone (intentionally or otherwise) inserts something in the Bitcoin source that makes something more predictable, or some other vulnerability that spreads and sits idle for years... Until one day someone starts abusing it.  How would such a scenario play out and be remedied in your opinion?
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:34:25
I noticed earlier today and still kept my last bit in even though I believed the bottom was gonna fall out, way to not follow my gut.  So many lower highs bouncing off that ~9500 area over and over again, never a good sign.  Similar build up to how it went from ~6500 to ~3500...and the inverse of how it went back up.
At least it's only a small long amount left remaining, other than my 1 longterm BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:32:56
Higher lows and the same or higher highs = buy
Sell the inverse, this is the inverse...though it's a bit late to sell.
I personally wouldn't add until you see signs of a trend change.
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:15:58
While I agree with some of what you say, and had similar views around 4k when it broke its 200DMA.  The higher highs/higher lows over a moderate amount of time is about the only indicator I care about, because it's logical and showing you buyers/sellers are/aren't coming.  It was basically showing the inverse of what happened when 6k broke down (kept making lower highs and bouncing on 6k until it gave out).
The problem is, you're not always right, no one is.  I had to stand back in recent weeks with BTC because it became too unpredictable (for little old me at least).  I never trust people who act like they aren't wrong some of the time, and everyone is and thus why TA is not static for anyone...unless you're the Neo of TA and we're in the matrix.
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:14:34
I'm confused by people who believe in Bitcoin but not gold.
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:16:39
There two different things with very similar core qualities: arbitrary stores of value based on finite supply, public belief, and the desire to be independent from (governmental) control.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:42:20
Yup, though you usually wait for it to bounce off various points on the trend before you buy.  You buy the breakouts, sell when it shows signs of breaking down, like it did at 9400 (didn't sell, knew I should have though, too late now).  Averaging down is a mistake for speculative products like Bitcoin IMO.

It's hard to track the source of intermittent radio transmissions and we won't care about licenses if we've come to the point where we need to use radio frequencies to transmit bitcoin/crypto.  Also, no special equipment is required to transmit radio signal... you can use a Raspberry Pi with a copper wire in it and no one can really stop you.

@_date: 2019-05-14 12:28:38
I made most of my position under 4k, but the reality is that is/was a poor approach... Averaging down in a volatile bear market usually ends terribly.  The chart before the pop of higher lows and hitting the same resistance over and over again was the only reason I took the chance.
Buying once the new trend is in is the best thing to do, but it's a hard pill to swallow after the first pop(s).
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:34:47
Dollar/pound being between BCH and ETH based on what?
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:02:56
I did the same after the pop.  All the altcoins is what made me hesitant to get into crypto in the first place.  There are so many arbitrary coins that serve no real purpose.  You need one true crypto to back the others in almost all cases IMO, not forking.
The more dislocation I see between Bitcoin and the rest the more I feel like the the boom/bust cycle will come to an end. Hopefully with a boom for Bitcoin and a bust for the rest. If the altcoins continue popping I'll have to expect another bust.

My point with the Raspberry Pi is the tech is simple and hard to stop, someone incidentally figured out you can use a single GPIO pin on it to transmit... that small bit of power/antenna.  Using repeaters would be a nonsensical (straw man argument?) approach for this, it's something you add power to...similar to how HAM hobbyists set up mini-towers or radio stations work.  
Hell, you can buy a decent "walkie talkie" (Baofeng) for more range (miles).  There is a checkered history of oldschool trolls taking over frequences to be dicks, just like on the internet now.  Do you know of this [incident](

Cheap based on people mass adopting it, it's not written in stone that that will occur.  If it does continue I don't see it being all at once either, just a slow churn of acceptance which is fine by me.

Hard to quantify, my trades have been near spot so I'm not complaining.  Certainly not 3% at least.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:29:26
I mean it has no intrinsic value and is based on nothing other than people wanting to believe in it, and I see nothing wrong with that.  It's amazing it's garnering itself as a national currency/commodity in an organic way simply because the people want it to exist.
The real question is what is the stabilized price of it going to be and when will the volatility die down... my guess is it's got a lot of upside in the near to long term, and will become even more useful once it's stable and adopted (and the vast majority of the altcoins fade away).
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:13:23
I mean believing in bitcoin for the long game is complete speculation, it requires mass belief/adoption in the end for the market cap people are touting/hoping for (gold levels).  I think there will be an ever-growing desire for a universal currency and I think bitcoin won in terms of the backing asset (I believe almost all of the altcoins must fade away for any of this to last).  I don't feel uncomfortable calling it a gamble though, speculating this far out for a new asset is a gamble IMO and should be treated as such.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:18:14
Given this trajectory and the long-term chart I wouldn't take it all off the table.  The way it cut through 6k, which was the major resistance, was unexpected to me.  But I understand locking in some profits, just that all-time chart is looking like something I want to stay in.
...maybe I'll just buy puts/sell calls on RIOT to protect myself :p
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:28:19


If all these altcoins continue to be pumped out I see continous pump and dumps of them all.  I suspect there will be (continued) dislocation between bitcoin and the rest as you only need one for people to believe in.  All of these cryptocurrencies are arbitrary to a degree, they only have value because people are buying them.  The comparison to gold is good, and you could say some of the other specialized altcoins have a place too...kind of like silver and platinum have a specific role.  What we don't need (and have) are 100 arbitrary versions of pseudo-gold, it just doesn't make sense and cannot be sustained.  Bitcoin is the first and has lasted this long, it is the sensical one to back if you're picking an arbitrary/made up currency.
I sold all my altcoins recently and put it in to bitcoin for the long haul for this reason.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:22:41
3% to break even is brutal (and that's not including selling).  Robinhood is free and what I use for trading purposes, the long-term is held elsewhere.  If you're in it for the long haul you should just have your own wallet.
Also, for something as consistently volatile as bitcoin/crypto (+/-10%) it makes sense to invest at levels.

Honestly that is the best time to invest in anything, once the new trend has clearly started (like it looks now), it's trying to catch a falling knife in a bear market...the problem is it's a hard pill to swallow missing the first leg of the gains.

You really like the straw man argument approach, you should be a pundit somewhere.
[Here is a radio similar to the one I have](  $60 and goes miles, depending on your location (on a mountain/minimal interference), 10s of miles.  There are tutorials on souping these up to go further.
I suspect you'll respond to this by changing my words around again into some other scenario I didn't say, so I'll limit it to "$60 = miles in range".

To speak to the culture, a couple years ago during the last bubble I refused to get for being too far along in the boom and having so many arbitrary alt coins.  In the end I started to get my feet wet between 6-3k with mostly BTC, now all rolled into BTC.  The fact there is separation between BTC and rest in terms of market cap and the existence of things like the lightning network to mitigate slowness I can easily see BTC being the backing of most crypto in the future, not forks.
Too many things lining up, including a beautiful all-time chart, to not hold some of it long term.
