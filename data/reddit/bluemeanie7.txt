@_date: 2013-06-02 12:40:58
its good to be an early adopter eh?
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:22:15
name 1 site on the tor network that offers a similar service to lib res
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:34:07
haha never realized the similarity between jones and that character
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:06:46
lol r/bitcoin
@_date: 2013-06-23 12:15:39
holly shit that was gay. good idea though
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:00:29
that just had me thinking, is there a twitter tip bot?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:32:35
interesting, exact opposite for me
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:57:30
aaaaand its removed...I wonder why
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:19:14
keiser helped bill pump quark with his twitter, it shouldn't go unnoticed. its seems likely that keiser was given a share of the coin supply
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:48:53
I think he dumped his quarkcoins and litecoins already, I haven't seen him pumped them in at least a week now
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:54:44
I see that the circlejerk is in full effect this sunday
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:14:39
and you think it's easier for a judge? usually they invite experts to ELI5 to the jury
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:21:35
I think NMC/PPC will always be alive as they bring new thing to the table, although they probably wont become a threat to bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:36:36
hes mr. gold shouldnt he realize gold is in a bubble right now?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:39:38
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:54:51
holly crap what a scumbag
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:57:24
still could have tipped the nigga a penny :P
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:41:57
wow, didnt know he had an account there. I checked his last posts and he just seems to stop posting all of a sudden, any official words from him and why he left?
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:26:44
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:17:01
i dont get it
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:13:46
"if the wallet file found on his PC is encrypted then the money can't really be considered to be on the PC since there is no private key proof"
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:02:59
hosting an anonymous tor site and processing bank transactions aren't compatible
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:05:38
most of them are clones of bitcoin and made to make the creators rich, they offer nearly no advantage over BTC and are nothing but speculation and pump n dumps. Anything but BTC/NMC/PPC is useless and scamish
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:54:36
lol this threads are so baseless and speculative
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:22:53
but..."Say goodbye to lag, because our platform runs on financial-institution grade hardware that can deliver quick trade execution and fluid experience even on high-volatility days."
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:17:22
It should be noted that keiser helped him pump it on his twitter, he most likely was given a share of the coin supply
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:04:42
ha, funny how someone from china thinks something as sensitive as bitcoin would be discussed in length on national TV without the governments aproval
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:40:13
can you elaborate on those reports?
@_date: 2013-05-24 13:01:28
consider yourself lucky it wasnt more, keep guessing is all you can do now
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:39:12
By reading his comments in the thread he seemed much more comfortable convincing himself that it was all his fault rather than face the facts and investigate into his beloved roommates, so most likely not.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:17:01
I have a feeling will end up buying a scamcoin because "they are cheaper"
"too expensive now" is becoming the first reaction of most people who learn about bitcoin, ppl need be better at math :/
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:20:08
i kind of agree, anyone with a google glass around you when your card was exposed would be able to empty it from the recordings.
OK, the google glass scenario is unlikely but anyone able to take a picture of the card could steal all your bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:42:15
it dates much further back actually
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:21:56
also, fire proof=/=heat proof, aka your paper will still burn if its in a fire
@_date: 2013-05-19 14:01:44
whos this fucking guy
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:50:22
so I take that twitter doesn't allow it and banned everyone who tried to make a bitcoin tip bot on twitter similar to the one on reddit?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:58:27
pretty sure it went before judges a couple times and they won
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:01:49
ye rly :P
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:29:06
he thought long and hard about the last one it looks like
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:02:08
there are some black pool sites
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:21:46
lets not mention the backbone of the bitcoin economy or what gave bitcoin the vast majority of its legitimacy and value in the last two years
@_date: 2013-07-28 00:46:13
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:32:35
might have been the guy with his sisters money
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:14:59
you are getting downvoted and it's understandable since this isn't and people here are probably not acquainted with this concept. But yes, koreans and white ppl are often considered two different "leagues" in therms of skill, although these two can probably beat any top korean on a good day
