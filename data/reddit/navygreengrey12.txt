[Verse 1]
We don’t have time left to regret (hodl on)
It will take more than common sense (hodl on)
So stop your wondering take a stand (hodl on)
There's more to life than just to live (hodl on)


Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on


[Verse 2]
One single smile a helping hand (hodl on)
It's not that hard to be a friend (hodl on)
So don’t give up stand 'till the end (hodl on)
There's more to life than just to live (hodl on)




When you love someone
And they break your heart
Don’t give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on


[Verse 3]
When it falls apart
And your feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hodl on, hodl on
