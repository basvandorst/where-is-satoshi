@_date: 2015-12-25 02:29:42
I'd also like to know.
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:28:45

@_date: 2016-01-25 00:48:24

How the heck does the Marijuana part fit in? Can anyone link me to something with more info?
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:06:01
Agreed. I don't like the mycelium app. But rest of the site is cool, and simple.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:28:10
Actually a cool idea though, non the less.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:38:36

May extend another 60 days
Is 2/25/17 the latest date?
Edit: filed on 6/30/16, but published on 7/14/16, so 3/11/17?
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:15:08

@_date: 2016-10-12 20:28:09

@_date: 2016-10-13 14:57:35
I looked up the law in the footnote in the SEC filing, then linked to that law in my comment
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:34:37
Do I have to signup to? Or just download the app?
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:53:39
