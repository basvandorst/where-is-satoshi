Thanks - I appreciate that and I agree with you 100%. 
Maybe it should be stressed that it is the top 1% of the community that is seeking to drive a wedge between us. Let me also say, that to some extent, it is working. I guess my attitude toward all of this is probably a bit naive, but a post like this can't be more harmful than good, right? I just hope it doesn't get worse.

Hope so. Would be nice to see a uniting of the communities again!

I'm a lifelong Bitcoin fan, and am about 5x more invested in it than any alt. I agree with you that the people you named are all bringing us down, but your argument isn't with me, brother. PLEASE stop the hatred toward the other laymen - we are killing ourselves.

I'm OK with this perspective. Thanks for your input!

Yup, I think we're positing the same points here - I truly believe that they are being mislead as well, which is an entirely different belief than I think most people are taking on - which is that the other side is comprised of mostly liars and deceivers. 
I think the best possible path does include constructive argument, but constructive would be the operative word (empathetic, patient, technical, and objective would be other ones). The way many people in both subreddits are going about "proving" their points has consisted largely of personal attacks, sweeping outgroup negativity, and other insults aimed not at the core perpetrators but at their minion army (imho) - I know this is a slight over-generalization but it is really disheartening to see.
Have a good night!

Sorry, I agree with all of your points, but I need to apologize because my sentence was worded a bit confusingly. I simply meant that we need to change the ATTITUDE that the other side are collectively a bunch of liars and deceivers - not that we need to change their BELIEFS. 
Thanks for your input!

It's legit. I'm not sure why it's not popping up on Google

East Coast checking in - maybe think about doing it someplace rural (not NYC, SF, etc) and equidistant from multiple cities so that people will actually have commit some time to leaving the populated areas to find it - it may last longer as well :).

Your latter argument I can certainly get on board with - technical discussions that can lead to iterative improvements, sure - pointing out flaws in the current logic, absolutely! 
But referring to as "the other side" - calling them liars and deceivers - when in reality it is likely just a few people in charge of the decision-making, where the rest of the people are humble followers of a technology they 100% believe in just like you and I - I think we need to change that. But maybe I am a bit naive in believing this attitude can realistically change.
