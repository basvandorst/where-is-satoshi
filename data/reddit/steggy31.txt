That is a silly justification. Just because something is inflating rampantly doesn't make it right. My issue is people being disingenuous. I'm glad people are making money, but I don't like people having hard earned money in a volatile asset. There will be a major correction and the price will plummit. Bitcoin is the Napster of digital currency

Why would people stop using RE? It's the safest investment vehicle there is

You people really don't understand the Bitcoin market, eh? You just have to look at inflated Japanese holdings, almost 50% being wonder owned by 1000 people, and the fact that Bitcoin isn't actually being used for anything . . . It's being bought for appreciation.

Not a commodity, more just a general asset :p it's not exactly integral to an economy

RE is about as common of an acronym as it gets. Plus you just discussed real estate, which would fit with the whole RE thing

I mean, it is a bubble though.

Like I said, a whole myriad of catch 22s lol I'm a huge proponent of decentralized currency, I just don't love Bitcoin. I want something tied to a basket of commodities or precious metals

I'll assume no sarcasm and say thanks!

I just don't want people that ignorant of investing losing their asses.

Currency is only functionable if it's feasible in credit and credit expansion. Bitcoin is too volatile to feasible by those constraints. It's simply an asset that's appreciating through hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:19:02
It's just frustrating to see people that are making money off of hype risk their hard earned money. There is a reason most professional investors aren't touching it unless it's with throwaway money.

It's a catch 22 though. For it to be used in credit and credit expansion is has to have a stable price. For it to have a stable price it has to be widely accepted. Look at the digital currencies tied to precious metals, they are gaining no traction because they are stable. People just want crazy cash crazy fast

Individual countries don't face localized inflation of the dollar, just bad exchange rates. We're talking about a Fiat currency that is engrained in a society vs a crypto that isn't even a currency, it's an asset. Until it's feasible in credit and credit expansion it's not even a currency. The grand majority of Bitcoin purchasing is for appreciation not it's intrinsic value

Well that's just down right ignorant. You're comparing bitcoin to something like the dollar, which has been engrained in society for a hundred years. It was born of being tied to precious metals, and it's pecieved value of tomorrow has always been based off of what it's value is today. It's relative to what people Earn and expect to pay.  Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a global speculative asset. This sub is such a hard circle jerk for Bitcoin though you don't welcome any dissenting opinions.  You're as bad as r/politics or r/thedonald.
