Ronin institute is one. But I don't think they have any crypto donation option.

Ok if you are really in a hurry you can do child pay for the parent technique. Where you forward the address to another wallet with a higher fee. The miners will pick up the transaction and the old txn will also be confirmed.
Or you can request viabtc people to accelerate you txn.
Or if you have time wait for another week.
Edit: I just searched, viabtc is overloaded. You can use  if you are in a hurry.

If you have a previous 0conf txn on the wallet, it will not show the next txn. It's one of the numerous bugs in ledger nano.

 Coming from a place where one fine morning govt. decided to ban all high valued currency and froze the assets of more than a billion people, crypto currency is a boon. 
Many lost their lives, their loved ones. The govt is too powerful. We need decentralised mode of payment. World needs decentralised mode of operation. 
This is the future!

I am curious what are the items in the real world you can purchase with BTC BCH ? This is the adoption stage. We need to go in a path that is conceptually gureentees that. BCH is a temp solution. No way a scaling solution.

This is the mempool. This is very congested right now. The miners switched to BCH just to show their strength/centralisation.
It will be soon cleared because of EDA and profitability to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:07:27
No chance! If you join slushpool you will see your miner as inactive despite of it running. It will be below the lowest acceptable hashrate.

Please mind your language! 
I am expressing that some 1 day old account comes to you with a sob story and all of you jump in defence for what ? 
I stand by my comment that 1 day old crypto users should first educate themselves, then invest!
Read the comment carefully!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:06:11
Don't try that. It will not work at the present mempool congestion. Wait out. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:15:28
Point is you should know what you are up against. You can't run around like a chicken if one crypto is falling or other is rising!
Do you have a reason to value BTC ? Do you have a reason to value forked coins? Then stick to the reasoning rather than fueling the FUD.
BTW thanks for the downvote in support of one day redditor with no comment history.

No easy way. You need ASICS. 
In some shared mining pools you can buy some hashpower. But you should be aware of their protocol before committing. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:11:43
Fear Uncertainty Doubt.
 In the times of large movement of crypto, fee is high. 
Yes there is a congestion, but for investment it works out well. We will soon have other layers that will make fee low, keeping the original chain intact.
Devs are working on that. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:44:52
That only one guy has to put in a lot of resources to keep the channel  and volume open. A guy with 1 btc open channel cannot send a 2 btc transaction. The channels will not be free for all or p2p2p.

Bitcoin core is trying new tech like LN and segwit. It's idea is the block size remains small and miners fee also remains small. Neither BTC nor BCH can handle 100 k transaction per second right now. 
This is very difficult to implement, but I think some very good developers are in the core side. 
BCH is just a temp solution. So, if you want to invest for a long time. BTC is best. If you want fast transaction right now BCH is best. 
I would recommend you to develop your own opinion from learning by yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:08:57
In the real world very few people are using it or hardly have anything they can buy with bitcoins. 
The idea is built a financial system / network that will be censorship resistant and universal. 
This is the basis of the blockchain. The rest of the system has to be built on the top of it. 
Within a few years you may be using it like a debit card in local shops or utility. The idea is yet to come to the mainstream, so we are the early adopters.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:13:21
If a person A1 does only one transaction with A2, which will be eventually be broadcast into the blockchain, how does he saves anythings in the miners fee?
Only if there are multiple transaction between A1 and A2, the miners fee can be thought of as divided by the no. of LN transactions. Helpful for businesses but not for individual payments!

You are not welcome! Simply because you did not do your research well! 
If you keep on changing sides and keep on moving your cryptos you will have a big zero in the end. You should know pros and cons of each crypto and invest steadily.
BTC is not a gamble!! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:55:40
It is communicated to the blockchain after a fixed time. Both the users pay the fee but divided by the number of transactions.
If you only do one txn during the entire period the channel is open. You pay the normal miner fee.

Yes you are right! DA is proper maybe.

It can be done.... but for me it will take up my work hours which is not good. If you believe and understand the value of BTC, you should be holding for long term.
But of course if have enough time and can predict/ guess the highs and lows you can do the day trading.
Only issue of concern is there are a bunch of investers with big BTC/ BCH that can pump and dump the market. This is very difficult to predict and match.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:29:07
It's a involved process. First you must understand the fundamentals. Then check with small amount. Then you are good to go!
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:14:59
That's not a correct assertion. Many wallets etc have various pros and cons, that user gets to know only after use. It will be great if we have some comparison and insights from the users. 
It does not matter which crypto you are using!
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:16:57
In that case the most secure way will be a encrypted paper wallet created on a air gapped computer.
Two imp properties of paper wallets would be:
1. If lost or password forgotten, there is no way one can help you
2. When finally moving the amount from the paper wallet to trezor you need to transfer the whole amount stored on it!

It depends on two questions:

@_date: 2017-09-09 15:34:32
I will try to answer with an example. You have two computer one offline one online. Both have armory and bitcoin core installed.
You generate a wallet in the offline computer using some program, armory or bitcoin core. Copy that encrypted wallet to a USB drive. Take the usb drive to the online computer. Import the wallet to the program and you can receive the bitcoin on the address generated. 
Paper wallet is the instance when in the armory offline you will put a password and it will generate a string of 4lettr phases for you to print or write down.
If you lose the phases your BTC is lost. 
Also there are some issues spending from paper wallet. Beware.
I am new and found that buying a ledger s nano is much more easy and secure.
When I am expert I will use locker facilities in the armory.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:24:32
Depends. From here in India, I can tell it is very difficult to get going on bitcoins. I tried to buy in 2015 but failed. After many hassle I did manage to buy a small amount this time.
Traditionally we put our savings in gold, property, mutual funds. They are a pretty robust modes of keeping one ahead of the inflation.
