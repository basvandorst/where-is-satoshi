Why do people keep feeding the troll. 
He is getting the attention he wants.  Suffocate him of attention and he goes away.

To clarify: " i don't understand why the manipulation of money is so important if everyone is on the same playing field"  
Because it isn't a level playing field.  There are a lot of entrenched interests among the largest financial institutions who want to be able to play games with currencies.  They spend LOTS of money greasing the right palms, influencing politicians and getting the right people nominated to commissions (regardless of party) for one very specific reason.
POWER.  
They have it and won't give it up easily.

These are good reminders that we haven't seen the top of Bitcoin at 20k.  It is going to be so easy for anyone to buy Bitcoin in 2019 the run/fomo will be epic - matching the Dot Com Bubble.

We are about a month or two from capitulation.  The dominant pattern - descending triangle is still in play.  If fact, the current pattern looks very similar to the last Bitcoin parabolic move.

He has no idea any more than anyone else.  That being said, it is like capitulation breaks prices below the 5700-6000 support - however briefly - to wash out the last retail traders/investors and begin the bull run.

Denied.  I don't think they are going to allow any this year - probably not any until early next year.  For whatever reason - any there are plenty of them - it will be a little bit longer.

Hard to say what the bottom will be.  I work with a lot of seasoned traders who anticipated about $3500-4000 back in February as the bottom -- though that would likely be a brief bottom through capitulation as prices that low would get bought up (I would and will).  If the movement is similar to the last one, about 6 to 8 weeks as a sideways movement.  Probably January/early February as the new bull run.

Anywhere between 200-300k by the team I work with at Bitcoin.Live

You didn't read it, did you?  He said that upon completion of the pattern there is a target of 2823

I would agree with that.  I've seen so many on twitter who think we are way past capitulation and it just doesn't seem like that is true.  I think the alts went through that last month, but of course when Bitcoin goes through it, they'll mostly fall alongside.

Further reminder to ignore any notion that crypto, let alone bitcoin is dead.  The next run will be epic.

Very true.  The free publicity thing stinks, but framing him in such a way with a label that sticks will do more damage to him than the publicity he craves.
Though for it to work, it needs a more concerted effort.  RogerVerScam.com BitcoinCashScam.com  etc  (you get the picture)
