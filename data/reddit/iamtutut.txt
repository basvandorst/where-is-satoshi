Only an utter idiot would mine, or I should say try to, Bitcoin with a PC in 2019.

@_date: 2019-08-10 11:18:23
My 2 cents if you are ready for this relative "risk": 
Buy  for a few hundred $ or € worth of BTC with the money you've got right now, sell a portion of your purchase at the end of the year to buy your PC, and you'll still have much more (in FIAT terms) than your initial investment.
I really doubt Bitcoin price will stay in the $12K zone at the end of the year considering: debt, quantitative easing, currency war, trade war.

FIAT currencies fluctuate everyday, many are much more unstable than Bitcoin. Central banks can get bankrupt. Bitcoin, well, just can't IRL.
Bitcoin is 10 years old, in the light of long term economy, Bitcoin still is an infant, but that infant is growing very well.
But if you don't trust the concept and / or the tech, your choice to leave is sound. There are other investments opportunities.

I beg to differ. Knowing what a pile of garbage facebook is, more than 2 billion people use it everyday, almost 1/3 of the world's population.
facebook aims to rule any business area it's involved in, suckerberg will lobby to have a regulatory advantage.
