I recently finished reading "The Intelligent Investor" and in the commentary written by Jason Zweig he talks about how stock splitting fueled the 90's tech bubble. The parellels between that and Bitcoin, among other factors (wild speculation, euphoria and limitedless valuations) are stunning.

I may be wrong but I think that's how bull traps work. In a falling market bears realize that they have to sell so when the market seems to recover by a little bit, bulls buy into it thinking that it is going to keep on going up and that the crash is over, thus falling into the trap.

Congratulations, you just described the entire point of the NASDAQ, which has been around since the 1970's.

NASDAQ=centralized database=the public ledger
The NASDAQ electronic market maker=a massive computing infrastructure managed by middlemen=the blockchain miners
The NASDAQ stock exchanges=crypto stock exchanges (coinbase, GDAX, etc.)
What difference does it make if the show is run by a public company (that is accountable to its shareholders who could be any member of the public, and laws and regulations that is ultimately put in place by the public through a democratic system) and a blockchain system (that is run by unknown miners in mostly shady countries who are accountable to no one, and developers that may or may not determine that future of the system IF they agree on the same way forward; i.e. Segwit vs. lightning vs increasing the blocksize)? 
Why is an inflexible system of exchange better than a system that can change with the times to counter different challenges? Every time someone has an idea to improve on bitcoin an entire new system is developed (Litecoin, Ether, Monero, etc.) while the old system stubbornly remains in place. 
Don't get me wrong, I think that the idea of the blockchain is brilliant but it seems to me that it is an answer to a problem that does not exist, in non-theoretical scenarios anyway.
Please correct me if I misunderstood anything or got anything wrong.

The way you are confidently talking about a subject that you clearly know nothing about is hilarious.
