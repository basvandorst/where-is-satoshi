Wikipedia as an organization tends to be all about maintaining a neutral point of view in their articles.  Their website as a whole obviously cannot maintain such a point of view; the mere act of soliciting donations and maintaining servers obvious requires a pro-wikipedia point of view, but they tend to do a decent job of ensuring individual articles are neutral.  For example, the article about Wikipedia include criticisms etc., and is written from a viewpoint detached from the operation of the site.  Adding a bitcoin donation button to the bitcoin article would degrade this barrier between article contents and site upkeep, and would encourage conflicts of interest, or at the very least accusations thereof, compromising the integrity of the Bitcoin article and the site as a whole.

No it's not.

But it isn't.  "Sign the genesis block" is shorthand for digitally signing the genesis block with some arbitrary private key.  We want him to sign some arbitrary message with the private key used in the genesis block.

Yeah, I understand the distinction between "proper" usage and common usage.  However, this isn't a case of common usage at all; I've been involved in cryptography for a while, and I've never seen the word "sign" used in that manner before [this post from yesterday](

That's why all vanity addresses have rather short intelligible bits to them.  For example, archive.org's vanity address only contains the seven letter word Archive, and even then they settled with an address starting with 1Archive instead of trying to generate one that started with just Archive.  Difficulty grows exponentially with the length of the message you want to embed in your address, so anything much longer than 7 characters gets infeasible fast.
EDIT: I was totally wrong about the leading '1', I forgot that was a feature of the Bitcoin protocol.

I heard there was free gold?

Lots of trial and error.  You make a bunch of addresses randomly until you get one that starts with the word you want.
