Thanks for the detailed reply. As someone with a non-tech background, I feel like I'm at the bottom of the learning curve. However, I can see the value in a crypto-currency, so looking forward to understanding it better. 
The paper does have a QR code. As Blockchain is a web-based wallet, does that means I can access it from any computer, like online banking and it's stored on their servers? I just keep seeing these stories of people throwing away USBs with millions on them.

with the prices changing so much in the course of minutes, how do you gauge what to sell it for?

How much have you made so far? I don't have the capital to be make large moves, but interested in the concept

too be honest, I don't really know at this point. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about really and learn more about it at the same time. I didn't put my whole life savings into it or anything, but enough that I'll keep my eye on it.

Can people just stand in line for 10 minutes and try to purchase on a relative high?

So what is stopping everyone who has any large amount of money from doing it? Wouldn't it have leveled out by now if it was common?

out of curiosity, i see a lot of talk about weekends being a time for drops. why is that?
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:18:27
Alright, set it all up. I didn't realize there was a fee for faster transactions. Already down from my initial amount put in this morning but it's all good

So I can send it back to the address on the piece of paper the ATM gave me?
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:09:11
It's a terminal, looks like pretty much likeany other ATM you'd see around. The company is Robocoin. Here is their video (warning the song is a little much)
