No, but ACH usually is (though slower).

Sure they can; a check is essentially the same mechanism as ACH.  In the US, if you have an account number and a routing number, you can pull money.  High five!

It's given on the confirmation screen when you create the withdrawal, but unfortunately isn't ever visible after that.  You can re-run *all* of the pending txns in the API, but I don't know of a way to look up a pending txn's hash after you've left the confirmation screen.

If you know your txn hash, you can find the raw transaction here ( and then manually broadcast it using `bitcoind sendrawtransaction "&lt;hex-encoded-txn&gt;"`.  That fixed it for me.

No, that's just some gox internal id.  The txn hash is apparently only shown on the confirmation screen when you create the withdrawal.

I withdrew about an hour ago to a local wallet and... nothing.  No record locally or on blockchain.info.  The BTC is gone from the gox account though.

MtGox is having trouble broadcasting transactions for some unknown reason.  HOWEVER, they are still posting their raw signed txns to their API.  So, if you're waiting eternally on your txn to clear, you can manually broadcast it.  I wrote a quick script to rebroadcast everything an hour ago after talking with IRC and realizing that mtgox doesn't seem to care at all...   When I ran it people on IRC said their txns showed up immediately.  Why gox didn't do it hours ago is a great question.
If you know your transaction hash, just retrieve the raw txn from here:  convert it into hex, and broadcast it using sendrawtransaction and you'll be good to go.

Nope!

Yeah sucks.  Looks like they started accepting it a few weeks ago and haven't updated their exchange rate :(
