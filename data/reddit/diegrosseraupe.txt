You mean a "tourniquet". 
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:42:37
You have to spend $3 to get out the $50 for the club? Wow, just wow. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:15:10
thats the time you start thinking about buying.. duh
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:42:40
If Bitcoin takes off and marketcap hits $100 trillion, destroying half a bitcoin is equivalent to destroying $2.4MM.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:22:12
give me your btc address plz, the bot rejected the format of my tip message.

If you already invested 750 BTC, why the fuck does he need to convert $9k so badly? Does he have a gambling problem? Does he pull a Danny Brewster?
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:30:49
I think you confuse the situation.
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:51:21
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:13:56
when will you rebuy? at 1200, 1500, 2000?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:53:55
Nice! Keep working on it! The killer feature would be API access to cryptsy and a "MOVE ALL FUNDS TO INUIT" button..
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:10:11
Great, so a uBTC is a million bits, but a milli BTC is a thousand uBTC and a thousand bits should then be 1 milli BTC. No potential confusion there.. not.

The whole company or just some specific stores?

[PSA] Dont install random shitware that can steal all of your coins. Even if it sound fun and all. Don't be gullible, do your homework, fear the too-good-to-be-true promises, don't browse and do shit on computers managing your money. Don't be the next "Help, Someone just transferred all of my monies to address 1HAXax0r..".
Do you understand the source? No? Did at least a couple of trustworthy developers read the source and deem it ok? Do you have to be the first to install it or can you wait a week or two?
Do you know how to install it in a sandboxed environment?
Good luck none the less to all of you on the forefront of technology!

I would suggest the number of actual items next to the category/subcategory names. Man, it's just frustrating to the click through the category names and come up with empty pages!

The opposite! Just checked on google trends for "bitcoin", interest in cyprus has EXPLODED to the top 7th spot just after Hong Kong and the Netherlands.

My vote goes to hoax, this was prepared beforehand to be leaked at the appropriate time -&gt; crash the market a bit, $$$
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:13:07
Problem is if bitcoin goes up by another factor of 1000, these were pretty big scams in the bitcoin world...
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:49:15
Look, it's not the money you are after - ask yourself what the money would mean to you: financial independance? a house, travel, kids?
Then realize that there are more ways than through money alone that you can realize these dreams.. 
[also just rebuy only a couple coins and you might be golden anyhow in a couple years time!]
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:10:21
maybe its gavin andreessen. that would have my vote.

Hm, can you see any similarities to MtGox limiting withdrawls drastically? It usually means they are insolvent and want to protect their liquidity.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:33:51
I think the negative consequences of having funds frozen for say one month are tiny in comparison to the benefit of discovering some of MtGox's stolen funds and returning them. The bitstamp account holders could also come up with their Gox purchase history..
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:25:56
Wasn't that particular trade at MtGox when they got hacked, someone made himself an illusionary BTC balance and dumped it on the market? All trades got reversed, users affected (who had trades) got one month free trading and a free yubikey..  
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:21:22
And talk to your parents about it, ask if they have access to a good lawyer.

And what about China, huh, China?!
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:31:10
My target price is &gt; 100k USD. Why would anyone in their right mind want to sell BTC at 700USD ??
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:54:08
You could also buy PETA at 0.48 right now if you believe that and double your money if your are right - if you are wrong however you still hold your PETA shares.
Much better than pure gambling. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:17:39
How much interest did you earn over the course of a month on average?
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:45:05
yeah, i got a rejection message from the bot saying that 0.1$ was a too small amount.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:15:54
If that works, it will only work for the first few who use it until hundreds of bots try to use the same strategy.

spending from an addess means ALL coins of the address are moved. The exact payment amount to the receivers address and all the rest back to addresses you control.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:30:10
Its not over till it's over. Unless there is a definitive statement on Gox I continue to wait patiently. I take the media (yes, also reddit!) with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:17:43
I thought there is and was called ...
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:32:46
Isn't that kind of proof what blockchain technology is for? Embed something like the hash of the message "I, twfry, give this bitcoin to my toddler A, and ..." in one of the transactions?
Then you have the proof you gifted them at the time the block containing this transaction was mined.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:29:48
did you do that for 2, 20, 200 or 2k BTC ??
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:40:30
Bitstamp should put it on hold, while MtGox can go through the records and either confirm legit withdrawls or acknowledge these were stolen.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:48:20
Until proof is posted or verified by a mod, this counts as nice little bedtime story..

Can anyone confirm the legitness of data posted?
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:39:01
They could just use a secure hashvalue of the data they want to store in OP_RETURN. With this hash you can look up your data (with arbitrary length) wherever you want to store it.

Well, it did not say "we promise", but "we estimate" the return of 5-10 BTC. Guess you cannot sue them for that..
