A coin only has value if people use it. Even if USCoin becomes a thing, its hard to force people to use something they don't believe in.

you would buy from an exchange such as : Coinbase. Your electrum wallet will have a "Recieve" address. In your Coinbase wallet you will have a "Send" option. You essentially send your coins from your coinbase wallet to your electrum wallet.

When you own bitcoins, you actually just own the private keys. So when you send your coins to a hardware wallet like a "Trezor", your hardware wallet now stores the private keys instead of "freewallet.org". Your keys stay on the device and no software can run on the device, making it safe against any malware you might have.

You just gotta wait. The good news is that Coinbase is launching Instant Purchases so you don't have to wait 3-5 days anymore.

So the reason BTC is only partly anonymous is because of how your transactions work. Your balance references previous transactions balances to make up your current amount, all the way to when the coin was first created. This being said, if I start telling people online that (this specific address) belongs to me. Then people can iterate through the transactions like a tree and see your movements and transactions.

Bitcoin has a lot of hype surrounding it, a bunch of people jumping on the roller coaster because their friends are making money.  So did the Tulips, and Pokemon Go, and a lot of other things. But when all noise dies down, the technology behind bitcoin "blockchain" still has value. It is highly speculative, but there is a lot of evidence that Bitcoin will stay around for a long time.  A point could be made that bitcoin is a store of value for people in countries where inflation is an issue. Nobody is right or wrong, people just have different visions of the future.

The coin is a byproduct of the technology. In my opinion they go hand in hand. The price of the coin is what incentivizes the miners to keep validating transactions and keep the network running. But I do see your point.

They have their own value proposition. It's like picking between using Lyft or Uber. For Litecoin I believe Charlie wrote about his vision for it on one of his blogs. It's a good read. Not sure about Dash. But I think crypto clones are just part of the noise in the space. When the dust settles, only the few with true utility will survive. But knowing which ones would be like predicting the future.

If you are using Coinbase. The ACH bank transfer takes 3-5 business days.

You can mine other cryptocurrencies, but for bitcoin it is too late.
