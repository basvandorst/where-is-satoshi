hmm funny if they were doing fine i wonder why they are implementing blockchain solutions. You are aware of the security breaches that continue to happen on their networks right? Sure, their tx/s looks good, but then again they are only typing numbers on a screen and hitting enter. Might as well maintain our bank balance on an excel sheet. The beauty of this new tech is it can be innovated to not only compete with VISA but surpass it.

For as long as i live, i will mix up those two words. FML

It was, and will be again. No business in the world can handle the volume Bitcoin has been seeing in the past few months with ease.

Bitcoin isn't without its faults. Nothing can scale overnight and no one could have predicted the huge influx of new users and demand for BTC. With that being said, there are a number of other protocols  such as LTC, BCH, ETH that are still lagging on processing time but still trump the USD. To sum it up, USD is at its limit, BTC still has plenty of room to grow.

What shutdown?

Litecoin for starters, i have been trading LTC for almost a year and never had an issue. Including high volume trading hours

You're on Z....we're at B. 
When BTC gets to that point, the race is over. Have fun on the sidelines.
P.S- $3 for one cup of coffee is crazier than $50,000 for one BTC. js

Not much of a reader I take it -_-

In other words you invested because you believed the price would go up...and up....and up and now its going down and you no longer believe. You sir are the reason the market needs corrections like this.

I don't know about you, but I don't lose my cash very easily, let alone my private keys. Sounds like a personal finance problem to me. Obviously, in the current situation it doesn't make sense to buy a coffee with BTC. But then again if you aren't looking at it's potential, you already lost.

Yeah i figured, saw a couple twitter posts that said "Bitcoin shutdown", cant believe everything you read on the internet right :/ 
Knowing the U.S. they'll say they're shutting down Bitcoin with no merit to what they say whatsoever.

Highly unlikely Coinbase could go Gox....Poloniex on the other hand is fair game for a Gox...very shady sh*t going down there.

I agree, it will take some people a while to wrap there mind around digital value. But when put in terms of todays reality it really isn't all that different. 90%+ of transactions conducted TODAY are digital. So that's you, me, and grandma getting around just fine with "virtual" money. The problem right now is a lot of people may get hurt because they see it simply as an "investment" when in actuality its a means of value transfer accepted among peers. Hard to convince your landlord to accept Bitcoin if he lost his life savings "investing" in Bitcoin. The threat to Bitcoin could be people's feelings toward it simply put.

I agree that Bitcoin needs to be protected as a store of value first. With that being said we have all these new "investors" coming in who do not understand either solution it provides and have made the price more like a wobbling top ready to come down hard at the slightest clue of a selloff. Where this inflation could go is anybody's guess but it's safe to say that the mass amount of people driving the price right now will both contribute to its exponential rise as well as its next collapse.

Not familiar with XRB but it seems like cryptos can and will have multiple use cases. Watching everything unfold is pretty exciting

and herein lies the bubble. Price is overinflated with people buying in simply because they think they can "get rich quick" when in actuality they have no understanding of the underlying technology or the benefits it brings to our analog of a monetary system. 
I recently read reports that people are taking out cash advances on credit cards and second mortgages to buy bitcoin. Absolute madness. 
Rule number 1: Do not put your money in anything you don't understand.

No more or less trustworthy than Equifax, Target, MasterCard, Visa or any of the other countless "trusted" corporations who have failed to protect our personal information.
