My dad learned how to browse the internet, e-mail and text in the past two years or so. My mom has learned the same in the past year. Now that bitcoin is hitting the news I remind my dad that I was telling him about bitcoin for over a year now (never bought any, what can you do) and trying to convince him that its going to be a thing. Hopefully I can put together some money to give them some bitcoin for Christmas. I love it when people get a handle on technology, whether its a previous generation being brought up to speed or someone who is always up to date getting their hands on a new gadget.

You're being downvoted for suggesting he donate a very large percentage of what he is being given, and now being downvoted for complaining about being downvoted. Calm down and let this guy enjoy his good fortune, I would be using it to pay for school and it would lift a lot of stress. Would I donate? Probably some, but maybe not if I read your condescending "beer money" comment.

Silk road was bad for bitcoin in the way the media could spin it as being too tied to drugs. Its a bad thing because it was a cleaner and exceptionally less violent way to distribute drugs.
The value of bitcoin will fall and that being good or bad depends on the person but I do not doubt that this huge market hole will be filled and silk road will either be a historic point in the history of Internet drug marketplaces or will be back online like the pirate bay tends to do. 
Silk road has definitely had a part in people's consideration of bitcoin and I want to see how this all plays out. Should be a fun ride if you like any combination of economics, drugs, and internet anonymity.
