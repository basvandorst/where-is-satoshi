I dont understand this either. Why on earth would anyone prefer bitcoin salary when it is so volatile? Why not just buy bitcoin with your fiat paycheck? Weird concept or just way too futuristic.

Satoshi's so cute! I can't stop looking at her.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:39:24
I love her
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:35:16
That is absolutely not normal. Low fee issue?
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:39:26
Sound logic here. People usually flock to the smell of money, and that's good for investors, tech, everyone!
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:34:10
Can you please post more pictures of Satoshi?
She so foine

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:07:49
Need to put in money which takes days as we all know. It's insta-buy time with fee and spread and er'thang. FULL TILT MODE
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:14

Salute to our SUPREME LEADER MR KIM

When will you stop licking his nuts?

Cc purchase = instant
Bank account purchase = 5-9 days

THIS GUY

When thee purchaseth cryptocurrencies and they appreciateth, it is thine duty as a proud citizen of thine noble country to report capital gains tax on thine gains. However, if thee wisheth to purchase thine wives pearl necklaces -which may I add can easily be obtained for free- with thine appreciated virtual coins, you sir, are obligated to pay sales tax on top of thine duty to pay capital gains tax. DOUBLE TAXATION M'LORD
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:55:40
I will sit next to you in the rocket and hodl your hand friend.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:50
Why the hell are you posting this HOURS old news
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:21
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:51:18
OMG 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:52:22
Great number. Mine is similar. Make sure to calculate capital gains tax! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:29
That is kind of abnormal from my xp
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:10:17
I smell bullshit on this one, but thanks for coming and contributing to my wonderful post. Come again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:15:41
What's with the dick symbol at the end?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:49:49
Haha wont change his mind. Just an annoying guy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:14:38
NO BABY. I WANNA DO IT NOW.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:48:42
HODL to you sir
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:03:13
This actually kind of makes sense because of the "appreciation" aspect of our beloved coins. Once they stabilize like USD and become static, THEN just having one sales tax makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:48:28
This old article guys.. WTF
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:20
Omg I dunno how to handle this malicious insult!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:38:40
AHAHAHAHAHA PRETTY FUNNY

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:41:07
What a tool
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:12
That “butt” of jokes article nearly had my blood boil. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:01:06
Listen to this guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:09:20
YOU DID WELL MY CHILD
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:52:01
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:36
Yeah and there is that stupid spread of $80 too! So I said what madness! Then price dropped so I said TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS INSTABUY THING.

Happy Holidays! when people are dying from this dip, and there are insider tradings going on at CB. This is like a middle finger to everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:45:50
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:53:19
If that's the case, I want 1 BTC to have a value of $1M or more!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:39:51
Ahh I see, my bad. Didn't mean to call you a liar. Well, if it's near that range again, I guess we will keep our eyes open.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:08
I will. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:05:09

@_date: 2017-12-11 22:08:47
WTF is this??
Sing it and post the video or something.
This is pathetic.

Is this how the world views Bitcoiners?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:58:40
That is a picture of S Korea’s president, not finance minister by the way. Go figure. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:29:22
Is the author writing his next article on bitcoin “trembling” at $11,000 level?
