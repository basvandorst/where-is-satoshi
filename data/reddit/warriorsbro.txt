Same. Sold at 362 for a solid gain, within 2 hours it was up to 380. 
Its cool though, I just want it to do well.

Careful, around here bitcoin is perfect and any/all issues are the result of users, software, magic, etc

Currently they seem to be undervaluing 1 btc by about $3.50+
Edit: So idk what the deal is but on my order of $233 they wanted $238 in btc. It messed up my original order since I was like 1$ short, order was cancelled, I redid the order with a slightly cheaper item, then one of the games I wanted was out of stock; probably because of my first order that was cancelled.
I'm pro-bitcoin and all but this was a pain in the ass.
Edit 2: The 30$ discount worked FYI
Edit 3: Rakuten offered me a credit for the discrepancy, so all is good.

Coinbase took weeks to deposit the small deposits in my account so I could verify. My help requests took days to be answered. All in all it took 2.5 months before my account was verified and I could buy.

The 63 vs 60$ discrepancy you had is the same the problem I had. 
Rakuten totals their carts in USD (mine was 240$), so if I'm looking at my wallet which says I have 244$ in btc (1 btc), obviously I'd think I'm good to go. 
Then I hit "pay in bitcoin" on rakuten's site and they ask for 1.008 btc, which is more than I had.

Well come on, the USA has to blame something or else its consistent half-century of nation destabilization and proxy wars might actually be seen for what it is.
Right now its Assad, next it will be Karzai, after that who knows.

Coinbase... for being the 'easiest' way to buy, it was kind of a pain to get going. 
If I placed it in a spectrum that ranged from using cash to a home refinance, its definitely closer to the refinance.
A less determined person would give up, particularly if they were unsure of bitcoin in the first place.

Go away, nobody likes you.
