Bitcoin absolutely went on a bull run. Don't think I ever saw that one coming.  Lisk was a pretty solid investment. Almost $20 to the dot today haha.

"haha don't panic chill dude."
That is really some sound advice. How long did you sit there and think of that incredibly helpful tidbit of information you decided to pass along?
To answer OP's question, bitcoin has been known to take quite a while for transactions. My last transaction from my wallet to bittrex exchange took almost 7 hours to arrive.  With everyone scrambling to send their bitcoins to exchanges and dump them, there is no surprise this time could increase.

That is the most fear mongering BS I have read all day.
"There is no place for crypto in the modern free-market"   
Get out of here.

China has shut down local exchanges and gave them a deadline of September 30th.
People can deny it all they want, but governments DO have the power to stop crypto in their country.

Except that he wasn't stating any panic from the market, he was asking what happened to his transaction that was not showing up for him. Instead of posting something extremely vague and unrelated to the question at all, you could offer helpful advice to people on this subreddit.
You ignored 3 clearly written questions from OP, and instead provided "chill" as a means of answering those questions.   Outstanding.
