So OK, why not? It is called Corda. It makes sense to me. Actually this is not blockchain tech. But it seems that you don't need blockchain for such properties. Consensus among few parties can be handeled differently (signaturies).
It still make sense, as at the moment of deal/tx publication, relevant parties will enforce validity/consistency/integrity and immutability. This could be very value-able.
However not Bitcoin competition. And Corda issues no inherent currency.

I`ve been waiting long for these two words: India and Bitcoin. I think that Bitcoin has huge potential in coutries with no banking services. China is already playing it's role. Finally India starts to be interested. In this two countries is living half of our eatrh's population - 3B people.

Hashrate is currently doubling every few months but it doesn't mean that electricity costs are not constatnt.
EDIT: The mining market is self stabilizing and should reach equilibrium (all miners costs = all rewards). So in fact the only factor for el. consumption of BTC network right now is the BTC price, as all reward are basically only newly minted coins and tx fees are negligible. So el. costs will not rise unless the btc price rises. Which means that bitcoin has gained even more utility.
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:34:56
How is that we can not change it?
The cost for electricity for miners is more or less fixed regardless of number of tx per day. So when bitcoin network will utilize more tx per day, the cost for one tx will go down!
The disk space is cheap today, bandwidth too. And it will be even cheaper!
Imagine, in 10 year (2024). Reward will be 6.25 BTC per block.
If there is 1mil tx per day.
It is 110GB of blockchain data per year.
Only 10GB of data bandwidth per month. 
I can download 10GB file with my ISP in one hour TODAY.

Issuance of new bitcoins is stable regardless of difficulty (or better: hashrate). Study the protocol.

Secure datastructure / database / ledger as blockchain is REAL inovation. So I am convinced that is has value. 
Please see following 3 reasons I can think of right now (the 1st I see as the real inovation without other market assumptions):
1. Permission-less inovation. I work in bank as programmer. Try to compare Bitcoin network to SWIFT network. SWIFT is very closed system and ordinary human do NOT have access to it. It is expensive for bank to have SWIFT access. But bitcoin is very different story. The blockchain itself is secure and it does not need to be behind the wall. Simple Indian men can access it as it is not behind walls or firewalls. This is REAL added value which propel inovations. Me, you or them can program application for payment network. You do not need to ask anybody, get licence or pay millions of dollars.
First time ordinary man can participate in global economy.
2. It is first time in human history we have digital token, which is scarce. So if this token has utility and is scares in same time, it can have market value. And then transfer this VALUE over existing infrastructure as internet. First time in our history moving only digital tokens.
3. As this payment network (bitcoin) use ubiquitous infrastructure (internet) and is P2P. It is ubiquitous and without point of central failure. Time will time how robust bitcoin really is, but I believe it is and this property can play significant role in dark times. Bitcoin will be here as alternative for long time.
EDIT: grammar fixes

Just for record: The bitcoins generated as coinbase in genesis block (this is the blockchain start) are unspedable.
@_date: 2014-10-08 07:34:18
I agree that something like this (more tx per block) **MUST** be implemented. 
Reason for this is that the reward per block (new coins) will half each 4 years and the incentive to secure the network will go down to zero. That is why we need a LOT of on-chain tx happening in bitcoin network with tx fees each day. So miners will have incentive to continue mining.
Currently single tx costs about **$17** !!! We need approximately 100times more on-chain transactions than today, so around 7.000.000 tx per day. One tx is around 300B. There is cca 144 blocks per day. So 7MB*300 / 144 is 14,5 MB per Block

This is interesting idea I have not though about before. Thanks for raising this. But it would be very bad situation as it would be unclear and uncertain for a while which is going to be THE Bitcoin. Imagine the panic!!! Once forked it never merges. And remember the consensus is reached not only by miners but even by merchants and other parts of ecosystem. How merchant decide which one is THE Bitcoin. Submit tx to both is not convenient for average consumer.
To avoid it, code must define that fork will take palce only if e.g. 70% of mined blocks in last week are of the last version (version with 20MB blocks).

Upvoted. However could you please more closly explain what did you mean by : "sidechain without permission, without forkings and without any governance."
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:56:33
Agreed, reasons:
1) It is matter of time when BTC will be banned / white/black-listed in some countries (already happened)
2) No ban, blacklist, but people will need more privacy due to advanced chain analyses mechanism
3) real cash-like fungibility just creates confidence to accept such currency. This last point is essencial for BTC adoption.

OK, but you forgot to say that what you propose is hardfork and after that. WE end up with 2 separate bitcoin chains which will be even bigger disaster than ETH/ETC as their market value could be IMHO 1:1 (based on 1:1 hashrate) an nobody will know which chain to follow.

Not so much. Franctional reserve banking will no prevail as one new factor enters this area in case of bitcoin. Fear of bankrupcy or not getting your real bitcoins back. In case of fiat, state can guarantee that your funds will be restored by: in the worst case printing of new money. As this is not possible.
Tldr: for eur there is ECB, for usd thre is FED as last instance (insurence). For btc there is nothing.

Latest QE by FED just pumped fuel into the old inefficient engine and prolonged the range of the old car. But it didn't add any value to it. It is just nature of people that they will still be using the old engine till it will run out of fuel. And only then start thinking about replacing it by new one, more efficient one. The low interest rates here is  low gasoline price, which is kept low artificially, so peple are wasting fuel (money).
So the report makes sence to me. I believe that the crash might not be so catastrophic when people still have a freedom to invest whenever they like and FED can start new QE to buy some time. Time needed to change the structure of current economy to something new, which makes more sense today.
It is interesting to observe. Global economy is in very unique situation like never before. Technological advancements are accelearting but in the same time there is a lot of instability in Middle east...
In near future Bitcoin can become very valuable tool to hedge against QE, central structures as central banks.
By the way, the fact that report comes from IMF is still good sign for meas IMF can impact the global economy a lot.

One of applications which came to my mind is hierarchical signing when both multisig and threashold sig are combined. Imagine using multisig where one of the 2of3 private keys is threashold sig. So some signatorirs under th.sig have lowe priority of signing.
UPDATE: It seems to my, that threshold sig alone could be used for hierarchical signing even with multiple levels.
To find usefull use-case is different stuff :)

It's UAHF, so chain split. It should have build in some measures against too high difficulty, so I won't die off because of low hash rate. But still, this is an altcoin with only innovation of biger block, so do have LTC, Dash.... I do not see any reason to support that. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 20:19:41
Disagree. You are trying to disconnect having value and book-keeping. In fact, having value means that you are able to sell the token for value, which is nothing else than change of ownership in the book.
