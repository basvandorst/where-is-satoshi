Who said anything about layers?  I'm just talking about the use of payment channels already in use in the Bitcoin Protocol.


All your saying is that if LN gets implemented, the block size may still need to be increased to keep fees somewhat low enough to make a confirmation (if needed) affordable.  Maybe this is why almost everyone has proposed at least some kind of cap increase??


As acknowledged, this is a simple solution to scaling.  But as you are not acknowledging, the additional resource requirements always come with tradeoffs which could be greatly avoided under the payment channel solution.  Moreover, the simple solution you are suggesting does nothing to reduce confirmation times, users still need to wait for several confirmations to be secure.  And the increase in block propagation times will increase the frequency of orphaned blocks, creating more of a need to wait for several confirmations in order to protect against double spends.  In order to even get to Visa level transactions you would need at least a 1GB block (Gavin has suggested 8GB for Visa level).  A solution that networks payment channels could be implemented in a relatively short time and could practically immediately outpace Visa.
Also, mining on TOR is not really a big deal, but having nodes available on TOR provides an extra level of privacy and security for Bitcoin.  Recent improvements in TOR have made it possible to easily configure nodes to automatically run over TOR if the service is present.  But it Bitcoin cannot run over TOR, then so be it. However, if there is a solution that would allow for it, then that is definitely a positive.


1st) You could still--and would still--receive transactions confirmed on the blockchain.  Any user within a payment channel can request a confirmation.  Almost all savings (cold storage) would just be sitting on chain.
2nd) Your point seems moot; most people do not (now) use their nodes as wallets.  That function has been mostly severed.  I don't keep funds on my node.  I have the keys to most of my funds offline, and then I have an SPV HD spending wallet.


Like I said, most (who matter) have proposed some sort of cap increase.  Of course, a solution involving payment channels will require less of an increase than the simple solution--likely much less.


I actually don't think you realize how likely it is that blocks could remain at 1 MB indefinitely.  One of the most attractive features of Bitcoin is the immutability of protocol parameters.  There are certain parameters that cannot be changed without practical consensus working in concert.  Block size is one of those.  It takes a relatively small minority to blockade a change.  Moreover, it takes more than consensus that block size needs to increase, rather a consensus on exactly how.  There are many opinions about this, and the issue is very divided.  The default under disagreement is status quo.  This design protects the currency by disallowing changes even by a majority (immutability).
Everybody who matters is trying to scale, but the ones trying to do it most elegantly are constantly trolled by those who don't quite understand the complexities behind the more elegant solution (or those who have ulterior motives).  Accordingly, those who surround themselves with the noise of those trolls are lacking in information and understanding necessary to realize that they are even following the wrong crowd.  It's typical though of humanity.  Fortunately, the ones who can make a difference tend to have a higher intellectual ability and can sort through the noise.  Unfortunately, they tend to be outshouted by the majority--in this case a loud but larger minority--of people who matter far less.
But again, everyone (who matters) is trying to scale.  And if you are serious about discerning why the use of networked payment channels could work far better, I am confident that with enough research you too could be persuaded.

Ant and 21 are the ones that matter, and I have no ETA.  Also Bitfury and BTCC seem to have partially switched.  Don't know when they'll completely switch.  If they complete the switch, there will be activation, but 95% will at least require ANT.
Edit: 21 just switched.  So basically waiting on Ant, plus we need BTCC and Bitfury to complete the switch.

With opt-in can't the change address also be different in a replacing transaction, such that the privacy issue is avoided altogether?

The blockchain has always been used for settlement.  All transactions are broadcast and the recipient has always known of the transaction before confirmation.  However, the transaction is not settled until the transaction has been confirmed into a block (and buried).  Confirmation (the whole mining process) is settlement.
Bitcoin is presently used by settling almost every transaction--unless made with the use of a trusted third party.  Also, Bitcoin does not settle every transaction when micropayment channels are used (between two individuals only) until the parties are ready to settle (confirm).  
**One way** to scale--the simple view--would be to keep settling almost every single transaction and throw lots more resources at the system (of course this has drawbacks due to resource requirements).
**Another way** to scale is to make more use of the micropayment channels, which are already a part of Bitcoin.  Micropayment channel usage is being developed to create a trustless secure method of making transactions without the need to settle, but still with the ability to settle (confirm) if desired.  The problem is allowing multiple micropayment channels to transact between one another to form a network of sorts.  This problem has been solved, and accordingly a method is being developed (at least three iterations are presently functional for testing purposes) to safely allow for the use of 0-conf transactions between micropayment channels (all of which is already a part of Bitcoin).  Under this method, thousands upon thousands of transactions could trustlessly and securely be made and then all confirmed just one time on the blockchain.  All this by making better use of less-used features that have been present in Bitcoin for years.  This method of scaling, while more complicated to grasp, produces a far more useful and elegant result without the requirement to change (hard fork) Bitcoin and without the resource bloat.  Users would have practically unlimited 0-conf transactions that can be confirmed just once.
All parties are either trying to scale in one of those two methods.  And at the same time almost all parties have proposed throwing somewhat more resources at the confirmation process (cap increase--your only method, I presume).  The parties pushing for the more elegant, but complicated solution, recognize that less resources are needed under this method, and accordingly call for lesser cap increases to prevent the drawbacks associated with large increases.  But make no mistake, everyone (who's anyone that matters) is trying to scale.

How can we hard fork back if only large corporations can run nodes?  We've lost our say.


Where have you been?  Everybody is trying to scale, just some have a more elegant way than clumsily just raising the block size.  Unfortunately, the better way takes time.

Why should a recipient be able to override a sender's wishes to unavail themselves of zero-conf?
What benefit is the recipient losing or burden suffered by the sender exercising its option to have zero-conf unavailable for their transaction?
I'm not saying that there aren't any, but the only ones I can think of are tangential at best, and I wouldn't even consider those realistic benefits.  It seems to me that the sender is the person who is benefited by zero-conf, and if it is important to the sender, then they will put in a sufficiently high fee and opt-out of RBF.

Not anymore.  It didn't look good to ban someone for linking to SegWit that they called "malware."

SegWit is "malware" ???  I posted a link to the UASF github repo.  Even if they were suspicious, deleting the post would seem more appropriate.  I guess it looked bad, so they unbanned me.

Now you are obviously lying.  Several times you said Greg "doxxed."  There is no way you can possibly believe that given the admin response.
Greg mentioned the real name of a defendant in a fraud action.  He never even mentioned his Reddit username.
If he had mentioned his Reddit username, he might have been doxxing , which coincidentally sounds a lot like your username @_date: 2016-12-07 22:13:17

You can still do that if your customer wants it.  But if your customer does not care about 0-conf and wants the option for a possibly lower fee, then for the same reasoning as ("but you shouldn't have the right to choose that for everyone else") you should not be trying to force your customer to accept it.  Besides, what kind of business would even want to force unwanted services on their customer that could cost the customer more money that does not even go to that business.  At this point, it's becoming clear that you just want to complain.

I don't think they have faith at all.  I think they are smart and have considered the many facets to the issues and have determined to act in their best interest.  This goes for most miners in general who refuse to move their hashes to a pool that provides an iteration of Bitcoin that they determine does not serve their interests.  I would guess that the vast majority have given an amount of consideration to make your position seem faith-based.

So I guess you are assuming/worried that wallets will start enabling RBF by default?  I mean if RBF is not widely used, or requires user interaction to "opt-in," it seems to me that it is easy enough to have your system look at the transaction while at the same time sending a warning to users not to use RBF unless they want to wait for confirmations.  It should become commonplace for users to know that if they opt-in for RBF then they will have to wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2015-11-28 04:26:52
First, if you were selling gift cards (online I presume) why did it matter if you waited 10 minutes before confirmation?
To your point though.  In this iteration, not just any transaction can be replaced by fee, rather only those tagged as being replaceable by fee.  Accordingly, you could continue your practice so long as you did not do so for RBF transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-25 05:16:12

I use you guys.  And when another US exchange was having trouble with verifying me (because of a move) you guys were very helpful to verify my account.  I also have ordered a Shift card.  I remember waiting for Bitinstant to deliver on the same product.  Good work/congratulations on being the first to actually deliver in the US.  I actually find you guys to be very impressive and the only place I take I differ with you is on the BIP101 issue (but that doesn't stop me from appreciating what you guys have done for the space).
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:06:28
So then the user will choose whether they want the ability to RBF if the transaction gets stuck, or whether they want to put in a high fee to get the chance of zero-conf.  I don't see how this harms you (or anybody who handles their business with reasonable care).
It seems like the proper thing for you to do is edit your statement explaining that your post was a knee-jerk reaction and now you are okay with this if properly implemented.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:54:36
No BIP.  It's not a consensus change, just a node default policy change.  Any node can take out the code and still run just fine.
