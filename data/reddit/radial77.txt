Diving?? Up $200 from last month. Hmmm.
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:42:36
I need a house in 1 month and have a time machine that only goes ahead 10 years. Please advise.
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:52:39
 Not without significant resistance.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:38:39
Damn.. been there. Best wishes. Use rules if you trade.

No one knows what will happen.Welcome to crypto.
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:43:26
Why only $5000?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:55:26
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:27:24
Ah.. that makes sense
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:17:44
I've done that with every attempt :(
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:12:39
Buy now. It might cost more tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:19:49
The same passphrase can be used on Mycellium as well.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:12:40
If anything happens, just reset your bank pw.

Hey thanks. I did this &amp; found an unconfirmed sent transaction from 5/23 with and avg fee that doesn't show in Jaxx tx history. Is there a way to resend with a higher fee to speed things up? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:58:34
That's exactly what happened to me but 5/23. Mine didn't confirm until 5 days later, but you could try these instructions 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:47:04
0 is the only bottom. HODL!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:07:50
I would hold on until Bitcoin becomes the dominant global currency. Then I would take over the world.

PM sent. Thank you for looking into it.

Too bad Coinbase can't reliably handle an influx of activity as we saw yesterday during the market correction. Shame
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:10:37
No, Gavin boiled and ate Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:07:58
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:47:48
Both are like fruits but different in types.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:19:49
Bitcoin has been a threat since its inception. Overthrowing state money is missing the point. Empowering people is the point.
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:40:49
Currency? Yes. Cash? No. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:15:53
That said, they could embrace &amp; innovate with it which will benefit them far more than rejecting it. It's in our best interest to educate and influence around this.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:14:24
I dumped 128,000 dogecoin last night. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:05:30
Typo in 3rd sentence of 1st paragraph
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:29:42
Both.. diversify
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:03:42
Download mycellium and use your jaxx backup phrase to restore. You might find attempted transactions that are missing from jaxx.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:34:19
Ah yea..lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:19:16
Probably :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:18:04
As long as it's up from last month, there's no drop IMO. I believe it's merely a market correction.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:10:41
No leadership.  It would compromise decentralized trust that helps make Bitcoin powerful.

Same problem. Jaxx has turned to shit. I'm done with it for good.

Conspiracy theory - NSA created cyberattack to aid in the cause to end net neutrality.

No use... Probably explains why Intel &amp; Microsoft now vouch for it. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:04:56
Jaxx isn't bad. Never prompted for my pin on my device which is worrisome if lost though :(
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:59:30
On the Twitter bio - Why the statement implying that a  public ledger is not a good  idea or do you mean for the criminals?
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:12:56
I think there will definitely be resistance from state institutions when they suddenly realize their lack of control over the common person who carries a bank in their pocket.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:19:04
HODL!!!!!!!! BUY MORE!!!!!!!!!!!
