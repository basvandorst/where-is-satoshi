How does one collect bitcoins?

But Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't have a history of ponzi schemes before bitcoin, that we know of.

All transactions happen in the future with Bitcoin, certainly not the present like with cash or card.

What the heck is block height.

They pay the platform for advertisements. Paying people to advertise to other people in a covert way is a part of reputation management, a highly controversial form of "promotion" (or propaganda) that most companies or states disavow using.

Have you [seen this]( It's out of date and incomplete. But the track record of bitcoin is terrible. Even the most secure people have posted here and shown everyone the "right way to do it" isn't enough. 
Paper wallets! Oops, a bit of water ruins them. Laminate them! Shit, house fire. Use a brain wallet, no physical copy of the key required! Oops, someone wrote a script to use Ayn Rand quotes to guess them. I've never seen a fool-proof plan, than neither has anyone.
You coiners like to point to SHA-256 and say, "see it's totally secured by math". I can put SHA-256 in anything, it doesn't make it secure. It's like putting a magical unbreakable padlock on a straw hut.

Sounds like you don't understand how a bank works.

Not equally present, but it's not unheard of on Mac.

Bitcoin is a network of electricity wasting devices which generate "currency" for use in ponzi schemes and drug sales, why would a restaurant accept it for payment?

The party that infected you may have done it long ago. They may have a backlog of key logger data, for instance. And they may be going through it looking for bank account passwords, not bitcoin stuff. Eventually they looked at your data and it didn't matter if your compute was on. 
Bitcoin is definitely not a safe way to store your money and you should put it in a bank instead.

Hear hear.

This is a bitcoiner, there is no “what if”
@_date: 2016-09-30 22:09:46
And the fact you use bitcoin tells me all I need to know.

Last I checked, developers couldn't even change the string `1MB` to `2MB`.

Dollar and markets high = bubble
Bitcoin price low = not a bubble
Pretty simple. Although to his credit isn't the western financial market kind of like a bubble economy that goes bubble to bubble?

Can't be bitcoin, it's going up.
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:31:49
I did lol at this
@_date: 2015-10-24 14:48:18
that is one number
@_date: 2015-11-09 03:00:32
Nerd thing + nerd thing.
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:03:57
it's a bad chart
@_date: 2015-10-24 00:48:12
would be good to know how many
