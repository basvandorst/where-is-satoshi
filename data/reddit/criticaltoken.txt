Hi Brian, I can't believe you would actually post to this sub. Coinbase is mercilessly bashed here on a weekly basis because your company chooses to comply with US regulations to keep the doors open. On top of that, this sub is fiercely loyal to bitcoin and bitcoin only. Anything and everything else (i.e. etherum) that won't make their bitcoin worth more is a pump/dump scam. To top things off, instead of simply ignoring coinbase and using a different company or service that more closely aligns with their values, they just continually come here and cry about coinbase. Anyway thank you for all you guys do.

Too many people are buying bitcoin like buying a lottery ticket, not a good sign. The best approach to adoption is clearly telling dreamers that the price could reach (insert any of the price comments here). 
@_date: 2015-06-26 12:33:15
Watching this play out will be interesting. I can't imagine the US gov. sitting on the sideline while this occurs. I wonder what approach they will take

They refused to tell you why they cancelled the buy? If it was cancelled right away it was probably a false positive by the algorithm they use to defend themselves from being burnt. It has to be tough to balance how much you want to open yourself to fraud and how much you can piss off customers. If a customer has been buying for a long period of time and is verified it should not happen.

I thought it was a good interview, both parties did a good job and a lot of info was covered. But around the 13 min mark Alex says he is "really excited to see who dies first, thats going to be a really fun day." (referring to top VC funded bitcoin startups including coinbase). The comment adds no value to the interview and shows his lack of maturity and respect for the man he is interviewing. The Coinbase CEO took the comment in stride and handled it well though. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:30:34
many of us believe the value will moon eventually, there is little incentive to buy stuff with it irl that you could easily buy with cash or a card. especially considering we know the value of our fiat is opposite of moon and some people are underwater with their btc investment. unless a shop accepting btc has a small discount or the price of btc moons i doubt they ever get much volume and likely drop it as a payment method. it is cool for the novelty of buying stuff irl with bitcoin though
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:50:08
What others said, but important to note again bitcoin has a fixed supply. A lot of the value now is derived from its appeal as a speculative asset. Many people store the majority of their bitcoin and hope one day it will be worth much more than what they bought it for, when it is widely used as currency (high volume goods/services), but many are not willing to use it as currency for that same reason! 
With fiat the incentive to use as a currency exchanging for goods/services is greater than the incentive to store it because the supply is not fixed. Currency used broadly here for simplicity no semantics.

it seemed inevitable they would try setting a terrifying precedent to deter others from working on online drug markets in the future. even then its really disappointing to see Ross got life. literally can not imagine being thrown in a cage for the rest of my life, honestly think i would end it the second i got the chance
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:21:57
If you don't know what you meant either thats okay. There are many factors that play into the volatility and I was curious what would lead us to "final maturity" in your opinion
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:41:32
the beautiful incentive structure!
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:48:50
anyone who says anything critical of bitcoin is attacked by this community, just like anyone promoting another altcoin is attacked. it is in our best interest to do so as most of us own some bitcoin and want the value to appreciate over time. 
even if XYZ coin came along and was more efficient, scalable, etc than bitcoin, it would be fudded into the ground. its not about the tech anymore...its about the moon! 
I still think bitcoin has a bright future
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:04:25
I hope this is a small percentage of your portfolio

I should have said "continue to be for the foreseeable future imo". not sure what you mean by final maturity?
@_date: 2015-05-14 11:16:43
Supply is greater than demand. There is still little to no reason for many people to get bitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:39:59
bitcoin is very volatile and will continue to be. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:39:19
it is very "fundamentally distinct" from fiat currencies. whoever said that to you has no idea what they are talking about.

I have never had an issue with my paper wallets so I continue to use them. I boot in live cd's for creating and recently bought a new dumb printer off newegg with bitcoin. Although I am planning to buy a hardware wallet soon. Either way seems to be a good option.

I don't know why the coinbase team bothers to spend any time interacting here. They are constantly bashed for following compliance requirements as a money services business and making the best decisions for the success of their company in the long run. Brian and Fred must get high blood pressure reading these discussions. No one is forcing you to use coinbase. If you want to launder money or remain anonymous then you have other options, stop the nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:03:01
Ah, you know your stuff! 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:39:20
I am not part of the coinbase team and I have not used their services. It seems you understood my point and I struck a nerve with my comment. I do not mean to attack you personally, but I know I am not the only one here who is tired of the weekly "don't use X" because they have made their own informed decision to be compliant with the law as a money services business. Unfortunately if coinbase went your route, the reality is they would be crucified by the government. I encourage you to explore other options for your needs rather than criticizing anyone. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:35:29
it should represent a small portion of a well diversified portfolio imo. buying small amounts monthly for dollar cost averaging is good. no "most definitely" in speculation though
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:59:09
Awful stuff. It seems it will only get worse as new versions are released. The media will take notice eventually.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:36:28
it's possible with fiat money but more risky than a "digital currency" like bitcoin. it was the same deal when local businesses were receiving anonymous extortion letters to pay a ransom in btc or be harassed and get bad reviews. pretending it's not a potential problem or blaming other factors won't make it go away. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:21:02
the difference is the criminal would have had to physically obtain the cash somehow, making him more vulnerable to being caught (ex picking up the cash at a designated spot). with bitcoin it's possible for him to receive it anonymously and mix etc
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:35:52
No. I am a lurker, but your post and some of the comments compelled me to create an account. It is just as "safe to assume" that btc will be worth less than $10 USD in five years. I don't believe it exists yet, but a better form of crypto that is more efficient and scalable could be released. It may enable governments to have some form of limited control encouraging them to adopt it for use. Many people are here simply to dream of being rich imo, and I believe many will not hesitate to jump ship to COIN X when the chance of getting rich is clearly higher there. It worries me when I see people here so incredibly confident that they will be rich. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

I agree but this will never happen here. companies used be slammed daily because some people here don't understand you need some level of compliance or the company may be penalized or shut down by the government

"I'm not saying crypto doesn't help kidnappers." BOOM! That's all I was saying! We are great friends after all!

willy knows
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:34:37
no, it's a very real crypto problem, as using bitcoin makes it far easier and safer for criminals to kidnap. they never have to put themselves at risk by physically obtaining the ransom cash, and they can mix etc. when people are talking about potential solutions, please stop stubbornly denying a problem exists, it won't get fixed that way.
@_date: 2015-10-30 01:34:18
cryptocurrency is not "the sole cause and motivation" of a kidnapping. it just offers the kidnappers a safer alternative to receving the payout, opposed to having to physically obtain cash, wire money, etc. Banning baseball bats is silly, just like it would be silly to ban cryptocurrency. While strawmans are drastic and seem effective in an argument, they are literally not a rebuttal dude, and hold no weight. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:12:16
More bats...now I know I'm being trolled lol. Have a good one. But unfortunately no matter how much you pretend it's not true..bitcoin offers the kidnappers a safer alternative to receving the payout, opposed to having to physically obtain cash, wire money, etc. We should think of solutions without changing core utility of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:41:26
"Leave crypto the fuck out of it". Unforunatly crypto is a large part of making it safer and more convienent for the kidnappers. Instead of pretending this is not an issue, we should focus on solutions

THANK YOU so much for posting this! I agree completely and it drives me nuts when the community here mercilessly bashes coinbase for complying with US regulations. If this community had its way, coinbase would have been out of business long ago for not complying and they would lose all investor money. Simply put...if you don't like coinbase - DON'T USE THEM. stop crying about it and go another route you have many options
