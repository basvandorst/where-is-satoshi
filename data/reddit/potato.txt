More hindsight bias. If you think the software project looks poorly run now, you've probably forgotten what it was like in the early days...
So you probably would *not* have ever put $1k into it back in the day. Why would you throw away $1000 of "real" money on a crazy invented currency of which somebody could just create *184 Billion* Bitcoins with a bug? You'd be brave if you put $20 in at that time.
(and you still would have made about $50,000 profit from your $20;)

If for some reason you really have to re-use the same address, you can get each customer to mark their payment by putting a unique numerical code in the rightmost digits of the amount.
For example, customer 1 pays you 0.05000123 BTC, customer 2 pays you 0.03300789 BTC
Simpler to use separate addresses normally, though

One thing that gets many people excited is money. They like to have more of it.
So, you could give them each a paper wallet with a small amount (not pointlessly small though, at least a few dollars minimum)
Tell them that if they use the money within the next year, it's theirs. Keep a copy of the private keys in case they don't
This will cost you money, but it's actually cheaper and probably more effective than spending your time arguing, it won't ruin your relationship with people either.
Apart from that, the other advice here is good: don't try to force people to change how they do things and don't be condescending.

I think your whole argument is based on a false premise. You've said Valve isn't likely to accept Bitcoin because of these problems...
But, what you've described is *exactly* how Valve's Steam Store *already* operates, right now, with dollars and other currencies. There are complaints about the regional price differences, certainly, but Steam is very successful, despite that.
Look at these two links, for example. This is the same game, from the same store, sold in two different countries, with a US$40 price difference between them. 
Or ask any Australian gamer for their opinion about the prices they pay for games, compared to the US - they're already very aware that they're paying much higher prices.


Again, this is *exactly* what is happening already. There's a thriving gray market for games purchased in the cheapest regions. I know, because I participate in this market. For the small number of publishers who don't like this, Steam DRM allows them to have different editions of games in different regions - it can prevent games being activated from an IP address out of their region.
^(edit: if you visit one of the links above, visit  - your country code, to reset your Steam store to your own country)
tl;dr regional price variations are not an issue that will prevent Valve from using Bitcoin

Is it low? I don't think it is, but it depends what you're expecting. If you were hoping for another bubble, then this isn't one (yet) :)
Average weekly USD volume across the non-Chinese exchanges during the past 4 months has been about 2-3x the average volume from May to September 2013
If you include the Chinese exchanges then it's about 6x the volume, but that's not a fair comparison (they weren't significant until late 2013, and they have free trading, which inflates volume)
The periods when average USD volume has been higher than now are April 2013, and Nov 2013 - Feb 2014. Average USD Volume in Dec 2013 was enormous, about 10x the recent months' average. That's not a big surprise is it? 
Whatever... I don't know what this means, anyway. People talk a lot about transaction volume and trading volume, and they try to prove something with these numbers. But there's a huge problem: we don't really know what the source of the volume is.
My conclusion about USD trading volume is: 
1. In the past 4 months it has been significantly higher than the non-bubble periods of 2013 - averaging at least 2-3x higher
2. Unfortunately, it's influenced so much by speculative trading that it may not be very useful as an indicator of anything else (except as an indicator that speculative trading is the largest contributor to Bitcoin USD volume, which isn't a surprise either).
(A good source of the trading data for all major exchanges is bitcoinity. It is a bit glitchy, but I think it's giving a reasonable estimate over longer periods. You have to extract the data from these charts:  because they don't have a USD volume chart)

Constant discussion of day-to-day price changes isn't very popular here, so actually putting the prices in the header seems like a bad idea

Some people are more likely to donate if they think that would promote bitcoin in some way.
You probably *can't* shoehorn references to crytptocurrencies into a film set around 1916 ;) but perhaps if people knew it would be mentioned somewhere else, that would encourage them to donate.
The other thing that would be very popular around here would be if you promised to keep donations in bitcoin and spend them, instead of converting to other currencies. Whether you can do that, depends on whether you can find stuff you need that can be paid for with bitcoins. May be difficult.
It's hard to say if you'll get much in Bitcoin donations. I'd guess it's going to be a relatively small proportion, unless you get lucky. People are definitely going to want to know a lot more about what you're doing before they'll donate, as there's no real information in your post.

But it does sound insulting, and you're also getting your facts wrong. For example, the original design for Dogecoin actually created a slightly inflationary currency, with a perpetual block reward minimum of 10k coins. This was apparently an oversight, but the issue is still being debated by the developers, and the transaction fee issue is an important factor in that debate. AFAIK, the current code is still inflationary.

Some people are suggesting that this is going to be a firesale, but if these are auctioned, then the selling price could be *higher* than the market price. However, that might also establish a potentially unwelcome precedent.
From the point of view of risk-averse institutional investors, these bitcoins will be *more* valuable than average bitcoins. 
Why? Because they come direct from the US government, so any future government attempt to blacklist bitcoins from so-called 'illegal' sources cannot possibly affect these bitcoins.
Consider the position of an investment fund that wants to put $100 million into Bitcoins because they believe the price is going to rise. If they buy on an exchange, they drive the price up a lot, and pay more. If they buy off market from large holders, then they have the potential risk that the bitcoins are traceable back to some illegal activity, exposing them to unknown risks.
I seriously doubt that attempts to blacklist bitcoin addresses can really be successful, but at the moment, that doesn't matter: if the buyer believes there might be any risk of it, then they will prefer to get their coins from sources that they believe are safer. It's also important to remember that anyone buying these coins obviously believes the value will increase

My guess is that it could be removed at any time on the whim of government officials, or the mall owners (who don't want any hassle or negative PR upsetting their business). 
The question of whether it is legal or legit is a secondary issue. The real rules are mostly unwritten anyway. 
Like Bitcoin itself in China, I think the ATM will be safe as long as it stays under the radar. If you see 100 people lining up to use it next weekend... expect trouble. *That's* when the 'legitimacy' will be tested, not now.
This ATM is just 'testing the waters' and it isn't a big deal really, except that if it *does* get removed because some junior official in the finance ministry had a power trip or the mall manager got cold feet, then you can expect to see a wave of "China BANNED Bitcoin" stories being posted to Reddit again. 
I would have said this was a very risky strategic move by BTC China, because it will hurt them if the ATM is removed - but the mall is in a Special Economic Zone, which has more freedom to experiment with regulatory innovation, so perhaps they have a better chance there

It seems to be a fund that lets people invest in bitcoin, and make a profit if the value rises. I guess it's similar to the Second Market Bitcoin Investment Trust, but much bigger. 
They declared a total asset value of almost $150 million. It's possible they already spent this buying bitcoin off market.
Fortress Investment Group, which seems to be behind it, is a hedge fund or investment management firm, with about $55bn assets under management

Yes, true, but that illustrates the problem with trying to use these charts to measure the health of the bitcoin economy. These charts seem to be completely dominated by the activity of people speculating on the price of bitcoin. We know that because the charts go crazy every time the price moves a lot, especially if it's going up. 
How much is the real underlying economic activity, like people buying and selling stuff? We don't know. Is it increasing or decreasing? We don't know.
edit: I assume the charts include a much smaller proportion of speculative trades when the price is flat, so maybe then we can compare volume at different time periods, but even that is still guesswork.

Probably not.
The price of bitcoin is very dependent on speculation. It's basically a bet that the value in future will be higher than it is now. 
The value of Bitcoin (the network) depends on it being used. So more merchants = greater use = greater value. That probably means a higher price for bitcoin (the currency) because Bitcoin (the network) has become more valuable.
edit: or think of the opposite case - if everyone tried to restrict use of bitcoin to stop anyone spending it... do you think that would increase the price? :)

It's always good to look out for alternatives, but there are still probably going to be some things which just aren't convenient to purchase with bitcoin. If it's just Paypal you dislike (which I could understand), then you should also look at other payment methods, not just Bitcoin.
I can tell you how to get some of your Steam purchases much cheaper with bitcoin than you can with Paypal. You'll pay less than half price sometimes, but it requires a bit of learning, and maybe some risk.
You need a Steam account, obviously, and this site: dispenser.tf
It's an automated trading site, with lots of people buying and selling anything that can be traded on Steam. Either buy the games directly with BTC, or use your BTC to purchase TF2 keys (currently about $1.95 each in BTC), and trade TF2 keys for the games that you want. Take some time to understand the site before you do anything, because it's confusing. For your safety, avoid buying from people with very new Steam accounts. 
The reasons the games are cheaper are complicated, but it is mainly because they were bought during a sale (this is completely legit), or because they were purchased in a region were the price is lower (this is a gray area). Start off by testing it with something cheap - don't buy a $50 game until you understand how it works.
edit: spelling error, and I should mention that if you just want to pay bitcoins for Steam games, at normal prices, try the Humble Store

I should explain more clearly why I don't think those 0.00777 transactions are ordinary spam, and why I think you might have the answer to this question.
[12Nxd2...]( sent more than 120 payments of 0.00777 BTC in the space of about 3 hours on Feb 6 2014. Collectively that was worth more than $750 at the time. Sometimes he sends identical amounts repeatedly to the same address in the space of a few minutes - [example]( There are no messages attached to the transactions at blockchain.info
So it's not normal spam. It definitely *could* be someone crazy who is fascinated by addresses with lots of money going through them - this seems the most plausible explanation.
You might be able to shed light on this, because [one of the addresses involved]( received 1 BTC from an address that appears to be yours in [this large and unusual transaction]( on 2013-01-29. I was hoping you could say conclusively whether that is or is not an Mtgox address. If it isn't Mtgox, then my theory is obviously wrong.

I think you're being very optimistic. Maybe *the price* will continue to take off, just as it has already done, but the price is just a sign of people's confidence in the idea, at best. Cryptocurrencies have to overcome some real obstacles to achieve true mass adoption. For example, the issue of scalability. There are many possible ways forward, but it's unclear which is best.

@_date: 2014-05-29 11:58:50
If the problem is with the hashing algorithm, and miners can't upgrade their hardware to fix it, then in that case, they have much less weight in the consensus. That could lead to the outcome you've suggested.
But, otherwise, imagine what would happen if you suddenly kicked a large number of miners out of the system when they still had functional hardware. They're not going to just abandon their investment, so they would attempt to create their own fork. That is very undesirable, so a consensus that includes a significant majority of miners is the more likely outcome in that situation, I think.

Dogecoin did start as a joke, but I don't think any of the developers intended it to undermine Bitcoin. Though, if that was their intention, then you are right that they failed to achieve it, since Dogecoin is very helpful in introducing new users to alternate currencies -- many of whom may go on to use Bitcoin. 
A minority of the stupider users (of Dogecoin, Bitcoin and Litecoin) do see it as some kind of a battle that can only have one winner, and a whole bunch of losers, which is unfortunate. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:32:34
There might be a connection, but it is only guesswork, and could be completely wrong:
Look at the many transactions of 10,000 bitcoins you can find via this link.  Because of the size and date, it seems likely they're related to the high days destroyed, and there is a *very faint* possibility they are related to mtgox, based on the numerous strange 'spam' 0.00777 BTC transactions from 12Nxd2...

@_date: 2014-05-29 08:52:51
When you have suspicions, a trick you can use to make scammers expose themselves is doing something unreasonable and watching their reaction. For example:
1. Increase the size of the deal - try to sell them more bitcoins at the same rate per BTC. It's *really* hard for a scammer to say 'no' to this, because it's more free money.
2. Increase your price in the middle of the negotiation. Very few legit customers will accept this, but most scammers will.
A good scammer may be able to put on a convincing show of doubt when you pull tricks like these, but they've already invested their time with you, so it's very hard for them to actually walk away from the deal convincingly. They will feel they are very near to closing the deal, so they want to reel you in fast and not lose you.
You might upset a legit customer doing stuff like this, but the chances are you would still be able to salvage the deal.

To my knowledge, Dogecoin hasn't been hit by a 51% attack yet, and it's likely to be immune to one with the current hashrate.
You'd probably be pretty annoyed if someone was arguing against Bitcoin based on inaccurate information like this.
You may be thinking of the 'dogechain' (dogecoin blockchain) fork a week or two back. This happened for very similar reasons to the Bitcoin blockchain fork about a year ago -- new versions of the client rejected an unusually large transaction while old versions still accepted it. It was resolved surprisingly quickly by the developers. It took about 6 or 8 hours to have a fix, I think, which is not bad for a 'joke' currency that's only a few weeks old. I'm not sure if money was lost or double spent, but I know many people were concerned about missing and delayed transactions. Mining pools that were on the wrong chain definitely lost out by mining worthless orphan blocks.
edit: BTW, the transaction that caused the dogecoin fork was  (same guy as just-dice.com) moving its cold wallet of around 1 billion dogecoins / $750,000
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:49:34
True, but the problem with people who don't understand Bitcoin throwing their money in just because the price went up, is that they might take their money out just as fast when the price goes down. So they lose money, and cause greater volatility.
@_date: 2014-08-27 05:59:28
I guess you sent it as a custom transaction? If you didn't, then I think bc.info screwed up. I don't know if there's any way to manually redo your transaction from inside the blockchain.info wallet
If no miner accepts the TX, Blockchain.info will eventually give up broadcasting and show the funds back in your wallet. I think that can take several days, so if you're in a hurry, you'll probably want to try other options.
It may be possible to carefully export the private keys to a new bc.info wallet and resend. That will look like a double spend attempt, so I don't know if you'll run into trouble somewhere.

Why would he use his own (mtgox) system to steal it? That makes it obvious that it's him, or someone else physically at that location.
That would be dumb when he could just move it directly on the blockchain with the private keys and claim a hacker did it. Nobody could prove he was lying in that case
edit: if someone else has just hacked into mtgox from the outside and is trying to move that money out now by shifting it to the hot wallet... that would make the Japanese authorities look pretty idiotic. Unlikely, IMHO... well, I hope it's unlikely.

Yes, but that was a long time ago when far fewer people and companies were invested in Bitcoin, and the total market cap of all bitcoins was only about $300,000 (today it's about 30,000 times higher).
That's why such a simple, but serious, exploit in the protocol could exist at that time, because Bitcoin was still very new, and it wasn't really a big deal. Even if someone had been cheated out of 100,000 bitcoins during the few hours that those fake coins existed, that was only worth a few hundred dollars. 
Today, although the protocol is more secure and has more eyes on it, the stakes are also a lot higher, and there are many more options available to a person or entity trying to profit from a weakness.
An attacker would be aware that a rollback of the blockchain is possible, and would try to find ways to get his money out before that happens.

What you've said is mostly true, but if you look at the chart on any smaller timescale, like the last 1 or 2 years, then that small bump doesn't show up.
I think when you get a sudden increase in Google trends score it tends to be following the price, much more than any other event. The price goes up and the media starts reporting on that during the next few days or weeks.
There is obvious long term growth. You can see media attention has been roughly doubling every year, even ignoring the bubbles. But I don't think there's enough evidence to support the conclusion you've reached.

The Bitcoin community can sponsor *anything*, so why dilute the impact by copying something that's been done before? Being first is important. New ideas usually get more attention. So it seems like this is not the most effective use of the money for Bitcoin, and it's possibly also bad for Dogecoin, too, by making their achievement look less spectacular.
Assuming the Bitcoin-sponsored driver performs at a similar level to Josh Wise (dogedriver), then the only way to get a multiplier effect and generate more publicity than before would be to have a 'battle of the coins', with cars simultaneously sponsored by both Bitcoin and Dogecoin. I don't think that the Dogecoin community has the resources or the morale to do that right now, though.

"the act of paying 0.000012 BTC for an app lacks elegance, which is important in a consumer-facing venue like Google Play. Don’t expect a Bitcoin logo will be popping up in the Play Store any time soon."
Or... maybe... Google could simply keep displaying the main price in the user's local currency, such as USD, like *every other major retailer that accepts Bitcoins already*
"A solution that satisfies all parties might be to allow Bitcoin transfers directly into Google Wallet. "

Joe public doesn't understand the use of 'bits' to represent encryption strength anway. So most people won't even have the level of knowledge required to be confused by this. If they see 'bits' they will just assume it's money, I guess.


This isn't a good example, because almost nobody measures such huge amounts of data in bits, except people studying information theory or something of that sort.


Yes, there's more possibility for confusion because ordinary people do vaguely understand megabits as a measurement of bandwidth. *But* is a megabit ever likely to be used as a measurement for bitcoin? We don't have megadollars and kilodollars, for example. Isn't a megabit equal to one bitcoin?

The most likely reason for a thief to use your change address in his own transaction would be if he was using Bitcoin Core with your wallet - therefore the thief was accessing your computer, somehow, on 2014-06-29 . 
Also, at exactly the same time you were posting here (2014-07-26 05:00 UTC), that address was accessed again, and the remaining coins in it were sent to another address (edit: I see from your other comment that you did that)

There are rough estimates of how many BTC have been stolen in major thefts, but I don't think anybody tried to find out if the thieves still have the coins. Once the coins start moving, it's almost impossible to be sure without other evidence. Nobody can even figure out what happened to the coins that were stolen from Mt Gox, assuming they existed.
An example: In the Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust case in 2011-12, he apparently cashed out immediately. So although he took in 700,000 in investments and stole 200,000-250,000 bitcoins, he only got about $150,000, and the coins all went back into circulation through exchanges. That is according to the SEC.
tl;dr a lot of stolen coins go back into circulation, so almost everyone probably has some by now

That's an interesting suggestion. I've seen mining hardware sales guesstimated in the hundreds of millions, so it's rather significant. 
I expect their source of information is news, financial reports, and press releases, so they're not likely to count anything that doesn't show up in those sources. 
I guess they could try to estimate sales of mining hardware, but I'd be surprised if they do. I think they're just getting a broad picture of traditional VC activity, not analyzing every industry in detail.
There's a lot of other investment that they wouldn't be able to count, and not only for Bitcoin startups, but for other internet and software businesses also. Anything which is community-driven or partly open source - people are contributing work for free, and that is a form of investment which would cost money in other industries.

There's a lot of jokes to be made with aspects of the culture around Bitcoin, but early on, Dogecoin wasn't using that to laugh at Bitcoin, it was mainly using them to laugh at itself, the absurd memecoin, which was what made it so funny. Even the mining parameters, like one minute blocks, were a sort of joke: like, how ridiculous can it be and still work?

There are many mitigating factors, as you've said, but...
In the event that Bitcoin's survival is unexpectedly threatened, *and* all else fails, the final fallback is an emergency update to the Bitcoin core software. This requires consensus - it would have to be acceptable to an overwhelming majority of miners and other major users to be effective. This allows anything, even a rollback of transactions. This has been done before. This is one reason for the alert key. 
If that failed, then I guess it's time to move to one of the surviving altcoins that wasn't wiped out by whatever disaster struck Bitcoin :)  though I guess 'failure' could mean a permanent fork of the blockchain, so perhaps BTC1 and BTC2 would have to fight it out in the market.

The term "double spend" includes more than one kind of attack
There's a huge difference in difficulty between doing a double spend with 0 confirmations and doing a double spend against a transaction that already got 1 confirmation.
Zero confirmation double spending is something that anyone can try, so it's a real risk that everyone needs to be aware of - it is detectable. But even attempting to reverse a transaction that already got 1 confirmation requires access to very expensive hardware, or a lot of luck, and may still fail.
AFAIK, almost all successful double spends have been against merchants and services that accepted zero confirmation payments.

Older coins tend to be free to send because the fee is partly an anti-spam defense. 
Imagine if somebody wants to slow down the bitcoin network by overloading it with lots of transactions between addresses that he controls. Without fees, he could send tens of thousands of small transactions, taking most of the space in each block. And then send them again, forever.
The first line of defense is that he has to pay a fee for sending small transactions.
But a spammer with more resources could avoid that fee by sending lots of larger transactions, again using the same coins repeatedly. So, a fee for newer coins prevents that. He can send his spam coins for free once, and then the next time, he has to pay a fee, because they're not old coins any more. It's still possible to spam the network, but at least you have to pay for it. So far, nobody has thought it worth the expense to DDOS the network in this way.

Yes, it is able to do that. In Bitcoin Core now it's easy to reuse an address manually. There's an option to set a custom change address in the send interface, if you have coin control enabled in the settings. But I'd be a little surprised if it can happen automatically, because reusing addresses makes the transactions less anonymous. I thought it just kept generating new addresses whenever you sent coins and change was created
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:29:02
Yes, very likely. If there's no real cost to trading, then people (or bots) will trade more.

I like Dogecoin, and having a fanatical community is the critical factor in its growth, but I can't deny this. Bitcoin also attracts a lot of stupid people (both for and against it), but Dogecoin is way ahead on that metric. 
Saddest thing is the number of people in who attack the 'bitcoin community' because they mistakenly believe that most 'bitcoiners' are putting them down or being 'elitist', while at the same time those dogecoin folks don't realize that they are repeating all the mistakes that the Bitcoin community has already gone through.

Then... don't use a poor random number generator? It's a very well-known security hazard, and I think there are one or two bitcoin-related examples where people have lost money.
I hope you don't mind me saying, but your original question is really unclear. You can see that the way that you expressed it is confusing, because every person who answered you has had to guess what you're really talking about, and we mostly misunderstood it.
There are some clues in your question that suggest you actually have a specific situation in mind. But you've tried to ask a very general question. Don't do that. Just ask about the specific situation first.
Furthermore, anyone who can give you a good answer to your question does not need to be told that its possible to program a computer to check private keys - that is obviously how a weak RNG would be exploited to steal money, so you don't need to explain it. 


This also very confusing. Why are you assuming the best available RNGs are usually javascript-based? I don't think this assumption is true, but it seems to imply that you actually want to talk about browser-based apps only, not standalone software like Bitcoin Core.
I guess that is related to the specific situation that you wanted to ask about. Are you interested in the RNG used by bitaddress.org or other sites like it, maybe? Or maybe you're thinking of blockchain.info and similar online wallets?

It seems impossible that this ordinance is deliberately aimed at bitcoin 'ATMs', because it was formulated more than 6 months ago.


One part of the government, the IRS, decided to classify bitcoins as personal property for tax reporting purposes. Every other part of the government sees them as something else, usually as some form of currency.
If you're concerned about this, why don't you raise the issue in a constructive way, instead of throwing really dubious accusations at the council.
What you've basically done here is planted a false story: that Philadelphia has banned Bitcoin ATMs. For example: 
So what happens when councillors in other cities notice that headline? 
Maybe some of them start thinking "Hey, it looks like Philadelphia banned Bitcoin ATMs, I don't know anything about Bitcoin, but there must be something wrong with these ATMs if Philadelphia banned them. So maybe we should think about banning them too"

Maybe your site isn't displaying the history properly? Or maybe there really were no old orders waiting in that range. That would be surprising though...

Dogecoin-qt code is copied from Bitcoin-qt. There are changes, but I think it's 90% identical. I think most of the filenames are the same, so that's probably the source of the problem: Bitcoin-qt is reading the dogecoin-qt files
I hope you didn't have any money in Bitcoin, because it sounds likely that you've overwritten the bitcoin version of the wallet.dat with the dogecoin wallet.dat, which would make your bitcoins permanently inaccessible if you don't have a backup of it.

However, assuming the other miners all exploded or something, since the blockchain would not be updating and all transactions would be stalled, the devs would be furiously rewriting the code to make Bitcoin start working again as soon as possible (probably within 24 hours, based on past incidents)
They could just change the difficulty, but, as they're being forced to do a hard fork anyway, they would not want to roll out a new version that gave one guy 100% of the hashrate. Perhaps they'd switch to Scrypt or some other hashing algorithm that already has widely distributed mining infrastructure. So, OP would get absolutely nothing...

the call


The recording is probably legal admissible evidence, because Paypal itself warns that all calls can be recorded.
But, anyway, the more the guy talks, the more chance he's going to hurt his own case somehow. If this really became serious for them, Paypal's lawyers will be all over single word he has said, looking for ways to undermine his case. He really should shut up.

Companies are conservative and risk-averse, especially big companies. There are benefits to adopting bitcoin, but at the moment, the number of customers who will use it to pay is still very small. So companies have to weigh the possible risks of adding a new payment method against the benefits it might bring, such as a small increase in revenue. This tends to be an easier decision for small companies in niche markets.

That's an interesting question. 
Their circlejerk depends on defining 'bitcoiners' as a certain kind of person -- a loathsome kind of person that is very different from themselves.
Unfortunately, the comments in this thread don't fit that definition. 
What do people usually do with facts that challenge their beliefs?
They ignore them or explain them away. 
Otherwise, they might have to admit to themselves that they were wrong, which is painful. (Funnily enough, many people who post in also fall prey to this weakness).

This kind of question is very worrying coming from someone who seems to be in a rush to spend 6K.
You should be able to weigh up the evidence for and against that sort of allegation, and *make your own decision* about it -- before you jump into a big investment in something as experimental and volatile as bitcoin.

Yes, it does seem very likely that the extra coins being traded would tend to stabilize more than destabilize in the short term.
The fact that the payment processors are likely to be experienced traders, not making panic buys and panic sells, probably provides additional stabilization. Although, I assume they automate some of the trading, so there could be unforseen volatility due to quirks of the trading algorithms used, if a lot of trading volume is coming from just one or two big payment processors.

If you're right, then it seems there might be even more money still in MtGox addresses
These are the addresses you found:
Did you notice that all 5 of those addresses, that you identify as mtgox storage, have something in common? They all receive identical payments of 0.00777 BTC from 12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh in a short space of time on Feb 6. 
I'm wondering what it means. To me, 0.00777 looks like a marker. I mean, it appears to be a regular number which is intended to be easy for a human to find later. 
But why would someone throw away $5 as a marker, when they could just as easily send 0.0000777? So, I would assume that, if it is a marker, it was sent by the person who owned those addresses, so they are *not* throwing the money away.
So.... Let's say you are correct and those 5 are mtgox addresses. Let's also assume that the person sending in 0.00777 controls the addresses. 
Ok, now look at all the other addresses that also receive 0.00777 BTC from 12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh during that same short period on Feb 6. There are more than 120 transactions of this kind.
Some addresses receive more than one of the 0.0777 transactions, but still, there are *many* such addresses, and most of them contain 10,000 BTC
Are these also mtgox cold storage addresses? If they are, then mtgox has even more money still in its cold storage addresses
For example, here are a few of those addresses, with the amount they hold, and the date they received it
10,000 BTC -  2014-02-05 17:37:27   
10,000 BTC - 2014-02-05 17:55:54   
10,000 BTC - 2014-02-05 17:34:47   
10,000 BTC - 2014-02-05 17:35:22    
10,000 BTC - 2014-02-05 17:36:02   
10,000 BTC - 2014-02-05 17:34:04   
 This one is unusual, because it held the same amount as the others, 10K BTC, but the money was transferred out recently. None of the others had any outputs like this. Note the vanity address that sends in 1 BTC in the first transaction 2013-01-29 ... GMaxwell... I've no idea what to make of that. Maybe can shed some light on it
Another interesting one:  -- notice the possible vanity address. Coincidence?
You can see all the addresses receiving from 12Nxd2 here...
  I think every address on this page has received 10,000 BTC (or more), and almost all still have it. There are as many as 50 addresses with 10K on just this page, though I haven't checked to see if there are duplicates.

The story is more complicated...
The premine was about 750 blocks (according to the devs and one of the pool operators)
The timestamps in the blockchain do support that claim, because they show the first 759 blocks were mined the day before the launch. 
It gets murky after that. The devs claim they gave the software to some pool operators "a few minutes early", to give them time to get set up. Supposedly, one or two pools managed to get running slightly ahead of the others, and mined almost all of the next 1300+ blocks in a few minutes
Now they've admitted they made a mistake, and they are "giving away 200-250m of the original 505m premine".

I can see the guy is trying hard to understand, but these 'discovering bitcoin' articles by journalists are so weird, and often very similar to each other.
He's like an alien tourist visiting from another planet, who wants to understand dollars. But this is what he does...
1. OK! Where do dollars come from? Printing! Easy! I'm gonna print me some dollars! Imma be rich!! Yay!
2. No... wait. I wasted all day trying, but for some reason, printing money is actually really difficult and expensive, not easy. This sucks!
3. OK, then I'll just buy some dollars! 
4. OMG! I exchanged my own money for dollars, but I had to go across town and line up, and it was difficult and expensive. This sucks! 
5. Anyway, now I have some dollars. I heard a rumor that there's a big market for illegal things which uses dollars. That sounds exciting, so I'm going to do something I would **never** normally do. I'll run over to the bad side of town, try to buy illegal drugs with my new dollars, that I don't even understand...
6. Oh Wow! That was so difficult and scary!! This sucks! I don't like dollars much
7. Well, anyway, I'm going to randomly change my dollars into Jordanian dinars, because... er... because I CAN!
8. Now I don't have dollars, I have Jordanian dinars, and I lost a bit more money. This sucks! These dollars are so hard to use. Jordanian dinars are even worse
9. OH WTF! Now the value of my dinars went up 20% overnight, and I got richer without even doing anything. Screw that! That's much too volatile for me. This sucks!
10. Oh shit! I left my wallet on the table for a few minutes, and my dinars were stolen... This sucks!
Meanwhile, *back in the real world*: People work, they earn some dollars, maybe they spend some on something they need. Unlike journalists, they do not run around, like a deranged rabbit on meth, trying to print dollars, changing them into random foreign currencies and attempting to buy guns and drugs with them...

You're looking at the last point on the transactions chart, right?
The last point on the chart shows the number of transactions that have happened up until the current hour of the current day. So it won't show a full day's data until the end of the day
This is a common 'bug' in a lot of charts you see online. They look like they drop dramatically right at the end.

@_date: 2014-06-01 04:01:40






The problem is that if you do that, you're just looking at one exchange. The market has changed so much, with exchanges rising and falling, and fees changing, that it's difficult to compare that data over long periods of time. 
I assume volume is much lower than the peak of the last bubble, but that's not surprising.  I don't know if it's a 'scary' margin though :)
FWIW, Bitcoinity shows an average volume of 145,000 BTC per day over the past six months, and an average of 170,000 over the past 24 hours - but it's not tracking all exchanges (it's often getting no data from OKCoin's API, for example). BTCKan, which does include OKCoin, shows a total volume of 265,000 over the past 24 hours.
edit: should also consider USD volume, which would accentuate the peaks of the Dec 2013 bubble, too.

If OP really wants to mine, then for the price of a GeForce 780, they could easily buy an AMD R9 280x, which will currently make about $100/month mining scrypt coins. Those can be traded for bitcoins, or held for speculation.
It could earn more, if the OP makes a good choice of coins to mine, but difficulty will rise and prices may fall, so the monthly income could easily have dropped to $50 within a month or two, and keep falling. It's not certain if it would ever pay off the cost of the computer

Interesting presentation. Showing the chart (Page 26) of the USD/BTC rate over the last 5 months is rather strange, isn't it? Why would they choose such an odd period? They used 2 years in the chart of gold/USD, for example.
Coincidentally, 5 months is the longest possible period that would produce a chart that shows a fall in value for BTC. Extending the chart to a more commonly used period, such as 6 months, would show a dramatic rise in value of BTC over that period.
Funny how it turned out that way ;)
I guess they wanted to show as much data as possible, because that makes the report look more legitimate, so they chose the longest possible period that would suit their message.

I don't think it's likely to happen, because miners probably wouldn't just switch off en masse. 
Undoubtedly, if it did happen (maybe because of a natural disaster disabling a lot of miners), it would be a very challenging scenario, not least because the uncertainty would push the price down further. However, I think the developers can alter the difficulty formula, to make it much easier, and push out a revision. 
If that's possible, then the challenge would be to quickly choose a revised difficulty formula that would appeal to a clear majority of the remaining miners, in order to avoid a fork.

Yes, although based on the writing style alone it can be hard to figure out if you're dealing with a child, a good-natured idiot or a scammer. Perhaps all of them should be avoided, though.
Something which is very hard for a scammer to hide is that their business model and cost basis is quite different from everyone else. 
For example: 
Their profit margin on a successful 'deal' is extremely high. This affects their behavior, as I said earlier.
They do not risk being scammed themselves, their main cost is time, so their approach to trading can seem odd - they don't seem to be paying attention and they don't ask the right questions. 
They cannot afford to have a permanent, real-life identity, because they're inevitably going to have to burn it eventually. The kind of fake forum you mentioned is a more advanced attempt to build that kind of identity, but still, if you dig into it a little, you tend to discover a disturbingly short history, inconsistent stories, and a lack of depth. People can sometimes build a good fake history for themselves, but it gets really time consuming building good fake histories for all their throwaway shills as well.

Why are you so sure that they will? The original announcement didn't seem clear about that. It was so vague that I wonder if the person who wrote that even thought about the question yet.
Did they make any other statements about it after that?
They refer to three distinct entities on which creditors have a claim in the April 24 announcement: 'cash', 'assets', and bitcoins. 
So the question is, do they see bitcoin as 'assets' or as 'cash'? 
I don't think the April 24 announcement clearly answers that question. I'd *guess* that government officials in Japan are more likely to define bitcoin as an asset than as cash, but bear in mind that a government may place bitcoin into different classes depending on the situation (i.e. US IRS defines it as property for tax purposes, but other departments may define it as something closer to money for other purposes).
I should also point out that the bankruptcy trustee is a representative of a private law firm, not a government official. In western countries, at least, bankruptcy trustees *are not immune from personal liability* for the results of their conduct. Why would they be?
edit: gave a pretty good [answer]( if correct, then law trumps everything, and the BTC are sold for JPY, ~~prepare your buy orders for 100  ;)~~ some time in the far future when 1 bitcoin is either worth $100,000 or $0.01

Really, there already are quite a lot of cases of people losing bitcoins because their computer was insecure, they chose a weak password, or they stored it on a site that got hacked. This is a major problem that has to be solved if Bitcoin is to be more widely adopted..
It's arguably as serious as the problem of credit card fraud and payment fraud in the conventional financial system, but the difference is that the losses fall 100% onto the individuals who made bad choices, instead of being spread throughout the system as higher fees, chargeback costs, etc. Whether that's a plus or a minus is a matter of opinion (I'd say it's ultimately a plus, because it lets the user have their own choice of security, or insurance, or just be responsible for it themselves)
One solution, maybe the best, are hardware wallets like the Trezor, though that still has not been released. (

If the USDOJ ever moved all of that $3.03 million in one BTC transfer, then it seems like there's a good chance of tracking this sale - finding out where the BTC came from, and where and when it was sold. 
For example, if we use the Bitstamp price range, and assume that they sold the BTC during the last six months, then that would mean it was sold at a price somewhere between US$190/BTC and US$1163/BTC. 
So, that would be one transaction for an amount between 2500 BTC and 16000 BTC during the last six months. I guess there are thousands of such transactions.
But taking a list of transactions in that range of values, and multiplying them by the historical Bitstamp USD price for that day (from Bitcoincharts raw data), would give a short list of likely candidate transactions.
Is there any online tool that can search for transactions by value?

It's possible, but the fact that they didn't steal exactly 100% of the money suggests they were in a hurry or had limited access (e.g. their connection was very slow because they were using something like Tor). If someone had a copy of the whole wallet on their machine, they would take their time and clean out all the funds.
It's not essential to launch bitcoin core, they could use bitcoind, it's in the same folder. Possibly you could find out if bitcoind was used, because there might be a new windows firewall rule for it, which should be recorded in the Windows Event Viewer at that time (or equivalent for whatever OS you're using). Or, possibly, they used Bitcoin Core, but sent the transaction quickly before it had got very far updating the blockchain. The local copy of the blockchain doesn't have to be updated to attempt to send money 
There's one unusual thing about this that I don't understand, which might help you figure out what happened - the change address was an address that you had already used. I'm not sure why, you'd need to ask someone who knows bitcoind and bitcoin core better than I do.

Spreading out your buying over time (known as DCA, or Dollar Cost Averaging) reduces your risk of losing a lot, but it also reduces your risk of gaining a lot. What you're doing is reducing the variance - increasing the chance that your return will tend towards the long term average (which could be higher or lower than where you started, obviously). 
I sometimes see people in who seem to think that DCA will magically reduce their risk of loss without also reducing their chances of gain. Basically, they believe it will get them something for nothing. It won't.
DCA is one way of managing stress, if you're risk averse, by reducing your exposure to extreme risk (another way of managing stress would be... simply not investing more than you can afford to lose). 
If you're using DCA to drip money into the market a little bit at a time, then you have to be honest with yourself: why do you want to reduce variance and manage stress? Why are you afraid to dump your entire investment into the market at once? Is it because you're actually not confident about your investment and you're trying to hide the risk from yourself? In that case, maybe you shouldn't be putting money in at all...
A 'side benefit' of DCA is that it's smart for people who have no experience with Bitcoin to start out by investing small amounts, so they can get familiar with the technical aspects and avoid losing their whole investment through some basic mistake like sending it to the wrong address.
Some people end up using DCA simply because they only have a limited amount available to invest each month.
A few studies have actually found DCA to be sub-optimal compared to lump sum investing. It's hard to say if these warnings apply to bitcoin investing though... even if they are accurate.

If you feel worried at the first sign of a downward trend, you should absolutely not be 'investing' in Bitcoin, for your own sanity. 
Look at the price graph for the past year -- specifically, the peaks and troughs. Don't get on board now if you can't handle that kind of rollercoaster ride. If you're going to watch the price every day, then you need to be able to watch it plunge to $400 or $500 without getting overly stressed.

I agree that it would take off like a rocket. I'd also expect it to drain very large amounts of money out of Bitcoin and altcoins.
However, I think corporations will be *very* hesitant to release a cryptocurrency project which will always be linked to them in the public mind, but is permanently and irrevocably out of their control. 
There are PR issues of course, but the real problem is that the potential liability is almost unlimited. One could argue that it's just like any other open source project that has its genesis in a corporation, and they're not legally responsible. Maybe... but if hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake, and they have to satisfy the legal systems of every country in the world, then it doesn't look like a very safe idea. 
So, it's really risky, IMHO, and what's the reward if they succeed...?

What client or wallet did you use to send the transaction? If no miner will pick it up, then you might have an option in your client to delete it or resync with the blockchain, so you can retry the transaction without the non-standard output. If that can't be done, there are other options. Make sure you have a fresh wallet backup, and keep any old backups too.
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:03:49
That may be true, but I think it didn't matter very much.
Even if many of the coins in Mt Gox were  'virtual' coins, everyone believed they were real, so they still had an impact on the price as if they were real coins being traded. While they're inside an exchange, they are just numbers in a ledger, whether they exist or not. 
(It would have inflated the apparent total supply of coins by about 5%, but increasing the supply is most likely to depress the price, if it has any effect. The price did decline and was extremely flat for a long time after Gox was hacked in 2011, BTW)

It's interesting that the *USD value* of BTC transacted* is holding quite steady
[bc.info Chart](
It looks like the volume of transactions (in BTC) is rising because the price has gone down, but people still want to send/receive the same amount (in USD) of BTC as normal. So they are naturally sending more BTC.
In other words: activity isn't really increasing or decreasing, and the price affects usage less than you might expect
BTW, USD transaction value during this current 'slump' is basically double what it was during most of 2013
^(*That is according to blockchain.info, who sometimes put out glitched and misleading data. And it doesn't include offchain transactions, or really account for the effects of exchange trading)

It looks like you're right, but isn't this strange? How did the coins go directly ~~from the OP~~ into the BTC-e ~~cold~~* wallet?

I guess the actual theft was the previous transaction, not the one to BTC-e.

If you're wondering why you get downvotes and a hostile response, one reason is that questions like this are really annoying. 
You're starting off with the erroneous assumption that Bitcoin and Dogecoin can be divided into neat categories, labelled "better" and "worse". 
So anyone who wants to talk to you has to first either accept this proposition, or laboriously explain to you why they do not accept it.
It's like you're approached by some random stranger in the street, who asks you "How are Pineapples better than Cabbages?" - you'd probably walk on swiftly.
I'll just say Bitcoin and Dogecoin are similar, but different.
Just looking at the technical differences can be interesting, and I'd suggest you start there with your research. For example, Dogecoin has a much faster block confirmation time, much greater number of units, much quicker reward halving, etc

To get an idea of the potential effect on prices, it's probably better to compare it to something like transaction volume than market cap, but anyway, to put it into perspective: $28 million is approximately the value of new bitcoins that is being produced every week by miners.

This could be quite helpful. I've found that following the regular trolls is very useful.
*Not* really for anything they say, because, whenever I bother to actually read it, it's rather repetitive and usually not even amusing, unfortunately
Trolls are a very useful indicator of market sentiment. When they get really confident after a price drop, and start mocking people, then it's usually time to start buying. When they get really quiet, then it can be a sign to be cautious because the market might be getting a bit over-exuberant.
The trolls also help draw my attention to interesting posts. The regular trolls don't waste their time trolling on spam and crap posts. So if they think it's worth trolling, then it might be worth reading and upvoting.
So it would be nice to have a bot that tracks them all, then I wouldn't have to waste time looking at them one at a time.

The Chinese government didn't stand to benefit from the positive TV coverage, so they probably weren't involved. Most government officials probably learned of Bitcoin for the first time *from* that TV coverage.
It does seem slightly more plausible that negative coverage could be prompted by the government, trying to cool down the market, or warn people off before a crackdown. It could also be done without any government intervention, as you said. Just an attempt to put a new spin on the story to get viewers, even.

If someone stole the keys from MtGox, then they would move the money immediately, because how could they be sure that nobody else had a copy of them? If there's any chance that someone else has the keys, then it would be a race to move the money first.
So there are two likely possibilities:
**1** This money was moved by someone at Mt Gox (or Mark Karpeles) or
**2** A thief had the keys, but he could not move the money immediately, for example,  the keys had to be decrypted first. AND all other copies of the keys had been lost or erased.
(*1* looks much more probable to me, because *2* relies on two unrelated conditions: a successful theft, and a failure to have backups)
^(Other possibilities? ~~Something like a delayed time-locked transaction, or m-of-n scheme, but I don't know how to look for this.~~ The scripts don't look any different from other transactions, I think. *edit: nullc confirms they are ordinary transactions*)
Of course, I'm assuming this is Mtgox money.

Wow, I had to dive for cover there, you moved the goalposts so far!
Your original question was: "do you or anyone have any data indicating that the internet or e-mail were this distrusted **when they were nascent technology?**"
No mention of the 'consumer-available' internet there in your question, is there? FYI, the Internet and Email were 'nascent' in the 1970's. 
You said you didn't even understand why I chose the invention of HTML as a relevant point in time? It was because your original argument was so weak that I was trying to help you by suggesting a more sensible starting point! (Although, if want to be difficult, I can argue that the consumer internet really got started in the 1980's with networks like Fidonet, Compuserve and the Well, which were all accessible to ordinary people, and all had interlinks with the Internet and gradually merged with it) 
Maybe I should move my goalposts as well and start claiming that I'm really talking about 'consumer-available bitcoin', so I can shift the starting date around to suit my argument? Is bitcoin even 'consumer-available' now? Many critics would say it is not.
Secondly, even after redefining your original question to make it refer to this so-called 'consumer internet' that you claim was created in 1995, you're still wildly wrong. I linked you to a collection of articles in one of America's leading consumer-focused magazines, which are clearly about consumer user of the Internet, and date from years before 1995. 
By the way, referring to the government (via the 'Federal Networking Council') finally waking up and defining the term 'Internet' 20 years after it was defined in RFC675, using basically the same words and by some of the same people, such as Vint Cerf... that was, I'm sorry to say, laughable. Though neither of those declarations is particularly relevant, in any case.
And blithely hand-waving away all those fear-mongering headlines about the Internet, in one of the country's most influential news sources, when you had specifically demanded evidence that the nascent Internet was 'distrusted'? That was weak, honestly.
Anyway, I'm done here. Nobody else is reading this, and you're not interested in genuine discussion, are you? 
I'll let you have the last comment, if you'd like to move those goalposts one more time... 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:31:26
I wouldn't fault you for abandoning this subreddit, because, like any large subreddit, the quality of posting and discussion is generally poor, and getting worse. You could try I keep reading because I'm very interested in the concept of alternative currencies, and the subreddit does alert me to a lot of news, bad as well as good - particularly if I don't rely solely on the front page. To make it easier, I have a lot of users tagged as 'ignore' in RES, because I don't find their comments a useful source of information (or even entertainment). This includes trolls, [liars]( spammers, relentless bitcoin boosters, price manipulators, conspiracy nuts, people who refer to all other subscribers or 'bitcoiners' as an undifferentiated mass, and general idiots.
I'm only aware of sqig because he responded to one of my comments a few days ago. 
I then tagged him as 'ignore' in RES, because I assumed he was some kind of troll. I can only speak for myself, but here are my reasons:
His initial responses were so obtuse that I mistook him for a rabid pro-bitcoin advocate; in fact, I started lecturing him on the stupidity of constantly trying to force bitcoin on people who aren't interested in it... the irony.
His replies struck me as 'high school debate club' posturing. He misinterpreted and exaggerated what I'd said, and then he argued against his own skewed interpretation of it. It's tedious and dishonest. I don't want to waste time playing silly rhetorical games like this. The sneering and condescending attitude didn't help either.
Someone pointed out to me that he did this all the time, so I looked at his history, and sure enough, it seemed to be true. I don't understand this behavior, I can only guess why. Perhaps he's not trying to be a troll, perhaps he was an earnest contributor who has been driven insane by the sound of the echo chamber (hence the odd tics, like referring to bitcoin as 'bit coins'), perhaps he still makes some relevant points sometimes. I don't know. All I know, based on my own experience, is that he doesn't seem to be arguing in good faith. I'd rather use my limited time to pay attention to people who are. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:31:51
Yes, it's not a bad summary, but it does have a subtle bias, like the writer had some ideas already and kept looking for evidence to support them
For example, the Bitcoin source isn't really as big as they're saying. Not 17 MB. Less than 5 MB, I think. The majority of it is actually graphics and multiple language strings for qt, not bitcoin source code. 
I think they wanted to convey the message that it's *really* complicated, because that supports the idea that "almost nobody understands it". That tends to detract from the benefit of being open source.
But, actually, Bitcoin isn't particularly complicated, and much of the code is pretty easy to understand. For comparison, about 15% of the Windows 2000 source was leaked years ago. It was 650 MB.

The OP never said or implied that small merchants should be turning *every* sale into an investment in BTC. He didn't write it very clearly, but you're putting words into his mouth.
In fact, what he says is the opposite of that:
1. He states that BTC value is volatile at the moment.
2. He implies that accepting small amounts of BTC is OK, but says it could be risky for the merchant if many people began to pay with BTC (because of the volatility).
3. He implies that the merchant could use a payment processor to convert BTC to USD immediately, or *possibly* keep the BTC to spend directly, while hoping that the price increases.

According to Bitcoin Core, did you have any bitcoins left in your wallet after the theft? Did you send them somewhere?

You can see that the claim is ridiculous by just looking at the chart in the article that they're referring to 
The journalist, Peter Spence, found the day in 2012 with the highest transaction volume, and then he claimed that was the 'typical' level for the whole year.
Looking at the chart for 5 seconds makes it obvious that the *typical* USD transaction volume in 2012 is about 10% of the volume on the quietest days of this year.
The error is so huge that I wonder if they meant to compare it to 2013 and gave it to an intern to research, or something silly like that.

The largest banks claim asset values of more than $2.5 trillion each.
Global M3 money supply is $50+ trillion (US is $10+ trillion).
Now, assets are not the same thing as money, but it's still significant that a single large entity can have assets equivalent to 5% of the global broad money supply. (and the top 20 banks have assets equivalent to 60-80% of M3). Is this something to worry about? Or is it just a sign that people and organizations tend to keep their money in banks?

Yeah, you could be right, it's only $6. Anyway, this all shows that the OP's PC was compromised and is possibly still compromised (the only other explanation would be that the OP faked the theft). Look at the history of the change address that the thief used: [1cPGsjDTtiAjDDJL6BdGNj6h7HqPLrsZK]( - this address *must* be controlled by the OP's Bitcoin client. It's not the thief's own address. Therefore the thief had access to the machine, he didn't just get the private key and create a transaction with it.

Not directly or easily, but you can by buying games on Steam and selling them for bitcoin via  or If you try this, check what other people are selling games for, before you buy them, because you will need to beat their price to sell fast.

Of course this 'flaw' wasn't overlooked. It's implicit in the design of Bitcoin. 
It's obvious that it may be seen as a challenge to banks, etc, and obviously that might lead to resistance. This is probably the sort of challenge that Satoshi Nakamoto was thinking about when he said that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.
What will happen? I don't know, but you're definitely not the first person to think of this

I'm not sure that's correct, but anyway, testing the first versions of Bitcoin in January 2009 was particularly difficult, because Satoshi said he could not receive incoming connections.
He didn't explain why. There are possibly legitimate reasons, such as NAT/Firewall, but it could also have been part of a deliberate attempt to conceal his location, or a side effect of using TOR or something similar.

Well, it's ridiculously poor service, but **if** they get the refund to you reasonably soon, then perhaps it will work out to your advantage. 
If you'd used your cash to buy BTC 6 months ago you would have lost money. If you had got the miner then probably the ROI wouldn't have been enough to compensate for the fall in BTC price, even if they had delivered it already.

6 confirmations seems to be an arbitrary number which is enough to make attacks impractical in almost all conceivable circumstances (with the exception of an attacker who controls a huge share of the network hashrate, and isn't concerned about the repercussions of an attempted attack)
 Maybe it was first chosen because it's equal to about one hour?
In the original Satoshi white paper the last two or three pages discuss the probability of a successful double spend attack by a miner with a significant proportion of the total hashrate. 
The white paper specifically shows that an attacker with 10% of the hash rate has less than a 0.25% chance of successfully removing a transaction after six confirmations (i.e. they would have to risk detection 40 times to succeed once). The white paper also looks at the case of of an attacker with 30% of the hashrate, who would still have a chance greater than 10%, even after six confirmations.
People attempting this kind of attack would also be giving up thousands of dollars worth of mining rewards each time they failed.

To the people who downvoted was that really smart? Because although it prevents him expressing his view and expresses your own disapproval, it also means all the many comments here that argue your opposing views are not being seen, either.

$110 
Explanation: the price rockets up to near $1000 as the reward halving approaches, but it crashes dramatically shortly before halving occurs, because traders know that adoption is still slow and they all want to grab their huge profits, in case there's another bubble and crash like happened after the first halving, early in 2013.  Panic and despair follow, and the price bottoms out at $110, exactly one year from now.
(The current estimate of the halving date is in about 1 year + 3 weeks)
These prediction threads are always really funny to read in future, because 95% of us will be totally wrong.

Amazon don't have to actively "do" anything. It's simply not in Amazon's best interests to make it easier to redeem gift cards. Amazon has notoriously narrow profit margins, and they apparently made about $100 million a year from unspent gift cards, ~~the last time they released that data~~ five years ago.
edit: apparently, Amazon now has something close to $2 billion in unspent gift cards, and the amount is increasing by $300 million per year - 
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:17:27
Actually they don't expire. But Amazon's best guess is that if they don't get used within 2 years, they're probably never going to be used.
The owners don't sell them for many reasons: because they don't know how, it's difficult to sell them (Amazon doesn't prevent it, but doesn't make it easy, either). Maybe they even read some scary stories about gift card fraud, so they think that trying to sell them would be too much hassle? 
It's also common that people put Amazon ads or referrer links on their blog or site, but they don't have an Amazon store in their own country, so it can be very difficult for them to use the gift card (they're not transferable internationally). Small site operators often don't realize how inconvenient it is to use the cards until they've already earned hundreds of dollars in Amazon credit.
But probably most people just forget about them, and some lose the codes, so it goes with most gift cards. There's over $40 billion in unclaimed gift cards in the US. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 04:47:02
SHA-256 (SHA-2) algorithm wasn't invented until about 2001, so earlier bitcoin would have used different hash algorithms. They could express the same private/public-key protocols, but they might be less secure
I think the ECDSA algorithm used in Bitcoin might be developed later than 2001, too, although the concepts were around earlier.
Diffie–Hellman key exchange was developed in the 1970s so that's probably the earliest possible date for the math to be possible. But average computers weren't probably powerful enough then.
@_date: 2015-10-17 05:39:32
Amazon US had more than a half billion dollars of assets in unused gift cards back in 2011. Assume the number is higher now. Amazon doesn't make that data public any more I think. 
Purse.io can make plenty of profit by unlocking a little of that money. It makes sound business sense for them to do everything they can to avoid being used for fraud.
Amazon's accounting policy is to add unused gift cards to their bottom line after 2 years, because they'll probably never be used. So it's in their interest to make it harder to use the gift cards.
edit: apparently, Amazon now has something close to $2 billion in unspent gift cards, and the amount is increasing by $300 million per year -

@_date: 2015-10-17 04:18:48
A lot of people and companies end up with Amazon gift cards (money) that they're not able to use. Often, it's because they're not in the same country as the Amazon unit that issued the cards. Purse.io gives them a way to get some of that money. 
When the gift card balance is spent, the money then is subtracted from Amazon's bank account. 
You can understand why Amazon might  look for any reason to make that more difficult.
There are billions of dollars in gift cards that are never spent in the US. Likely many millions of those are Amazon's.
edit: Amazon's assets now include close to $2 billion in unspent gift cards, and the amount is increasing by $300 million per year - 
@_date: 2015-10-17 09:26:09
You found 2 cases, of a few hundred dollars fraud, from more than a year ago, and linked to them 4 times. And you're comparing those to the **$1.7 billion** in unspent gift cards that Amazon reported in its 2014 10-K. Is this a joke?

I'm pretty sure that journalists use it whenever they write another one of those articles that says "it's really difficult to actually spend bitcoins, so bitcoins are just for speculators and libertarians and anarchists and drug dealers"
That's because the list gives equal weight to *everyone*: little niche stores selling cupcakes or keychains or backrubs, scammers promising free stuff, and the huge vendors that give access to a huge range of products (like bitcoinstore.com, gyft.com, foodler.com, etc)
So the journalists look through that long, long list for 5 minutes, click a few, and they see some broken links and all sorts of zany borderline stuff they'd never want, and things that they could only buy in Lincoln, Nebraska. Then they write "Conclusion: Bitcoin not yet ready for prime time"...

"First of all, the main topic of our paper (which is clearly described in its title) is an analysis of DPR’s activities. However, all the recent media attention was focused on this one detail (Satoshi Nakamoto)" - Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir
Oh, what a horrible shock! The nasty media picked up the most sensational part of their paper. That must have come as a great surprise to these naive but well-meaning guys, who were just innocently doing science.
From their [paper's meta data]( 


Summary: We tried to play the "science by media" game with a hot new topic that we didn't fully understand. We didn't pay too much attention to the criticisms of our earlier work, because we are very famous scientists. Then we cooked our paper with a super-sensational suggestion. Win! Look at the hits!

It is too complicated, but the alternative may be even worse. There was an incident in 2010, when a bug enabled the creation of about 180 million Bitcoins. They did a roll back within a few hours. If the same thing happened today, the consequences would be far worse, but I think the action taken would be the same.

To journalists generally, not just you, *please* stop repeating this half-truth. It might have been relevant a year ago, but now it's misleading. 
If you are in the US, there are now large online stores where you can buy a huge variety of stuff online, pay with bitcoins, and have them delivered. So it doesn't matter where in the country you live, you can still buy a lot of everyday products and services. 
For example, look at bitcoinstore.com, bitcoinin.com, foodler.com, namecheap.com, and so on. They're not Amazon.com-sized, but there are tens of thousands of products available, so they are not just 'little random merchants' either.

I've always assumed this to be true. I'll usually complete an order as soon as I see the broadcast payment with a 'normal' transaction fee at blockchain.info. So sometimes I can almost do it before the customer even has time to tell me they paid (in fact, they don't need to tell me, because I can already see it).
I'm usually only dealing with small amounts &lt;0.2 BTC though, and very small quantities of orders. The possibility of anyone bothering to attempt a double spend seems incredibly remote.

People make price related posts frequently. It just gets really boring, because most of the comments are a mixture of guesswork, wishful thinking, trolling and outright attempts at market manipulation.
You should try to get a bit of perspective. Look at posts from from 4 months ago, when this subreddit had *less than 10,000* readers, and the bitcoin price had rocketed up to *the crazy heights of almost $20*. Even then some people were panic selling because they thought the bubble was about to burst. Just spend a few hours reading those posts, and you'll realize that nobody really knows anything.
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:58:08
Yes, this is a much more accurate description of their role. That's why that part of the article is misleading. 
It is likely to be misunderstood by most readers, who are not very familiar with the nature of open source projects.
For the average reader, the words "Bitcoin Foundation... manages the project", implies that the Foundation is a central authority in control of the Bitcoin protocol, or maybe they even think it's some kind of central bank.
The Bitcoin Foundation has a strong influence, at the current time. It does not have control.
This might seem to be a small difference, but when uninformed people try to fit this unfamiliar concept into their pre-conceived notions about hierarchical organizations, the result is really terrible garbage like the article described here:

This is basically the same bitcoins as identified in their original paper, again


I don't see this number in that paper. Not trying to be rude. I just can't find it in there. The largest number I see is 90,000 BTC, which coincidentally would have had a peak value of around US$3,000,000 during the period when they wrote that first paper.


I think that's because people believe Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron made far too many mistakes and did not even fully understand the system they were analyzing. 
The first sign of this is when they confused blockexplorer.com and blockchain.info with the blockchain itself, and actually downloaded the entire blockchain from those sites, as 180,000 html files -- instead of simply getting it from bitcoind like anyone who understood bitcoin would do.
In their most recent paper, they used the same analysis to 'identify' Satoshi Nakamoto and link him to the Silk Road, but it was immediately obvious that they had actually discovered an early bitcoin adopter from the US putting his money into MtGox. *They could have been spared that embarrassment by simply typing the address into Google, but instead they rushed ahead and published their paper.*
Their attitude to bitcoin, inability to understand parts of the system, and their haste to uncover what they perceive as 'dirt' and publish it without the most basic checks or peer review, suggests an agenda that goes beyond reasonable skepticism. Unsurprisingly, they receive a hostile reaction.

I don't see how they can know the difference. It's the same calculation
Latency maybe? (maybe they're more likely to return stale work, because they have to wait to get it back from the botnet machines)
More errors than average? They're more likely to be overheating the GPUs and returning bad results
Could there be some kind of a pattern in their ability to do the work (like some work is harder)? I doubt that
Maybe their gateway that sends the results to the pool will tend to hop between IPs in different countries frequently, which would stand out. Most normal miners will stay in the same dynamic IP range, or static IP.
edit: One more idea. I don't know if mining botnets use a gateway to return the work. I was just assuming they do. Maybe they send it directly from the infected machines. That would be a very obvious, detectable pattern, if they used one account at the pool for all their machines around the world.

There is a serious problem with allowing trolls like those to stay around here. They post their weak arguments, tedious mockery and lies so frequently that their 'opinions' probably constitute more than half of the anti-Bitcoin argument on this subreddit. This gives the impression that *all* critics of Bitcoin are rude idiots. 
Unfortunately people get tired of this constant trolling after a while, so they just start downvoting and ignoring almost any criticism. One result of this hardening of attitudes is that legitimate critics who might have something useful to add to the conversation are also getting ignored or downvoted.

The specific verb [used by Baidu Jiasule]( '暂停' means to 'temporarily suspend' or 'pause'. It's not how they would usually express a permanent end to the service.

Yes, it's time to BUY!, and there's a fascinating new alternative currency that I want to suggest all you investors here take a look at. You probably haven't heard of it before, but it's up by an incredible 10% during the last 30 minutes alone, compared to more traditional currencies like BTC.
I didn't quite catch the name, but I think it's called something like 'the Untied States Dollar'. 
The twist here is that these dollars are created by a scientific algorithm, devised by top economists. The highly complex calculation that they are using is something like: dollars +1 = more dollars. It sounds shady, but it's got great potential, I think.
So this new USD coin is way cool. It was invented by a mysterious guy known only as 'Bernanke', which probably isn't his real name, and they even made a cute little icon for it '$'. They will even print you little paper dollars, if you want. How awesome is that?

If there is ANY possibility  that Coinsafe.io or your own computers or accounts have been compromised, then the right thing to do is to stop accepting deposits at Coinsafe.io while you investigate, and to ensure the safety of any funds you have already received from users (which may mean shutting down the service and moving funds to a new, safe address).
And the fact that someone has unauthorized access to your own personal money does mean it's possible that you've suffered a compromise of this kind.

China's government often *wants* people to work around the rules. If everyone is breaking a law, it's even easier for the government to control them. 
Or maybe this activity supports the theory that the Chinese government never wanted to shut down the exchanges or kill Bitcoin in China - they just wanted to calm it down a bit, but they are not very delicate or subtle... nobody is going to vote them out of office at the next election, are they?

I don't have personal experience of this, but from cases of virtual item trading fraud, what I've seen is that the law enforcement reaction varies a lot, depending mainly on the attitude of the person you contact. Some take it as seriously as any other fraud case, because they see that thousands of dollars of value have been stolen, some think it's a complete joke because it's "not real money".  
Many probably won't give it much attention because they don't understand it and don't know how to investigate it. It could involve international investigation, which is far outside the experience of a local police department. They're overworked and they have plenty of other cases to investigate which are inside their comfort zone.

You're missing the point, I think. The claim being made is not "Bitcoin is as useful as the internet", (although some people think it is).

It needs to be emphasized that the $30,000 they lost immediately is not the value of the games, but simply the *fee* for handling the chargeback that the credit card company forces them to pay. Chargebacks are the most amazing 'victim pays' system
On top of that they have probably also lost hundreds of sales of their $25 game, because some customers who bought the stolen copies, which have now been revoked, will not replace them. Perhaps another $10,000-20,000 lost there

There are several different rebuttals already posted to this point. Here is one more to add to those.
High prices are **totally** giving Bitcoin more viability, because they're putting increasing amounts of wealth into the hands of early adopters, and some of those people are using that wealth to promote Bitcoin. 
Bitcoinstore.com is a [perfect example of that](
Or think about where the funding for the Bitcoin Foundation comes from... or BitcoinTalk.org, which must be the best-funded forum on the planet (not that they are spending much of what they have).
It's not surprising that early adopters are doing this, because many of them are people who have believed in and supported the idea for years, they're not only trying to make a profit

Theoretically, yes. In reality they must risk a huge amount of money, briefly, and if they misjudge the market, or there's some technical hitch that stops them buying back in, they can lose $100,000 very easily. The exchanges are all very glitchy, so you can't assume you'll get a deal executed instantly during a panic buy/sell

^(*repost from yesterday*)
I don't know if Dogecoin will continue to grow, or just have a burst of hype and then fade, but at the moment, it is getting a lot of new people interested in alternate currencies, and that is a *very* good thing for Bitcoin
Here's a nice example. A senior coder from Balanced, the payment processor that manages payments on Reddit's Store, says he felt very negative about cryptocurrencies before, but now he hopes his company can accept them, including Bitcoin, of course. 180 degree shift in viewpoint of an influential person, thanks to Dogecoin
This looks like a really positive thing for Bitcoin. I don't really see it as competition, it's a big expansion of the potential audience
Litecoin is really just a tentative modification of Bitcoin. On the other hand, Dogecoin started as a joke, and so it bends the basic parameters close to the breaking point. The block confirmation time is only about 1 minute, for example. I wonder if this even safe. Perhaps it makes new attacks or DDOS vulnerabilities possible. Another huge difference that will have unforeseeable effects: all the Dogecoins will be mined out in about 1.5 years, compared to 100+ years for Bitcoin
An important fact to understand about competing currencies is that most are part of the same non-fiat ecosystem. They share a lot of the same code, so development is easier and the work can be shared. If your app or site can handle one, then it can handle all of them.
 Unlike fiat currencies, trading them is so easy that inevitably, exchanges will become almost frictionless, with close to zero fees. So it is going to be very easy to convert from one altcoin to another. What this means is that if one altcoin has an advantage, all the others can share that advantage. So every altcoin gets easy access to Bitcoin's huge network of  stores, exchanges and services, for example.
^(tl;dr the only **real** problem with Dogecoin is that it isn't DolanCoin)

I have read it before, and I don't want to have to read through the whole thing again. That's why I was asking your help to find the number you were referring to.
As [says]( (and many others have noticed before, just search for the title of the table online), the table is misleading and poorly explained. 
In fact, considering that it is the central finding of Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron's entire argument, it is so misleading and so poorly explained that some people naturally wonder if this was accidental
Additionally, as their most recent paper has shown again, their whole methodology is suspect. As soon as they attempted to identify these large entities and to delineate where one entity ends and another one begins, they failed, publicly and embarrassingly. 
Have you read Adi Shamir's apology about the mistakes in that paper? His disingenuous attempt to blame the fallout on media misrepresentation? Search for it.

@_date: 2013-11-21 04:26:27


If their goal is to steal a lot of money, then there are factors which limit how much they can steal.
If they steal all of it, the currency collapses, and their bitcoins are worthless. 
If they steal a noticeable amount, then people lose confidence in Bitcoin and the price tanks, greatly reducing their gain.
In any of the above cases, miners might vote to roll back the transaction(s), fix the code, and restart, whatever the cost. Exchanges might refuse to handle the stolen coins. So they could lose some, maybe all of their loot.
So, if it's possible to put in a backdoor, the reward is still limited by these factors. They would have to hack Bitcoin in such a way that they could steal small amounts without being noticed.

I agree that some of them simply don't know they could do this, or they're so scared that they want to get their money out right now, not send it somewhere else.
Normally, in a free market, money would just flow in to take the cheap BTC off their (weak) hands, stabilizing the price. With input blocked by the government, this doesn't work.

It was *an assumption for the purposes of the current discussion* based on one, highly contentious, estimate of the blocks that Satoshi mined in 2009, and then never touched. As far as I know, nobody, ever presented any evidence to show that any person or organization controls more than that. If you read my comment carefully, you'll see that my assumption is no longer useful for this discussion anyway, because the coins were actually more than 1 year old (3 years, in fact), which greatly reduces the quantity required.

You probably already know that Valve now has it's own virtual item trading market:

(I call it a pseudo-currency because Valve does not provide any way to cash out, so far)
Valve also has a quite serious problem with people using stolen credit card data and fraudulent Paypal/CC chargebacks to launder money and perform other scams inside their virtual item trading system. Perhaps that's another reason for them to investigate Bitcoin.

That's very interesting. Then it seems almost certain that pool owners would learn to identify and cheat those botnet operators.

They will already be panicked blobs of jelly after the last 4 hours, so I wonder if press reports will have much effect?
Maybe reports would shock people who don't pay attention to their holdings, but I thought everyone who bought bitcoins recently was supposed to be a frenzied speculator, so they should be watching the price already?
Maybe scary press coverage will stop new people putting money in, I guess. But really, the previous press coverage has mostly been quite scary anyway, always talking about bubbles and crashes and bitcoin drug deals, etc.
And I guess any coverage will get attention from new people who never heard of bitcoin, FWIW.

What this means is he believes Bitcoin potentially has a long term market capitalization target of approximately $5-7 trillion (based on the industrial value of gold being about 10-20% of its trading value, and the total value of all gold to be mined being $6.5-$10 trillion at current prices). This is what he calls the 'addressable' value

In theory, if you do fewer than 100 new transactions (send or receive or create new address) from the wallet after you back it up, then you don't need the new wallet. (I'm assuming that the software is generating one new address each time you do a transaction, in a FIFO (first in first out) style, though I don't know that for sure)
In practice, please just keep them both, and a few more interim backups for good luck, because it would be silly to take a risk with your money just to save a little storage space or for convenience
edit: my greatest fear would be that the software would generate more new addresses than I expected for some reason (such as change addresses maybe), so I'd be unexpectedly using address that were not in the old wallet

If we assume that most of this 134,000,000 days destroyed figure is coming from the same source, and that nobody controls more than 1,000,000 BTC, then these coins must have been unmoved for at least 130 days, I guess? Probably much longer than that. ^(edit: more than 1 year, see below)
If we assume they're the oldest possible coins,  4.9 years old, from Jan and Feb 2009. Then moving 72,000 BTC would be about 130,000,000 days destroyed (4.9 * 365 * 72000). There's no sign of such old coins being moved though, if you look at a few early blocks. But it sets a lower bound on the number of coins maybe 
edit: I guess the actual number of days destroyed is 130,990,276 for this unusual transaction, and they were more than 1 year old. That would mean the maximum amount of coins moved is below 358,877 BTC

Ultimately, you'll pay for buyer protection when you think you need it. A variety of services are possible - it can be treated as a form of insurance, or a middleman who absorbs the risk, for a fee. Right now though, there isn't really anyone providing that service, escrow with dispute resolution is the closest.
The point is that you should have a choice, and not be forced to share the cost of buyer protection with every idiot, as you are with credit cards and paypal.

They could remain skeptical and unconvinced, but also accept the 0.5 bitcoins. These two things are not incompatible. Accepting the bitcoins should not imply that the OP has accepted the arguments of Bitcoin advocates.
The OP in that thread invited people to change his views about Bitcoin. So someone generously offered him an opportunity to change his views by practical experience. For a person who is really open to changing their view, it would be illogical to reject that opportunity, because practical experience might provide a fast shortcut to understanding.
Perhaps using those bitcoins would have provided the final proof to convince the OP that he/she was right about Bitcoin, and did not need to change his views
Of course, if you are happy to debate pure theory endlessly, and you're not in a hurry to apply it to the real world, then it could be best to avoid the danger of practical experience... :/

There are more new bitcoins being generated from mining than average, about 400-500 BTC extra ($50,000) per day, because blocks are being mined faster than average. Obviously, there may be other reasons as well.
The amount of extra bitcoins seems small compared to the market cap, but in fact a buy or sell of even $50,000 on mtgox can move the price noticeably. So, the effect depends on how many of those new bitcoins get sold for dollars, and on the size of the pool of tradable bitcoins in the market. 
I assume this is happening because the hash rate has increased unusually fast, with many new ASICs coming online in the last few weeks. The Difficulty only changes once every 2 weeks (approximately), so in this case the rate of creation of new bitcoins can briefly increase, until difficulty is adjusted again.
The average time per block over the past 2 years is 577 seconds (9.6 minutes, 149 blocks per day)
The average time per block over the past 2 months is 521 seconds (8.6 minutes, 165 blocks per day)
The average time per block over the past 5 days is 459 seconds  (7.65 minutes, 188 blocks per day)
 (about 1.9 years) 577 seconds average per block
  (about 60 days) 521 seconds
  (about 5 days) 459

Criticism is good, but parts of that read like theonion.com
What is Bitcoin? (according to Seeking Alpha)
"It is like a virtual ounce of gold, only made out of highly elastic electrons, not highly inelastic gold"
"It is over a $1 billion monetary system, all done by a "collective network."
"It is backed by the full faith and credit of a shadowy group of collective computers and consists of electrons."
More Bitcoin facts (according to Seeking Alpha)
"There are 25 bitcoins generated every 10 minutes, or about $35,000 currently. In the articles I read, no one bothered to ask who gets that money. "
"Current data has a bitcoin trading at $149.93 in Columbus Ohio, and $139.96 76 miles away in Mason Ohio."
"Under the bitcoin system, there is a huge incentive to cheat and print money, and when those bitcoins are printed, we have no idea where the money goes. It could be some guy paying for his mansion in the Canary Islands, or Kim Jung Um funding a new missile program for all we know."
"Two years ago, the incentive was under $1 to create a bitcoin, now it is over $140. That is an incentive to print money out of thin air if I've ever seen one"
"Under our current monetary system, there is zero personal incentive for Ben Bernanke to print money, zip."
"My $1 bill bought the same McDonald's (MCD) sausage biscuit 4 years ago as it does today. In late 2010 it would have taken 20 bitcoins to buy that sausage biscuit, today a bitcoin will buy 140 biscuits. Does that even remotely make sense?"
"In my opinion, the bitcoin is all about making money for some unknown individuals. They don't even try to hide it. Printing money out of thin air and lining their pocket is called an "incentive."
"A hacker can "print" as many bitcoins as there are electrons in a blink of an eye."
"As the hackers recently proved, all it takes is a push of a button and the bitcoins evaporate."
"The miner analogy is way off. Miners in 1849 had to work long hard hours to discover an ounce of gold and have it minted into coins."
"There is no shortage of electrons and pushing a button on a keyboard doesn't count as hard work."

I don't day trade, so I'm not very knowledgable about this, but they're not connected in the way you're suggesting, AFAIK. There's no API linking them. If there is, then maybe you can accuse those exchanges of manipulating the market?
Yes, the price sync is from the free market, and the difference in price should all be explicable according to the other differences in liquidity between the exchanges.
For example: it is harder to get USD out of MTgox than Bitstamp. Some exchanges have difficult verification or other restrictions. Some exchanges have low volume. There is no trading commision on several of the Chinese exchanges. All these things affect the local price on those exchanges.
And according to some posts here, during the last few days it is also harder to get BTC out of MTgox, which might explain why the MTgox price is moving further away from the other exchanges(?)

It seems very unlikely there could be a unanimous decision on that.
So it would require that Bitcoin split into two or more separate currencies with different rules.
It would cause chaos and a very serious crash in value for all of the child coins, since the 21,000,000 coin limit is one of the foundations of Bitcoin, and one of the promises that attracts people to Bitcoin.
So it is against the self interest of the majority of miners to increase the coin cap. 
The author, Brian Wesbury, isn't really arguing the same point as you anyway. He clearly doesn't understand that extra Bitcoins cannot be 'hacked' as he implies. "Hackers keep getting better" is an idiotic, unsupported assertion which is worthless in supporting his argument. He also doesn't seem to understand that there is no single "issuer" to increase the cap, as he implies
edit: Really, the whole article is lazy and badly researched. 
Brian Wesbury blames the recent fall in BTC/USD on "Baidu.com,the Chinese web services company, said it would not accept the scrip". If he did more than 1 minute of real research, he would know that the price fell mainly because the Chinese government made a statement that was seen as quite negative for Bitcoin. Baidu (actually one small unit of Baidu) then reacted to that
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:55:38
AFAIK, it depends on how rapidly they release them (not how soon). 
If a lot of new ASIC miners all start running at the same time, that could temporarily reduce the price, until the difficulty automatically adjusts upwards, after a week or so. 
But based on Butterfly Lab's history with ASICs so far, it looks really unlikely they're suddenly going to release a large number of working units simultaneously. Maybe somebody else could
Don't forget that as the difficulty increases, some miners with older hardware will simply give up, because it's not profitable to continue.

I'm not sure if this is a bubble, but my impression is that the Bitcoin economy is *far* more mature than it was in 2011, the time of the previous 'worst' bubble. 
What I mean is: Bitcoin is becoming more and more like a 'real', practical currency that you can use to buy a reasonably wide range of goods and services, without having to constantly think about converting to $, at a loss, to get what you need. It still has a *very* long way to go, but it's no longer just a speculative investment (though the speculative potential future value is still an important part of its attraction, unlike most traditional currencies)

Yes, but no, because at the time of the previous high, people were confident they could get their dollars out of Mtgox within a week. Now, they're not
tl;dr Mtgox(April2013) =/= Mtgox(November2013)
Personally, I always refer to Bitstamp's price. I wouldn't use the Mtgox value, because it exaggerates the price a bit. But to be practical, this is not *such* a big issue, because the difference between Mtgox and Bitstamp is insignificant compared to the daily volatility of the rate (the gap is always between $5 and $15, which is about 5% or less now)
and Mtgox is a much smaller percentage of daily volume now. &lt;30% compared to &gt;70% in April

That original article they're referring to seems have been ridiculous
The cost of simply *printing* just the paper currency in the US alone is $750 million per year. That's not the cost of handling it, or storing it or moving it, just the initial cost of printing it.
Money isn't free, obviously.

I really can't believe people with real 'power and wealth' waste their time trolling on Reddit. What could be more pathetic?
Malicious trolling is a textbook behavior of a person who feels powerless in their everyday life, and derives some satisfaction from the sense of empowerment they get by manipulating the reality of others.

Very interesting, but expect you will soon see some 'journalism' that picks out the most frightening speculation from the first chart (10,000 BTC?) for an attention getting headline, and ignores everything else, particularly the conclusion that botnet mining is dying fast, because the returns will not be worth the trouble soon.

I wonder what's happening with the new payment processor, they're talking to, Double Dry, then? 
Based on that statement there's no sign they're optimistic it will happen. It's strange, why mention it in that vague way if they don't even think it will work out?
Double Dry is a literal translation of 95epay's Chinese name -

Indeed, our financial future is in safe hands. If there's ever any little mishap  with 'DollarCoins'...  like if they became virtually worthless due to gross financial mismanagement, for example, then the central authorities can just print more to solve the problem. You can't do that with boring old bitcoins.
Thanks for the tip, though I would have preferred some of the new 'DollarCoins' of course. It's the currency of the future!

Well, the lag is the oldest order that is waiting for execution. 
Mt gox must be accepting some new buy/sell orders, because the lag is still at around 9 minutes, and hasn't gone down. Therefore, new orders are still entering the queue at mtgox.

The payment processor that the store uses, BalancedPayments.com, is considering supporting cryptocurrencies. 
Their main concern seems to be the possible regulatory and compliance issues.
They invite discussion and suggestions here: 
@_date: 2013-09-01 06:15:15




No. Even to suggest this here is a tactical error, because it is (arguably) against the rules of Reddit. It gives unfriendly subreddit mods an easy excuse to remove the post.

Most forums don't offer a scammer the opportunity to steal $10,000 by impersonating another trusted user (e.g. with access to a trusted user's account, the scammer could ask for a loan, intercept a trade in progress, get donations, etc.)

I don't think it works like that, at least not in Bitaddress.org. BIP38 is way of encrypting private keys, so that other people can't use them without the passphrase. Knowing the passphrase is useless if you don't also have the encrypted private key.
I think the BIP38 paper wallet feature at Bitaddress.org just generates random private keys and encrypts them with BIP38. It doesn't seem to be deterministic. The BIP38 passphrase is not being used as a seed to generate the private keys.
The system you've described certainly exists (deterministic wallets), but it's not BIP38, I think.

**Yes, that is the point.**
The OP was referring to idiots who compare graphs that have completely different time scales, and who believe that proves something or lets them predict the future
Here's the top post from today, comparing Bitcoin to the dotcom crash (2 weeks compared to 2 years)
Message: Bitcoin is finished, you are all doomed!!
And, here's one from a week ago, comparing Bitcoin to the gold price (3 years compared to 30 years)
Message: Bitcoin is gonna be worth $1 trillion, we're all rich!! muhaha!
Both of these comparisons are equally stupid. (Though the fact that today's idiocy comes from a guy who describes himself as an experienced trader is especially shocking)

I agree with you (But that's probably because I got in early and see it as a fascinating long term investment). 
Some people who spent thousands of dollars at 200+ and finally despaired and sold at 50+, only 2 days later... they probably aren't seeing the funny side. Some of them are probably feeling lower than you can possibly imagine right now, and you shouldn't forget that...

[This report]( quotes an unamed source at Suning saying that they will proceed with their cooperation with BTCChina, in spite of the government announcement. If their negotiations with BTCChina are succesful, then they plan to accept Bitcoin on an ecommerce website. 
Not very clear what they will do with that. Their plan seems to be to divide the business with BTCChina so that Suning is not exposed to risk
The source told the journalist that the government statement was good, because it shows that the government is paying attention to Bitcoin.
Suning is the biggest consumer electronics retail store chain in China, and they also have a big online store.

You'll probably get a better discussion posting this on @_date: 2013-06-19 02:23:11


This is a problem, although it's not really a problem with the payment method, it's more of a problem with the codes (there's no conclusive way to verify validity without using them, even for the seller). It would also be a problem if you used Paypal, which is not helpful in disputes involving virtual items.
Anyway, completely separate from the ability to use a raw alphanumeric code to activate a game, Steam also has a *much* safer game and virtual item trading system. This is not prone to the same risks as raw codes, because an unactivated, but valid, game is represented by a virtual object inside the trading system. This can be traded repeatedly without being activated/installed, and when it's activated, the object is removed from the system, so can't be traded any more. I've used this to sell hundreds of games and virtual items for bitcoins (at discounted prices) during the past year, with zero problems.

There's one much older transaction related to that address (1LrPY...), about 9 months ago

I don't know if Dogecoin will continue to grow, or just have a burst of hype and then fade, but at the moment, it is getting a lot of new people interested in alternate currencies, and that is a *very* good thing for Bitcoin
Here's a nice example. A senior coder from Balanced, the payment processor that manages payments on Reddit's Store, says he felt very negative about cryptocurrencies before, but now he hopes his company can accept them, including Bitcoin, of course. 180 degree shift in viewpoint of an influential person, thanks to Dogecoin
It's too bad that your post was downvoted, because this looks like a really positive thing for Bitcoin. I don't really see it as competition, it's a big expansion of the potential audience
Litecoin is really just a tentative modification of Bitcoin. On the other hand, Dogecoin started as a joke, and so it bends the basic parameters close to the breaking point. The block confirmation time is only about 1 minute, for example. I wonder if this even safe. Perhaps it makes new attacks or DDOS vulnerabilities possible. Another huge difference that will have unforeseeable effects: all the Dogecoins will be mined out in about 1.5 years, compared to 100+ years for Bitcoin
An important fact to understand about competing currencies is that most are part of the same non-fiat ecosystem. They share a lot of the same code, so development is easier and the work can be shared. If your app or site can handle one, then it can handle all of them.
 Unlike fiat currencies, trading them is so easy that inevitably, exchanges will become almost frictionless, with close to zero fees. So it is going to be very easy to convert from one altcoin to another. What this means is that if one altcoin has an advantage, all the others can share that advantage. So every altcoin gets easy access to Bitcoin's huge network of  stores, exchanges and services, for example.

The fact that the lag has rapidly fallen from more than one hour to only 9 minutes is rather suspicious

There still seem to be no news reports related to this on sites like

They just have the standard bitcoin stories you could see anywhere, no new story that mentions bitcoin and government regulation. Sina has about 3 bitcoin stories on it's front page, so they still think it's an interesting subject to report.

Really sorry to hear about your disappointment OP, hope you have better luck in future. Please don't give up on Bitcoin yet.
These ideas might help: 
* Have you tried choosing a passphrase from Harry Potter? (I recommend *The Order of the Phoenix*, because it's the longest in the series, so you'll get better security)
* Or disabling two factor authentication because "it was a kinda hassle"? 
* You could also look into storing all your Bitcoins in an online wallet run by someone anonymous. 
* If you're day trading, don't forget to buy when the price is spiking up to a new high, and panic sell when it's crashing down and you feel really nervous and depressed.

In my opinion, the price of Bitcoin, at the moment, is roughly 90% speculative. So the remainder is not usually a factor worth considering. (And I don't care that people are actually spending *more* than  10% on the electricity, BTW, I think it is not relevant).
I'm certainly not saying that the speculative valuation is wrong. In fact, I personally believe it is justified and, in fact, bitcoin is underpriced. I'm only saying that the valuation is mostly based on a prediction of things that haven't happened yet.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:01:19
The idea is interesting, though if it takes off, you have to be very alert to the danger of mission creep, ending up with Bitcoin police imposing address blacklists or that sort of thing
There's also a practical problem, that without law enforcement powers, you sometimes can't get very far. I have quite a lot of experience tracking down scammers, and that PS4 case you linked to looks like a tough one. 
The public information is very limited, probably all fake, and even if you can get private information behind privacy walls (like IP records from the hosting company or Reddit), you could just find you're looking at a dynamic IP from Russia or China or somewhere, and the ISP is not going to help you. It looks like the most information you're going to get from that one is a behavioral fingerprint, so you can spot the same guy when he repeats the same scam.
That scam was totally obvious for anyone with any experience or a little common sense. Sometimes, it's better to use the effort to educate users, or try to shutdown scams before they can happen.

Yes, of course memes have words. They *need* to have words because the pictures usually convey no information. 
The mods used a meme because they needed to communicate with people who like memes and might not read anything else. 
The mods *had to* find a way to communicate with those people, just this once, because they want to tell them: stop using memes.

This could be misleading you. 
Miners prioritize transactions based on several different factors. As far as I know, these are: size in bytes (smaller is better), age of inputs (older is better), amount of money (larger is better). And, I assume most miners will also give a higher priority if you paid a bigger fee than others
You have probably created a transaction that miners don't like very much, so they are giving it a lower priority. It will get processed eventually, anyway.
On the other end of the scale, if you leave coins in your wallet for a while, you can normally send zero fee transactions.
