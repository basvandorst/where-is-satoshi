Look, if you don't understand modern money mechanics, inflation, market manipulation and sound money, you won't understand why bitcoin makes sense.. If you don't understand imuteability and accountability, you won't understand why blockchain makes sense.

It's the same thing that happend in 08', only with personal loans in the form of 0% credit cards with high limits.. So, take advantage of it kids.. Take their imaginary, toilet paper fiat, put it into crypto, and file BK on it.. Let's help speed up the process. They can't garnish your crypto..

It's dominant because it's the only truly decentralized coin, and it's completely upgradable.

 I've had the thought that, if the crypto community collaborated during the holidays to make their purchases exclusively in crypto, it would be huge for BTC, no? Just put your fiat into BTC, or any other coin your vendor supports and spend it on what you were going to buy anyway.. No Volitility. Puts stress on fiat, supports crypto and will accellorate adoption.
 If vendors knew that the Crypto Community would be making strong purchases at certain times of year, ONLY IN CRYPTO, new vendors would pop up every where, and old vendors would adopt crypto payments.. This would not only be good for crypto, but would be great for redistributing the wealth to more start up businesses and Mom n' Pop shops..
Annual Spending Estimates:
Halloween - 8 billion 
Easter - 16 billion
Valentines day - 19 billion
Mothers/Fathers day - 30 billion
Christmas - 630 billion

 It's not about the people buying it, its about the technology and the people building the infrastructure. The fact that people don't know wtf bitcoin really is, is why people aren't buying it. The past performance is simply a model of how sheep flock when a carrot is dangled. And yes, it will happen again, and again.

How do you propose that they'll be able to do that? I'm intrigued..

Elaborate.
