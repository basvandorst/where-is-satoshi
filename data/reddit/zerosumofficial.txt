Good highlight here for a tldr;
The BRR is calculated based on the Relevant Transactions of all Constituent Exchanges.
  
Calculation steps for the BRR on any given Calculation Day are as follows:  
  
1. All Relevant Transactions are added to a joint list, recording the trade price and size
for each transaction.  
  
2. The list is partitioned into 12 equally-sized time intervals of 5 minutes each.  
  
3. For each partition separately, the volume-weighted median trade price is calculated
from the trade prices and sizes of all Relevant Transactions, i.e. across all Constituent
Exchanges. A volume-weighted median differs from a standard median in that a
weighting factor, in this case trade size, is factored into the calculation.  
  
4. The BRR is then given by the equally-weighted average of the volume-weighted
medians of all partitions.

Hind sight is always 20/20. I was around and active back then and the come off from the first time it went over $1k all the way back down to $200 was rough and a lot of people were aching to sell back at $300.
Perspective now :)

There isn't any mechanism in place for shorts of that magnitude - you would have to give near limitless credit lines out and I'm pretty sure exchanges won't do that to someone trying to shut them down.

Yes, agreed. End result is the same, hedging new money in the system is going to create buying pressure.

They don't have to create bitcoin, but they need to buy it as a hedge.

It's not...

Yes and no, there are arb opportunities if the price spread becomes too large between the futures and spot bitcoin. 95% of gold and silver futures are cash settled but spot gold price has an EFP (exchange for physical) that is of +-1 of the futures.

Always loved the SWAG index (Silver Wine Art Gold), need to find a new age crypto one now.

This is a much bigger deal than I think a lot of people realize. CME futures contracts will allow a ton of arbitrage opportunities now that there is a reliable way to short. Total traded notional will be massive.
Also with indexing and bench marking - all futures contracts have a 'close' which means pricing might get more volatile depending when they choose their benchmark.

If you believe in the potential growth of Bitcoin then it is definitely not too late. 
$6k is just a number it could be $25k in a few years and you would love to have been in at $6k. 
If you are looking to speculate and make a quick flip, I don't think you will see 200% daily gains anytime soon but long term prospects look great. Lots of excitement and on a relative scale it's still a new technology.

Each exchange has different rules on how you can get your money in and out (fiat money, ie USD, CAD, EUR etc). The difficulty on getting fiat in to purchase BTC can lead to price discrepancies. 
Now if the discrepancies ever become too large there are plenty of algos that will step in to do triangular arbitrage between the exchanges.

Oh to be sure. But for a big part of the population who isn't as tech literate this gives them exposure they wouldn't have otherwise.

True, but you can also have futures on currencies which are purely cash settled. A good example is JY (Yen) on CME one of the most heavily traded futures contracts out there.

This mentality will lead you to never investing. If you saw $1,000 for the first time ever would you be scared? The main question I would ask yourself is, how long do I plan on holding? 1 month? 1 year? 5 years? If you buy now and next month BTC is trading at $5500 but you want to hold for 5 years, that's not really a concern.
Just be realistic when you set your goals.

If you are trading future I'm positive you won't have a wallet, 95% of futures contracts are cash settled with no delivery. I'm not taking 2,000 lbs of cattle on my doorstep.
