There's no public record of him talking about it before he died.  I bet he'd be a huge supporter 
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:53:27
exactly 
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:33:43
No they said “eminem mentions” bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:48:11

@_date: 2018-08-31 15:52:37
little before that moment sorry 
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:49:20
Safu haha 
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:51:46

@_date: 2014-06-13 00:03:57
Nice!  Thats good!
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:02:34
Hodling is good, I just like making fun of people who use lambos as a positive reference never understood that.  
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:49:40
No one got coins 
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:32:32
Well the company will stay he’ll just be kicked out eventually. It’s a joke that the moon is desolate and lambo waste gas - it’s an ideology thing for me.  Mars has a layer of oxygen and tesla is good for the environment. I wasn’t thinking musk when I made this.

It was so much better in the early days, people wanted to teach others how to buy BTC and how to keep it safe.  This was in 2012 - All the noobs came in and just cared about getting rich.  I miss the old days.,

@_date: 2018-08-15 16:56:05
Lets hope so 
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:38:16
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:36:38
Because others are telling me to hold on to them
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:52:42
i'm holding, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:42:00
Ok man haha don't yell at me.  I'm not piss poor over here, what about the other side of the coin... what if it goes back to 600 by tonight... u don't have any idea where it will go... so I can afford to lose some money here in order to hold and gain later.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:47:23
yeah my investment was used from money I can spend... long term is where I sit and I just got to get us to the growing pains.  Heck maybe i will buy more even if it drops lower... Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:53:24
It's long term for me and i thank ur for ur time.  I'm just going to hold.  Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:57:02
nope I invested 5,000 and just throwing my hands up and walking away 
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:56:22
i got to buy one
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:36:00
ok good :)
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:31:40
I just bought them a week ago... i kind of was hoping to hold on to them.  mmm in a predicament now haha
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:25:36
Those are great! I took the simple approach since I was at the gaming convention just to see how people react to the words “bitcoin and “crypto - 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:23:39
I don't get this reply? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:16
100k house for me, and out at 5 mill. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:35
Oh got it!  Well, first off welcome, and second back 4 years ago people had many, I mean a lot.  Yes, technically you're right though 3 is a lot now.  Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:46:51
haha I know!  Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:11:52
Thanks man!  Same to you and everyone here.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:52
I don't have a lot of money.  I just said I'll put this in, and hope for the best.  I think 3 is fine for me, if it buys me a house one day then that's a win. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:49
This post wasn't so much about how many I bought, but that I told a lot of people to think about investing, I did my research I bought what I could afford.  Maybe I'll be a millionaire with just the 3 I have, but I remember people thinking I was crazy, that's really why I posted this.  
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:01:21
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:41:38
I had no idea the ceiling just heard the myth of it reaching 100,000 one day.
