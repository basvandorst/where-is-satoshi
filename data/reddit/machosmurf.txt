That wasn't a positive remark...

That's not true, just don't expect to make a widely adopted, safe, client. Even if you don't finish it, there is a great deal you can learn from it. 
Though, I do agree that if you haven't done any work in this field that making a full blown client is probably a bit ambitious. Poking around in the reference client or starting a smaller project to learn about the protocol is probably better.

Well, then those are some shitty devs. For each project, a dev should do some research as to what programming language/toolset is best. Just dismissing one because you don't like it is just plain stupid.

How do I enable pruning and how much of a difference does it make? I'd gladly run a node, I've got the bandwidth and system to run it on but I'm running low on disk space.

You could always send some to me. I sure as hell know what to spend it on ;)

Simple, just spam the network five times as much.

Close, sarcasm.

Why is it only beneficial to have a node with a wallet that receives transactions? What's the difference?

Thanks. Looks like i've got something to do this afternoon

That makes sense. Thanks!

Why is a logarithmic scale more relevant than a linear scale?
