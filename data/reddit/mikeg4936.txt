Ftfy. Lightning Network is awesome.

Bitcoin ain't most countries and doesn't give a damn about laws.

Just donated some BTC. THANK YOU ANDREAS

Vague post is vague. What exactly do you mean by that? Manipulated?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:21:07
You pay them. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:31:45
Hahaha okay you got me. Clever.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:44:14
Ummm... that's not how it works... at all.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:16:45
Nice. I just picked up a refurbished Xbox One with kinect for $395. That's over $100 off the price if I were to buy it at a retail store!

India is hard forking the shit out of their fiat tonight....
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:09:54
Nice. Hope you made some profit. See you at $100k
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:46:56
That's what everyone said about the move up to and past $6k.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:50:41
I agree with what you're saying. I was imprecise in my previous statement. That being said - as you just reaffirmed, the previous devs will not have a role in Bitcoin development going forward, unless they start pushing commits to BTC1 or make the original Bitcoin repo 2MB compatible (neither of which will happen).

Just got my Pi node built last week. Used a 360GB WD PiDrive HDD. It's been syncing for a full week now and I'm no where near completion. Just know that it will take upwards of one month to get it fully synchronized.... The pi has a very weak CPU. 
Here's the guide I used: 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:41:46
So.... 100 of the world best cryptographers are replaceable with 1 man (Jeff Garzik)? Really???
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:43:02
Who is paying them? Are you really comfortable with the core Bitcoin protocol being owned by a company? This goes against the entire ethos of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:49:28
That's not how it works... This is open source software, remember?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:36:18
Maybe I am misinformed. Who controls the Git repo for BTC1? Who maintains the Segwit2X branch? Not the current devs, that's for sure....
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:02:32
What you don't understand is that some (actually, the majority) of us LIKE the work that the current devs have done and appreciate their technically sound and extremely conservative approach to development. The project attracted them for specific reasons, and they have proven their worth with years of quality code commits.
It is simply foolish and rash to put the devs in a position where they can no longer make changes to the core protocol. What's to say that quality devs will even WANT to "take up the task" of building upon Segwit2X and the organization that backs it?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:17:52
We did it, boys! Cheers to my fellow HODLers and GENTLEMEN. TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:48:21
I used to share the same opinion. Now I realize that we will lose ALL of the Bitcoin core devs if 2X becomes the primary chain. Not something any of us want....
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:45:33
They wouldn't be quitting... the fork automatically cedes control of the Bitcoin codebase and Git repo to Jeff Garzik. 
edit - providing, of course, that miner hashpower significantly favors the 2MB blocksize change.

Someone please update the Ubuntu PPA for raspberry pi... Only reason I haven't upgraded!
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:31:34
Incredible. Don't know how I missed this... setting up my lntipbot right now!!!

Presynch the blockchain on a desktop computer, then transfer it to the pie using SCP.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:09:44
Ummm.... what's going on here?
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:32:36
Thanks for the summary. I'd send you some SATs via LN if I could.... ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:01:36
No, they havent.
@_date: 2018-07-08 08:16:03
AMAZING instructions. Node is up and running!

Its an IOU that is held in 100&amp; reserve by the BTC blockchain \- literally as good as BTC itself.


There is no way to decrease the reserve amount, and if something "goes wrong," the bad actor is punished and the good actor gets real BTC refunded through transactions on the BTC blockchain. This is certainly "using" BTC, so I'm not sure what you mean...
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:03:50
Its a sidechain/L2 solution. The MS of today is not the MS of yesterday. See all of the work they're doing around Linux/Azure for serious proof.  
MS is extremely open-source friendly these days.

Lol - redditor's wife meme on top.

The government is every bit as bad as you make them out to be.
That being said, the other advice here is sound.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:32:49
No one ever owns a free market. They use laws like this to control markets.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:34:38
It is... Just a typo for hold.

Lol - someone who works at Coinbase is going to talk about cold storage? Hmmm... don't think so. ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:58:55
agreed... the drudge attack article today was horrible
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:56:42
Put a Bitcoin the the alien's antenna!!! Someone do it!! ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:59:59
We'll see...
I'll bet you a bitcoin that it won't dip below 80 within the next 24 hours. :-) Congrats on your profit, though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:02:44
Wow - you've weathered it this long and you still sold? I've been in since $31 and I'm in until it reaches $5000 or $0. Should be a wild ride either way!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:15
OMG, this is getting too stressful - even for me. I don't know if I can take it anymore. Did you end up getting back in?
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:34:14
I've seen a couple of youtube vids about people GPU mining with Hyper-V on 08 R2, but I would assume that this would be a very expensive and slow way to mine at this point...
ASIC is where its at right now...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:38
Well, bought 10 @ $209. I'm holding for now!
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:52:46
Awwww yeah! $140 today... Told ya yesterday was just a normal correction!
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:25:44
You, me, and everyone else, bro.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:49:25
Please don't do this. Please. This is a really bad idea. It was never your money to begin with. This is extremely disingenuous and foolish.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:49:11
Nice, can't wait to buy what you sold. You must be new. ;-)

I'll take the bicycle!
