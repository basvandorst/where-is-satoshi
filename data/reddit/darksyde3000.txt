Of course the "big guys" are now getting involved. It's validation that crypto is being taken seriously by Wall street. You can now trade bitcoin futures on the CME or purchase bitcoin IRA's for your portfolio. I thought validation is what the community itself was looking for in the long run. However bitcoin miners for the most part typically decide the direction of bitcoin and it's less become a place for the community. How much would it cost for your average Joe to setup and build an ASICs mining platform for bitcoin these days that actually creates a substantial revenue? Yeah, pretty hefty sum. Bitcoin was the greatest experiment the world has seen thus far for global currency, but it's become more of a dinosaur these days with high fees and slow transaction times. Is it still a store of value? Sure it is, if you can weather the maelstrom it creates to get to those new highs. I find the crypto community has more of a voice when it comes to alts and the various directions those take versus bitcoin at this point. That being said, bitcoin is still the current king of crypto and I'm sure will hold that title for many years going forward. Buy the dips, sell the tops. There will ALWAYS be another trade to be had. I'm never leaving crypto until it literally disappears.

Agreed. That's why I wrote a book about it for someone whose never bought a single dime of the stuff. I think it's not only an important asset class to understand but also one that is going to change the world (more so than it already has). We'll see what happens.

It absolutely is a valid rebuttal because it's the exact same situation. How you're not seeing that is incredible. The internet itself was considered by the media then, to be something that was used by hobbyists and computer nerds much like a HAM radio with no real use cases. Nobody at that time (and I lived through it, not sure about you) thought it was going to change how business functions globally. Nobody. Now we can have things delivered to our house, monitor our home security systems, trade stocks/options, or have online conversations with the phones we have in our pockets etc. The iPhone changed how we did everything and the internet connected us to people globally. Crypto currency, upon receiving wider adoption globally, will change what everyone thinks about money and how we interact with the marketplace online and off as well as how we're able to send it. You're essentially making my point for me. Yahoo still exists obviously, but due to poor financial decisions and buyout opportunities, they barely exist. AOL however was the catalyst used to get millions of people online and used for navigating the web even though it was a walled garden back then using those services. That concept was built upon by other entities that saw the use case for it and the landscape changed to what is now second nature platforms like Google and Apple with hardware and software for each. I would imagine those that saw the writing on the wall with companies like Amazon and Google are doing quite well financially these days. Those that argued semantics like you're doing probably didn't. Either way, over time crypto will be an asset class everyone whose investing will have a stake in. The large brokerage houses are already getting on board and preparing to offer their retail investors a piece of that pie. Blockchain is a global phenomenon that other large corporations already see the value in and are investing assets accordingly with, mostly for tracking products from inception, to transit, to marketplace. Whether or not you choose to even acknowledge any of those things is up to you, but that doesn't mean they're not already happening or that your opinion is going to change that.

Well, if you're buying/selling bitcoin right now you're an early adopter. Not as early as those doing the same during it's inception, but still early. Only 3% of the internet having population even touch the stuff. Although the financial firms are starting to pay attention and offering these assets to their retail investor clients so the time table of getting to wider spread adoption is getting shorter.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:26:22
Is ForEx not an asset class people trade on a global scale? Just because something's a currency doesn't mean it's not an asset class for investing. People do it every day. Just because you don't see the purpose in it doesn't mean that market doesn't exist. I own bitcoin and I own gold and silver. Not fractional reserve investing, actual gold and silver. What's your point? One actual bitcoin has held over twice the value of a troy ounce of gold over the past few years and now can be traded on the CBOE as futures contracts. I really don't think you comprehend what's going on in the marketplace with your rebuttals to me. There's a serious disconnect for you somewhere. Moving on.
"The horse and buggy isn't going anywhere. Motor cars are a fad."
There's always people like you throughout history, and you're always made out to be the narrow sighted people you are who can't see past your own opinions. I compared the end result of crypto to successful technologies after a myriad of arcane issues are ironed out and more accessible to someone who just wants to download an app and move money around the blockchain or buy goods without worrying about copying addresses correctly every time. It seems like the simplest of concepts are lost on you regardless of how they're explained to you. I also never gave anything a timeline. Yes it's been 10 years since the inception of bitcoin but things are moving a hell of a lot faster now than they were then. Access to these currencies are becoming more available to a wider audience, even if it's just a brokerage firm letting someone buy and hold bitcoin, ethereum, etc in their portfolio to sell later. It's still money entering the market.
As far as investing assets to track products you're missing the point. It goes far deeper than your little QR codes on your own products. It's finding significant adoption in the food industry for various reasons. The center for disease control use it to track outbreaks in the food supply as well as other things. Here, read more yourself:
Honestly don't know why you're arguing these points. You've missed the boat somewhere but it seems pretty obvious you're not a supporter of bitcoin or crypto in general which begs the question, why are you even here? That's rhetorical, I honestly have no interest in why you're here. If you don't like where crypto is headed and don't believe it's viable in any way then don't invest your own capital into it. Simple as that. I'm not going to sit here trying to convince you to do otherwise. I'm not going to try and convince you of anything actually. All the information is out there and readily available for you to read and divulge at any time. It's obvious you're not a fan so why do you even give a shit what other people do with their money? Live your life, believe what you want. At the end of the day, nobody cares either way. These are just words on a screen.

@_date: 2019-07-06 09:26:10
Valid concerns but many of those issues will cease to exist as mass adoption occurs some years in the future. Software platforms will sit on top of the deposit/withdrawal process so the fat fingering of incorrect addresses won't even be a thing. Once upon a time the internet was limited to an AOL/Yahoo portal and wasn't even indexed. People on TV called it a fad and a passing fancy, but all that changed. Many of the pertinent issues we experience within the realm of crypto will cease to exist in the future. We're early adopters, we're the ones who have to deal with it. Those in the future will only hear stories about it.

The people dealing with those challenges and finding new ways to implement better solutions that just work seamlessly later on, pave the way for what the future user experience will be for those not nearly as inclined to use the more arcane methods we're dealing with currently.

You might want to spend some time watching The China Hustle for a better understanding of what you're trying to talk about here. If you think there's no trade deficit with China or that it hasn't been taking advantage of it's trade partners (not just the US) you may need to seriously brush up on what it is you think you understand.

Yes and no. There's already bitcoin retirement vehicles out there that can be invested in with fiat. That would probably end up being how this vehicle works if they decide to tweek it to make it happen. Someone's got to manage it and that person(s) aren't going to just walk away from millions in managment fees. Just a hunch. Either that or the SEC seriously doesn't understand themselves how this would work.

How many times has the obituary of bitcoin been printed the last few years? I'm sure more are being published now. I don't even look at the prices anymore. It doesn't matter when you're just hodling. In 3 to 4 years I'll care, but right now? This has already happened in the past numerous times. The same sentiments from investors was all over the internet. This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last. Stock up if ya got the means, not just in bitcoin but anything else worth grabbing up at deep discounts.

I should've started that with "THEIR interpretation of a free market." I agree with ya chief. Not to mention their idea of business is a joke. That's why they cook their books and 10x the value of their shit companies so the stock goes up in our markets. The documentary "The China Hustle" just reaffirmed what I already believed was happening, it just ended up being even worse than I thought. They can steal foreign investor money and suffer zero consequences and as long as the government is able to get money from those companies the deception continues. Hell, I just published a book in January about crypto and one of the chapters is basically me shitting all over China and how they do business and manipulate markets lol.

They have apps running there that depending on people's societal infractions, can dictate where you can live, the type of transportation you can use, and whether or not you're even allowed to leave the country on vacation. I mean the government already has direct access to everyone's money and can take it at their whim. It's a great example of what not to do in just about everything.

Electricity is certainly an issue, but less to do with bitcoin. If there's no electricity, your local ATM's won't be working and your bank will probably close it's doors. I've seen them keep paper transaction records in deposits/withdrawals when their software wasn't working but during power outages I haven't typically seen them open. Not to mention your local neighborhood bank doesn't typically keep that much cash on hand to begin with. Go in there one day and ask to withdraw $10k cash and see if the bank teller doesn't look like a deer in headlights lol.
On a sidenote, I hope Scrooge gets his money back ;)

When you're not planning to sell for another 5-7  years, the price is relatively unimportant. You obviously want value to increase but worrying about large fluctuations is relatively painless.

@_date: 2019-06-23 14:16:42
Absolutely. You know what the main thing I look for when it comes to crypto and whether I should be buying more or less in any given month? Legitimacy and mass adoption. I look for things that are going to make the average Joe citizen take another look at the asset class and say, "Hey, I should be buying this stuff. I might not understand it 100%, but I feel like it's something I should own." And when we see companies like Fidelity starting to go balls deep in what they want to offer their clients for crypto assets in the future, as well as large banking institutions investing heavily in blockchain, and now Facebook getting into the mix, people are slowly starting to change their minds. By the time CNBC starts telling people that they should have decently sized allocations of bitcoin in their portfolio, most of the real opportunity will be gone. As soon as the world is told about a particular opportunity on their televisions, the money making opportunities have already been given away to the early adopters. The corporations that own those news outlets are simply telling people to join them at that point to cushion their own investments and make them richer. So that's typically what I look for and I think within 3 to 5 years that's exactly where we'll be.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:32:41
In the typical sense yes, but there's only so much of this particular currency and when its gone, its gone. There's a finite amount so as the end nears the price goes up dramatically. Fiat can always print itself into hyperinflation and devalue itself at any time. Parameters change if it becomes a global reserve as well along with how much bitcoin has already been lost forever. It's also an investment vehicle for many, from straight buying and holding to IRAs and other asset vehicles. I believe the early adopters are going to do just fine. Once universal adoption happens and the difficulty level of buying/selling becomes easy enough anyone can do it, the opportunity will be gone.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:42:28
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:58:31
Well there's other financial institutions that are making crypto investing extremely easy for retail traders, thus giving even more credibility to the asset class. Fidelity will be one of the first (along with Robinhood in various states) that simply allows people to buy bitcoin and other currencies and keep them in their portfolio. There's even bitcoin IRA's now that allow for an initial investment of $10-20k for people looking for additional avenues for retirement. Zuckerberg is just jumping on a band wagon that's already been in motion (not that I'm going to give libra one solitary cent).

Oh yeah it's like night and day. I don't even buy stocks unless they pay me to own them. Great way to make some guaranteed income, the only caveat is that you need to own tons of it to make any decent returns if we're talking dividends. That's why I like the leverage of options so much.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:24:22
Do yourself a favor and just open a Gemini account so coinbase doesn't rape you on fees. Get a hardware wallet (ledger or trezor) and just send all your bitcoin there to HODL for years. Then download blockfolio and enter the amounts of bitcoin you own so you can see it's value in real time. I would imagine in 5-7 years it will be worth a very hefty sum.
Learn to dollar cost average with limit orders. For example lets say you have a $1000. You can set a limit order to buy bitcoin at $10,500 and another at $10,000 so you enter your position slower but don't immediately lose value if bitcoin drops sporadically. It's a smart way to accumulate if you're not day or swing trading.

Have you even seen the datacenters that have been erected to mine bitcoin? Do you think your antminer even stands a chance at attaining anything substantial? There's a gigantic datacenter in China dedicated to mining and people like John McAfee have invested millions in building out systems to mine these coins. The only way you'd even stand an even moderate chance in mining anything is if you choose to enter into a mining pool with others, and due to the large amount of people in these pools, the few times you did actually solve a block on the chain your reward would probably be extremely minimal. You're better finding something else to mine all together.

Well, when bitcoin neared almost $20,000 last year, it was on every damn news station along with the Winklevoss twins becoming billionaires from those prices. It was like the California gold rush for a few months. People were taking out second mortgages on their homes to buy bitcoin. Of course things can only go parabolic for so long before coming back down to Earth and a lot of those people's greed came back to bite them in the ass, and seeing most probably weren't investors of anything else, they got scared and sold their bitcoin holdings low thus making the price drop even more. Ever since then its mostly been banks and media calling it a horrible investment and people who buy it are just plain stupid. Which of course is ironic because wall street is now involved in both bitcoin futures contracts and bitcoin IRA's as retirement vehicles. Just the same though, 2018 is going to be another big year with lots of new money coming into the space. The greedy low information folks always get shaken out on dips and corrections. It's always the long term holders that make money in both crypto and financial markets in general providing their investment is solid. As a high school student you may have read a recent article that young people are gravitating more to investing in crypto versus stocks these days, which makes sense seeing the returns on stocks aren't even comparable to those in crypto. If you guys can stand the volatility and the roller coaster ride of the markets you should see ridiculous gains in the next few years. After major public adoption though, many of those gain percentages will diminish greatly and the same opportunities will no longer exist.

These people aren't really journalist. Journalism has been replaced by nothing more than entertainment-for-ratings stories since ages ago. It's all about clickbait, sensationalizing, and complete falsehoods to lead the public into believing certain narratives. It all comes down to the corporations that own that particular media outlet and what they want people to be told. Overall trust in main stream media and media in general is at an all time low and I don't foresee it ever going back up again. The majority of people see through the daily bullshit.

Yes, but only a finite amount of those Big Macs are free. Everybody else is paying for them, so these are basically just subsidized Big Macs for a select few lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:43:03
Yeah, but you can just keep making as many big macs as you want. There's no finite amount of Big Macs, and no shortage. And over time you can put in lesser quality ingredients, like when they took all that silver out of our coins, and now you're devaluing the asset of what those coins represent. The market can absolutely be manipulated with these.

I don't know, that  guy looks like he knows what he's talking about. Most 12 year olds do :p
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:48:41
True. Much of their money is tied up in investments, assets, funds, businesses, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:40:55
Well hopefully he learned a valuable lesson about investing.

The run to $20k was from every day retards who didn't know or even understand what they were buying. Some took out second mortgages on their house to become jillionaires and lost it all and then some. But that happens in every market. Shit, wait for someone on r/wallstreetbets to make some crazy win on a ludicrous trade they made and watch everyone who sees it asking those guys to teach them options lol. Only 3% of the global internet-having population invest in crypto. Once the floodgates open and it becomes easier, the price of bitcoin will be ridiculous. It's not time for that yet though.

With the inception of automation, people will find themselves having to become more specialized. The days of doing brainless work will cease to exist when you can be replaced by a kiosk.

I'd be interested to see in the future what ends up being the reserve currency for the world. Fiats days are numbered. As seen in the last global financial crisis, quantitative easing was used as a band-aid to stop the free fall of global economies. The state of the current fiat currencies of the world is akin to walking on Saran Wrap from thousands of feet in the air. I feel like the next crisis is going to be a collapse. After that happens (and it will happen) serious discussions will be had about what the real reserve currency should be. There will be discussions about gold, but in order for that to be viable, the spot price will have to about $10,000 an ounce (which would be great for people who already own a decent amount of gold). Other discussions may very well end up being things like bitcoin which is essentially the reserve currency of the crypto markets for the most part. Either way, it will be interesting to see. I think those that own it will be well rewarded if that ends up being the case.

Stock market is going parabolic for a while now too. I think that's definitely due for a correction soon. When that happens I see a lot of money moving into crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:49:43
but coins, not bars.

I think as long as people have accrued a sizable amount of anything that gains steam, as soon as global adoption occurs people should be sitting pretty. Whatever I buy just sits on my wallet for years, I don't take it that seriously. Just HODL'n really.

Lol it's a fucking asset class that Wall Street is already trading on the CBOE. Good luck with this dipshit gaining any leeway on banning a damn thing. The financial sector owns these asshats, always have. Not the other way around. How many people went to jail during the financial crisis of the great recession? Yeah. Plus bitcoin is a PUBLIC ledger............we also have PRIVATE ones.
Good luck Sherman. Your time would be better spend starting a gofundme page for a nice hair piece.

Venezuela recently attempted to start their own crypto currency. As far as I know it failed miserably.

Yeah, it's all relative. I put aside a few hundred bucks a month, set limit orders and if they trigger a buy so be it. If not, no biggy. I'm not expecting anything substantial to really happen for another 3 years give or take. But brokerage firms are starting to make the process of buying crypto assets and just storing it in your portfolio like you would a stock, pretty easy. That will continue on as time progresses. Where it goes from there, who knows.

It'll be fun when option contracts become a thing (not just futures).

Yes it's been done before. All that happens is that when things become illegal overnight, black markets pop up the very next day. Cocaine and heroine are illegal too but people are still able to get it every single day without fail. If people really want to buy bitcoin, the marketplace will answer that call.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:46:48
Bitcoin price is manipulated too. Daily. I still buy it, but I know the risks.
