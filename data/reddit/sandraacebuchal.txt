This MUST be off exchange owing to risk of loss/theft and extensive waits for ££ to be remitted. There are not really any exchanges in the UK anyway are there ?

How will that help ?

Bearing in mind that the proposed cash deal will take place in a solicitors office which is in the same building as the local crown court and entry is via a metal detector gate and security guards with CCTV I think this will put off any criminally minded buyer. Do you agree ?

Discount negotiable of course. We EXPECT to sell at a significant discount if we can do so in one transaction.

We went to 3 financial advisers in the UK and none of them could touch this because, in their words, "it is unregulated".
I have got a referral to a solicitor who is happy for the transaction to be conducted in his office under supervision. Any prospective purchaser can stay anonymous to whatever degree they desire. Full proof of the existence of the 1200 BTC currency will be given prior to the prospective purchaser meeting us. The prospective purchaser can fully disclose all their details, use their own solicitor and or have their solicitor present too if they so wish. We can arrange for a reputable security cash in transit company if required.
Any other suggestions to assuage suspicions are welcome.

OK, good idea. Might do that.

Sounds helpful, thanks.

I think as follows (tell me what is wrong with it !):
The sort of person will be a seriously wealthy business man, or lottery winner, or inherited wealth, or serious investor / trader.
They could be in any kind of business.
They will have conducted their business well / profitably. They would know how to spot a good opportunity they can take advantage of.
If they are very wealthy they probably have several million sitting on deposit so they only have to draw the requisite amount out in cash from their bank. They might do that regularly anyway if they have a significant "cash" business, such as many shops requiring a cash float.

We are selling, not buying. So if buying on exchange at £722 my suggested selling of 1200 @ £400 should be attractive to someone maybe ?

UK local bitcoins quote last night for selling 1 BTC was circa £523, if we discount to, say, £400 to sell all in one deal the 1200BTC are £480,000 . Less than $800,000 . Might a USA investor be interested in the $400K "profit". Would easily pay for a flight over to the UK, just need access to ££ when here to do the deal.

I do not know. What are the pros and cons of wire transfer ? Is it in any way reversible by any of the parties involved ?
We need to look into this a bit more, thanks for the suggestion.

The owner is 82 years old and needs ££ to do up her house and improve her life, she does not want to keep 100 bitcoins or any other investments because she had enough worry with all the stuff her late husband used to get into which, to be honest, didn't actually improve their life at all. Following his death she has turned all the other shares and stuff into ££ cash in the bank and it is only the bitcoins that remain to be "liquidated". The rush basically is ;
a)This is a worry for her and she wants shot of it, the last thing she needs at her age is a fluctuating investment.
b)She does not have enough cash without the bitcoins to get the new bathroom, kitchen and the extensive work on the roof done. Ironically bitcoins appears to be the one investment her late husband made which actually "came good" to any significant %. 
I will look into Kraken, thanks for the pointer.

I have a similar problem and just signed up here. Need to sell 1200 bitcoins, not mine but belong to an elderly lady I work for. Her late husband apparently bought these last year before he died. We have got the passwords and keys and can see they exist on his computer. She is 82 and has no interest in keeping them or spending them on the internet ,etc. She needs to turn them into £ and spend them on doing her house up which needs about £100K spending on it for new heating system, new bathroom and kitchen and some roof work. I have read a lot of stuff on here and it looks like she would be taking a big risk and/or having a long wait if she tried to trade through an "exchange". Ideally she needs a guaranteed sale with the money quickly. I was advised by someone to use local bitcoins and meet someone to trade for cash but it seems no one out there has an interest in more than 1 - 5 bitcoins so selling 1200 like this seems difficult if not impossible. We went to 3 financial advisers in the UK and none of them would touch it but I did get a referral to a solicitor who was happy for a cash exchange to take place supervised in his office which at least mitigates the risk of carrying lots of cash or being passed duff notes. But we still have no idea how you find a buyer for 1200 coins.
