Bitstamp does not accept credit cards and yet they require the same crap (and they painstakingly examine the documents.)
The point that AML/KYC is a burden stands.

Most smart sellers will require ID if you do not pay or deposit cash. In any country. Wire transfers been reversed one time too many. Paypal is even worse. 
Source: I have seen wire transfers reversed in several countries, in different continents.

Except, you cannot make a backup of your cash or your car. Given the choice, I'd rather lose my iPhone, if properly locked and backed up (thankfully Apple is doing a good job implementing decent default security for the non-techies.) Restore backup to new device, move all bitcoins to new wallets just in case. Done.

I would upvote you twice if I could. Some people seem to be out of touch with the 'real world.' Most people are simply not willing and able to take charge of complex security policies. Your job of offering quite good security to the masses is extremely useful and very much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:41:11
Unfortunately, you might be right. They'll try to regulate cryptos to death, or ban them altogether.

Unfortunately, no address book.
Which brings me to my question: which iOs wallets offer an address book, besides GreenAddress?
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:27:46
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
Feature 1 though (public monitoring of the votes in real time) would be illegal in some countries. I know Italian law, for example, does not even allow exit polls to be made public until after the ballot closes. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:52:48
Agreed, I'd love to be able to mine again with my "normal" computer in my basement. Somehow it feels like that's the way Bitcoin was supposed to work. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:23:46
Since nobody is answering you, I'll be the bearer of bad news.
You lose the passsword/private key -&gt; you lose your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:38:53
Should we seed on I2P as well?
@_date: 2014-11-25 07:05:56
Even more unfortunate is that they require an e-mail address to donate bitcoins. That's where I bolted. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:56:21
Why wouldn't you just send the balance to a brand new wallet rather than importing the old one? It seems so much easier to me.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:43:50
Jesus, with that kind of money in bitcoin, could you not invest in a Trezor!?
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:17:42
Please add an address book. For someone initiating several transactions a day, not having an address book feels like being in the 90s all over again. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:58:53
Of course. Otherwise, anyone could have bought cheap at bitstamp and sell expensive at MtGox. Instant arbitrage rich scheme, At least as long as withdrawals went through. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:00:59
In fairness, as banks go, ING Bank Italy is a huge improvement: 0 fees for *everything* and overnight wire transfers (free for the entire SEPA area.)
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:11:52
Why? A well implemented 2FA code can be used only once (I am not talking about a simple PIN as second factor of course, I am thinking Gauth or something like that.) Most services require a second 2FA for withdrawal. I don't see how temporarily disclosing your login credentials to a phishing site would be game over if 2FA is enabled. 
Source: I once feel victim to a phishing scam, 2FA saved my ass. Logged into the real site, changed password, done. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:12:52
Localbitcoins admin are not fast but they are on top of their security and have always been fair, IMO. Definitely report it.
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:39:33
Wouldn't the seller risk chargebacks just like with credit cards?
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:30:23
*This* is the way it should be done !
I still have a problem with the votes showing up in real time though. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:18:27
Can you elaborate? (Honest question, I do not get it.)
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:33:42
Yes they do. They offer an escrow service and a hosted wallet, at least for on-line sales. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:59:41
This is a really good start. Short and clear. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 05:31:33
I am looking for a wallet with this kind of functionality. However, I first need to know: Who holds the private key of the ANX Vault app? Is it stored on the phone or does ANX control your bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:18:18
Don't you think that calling someone's opinion 'wrong' and 'misguided' is disrespectful? Just because you do not agree.

It seems to me that Bitcoin does not fit Hosein's definition of money (it does not match 4 out of 6 criteria.)
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:36:26
IIRC, the FAQ states that they'll need reasonable proof of your identity to reset 2FA. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:09:47
You've goy my vote too
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:51:49
Thank you for the good answers and thank you for the good work.
You might want to add that the iOs device should *not* be jailbroken for maximum security. Jailbreaking iOs dramatically increases security risks. I specially keep a non-jailbroken iPhone for sending bitcoins. All other devices I own are view only (including my desktop computer, unless I use Trezor.)
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:41:05
If that turns out to be true, Tor *is* broken imho.

To put things in context - I bought between $10 and $20. When it crashed to almost zero, everybody laughed at me. They had invested in gold. Fast forward three years, I sold most of my bitcoins between $100 and $1000. Their gold lost 25%. 
For clarity, I sold because I needed the money. I am still a big believer and I am still buying what I can afford.
Obviously, this 'crash' does not worry me at all. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 04:12:50
Why the registration though?

Coinkite can be used as cold storage if you create a multisig wallet. 
You could use Coinkite for convenience to store one key and print a few more keys in a m of n signature setup.
Easiest approach is probably 2 of 3, one key with Coinkite, one in a safe and one in a bank deposit box but you can get very creative with that. I think they allow up to 15 signatures. 
In my experience, Coinkite has been the most reliable hosted wallet out here, consistently. I have a cold (multisig) and a hot wallet with Coinkite and they never let me down. If they just had an iPhone app, it would be the only wallet I need ...
If you have a significant amount of bitcoins though, I feel that Trezor is the way to go. It blows my mind when I read about people losing the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars because they felt that $120 dollars was too much money for a Trezor. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:07:45
It's not only too much. It's bad practice. Everybody agrees that bitcoin addresses should be for single use only and for that reason a lot of wallets are HD, which means that the adress will never appear as used. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:15:49
Yes, the difference being that in the past those transacfions almost never confirmed while now a lot of them do confirm. I get a few free satoshis a day. Yay. 
Seriously though, I am concerned that Big Brother is somehow using those transactions to deanonymize bitcoin owners. Darkwallet we need you! (yes, I donated.)
@_date: 2014-10-13 04:24:39
This is not about buying at all. You are either purposefully misrepresenting or totally missing the point. Some of us love the technology, the disruption of old, corrupt systems and, hopefully, the possibility to make a small contribution to making the world a better place.

Sell on localbitcoins.com
The prices are generally higher on localbitcoins so you'll make some extra money as a seller.

I exchanged PGP-encrypted emails with Coinkite. Their public key was published on the site.

A Verso card is 20 bucks, shipment included. It works wonderfully in my experience. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:19:21
Why don't you buy a Trezor or (cheaper) two Verso cards, one for cold wallet, one for hot wallet. That would be the easiest way to implement good security. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:05:08
This! Thank you. I instantly bolt when needless information is required, especially in the bitcoin space.
E.g. Install our wallet, step 1: confirm your phone number. Really?!

It was about time. What an absurd policy. Unfortunately, all existing wallets are still vulnerable.

Thank you for the suggestion. I was looking for a way to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem and this is just the best way for me. I barely downloaded 50% and I have already uploaded quite a bit. It makes me feel good that I am doing my tiny bit to contribute.
As for u/allgoodthings1 remark, why would you get in trouble with your ISP for torrenting perfectly legal data? Do you have a data cap or something? Or are some ISPs so retarded that they target P2P without regard to the content?

To be clear, 2 step auth will *not* protect your e-mail backup. Your email backup is only as safe as the password you used. If your password is not *really* safe, make a new wallet and move all your funds. Changing the password now will not help. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:19:16
I2P seems to be a much more secure darknet than Tor ever was though. Tor was mainly created to access the clear net, I2P was a darknet only from the get go. Also, somehow the involvement of the U.S. government in the development of Tor makes me nervous. It might be open source and all that jazz but it might also take time to find a well concealed backdoor. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:59:15
No, no, and no.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:31:41
Actually, it does, if implemented properly (plausible deniability.)
You can set up two different wallets with two different passwords. You keep a small amount of bitocins in the wallet you are prepared to give up. There is no way to determine that there is actually a second wallet accessible from that device.
