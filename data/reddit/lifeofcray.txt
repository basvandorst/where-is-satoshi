Yeah, i mean, i want to pay for a 30 dollar game and have to pay like 14 dollars in fees. 
Which kinda means that i have to have my bitcoins in some kind of service. Which means that I can't have them in my private wallet.
It's just strange is all. Even if bitcoin is worth more, 30 bucks is 30 bucks*. It kinda feels like it's gone from being a currency to being a commodity. 
*not adjusted for inflation

Banks reimburse stolen funds. Bitcoin doesn't. 
I don't have to worry about my computer illiterate mother having five troyans and three keyloggers if I use my card. But i risk losing everything in my "hot wallet" if i pay with bitcoin.
Do you think the average person knows what the difference between cold storage and hot wallet is? Do you think they know what a blockchain is? 
All they know is that they log on to a site, type in a number, and the stuff they wanted to pay for gets paid.
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:13:26
So you have to give the other signature to someone you trust. Which would be someone you know.
If someone knows you, they're more likely to actually care for you. So first you get to Person 1 with the wrench and say "get him to sign off on it or you get a drill into your kneecaps until you do". If that doesn't work, you get the information on who the second person is and say to them "I got a power-drill aimed at your friends knees."
Now lets say he doesn't give it up anywho. Then you just pick him up and drill his knee as well.
Or you install a keylogger on both their computers.

One would image that he'd ask more than 1 billion people and just not you. Equilibrium is at one billion people @ 1 dollar with a payout of 1 billion.
From the 1 dollar guy it's worth while if he is indeed asking one billion people but giving out two billion. That means that if you give him 1 dollar one billion times you'll get 2 billion dollars

Yeah, i've never understood the craze about mining. Just, you know, open up a service that uses bitcoin. 
This is why I always explain bitcoin as "Magical internet money" to someone who has never heard of it before. They don't need to know that bitcoin is mined, or that it has a blockchain, or what the blockchain does, or any of that.
All they need to know is that they can use their "magical internet money" to buy or sell stuff.

Banks "Borrow" our money and keep it relatively safe. 
Ben, Jerry and Joe each have 100 usd on their bank. Since Ben, Jerry and joe never withdraw all of their 100 usd at the same time, there will always be something left in the bank.
The banks use these funds to make investments. In other companies, other countries, loans to people with good credit, etc.
The bank give back some interest to the Ben, Jerry and Joe because they're using their bank and letting this happen. The bank in turn give them the security that they'll always have their 100 usd. Even if the bank go belly up, the state goes in and say "here Ben, Jerry, Joe, here's your 100 usd"
