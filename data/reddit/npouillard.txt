You might have a look at this article from Vitalik 
He describes one flaw of HD wallets which is now mitigated by the use of hardened derivations. Namely each account in a HD wallet is firewalled from the others.

Not sure those are layman terms, but hope this helps:
ECDSA is the signature algorithm used in Bitcoin to sign transaction. If someone can forge your signature he/she can steal your coins. Now this signature algorithm needs a random number, if the number is not "random enough" there is ways to recover your private key from the signature.
Now RFC6979 means "deterministic ECDSA", the idea is to reduce the risk associated with a potentially bad random generator coming from your OS or whatever. To do so one reuse the private as a source of randomness in a deterministic (which means that with same inputs you get the same outputs, hence no randomness).
For instance the Trezor hardware wallet is using RFC6979 and thus should be safe from these attacks.

Have a look at bitmessage. It is more of a secure email system than a secure Skype but it is p2p and does not disclose your IP when you receive a message.

It indeed makes less sense in Bitcoin core has the private keys are not deterministically generated anyway. I think however that as soon as the private keys are derived deterministically from a seed, one should use deterministic signing as well.

Which kind of card?
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:46:25
Yes they are. Is this going to be the bottle neck?  I doubt so. Even validating the ecdsa signatures is cheap enough. Looking through the unspent outputs might take the most resources.

Any specific links?
@_date: 2014-12-23 08:39:30
Yes that's the way to do it. Still you have to either remember or automate.

We don't need the price to be higher for Bitcoin to function as a better money/payment system. We don't need new users either.
If others find Bitcoin useful as well then they will take part of it which incurs a rise of the price.

It does not work like that.

I recommend this video lecture as an introduction to elliptic-curve cryptography because of its use in Bitcoin. But also as they explain how using a particular kind of curve (Edward) would be a safer choice. The main reason being that Edward curves comes with no exceptions to compute point addition which makes the implementation less error prone in particular when avoiding timing information leakage.

Do you still believe in growth?

While your comment is well-informed and wise, I'd like to comment on your two points (non overuse of blockchain, use of projects such as Helios).
Having studied Helios protocol and implementation, I'd stay there is still a lot to be desired.
* I would like to see less centralized protocols where the need to trust the election officials is reduced to its minimum.
* I also found the implementation to be quite horrible from a security perspective (not defensive enough).
For instance our team found a bug which allowed to over-vote and this by simply disabling the JS check in the UI. Assuming you ticked 2 boxes and max 1 was allowed. The produced ZK proof would tell that your number of votes (2) is within the bounds 0..2 instead of 0..1. The server then checks the coming proofs without checking that they are proofs of the right thing?!
Reference: 
I have supervised some work on a more decentralized approach which still relies on the block-chain without bloating it

I've not looked deeply at the paper yet.
Any idea if this applies to the curves used in Bitcoin?
Any idea on how practical this can be?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:08:49
Thanks for your answer. Clear and to the point.
have beer on me, nullc! @_date: 2015-03-27 08:18:47
Actually there is a subtraction operation. It comes by combining addition and the inverse. The inverse of a point is the opposite point on the curve.

Simple. You sell (both on an exchange or with a merchant) when you value more what you get in exchange for your bitcoin.

Some might see as educational devices to have at conferences/events it helps speak about bitcoin. It also helps if one can buy things with bitcoin at the same event. Moreover they still make 3% on fees (configurable though)

Thanks. I get the point. This still rely on fact of using well this power of expanding or shrinking the money supply. However decision makers tend to only listen at the economists when the economy is in trouble. To which the only advice boils down to printing money.
