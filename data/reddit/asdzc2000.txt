I keep reading that... but serious talk here.. wouldn't you want to sell at some point? Like what if you are 50 and have enough money in BTC to sell and make $30 million.. then you could just invest that $30 million in tax free bonds and just live like a king for the rest of your life. At some point, you're going to want to get your money from btc right?

I mean they are based in the US and have a lot of VC money and are FDIC insured... It's honestly not as risky as everyone seems to make it out to be.. but I'm new here and have no idea and probably don't know all the horror stories that have happened to people with Coinbase.

Is it possible for Trezor to go out of business and then you lose everything stored on your Trezor?

Got it. So you keep everything in your offline wallet like a Trezor.. And then.. one day.. when you finally pull the trigger to sell, you can quickly transfer your funds to a website like Coinbase and then sell. And what are the chances that website goes bankrupt that day you are selling on them?

Quick question on transferring coins into Trezor from lets say.. CoinBase.
Is it as easy as plugging your Trezor in on your computer and getting an Address and then logging into your Coinbase account and clicking Send, and copy pasting your Trezor address in there?

So yea I don't get that.. are you just going to keep buying BTC up until the day you die? I understand holding for like 10-20-30 years.. but never sell forever? Is this just a gift for your great great grandkids?
