What business would pay real money for a useless service? Any company can create its pwn blockchain for free. Ethereum exists since 2015, now is 2018, so what you can do with it except tokens? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:53:49
Good idea

Micropayment channel networks create new problems, which have not been solved in the original papers [8,18]. We identify two main challenges – the blockchain capacity and locked-in funds.
Even with increases in block size it was estimated that the blockchain capacity could only support about 800 million users with micropayment channels due to the number of on-chain transactions required to open and close channels [9]. A large scale adoption of micropayment channel networks, where, e.g., Internet Of Things devices have their own Bitcoin wallet, brings the blockchain to its limit.
Two parties cooperating in a channel must lock funds into a shared account. The locked-in funds should be sufficient to provide enough capacity for peaks of transactions. There is a conflict of the two aims to have a low amount of funds locked up in a channel, while at the same time being flexible for these peaks.
We will present a solution that improves on both problems. Payment channels will not appear in the blockchain, except in the case of disputes. Users will be able to enter the system with one blockchain transaction and then open many channels without further blockchain contact. Funds are committed to a group of other users instead of a single partner and can be moved between channels with just a few messages inside this collaborating group, which reduces the risk, as an unprofitable connection can be quickly dissolved to form a better connection with another partner. By hiding the channels from the blockchain, a reduction in blockchain space usage and thus the cost of channels is achieved. For a group of 20 nodes with 100 channels in between them, this can save up to 96% of the blockchain space.

I didn't buy eth at 10 dollars and I won't buy it at 1000 dollars either. The price of bitcoin could go to 1000 today and I would still have profit.  The 20k price was an anomaly and only dumb people could invest then, same as ethereum now
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:41:58
I think the recent airdrops have a big impact on the fees. It was the only time I didn't care about the huge fee to move my coins because the airdrops rewards were higher
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:04:32
great, a second layer solution. bitcoin can handle these types of transactions until channel factories is implemented

@_date: 2018-01-28 19:50:58
I understand there were issues because some people didn't want to upgrade to segwit and other wanted to fork the blockchain, but now that the FUD is over I think it's time to work full time on developing bitcoin  
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:42:54
I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the ratings. Bitcoin has C+ because "it is encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs" and ETH gets B because "benefits from more readily upgradable technology and better speed". 
So according to these "economists" Dogecoin should get AAA because it has cheaper transactions and higher speed?  And USD should get E because of the hassle to move, say 15k from USA to EU? 
Just ignore these ratings, they know nothing about blockchains and crypto.
Edit: and why are they comparing apples and oranges, some of the blockchains such as eth were never supposed to be a currency
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:08:07
Indeed, I have never been more optimistic about Bitcoin in the long term. I regret selling some in early 2017 because of the full block fud and propaganda from r/btc

There is no such thing yet, but I would like to be able to buy "lightning bitcoins" which could be spent to lightning addresses only instantly and very cheap. Channel management should be done in the background by wallets/exchanges, the user should be able to buy and send lightning bitcoins instantly.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:06:59
Devs should faster start implementing and selling lightning bitcoins on coinbase before the smart contracts platform will overtake bitcoin's market cap
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:36:31
It looks nice, most of the nodes have only 2-3 open channels and are able to make as many transactions as they want
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:25:26
They are cuntz, complain about high fees but don't mine transactions with less than 5 sat/byte
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:13:12
I suppose you did your research, so which crypto is undervalued in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:56:42
Companies never buy crypto and never gamble like you do. If you think a company will buy your early bought tokens for a higher price you a delusional. Only other greedy speculators can buy your tokens. There are legit blockchains aimed at companies but the companies never buy the tokens in that case, they pay a fixed price in fiat to use it's service.
People that use bitcoin as a legit store of value account don't check the price every day like speculators do, they check the price maybe every couple months. Bitcoin is still 10x since last year, and it's the most secure and stable. Last couple months a lot of dumb money entered into crypto (because we were in a bubble) and that's why bitcoin's market share decreased.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:30:44
Dumb money is moving to smart people

I would if I could write code
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:09:37
This. There is a lot of money to make if the devs would increase the block size but it will be the end of decentralization long term.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:40:47
But Ethereum existed in 2015 as well, why no one bought it then? Is there any use cases for dApps other than ponzi tokens? All the newbs who bought tokens in the last half year turned the crypto market in a big ponzi scheme. Just look at this chart:  Everyone that invested in crypto after november 2017 will regret it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:34:16
Only rich people (which I hope I will be) should have a btc savings account, all the other who buy bitcoins on exchanges should receive a lightning account to be able to make cheap transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:21:50
You're not wrong. But my opinion is the end is near for altcoins, not for bitcoin. Some people won't cash out bitcoin because they trust it more as a store of value than banks.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:28:56
LN is old news, we need [Channel Factories](
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:04:56
If I understand correctly a channel is a 2-of-2 multisignature wallet between 2 nodes where their btc are locked.
Is it possible to open a 1000-of-1000 multisignature wallet between 1000 nodes to work as a channel so there is no more need for openings of new channels?
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:22:45
It won't create 2 chains if it's well planed in advance.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:59:26
bitcoin can implement any technology an altcoin has. just the ledger is important, anything else can be changed. by your logic any coin is useless because next year will be a better coin

These people are going to buy all the bitcoins

@_date: 2018-01-28 21:12:52
well anyway, I think all the bitcoin holders should unite and support our devs either through tips/donations or by doing something. I am a bitcoin user and I don't plan to move my store of value to an new altcoin everytime there is a new ICO

What are they biulding and why it needs to be decentralized? Why eth does need a token if this is not a currency? If eth appeared before btc it would be free, even vitalik sold all his eth at the price of 10.

I tried since the beginning of 2017 to find a real life use case for ethereum but i couldn't. Good luck to you!

What feauture other coins have that bitcoin cannot copy paste and implement? The ledger and proved security is important, not the shills and experimental technology
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:19:01
If bitcoin didn't make some millionaires no one would have created any altcoin. If not for bitcoin, ethereum would be free, the same as testnet tokens.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:03:56
Time will show my friend. 99% of alts are ponzi schemes. Bitcoin had 90% market share before the fud that "blokstream limited it to 1mb to destroy it" which was a lie. All the alts grew because of a lie. All the alts grew because of the stupid investors, snd the bubble is about to burst. 1 year ago everyone new eth is interesting but useless, i bought some as well when it was 15 dollars.

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:02:07
All the blockchains have scalability issues.  If the devs don't acknowledge this they are liars.
Look at Ethereum for example:  And they waste blockchain decentralization to play Cryptokitties. At least Bitcoin's transactions are serious that otherwise would pay that fees to a bank.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:38:53
Transactions on the Lightning Network are not publicly broadcast. Instead, they are encrypted and routed from the payer to the payee via intermediate nodes, using a tor-like onion routing protocol.
In other words, Lightning transactions offer significant privacy improvements over regular on-blockchain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:17:39
After ethereum will have congestion issues in the near future people will realise that a small block size and high transaction fees are a feature and not a bug

When the transaction fees were low there were a lot of spam attacks which now remained on the blockchain and have to be downloaded and stored forever by the  future nodes.
Bitcoin can be used as a pocket swiss account, but autistic people that don't understand the technology want to pay for coffee with it because cash is too mainstream. 
It will be possible to pay for your daily coffee without congesting the network when the lighting network will be ready.

@_date: 2018-01-21 12:04:55
I expect BTC dominance to go above 70% in the long term. Very soon BTC will have smart contracts, a working lightning network, channel factories and it wouldn't make sense to use other coins. Dapps are useless and free off-chain payments aren't sustainable. Immutable money ledger and proof of existence are the only real life use cases of a blockchain.

And why would I care about "lncli decodepayreq". It's an online wallet and it just works.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:39:53
I would send the money using my bank account or maybe bitcoin cash which is cheaper. Bitcoin is best as a store of value or savings account and not for daily payments.
Ethereum is advertised as a turing complete blockchain not a payment processor, so if you only want to send money why don't you use Bitcoin Cash which is 67 times cheaper and can already do 5 million transactions per day?
How do you think [this chart]( will look in 2 months? Or [this chart](

What do you mean by centralisation or security risks? It sounds like the definition of ehtereum
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:05:53
Bitcoin can easily do 10x the current number of transactions if the devs decide to raise the block size. Ethereum is already unusable at 4x. Ethereum transaction fees are rising and will be the same as bitcoins. Except I am willing to pay $30 to move $10k but who is going to pay $30 to playing Cryptokitties?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:38:07
Of course i moved my coins first, paid i very high transaction fee but the free airdrops were worth it 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:24:14
Yes indeed, I feel safer owning BTC knowing that the bitcoin software cannot be changed overnight by some nocoiner
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:38:05
If you think bitcoin is useless because the technology is outdated, then all the other coins are useless as well because there will be newer technology next year. We can't swap the coins every time a new blockchain technology is invented. Bitcoin is the most valuable or nothing is.

Download Electrum wallet, create a new wallet on an offline computer, write the seed on 2 pieces of paper, and put it in a safe place, then create a watch only wallet using the master public key, open the watch only wallet on your every day computer and send there the Bitcoins. Double check the address when adding funds to your wallet and use every time a new deposit address.
And when you want to spend the Bitcoin, you restore the wallet on an offline computer with your seed, sign the transaction, save the transaction in a file, and broadcast it on the online computer. This way your seed/private keys never touch the internet.
Or you can send me the bitcoins and I can keep it safe for you /s

I know that Bitcoin's volatility is a problem if it wants to be a store of value, but so far it only went up long term, and volatility is getting lower and lower with adoption so there will be a time when Bitcoin's volatility will be comparable to USD or GBP

You don't understand how bitcoin works. Now the bitcoin (or ethereum) miners earn about $ 5 billion worth of bitcoin per year. It's a big amount of money, but not very much comparing to traditional banks which earn about ten times more. And Bitcoin offers a real service to it's customers, not just speculation, an account more secure than a swiss bank account. How much money is spent for swiss or offshore bank accounts? 
Bitcoin's price is designed to grow due to block reward halvings, but it can work even better if the price will be the same forever.

Bitcoin can support about 1 million outputs per day NOW without a block size increase.

Sharding is only a concept for now. Half of eth transaction have a 0 value. It has more transactions but far less value than bitcoin. You already need a very powerful pc to run a eth node and is getting worse every day. This is not good. My car doesn't have a swiming pool, but it doesn't mean it needs one to do more things.

Not directly but in the same year. It didn't go directly to $20k either. And this time almost everyone knew it was a bubble so it went from 20k to 6k very quick. But I think the altcoiners didn't get there was also an altcoin bubble, so altcoins will have a much longer bear trend.

Your source is correct. If have to try multiple paths until you find a good route, and if the path is too long it needs time to calculate it. So if you have a supercomputer you can find the perfect route with 20 hops, but if you have a smartphone you can calculate a good enough route with 5 hops

You don't know what you're talking about. I chose "median" because in Bitcoin 1 transaction can have 1000 inputs and outputs with a 1000x fee and counted as 1 transaction, while in ETH 1 transaction is just 1 transaction.
So do you understand why "median" is the fair choice?


LN already exists and made the fees negligible, there are thousands of free transactions everyday.

Why does that matter? It did 100x in 12 months, so it obviously crashed in a 1 year bear market. In 2017 it did 20x in 12 months, so it obviously crashed as well, only this time was quicker because everyone was excepting the crash, and also not -85% like in 2014 but only 70%.

@_date: 2018-06-24 20:35:05
There is a reason why bitcoin has a 1 mb block cap. Blockchains scale very poorly, and adding smart programs makes the issues worse. Bitcoin had the smart contract op codes removed in it's early days due to possible attacks found.  Remember how many times ethereum had vulnerabilities. Or try to run a eth full node and see how many resources it uses comparing to bitcoin.

The 2013 bubble was different. Bitcoin went from $12 to $1200 (100X) in just a year and then the biggest exchange got hacked for 800k BTC and all the hacked coins dumped on the other exchanges (btc-e). In 2017 Bitcoin did a huge 20x but not nearly as 100x in 2013 and no major exchange got hacked, in fact the technology behind bitcoin is the best as ever, with under 2 years until the block reward halvening and lightning network wallets around the corner.

You suggest to be smart but you understand almost nothing about LN. Why do i need to know about a node that is 20 hops from my node? 


It should know the nodes connected to my channels. And the nodes connected to that nodes. And so on. Up to 6 hops I think.
It may look like a short path but if you use facebook and go to your friend and then his friend and so on you could probably get to almost anyone from this planet in about 6 hops.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:49:10

@_date: 2018-07-23 11:49:25


You don't understand technology, otherwise you would know that sharding creates more problems that it solves. A better scaling solution would be sidechains. 
But if  sharding is worse than layer 2 or sidechains than why Ethereum chose it? Because in order to use Layer 2 or sidechains you need to lock your coins, and in a POS crypto your coins are already locked to earn dividends. You cannot both stake or use Layer 2 at the same time.

As far as I know eth is good at pruning but it was never the storage the biggest issue.

You're retarded. Look here:  Only 2 dapps with 1k-2k daily users - some expensive exchanges for shitcoins. And the rest of the dapps have less than 200 daily users. Why waste your time developing a dapp if it will have 200 daily users in the best case and 5 daily users if it's not in the top 50?
And the worst thing is that you cannot increase these numbers without sacrificing decentralization.

The internet doesn't have a bandwidth or processing limit. Eth hit it's scaling limit, it cannot handle more users, and things are getting even worse every day while the blockchain size grows.

It's wouldn't be a bad feature to have for a crypto if it didn't increase the system requirements to run a full node so much. BTC has now 9 years and can run on a old computer with HDD, ethereum is less than 3 years old and already needs a powerful computer with SSD.
