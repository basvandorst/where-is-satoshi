wtf is this? only cash deposits into your own name?!?

I think all spending should be done from cold storage.  
Electrum with offline computer signing the transaction. 
Thats how I purchased this sofa :)

How do you know that I realized a gain overall? Or do you always speak out of your ass?
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:52:48
Do more research. You are extremely ignorant on the topic, and I do not mean that in a negative fashion.
Tl;dr:   User error, coinbase valuation is spot on

It is possible. There are 2^160 possible Bitcoin addresses. 
Comparatively speaking, your odds of being struck by lightning are about 1 in 280,000.
So you’re about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to find an address.

Yea sounds like you shouldnt buy bitcoins then
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:37:59
or better yet, it stops raising when more people are selling than buying

That was my guess, (have previously ordered a Breitling Superocean on from amazon) ... and might just use amazon again for ease of use [except the watches on there are not from authorized retailers]... 
edit: THANKS... just needed to look a little longer on amazon

You definitley have to have things in order before a 100k+ deposit.. but a 12,000 -20,000 cashout from coinbase is not going to freeze your account

Newb or specialist, why would that matter. The fact is that it is a feature built into coinbase, the same as instant purchase via visa or selling bitcoins via ACH transfer. If it doesn't cancel, oh well. I went and bought 5 more after trying to cancel. If they have a feature on their website, it should work

@_date: 2013-12-31 17:32:10
wouldn't everyone want to order when the price does jump and their bitcoins are worth more USD?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:39:10
These problems will be dealt with by the developers as they occur. The level of your speculation is 3 orders of magnitude greater than the speculation on bitcoin its self right now.

For someone with money, 100 btc is nothing. I had a friend from colorado call me and want to buy 100 btc this morning. He is not tech savy at all, but with the influx of news reports, don't be surprised to see accredited investors and the upperclass start buying. 
Just remember.... just because you have never earned $70,000 in your whole life does not stop someone else from betting that much on a blackjack hand or out with a night of strippers.

localbitcoins is the best out there. There is reliable people who will meet up with you in nice area in broad daylight and even offer up to 7% off mt. gox prices. They will help you out when you dont understand something, some of them will even buy your bitcoins back when you want to sell.
Neither of of us are correct, LBTC is just like ebay... the service they provide is amazing, the people you deal with are the ones that suck. I have had nothing but positive experiences with local bit coins.

Seen it, If i was spending that much i would get a new Patek or Audemars. Thx :)

localbitcoins.com if you do not want to give out any information is the only way. Bring cash and meet in a safe location

1 - Stock market is artificially inflated right now. You might get some small gains for the next 18 months... but watch out for the real market correction.
2- I bought my bitcoins at 100-120      - Not only will I not sell my chunk.... I am buying more. 
I truly believe in bitcoin and despise the bankers and politicians just as much
I do own BIDU stock.....  FWIW

1. coinbase
2. localbitcoins.com
3. get electrum as a wallet or send to paper wallet.

But, in all honesty, bitoin is a smart allocation of 1-5 percent of a well diversified portfolio. Consider it schmuck insurance, if it goes to zero; oh well. If it succeeds it could take over your whole portfolio.
The problem today is that we have an excess of young individuals ignorantly looking at past gains and new stories, expecting to turn 27 dollars into $886,000. These individuals are putting in excess of 75% of their meager net worth's into bitcoin. Some are even taking out loans or buying on  credit cards using cash advance. 
The main explanation for this is greed. These newcomers do not understand the technology its self, let alone how to secure a wallet or use offline storage. This will lead to some artificial price increases followed by fast corrections. 
The early adopters who have the majority of the coins understand all of this, and are keeping us whole. 
If the early adopters acted like all these people who just bought last week because of CNN... we would be sunk.
After all, we are not ready for $1000 until Mid-2014.

I have bitcoin as a store of value and as a way of controlling my funds without letting the federal reserve lend money off my deposits. I just want them to stay where I bought them. If they increase in value that is just a positive side effect. 
You guys need to think of bitcoin as a crowd funded global banking system for the people by the people ran by the people
