"Paying at the same time you place it". So, not Bitcoin then?

I thought Bitcoin was meant as a currency and means of exchange and not just a store of value? Or did I misread the white paper?

How is paying a large % in fees better as a currency? Store of value? Maybe. Currency? Doesn't look like it.

Bitcoin is not really viable as a Day-to-day currency with it's fee structure and long confirmation times. Or do you reckon it is?

If I would pay all my groceries or online purchases with Bitcoin for a year, instead of cash/USD. Wouldn't I lose more in Bitcoin fees than through inflation of the USD? What am I missing? Why is everyone claiming Bitcoin is superior here?

Yes, they are? Tell me: how much purchasing power have I lost this year. How does this compare to the average Bitcoin fee?

Yes, totally agree. I just don't think it will be Bitcoin. Maybe some other cryptocurrency.

So you need a bank, to 'be your own bank'?
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:49:37
So you agree with me OP is wrong and Bitcoin won't replace the dollar?

How is Bitcoin 'working' and/or benefitting humanity, exactly?
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:00:57


Doesn't that apply to all exchanges? Are there any real/working DEX?
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:38:27
How did you think they worked? Might be worth a google before you post stuff like this.

No fees of any kind? How much was paid to miners for this beer?

Isn't the 24th word usually a checksum (so: not a random word out of the list)?
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:46:58
7 :)

With absolute Bottom, you mean yearly low or something?
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:12:37
What does make Bitcoin unique and valuable?
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:16:58
How exactly will Bitcoin change any of this?
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:04:51
Yes he does! I just read an article about him, today.

Are you saying no alts serve any purpose or solve any problem whatsoever?
