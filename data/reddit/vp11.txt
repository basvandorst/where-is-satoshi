pretty decent beginner's guide. I wouldn't recommend WhatsApp never, though, since it's Facebook-owned and they clearly scan your messages and link them to your Fb profile.

E2E encryption means that anyone trying to intercept the message will not be able to read it in plain text. It doesn't mean that WhatsApp (Facebook) doesn't have the keys to decrypt them at their will. I've been seeing a certain trend of people believing that end to end encryption means that the company has no access to the data -- **that's a false assumption** (and a dangerous one depending on your threat model). This could only be true if the data was strongly encrypted with a key that YOU and ONLY YOU own.

There are many ways to achieve that. I'm sure you've heard about the term "browser fingerprinting" before. They will match 2349820948290 profile with many other "similar profiles" that were harvested by other means (like cookies for browser fingerprinting) and give a very accurate probability of how 2349820948290 profile is similar and probably the same user as to, let's say, 1541824247277.
There's a reason these guys are the biggest ads server in the whole Internet business, they can target a very specific market with such precision that it's extremely valuable. But they can only achieve that by using these data harvesting factories.

[Matrix]( is trying to solve this problem, IIRC they already have optional end to end encryption. Fully open source protocol for private personal or group chats.
I'm not saying that the alternatives are perfect and ready to be consumed by the masses, but early adopters and people engaged in privacy activism (if that's a thing) should be looking into these alternatives and supporting them, imo.

Yes, but they are open source, which means anyone can verify that your keys are not being stored in a random server in China or Palo Alto.

They can only scan the messages if they have the key to decrypt it, you can't do one without the other, lol.

Wire, Signal, Matrix, to name a few.

as u/giogaris said, they make one for you. they will simply associate your phone number to a new profile called 2349820948290. they will scan your messages from all the groups and personal messages and make a very nice profile about Mr. 2349820948290.
And if one day at some point you use any of the other services offered by Facebook with your phone (or even without it), they will  be able to correlate 2349820948290 to you and offer that sweet, sweet ad that you were looking for.

You kinda have to trust them for that. You can only be sure with open source software and both aren't. I was one of the very early adopters of WhatsApp and always liked the company's instance in protecting users' privacy (by not adding ads) -- until Facebook bought it. By the looks or [this interview, where the WhatsApp founder explains why he left Facebook]( I can't be so sure Facebook won't have access to my messages for long...
As far as I know, Telegram is in an alright spot right now and many privacy advocates like it. But there are more secure, open source alternatives out there, so why not use and promote them?

Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent and governments can already audit and track transactions in a very easy way by using chain analysis software.
I believe it makes sense for them to issue a federal / local cryptocurrency because it would make transactions go a lot faster, cutting many middlemen. There's also the added bonus that the people would be able to correctly identify public transactions from the government that might come from corruption.
Bitcoin will need to toughen up on privacy big time if it will become the main choice for those who want or need financial privacy.
