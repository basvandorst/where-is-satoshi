You don't receive $75 back. You didn't lend money, you lent a stock. You get your stock back. Though now it is worth less, yes.


I think you get nominal fees for the borrowing of your stock. "Stock Loan Fee." The person borrowing has "Borrowing Costs" to take on, including possible interest fees.


The value of the stock is not set in stone. It could keep going down. It can go back up, it can even go higher than $100. That's why it isn't the same.


You don't know. That's why it is a "bet." It's a total gamble. Shorting is basically only a good idea if you *know* the stock will drop.


This is true, and one of the things that makes shorting complicated and asinine. Someone else just made money off of your misfortune. The value of your stock was going to go down anyway, someone "bet" that its value would plummet and won. You do need your stock returned though, stealing is still not legal. 
You also have to consider the opposite possibility. What if I borrow your $100 stock and it instead goes up? Say, it goes up to $125. Well, now I have to get you the stock back at a more expensive price and I'm out both the cost of the stock and the cost of the fees. I'm fucked.


The borrowing process is automatic as far as I know, you can't ask or deny permissions. As long as fees are being paid, the transactions go through using a broker.
You can sell your own stock high and buy low, that's how day trading works. It's also risky as shit because stocks in short periods of time are volatile. That's why holding for long terms is the recommended practice.


These are good questions and I've run out of answers.

they will file it under civil forfeiture and tell you to go fuck yourself. police departments have a lot of practice with straight up taking people's shit.

I mean, you can say it but it doesn't inherently make it true.
As long as bitcoin's value comes as an investment, instead of steady use *as currency*, then we have seen this before. It's a stock, and unless the direction bitcoin's adoption is taking severely changes, it is following a pattern.

You gotta ask questions so I can figure out which bit you are finding confusing.

Not everything is uncertain. History repeats itself. You simply need to see the pattern.

It's not entirely free, you pay a fee to whoever you are borrowing from. But the fee normally doesn't matter if you make enough of a profit. Like in my example if the fee was $5, I'd still have a $20 profit.

It took me fucking forever to understand shorting and it's because none of it is intuitive. 
Let's say you own 1 stock, it is worth $100 currently. I want to short it. 
I "borrow" your stock, and I sell it to a 3rd person. Now I have $100, and you have 0 stock. I still owe you a stock, because it is only borrowed.
The stock price drops, down to $75. I buy it back, and I give it back to you. I now have $25, you have your stock, and nothing of value was made.

Especially those that got in early (or early-ish) and didn't lose their bitcoins or have them stolen.
