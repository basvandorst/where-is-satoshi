You don't understand that your country Imports a wildly disproportionate amount of Middle Eastern immigrants compared to the US? And that they are sexually assaulting your women in huge numbers?    
You know that just refusing to talk about something doesn't mean that it's not real, right?     
You Cucks over there in Germany really think you have anything to brag about?     
Oh please! Whatever you do don't down vote me!

Ok then.   
Were numerous women raped and sexually assaulted or not? And that is a yes or no question. I mean you say that it was blown out of proportion, what does that mean?    
I can't Envision the time ever where it would be appropriate to say that women being raped and assaulted is just being "blown out of proportion" but for some reason you have no problem saying that in this instance because "immigrants"?    
I'm not asking you to have some great Revelation and realize that Common Sense wins out here, clearly that's never going to happen for you. But if you could at least acknowledge your insane moral failings, That would be great.

I get that you are just consumed with political correctness over there in Germany but either the 24 women who claim to be raped are liars and the dozens of women who were attacked sexually are liars or what?    
Fascinating the way you can just deny reality for fear of being called an islamophobe or whatever. You're out of touch with reality you don't even comprehend it. Absolutely fucking fascinating.

Jesus when is this issue going to die? Basic income only works if you  can wildly ignore how numbers work. But please, downvote and tell me more about how a nation already more than 20 trillion dollars in debt can become solvent Again by giving away free fucking money to everybody?

How is that not exactly what the welfare state was / is?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:37:23


Except there's zero proof of this? And the little problem of decreasing spending by increasing spending?     


It hasn't worked with the welfare state. We know this through things like tracking illegitimacy rates and violent crime numbers.     
Your feelings on the matter just don't apply to reality...

And vegene plz.

This is absolutely true if you completely ignore the fact that numbers are a thing

Is it a 1 for 1 thing? As in, If I have 1.22 BTC, I will also have 1.22 BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:50:12
Well no shit. But whatever the answer is, It sure as hell isn't shoveling "free" money at people.

Lead reporter for Vox here. We would love to sit down and talk with you about how Bitcoin is racist.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:19:55
No I'm pretty sure it's called bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:30:02


Why is this obvious? At least in the US, unemployment is something like 4.1%? And what's the definition of a "good" job? The us enjoys a wildly High quality of life. I swear you people read one article about automation just become fanatics, no different than climate change or whatever the latest left-wing craze is.

I have had a small amount of Bitcoin on my Bitcoin client wallet for years. Where do I find this Bitcoin cash that I supposedly have?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:44:24


I guess I will have to watch a video on this? I know how to transfer Bitcoin, if I just transfer my Bitcoin will it turn into Bitcoin cash? This is so confusing.
