That is true and a good point.  However, I guess my question is, why would they ban me over that comment?  My account is almost a year old with 100+ trades and 100% rating.  That was my first ever dipsute, so its not like I ever bugged them or was a problem maker.  I just dont understand I guess and am trying to better understand their decision.

I bet you are a bundle of joy to be around.  Why is my post bothering you so much?  You seriously need to get checked by a doctor man.  Seems to be some chemical imbalance going on upstairs.  It amazes me someone could get this upset on Reddit.  Miserable, miserable life you live.  This type of reaction is why I minored in psychology.  Fascinating.

Geez...  Thanks for the info

Not to mention I should have won the dispute. I am not going to even go there or touch on that.  I am sure every loser may say something similar, but I gave the seller a legit itunes card claim code and he claimed it and denied it in the dispute.  I learned the lesson of not letting newbies earn my business a crazy hard way.

Thank you.  I guess I have no choice.  I guess I will never get an answer to why I was banned anyways.  Just seems very odd.

Please only provide suggestions.  This guy PM's me saying he will buy it for $95.  I say ok, send me $45 up front and then I will send you the code and then you send the other $50.  Seems about the only half way fair route, huh?  Nope the guy gets mad and says he is not an idiot, blah blah blah and that I need to send the card first.  Man, do the scams ever end???  I am so sick and tired of these lazy theifs man.  You can't get away from them.

Why are you even commenting on this?  If you have nothing useful to say, please just troll elsewhere.  This post was to basically see how many people have experienced similar things and could provide anything useful to me.  I have reached out in many different forms and have not received a response.  Facebook, twitter, reddit, LBC support ticket, etc...  Troll somewhere else and quit rubbing your miserable existence off on us.  Trust me, I have exhausted all options before asking for help.  Eff off.

Lol, I said it in passing.  You are legit pissed about stuff.  Why is that?  Can we get to the underlying, real, problem?  How was your upbringing?  Anything odd in your opinion?  Did you witness a specific incident that made you the way you are?  Talk to me.

I wasnt a smart ass.  I just asked them why they ruled in favor of the seller.  THat is literally the only thing I have said since the dispute and boom, i was banned.  I did not even try to hint that I was pissed at them b/c I have heard similar things, like my account being blocked, happen to other people over something even smaller.  Look my account up if you want... I have 100+ trades, 100% rating and that is literally the only dispute I have been in.  That is why the ban is an absolute shocker to me and coming from left field.  I honestly can't understand why.
