To be fair, and you might be a great guy, but there's probably people WAY more important than you who also got the same response.

So true.  Until we get those robot senators...

Unfortunetely, government is just a word that means powerful people.

Most definitely.  Never actually encountered it myself, but we were always on the lookout.

Nobody can shutdown bitcoin, so don't actually be worried.
It makes for some interesting stories for people who don't closely follow bitcoins or who aren't investors.

Perception is reality.  It doesn't matter who the people in the government are, they weild a lot of power regardless.

Having worked retail banking, this is not always cut and dry.  Banks dont hold nearly enough money to let everyone do this.
Most people can easily walk up to a bank for 5k.  Most can do it for more than that.  They prefer notice so they know to restock a little more cash if everyone is doing big withdrawls that week.  Generally, we only turned down people who werent doing this regularly and only when it exceeded 10-15k.  Also, most people dont realize cashier's checks are way better, and most are talked into doing so.
If you want more than 10k, you will need to fill out a form that is sent to the government with all of your personal info, where you work, what you do for a living, and which accounts the money is coming from.  iIRC, you dont need to say why youre withdrawling.
EDIT: the limit is only daily.  The government generally is not notified if you withdrawl 5k a couple days a week, unless youre under suspicion for trying to avoid the report sent to them for taking 10k+ a day.

Government isn't a bad word.  The people in power today are bad.  They could be good, and they'd still be called government.  It's just a word.

Exposing your company to Litecoins exposes you to an additional billion dollars, and your support would only make Litecoins stronger.
I can see if it were difficult to implement.  But really, why not?
