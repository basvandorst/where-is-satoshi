Thank you!

Lived up to username. Thank you.

Seems legit!
@_date: 2016-04-28 23:27:32
Cool, I gotta try this out!
@_date: 2016-04-03 13:32:27
They're still on social media tho 
I don't see how u say they completely closed down. Their website is up still too. Any proof?

By keeping blocks small, it's accommodating miners in China which is supplementing centralization. 
In order to actually decentralize further, raising the blocksize would bring more miners to an advantage outside of China creating more of an equal playing field and more decentralization.

A good wallet that you can buy btc with is one that rhymes with Loinbase but starts with a C. Good luck! May the force be with you.

All Cody said when asked about Amir is "he's alive I guess."  That's it. But he later was talking about lead dev Pablo Martin who is "missing" possibly due to "foul play."

Good report. I don't see why we can't up the block limit and keep decentralization. Even at 2mb plus segregated witness it's a win win.

Amazon would be the biggest deal!

I can already buy pretty much anything using Gyft
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:48:02
Nice job but we still need a bump to 2MB guys, make it happen!

I don't like GreenAddress that much, but BreadWallet is good. I've also used Bither which had a great UX. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:27:30
Tell Ben Lawsky and the NYDFS that :-)

So maybe I'm being dense but if you say the data is still there being stored just in another file then block size really isn't changing right? SW just separates the witness data into another file? So the block size is smaller but the data file sizes of the blockchain remain the same?  
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:12:10
So forget the old non-upgraded nodes for a second then. For upgraded nodes that support segwit you say "In the raw data the witnesses are stored as part of the transaction data, so there is no physical separation between witnesses and non-witness data." So for upgraded nodes they still see the same 1MB of data throughput for segwit transactions? 
So are you saying that segwit only gives a block size "increase" to non-upgraded nodes? And upgraded nodes will still max out at 1MB of block size data? Still kind of confused on this. If there is an explainer out there that tells this part of how the block size is being increased I'd like to read it. 
From what I gather so far from what you are saying is that upgraded nodes still have all the same witness data (so no increase?) and non-upgraded nodes see an increase but only because they don't see the witness data which makes them not even able to process segwit transactions?

Eh, it's essentially the same thing :/

here are a few exchanges to use in the AU! 
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:04:40
I hope not, but new bitcoin subs are popping up all over the place. I guess my point is, there is always places to talk about Bitcoin, it's decentralized :)
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:47:45
maybe not *all* but certainly a chunk. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:32:53
not sure why people still use this place, when they are constantly screwing customers. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:27:34
ha, that's a great graphic. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:57:03
The Variety article doesn't say that's how they were tracked down. Anyhow, if they bought the Bitcoin from an exchange, likely the exchange had their information and worked with the agency and provided it to them. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:09:07
Yup, paid on Expedia and it worked great.

Lawsky, this you bro? ;)

Started from the bottom, now we here? :-)
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:17:35
lol riiight is anyone supposed to believe this? there is absolutely no remnants of an article published on the web with this title. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:06:36
I thought the same thing. Can it be moved? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:23:54
I just talked to Donald Trump, he said if he becomes President he will make Bitcoin the official currency of his hair. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:04:04
It seems to be working out well tho, did you check it out? :-)
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:46:28
Gemini, Circle, or Coinbase  
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:25:55
No doubt, maybe they can upgrade it after a bit! ;-)
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:09:03
Same problem here! I don't think you can tho, unless anyone else has ideas?

You had me until you threw in the whole illuminati twist. Kind of silly to add that in and have people take it seriously. Upvoted though because more people need to understand a blockchain isn't immutable without a token to incentivize miners to secure it.

Thanks for confirming.

Congrats Roger!
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:19:52
Is there an EIL5 version of this? Sorry my technical knowledge doesn't appear up to par to understand. I thought you needed miners to mine the blocks, thus "stacking" them in the "chain" so they are secured. How do "federated keys" work? I don't understand that part. Feel free to link me to something that explains that part (yes I could google but maybe you know a better resource?). Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:01:45
Maybe their building up a fake network of profiles and comments. Then later will switch them over for a certain company. Would be good to save these profiles and come back to them in six months and see if they've changed.
