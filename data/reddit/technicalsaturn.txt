You can do similar things with other currencies.  It's a free market; people should be allowed to buy and sell bitcoin as they wish.

I don't know if China's central bank is trusted enough to pull it off; they are already accused of currency manipulation all the time.  I think people would be wary of adopting it.
Maybe Europe could though.  If you thought that this type of currency would be increasingly important over time, maybe tie it to the Euro now.  The Euro is way less important than the dollar and losing ground to other currencies I believe, but if it were tied to the leading cryptocurrency, maybe that would it increase its importance.

If China's central bank endorsed a competitor or the ECB or FED created their own crypto-currency with some sort of convertibility to regular currency, I think bitcoin would fall to almost 0 overnight.  Bitcoin still has significant value because it is still the obvious market leader.  All of these currencies are getting hammered, but bitcoin is still the best known and most capitalized.  When a substantially better currency is invented or if substantial flaws are discovered in bitcoin, I do not think bitcoin will be able to sustain a price over $100.

Couldn't bitcoin's features be easily copied?  I am not that knowledgeable; is there something that differentiates bitcoin from its competitors other than the fact it has been around longer?

You say that now, but I think anything that would drive the price down that far would be so catastrophic that no real investor would want anything to do with them anymore.
I can't imagine bitcoin hitting $10 unless some  competitor was very widely adopted (i.e. massive market cap, guaranteed convertibility to some other currency, internationally required to be legal in all countries, etc.) or some security flaw was discovered in bitcoin. Maybe if the US or EU decided to ban them as well.  In any event, any of these things would prevent me from investing at all, even at an extremely low price.
If an investment bank has done the research and won't invest at $10, it is a pretty good bet that bitcoin has a fair bit farther to fall in the near future.
