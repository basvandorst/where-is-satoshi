I don't exactly know, but there is a history to egg prices. Eggs don't cost $100 each, I can be sure of.

We don't actually _know_. But it hasn't been changing much day to day, and we know what we paid for a pizza yesterday so it should most likely cost the same today.
In the case of a fiat crash, BTC would increase in value and would have no fiat unit of account -- we would have no idea what its value is in this case.

The person not getting it is you.
To put it very simply:
I live in NYC where a pizza costs $10. I can also pay the $10 equivalent in BTC for the pizza, automatically calculated at the time of purchase.
The next day, the USD loses all of its value; nobody uses it anymore. I got to buy a pizza with my BTC. How many BTC should the pizza seller charge for the pizza now?

Yep, that's my point: that bitcoin is reliant on another currency or measure of value (unit of account) for its practical use. Whether it's gold or USD, it's not usable on it own. The fiat currencies on the other hand, are.
What would it take for BTC to not be reliant on another unit of account? 
Could a digital currency "organically" become the world's or a nation's currency simply because it had a high rate of adaption or would it need state sanctioning for this to happen?

He has the best CV possible and a strong brand so it's very possible if he decides to go down that road.

Is the author new to the media business? Obviously paid coverage isn't okay, it's just that it's been like this for _decades_ and the established media is even worse. 
This is ELLE:


There are almost no media companies left today, and no journalism whatsoever. They're all advertising companies: they sell attention space, which is why news is so incredibly sensationalized. More clicks mean more ad revenue. And of course, none of them will risk upsetting advertisers, alas all coverage is bought and paid for.
In tech, you have similar practices with Vox Media (The Verge, Vox.com etc.) who regularly post sponsored content.
To clarify, it's a great dig, but the moral indignation and singling out bitcoin sites as if they were the only ones that did this ruins it.

Awesome! Digging the design of the mens' model. Any chance you'll start offering the same model with a heavier sole?

It's obvious because that's what I said in my previous post: *become the world's or a nation's currency:*.

You're right, it's unlikely that the USD or another currency would just disappear over night. And slowly, the part of the population using BTC would increase until a point where it may become the main currency.
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:01:42
Exactly my point. BTC is reliant on a second currency as a unit of account to be useable.
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:50:35
Yes, but my point is that there would be a transitional period during which BTC prices would not yet have been fixed. How do I know how to price my eggs in BTC without using another unit of account?

If what you say is correct, then that would also mean that Warren Buffett sees buying shares in his Berkshire Hathaway not as an investment but as speculation, as BH does not pay dividends. Obviously, this is incorrect. 
I could add that the man who wrote Buffett's playbook, Henry Singleton, also did not pay dividends on the shares of the company he founded, Teledyne.

Execution has no value if not backed by ideas. Neither does capital.
