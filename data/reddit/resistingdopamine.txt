Bitcoin is under a massive coordinated FUD attack right now, all media and radio.  I suspect I know who is funding this and I hope they continue to eat a shit sandwich.

Ver is literally paying news outlets to interview him so he can trash Bitcoin.  The singular method of their attacks are to change Bitcoin's name to "Bitcoin Core".

You mean "dump btc for alts", at least that's the future I now see.

It's going to change everything.  Just HODL.

I'm ramping up for my own mining labs forking off BCC in 2 weeks.  For those who were lucky enough to obtain BCC you will get free BCEC (Bitcoin Extra Cash).  Two weeks after BCEC I will be forking to BCEAC (Bitcoin Extra Additional Cash).  We will then auto fork every 2 weeks until 2020 ending the final fork with BCMBF (Bitcoin McBit Face).  Owning 1 BCC and riding it until we hit BCMBF in 2020 will net you over 50 million dollars.  More soon.

I was under the Bitcoin spell for years, was there nearly at the beginning.  This year I finally accepted that Bitcoin introduced us to the blockchain, and that does not mean much if it can't truly achieve all that the blockchain offers.  Just because Bitcoin was first, does not make it holy or make me a devout subject.  What was I doing?? I'm probably going to be downvoted, but I began to see the true promise of the blockchain in Ethereum.  But wait you say, they are not in competition, both serve a purpose, do not turn your back on us you traitor, you sinner! You are somewhat right, they are not in competition because Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can do, it can do it better, faster cheaper x 1,000's of additional use cases.  I transferred my entire BTC stack to ETH and will never look back, and I haven't been this excited in years at what this "World Computer" will accomplish.  Crack the smelling salts and wake up, before it's too late.

You dumped at $1800 and want it to go back down so are posting wild speculative FUD.  Condolences.

Convert BTC to an ERC20 token, honor BTC conversion and be done with this.  A bloodbath is coming for BTC, if you can't see this you need to put down the crack pipe.

Convert BTC to ERC20 token, problem solved.
