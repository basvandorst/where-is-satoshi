Very nice that BTC was able to help, but don't forget that surgeon(s) actually did the work/saving.

This doesn't make any sense.

Method of barter exchange.. I might not accept a gaming console as payment for debt or services, but some might and others not, like the US gov't.

It's both because something virtual is not tangible, can I physically hold a Bitcoin outside of its digital container?

Actually it is not a real currency by the legal/social majority standards; as it has not been sponsored/accepted by governments as legal tender, nor has all of society accepted it as such. I am unable to purchase milk at my local grocery (currently, maybe in the future, yes) with it, so it has not been accepted as currency by the majority. The U.S. government doesn't recognize it as legal tender, e.g. I can't pay my taxes with it. But many would accept straight gold as payment to debts owed, a tangible thing that can be held and has (pseudo) intrinsic value.

worth has no limit, it is all in the valve of which it can be sold. meaning, everything is basically worthless and priceless at the same time, and is only valued at what you can sell it for no matter the worth.
