I also worked on DMT with some other developers in my company.  I worked with Orlin years earlier on a trading/risk mgmt platform with a company he co-founded.  I recall Orlin flew me down to Costa Rica to meet the team, everyone was using code names like haxaw, tom mix, neon, and the like.  My team started using names from Reservoir Dogs, e.g. mr. black, mr. white, etc.  
My team was working on a web-based portal to DMT, as opposed to the downloadable executable -- trading off convenience for some security where your private keys were held on the DMT servers if you used the web portal vs. on your own iron.  
I wasn't involved with DMT for long, we just got the web portal working and moved on.  I did use it as part of testing to execute some transactions.  I heard that after 9/11, LFC and DMT were under scrutiny because it could be used to move terrorist money.  Not sure about that, though.  
LFC and DMT were all about privacy and security.  Orlin was trying to build the infrastructure for a totally anonymous and encrypted ecosystem, supporting a like economy.  The plan was to build banking, credit, stock markets, etc.  Everything needed to support a modern economic system, but with security and privacy designed into it.
It seems the non-centralized nature of BTC and blockchain technology in general was the next step in the evolution of DMT.  I like to think that Orlin was involved with BTC and blockchain, but I'm not certain.  Perhaps he had some influence, or had discussions with some of the folks originating BTC.  Maybe Orlin is Satoshi.  I guess, anything's possible. 
I'd like to reconnect with some of the folks I worked with and met in Costa Rica.  Especially haxaw.  If you get this, please message me.
