I wasn't going to sign in, but then I had to just so I could upvote this.

General article. However, he'd like to make it relevant to the community. I believe he submitted it today, and I got too busy yesterday to check back here. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:41:31
Man, I love this community. "Oh, something bad happened to you and it's bitcoin related? Here. Have a bunch of money."
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:45:45
Sealswithclubs.eu is the reason I bought my first bitcoin. Back when $33/BTC was "ABSOLUTELY UNSUBSTAINABLE".

+all verify

If you use coinbase, and buy the btc right now, in five days you'll get it for the price it is now.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:35:58
Is this a joke?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:52:19
I did it. You need more bank options!
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:36:11
I have a lot of tattoos, but none on my back. I actually really like where it is. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:46:19
If it hits $100,000, I'll get my face tattooed. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:50:53
You got it!
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:25:03
Giving them a little is typically a good way to peak their interest. You don't even have to give him that much, though. Maybe like .01 btc. I really like showing people how to send money through scanning their QR code, they feel like their in the future and get hooked!
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:51:38
You're just saying that because of his gold chain.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:20:58
$3,000 at $200. 300% gain in one month. He actually said today, "I need to take more money out of my pension, because it's not making me shit."
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:23:10
I agree. I need more back tattoos, and it's going to be a little difficult to correlate with that tiny little "to the moon" piece. I'll figure out something though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:17:13
Yeah, I actually begged him not to tattoo any of those zits. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:44:45
Also, TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:23:44
THANK YOU! This is my first bitcoin tip on reddit! I feel so good I just want to tip it right back.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:13:20
I saw something similar to this a month ago or so, however the stakes were $10,000 USD. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:04:12
AN NSX IS MY DREAM CAR, and buying one with bitcoin just became my new dream.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:49:44
I was worried when I did this the first time as well, and then they asked for the answers to my security questions. I've been using Coinbase for months with no issues, though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:36:06
I would definitely donate to a tattooed QR code. I'm kind of mad that I got the moon thing instead of my QR code now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:57:33
Thanks man. I always remember one thing before I post on reddit, haters are going to hate!
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:37:00
It just hit me that you're (probably) going to have a much larger player pool, given that if I play with BTC, I could sit at a table with someone playing with USD. As soon as you guys get Mac support, I'm definitely going to try this out.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:59:12
You got it. I actually had the worst run of my life the week after I got it. Haha. Let's hope this bitcoin tattoo doesn't give me the same bad luck. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:58:58
You're absolutely right. We're a very cynical civilization. "If you can't understand something, then it's best to be afraid." 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:35:44
I'd call him up and ask him to meet you at the closest pub. You guys did just land on the moon together.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:11:20
I am from the US, and the entire reason I found out about bitcoin was because I wanted to play online poker. I play on SealswithClubs fairly regularly, and have been doing so for about a year. What incentives do you intend to offer that would draw me away from a site that already works perfectly for me?
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:52:06
Just a little farther south. Carbondale, IL.
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:08:38
All of this is great. I don't have the kind of money to just shovel out $5 every time I mention bitcoin though. I guess I could start tipping bartenders and waiters in bitcoin. 
Also, this is a very "mom and pop" market when it comes to restaurants, it's not too far off to hope I could talk someone into accepting bitcoin, let's just hope I'm not the only one paying them. Thanks everyone!

I bought more at 570, thinking, "No way will it fall under this price". It fell to 350 in five minutes. Oh, hindsight.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:01:47
I know, my dad's a pretty funny dude. I'm pretty sure he was being just that.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:25:21
I was hoping to get the tattoo! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:52:28
Twenty-two. And thanks. I knew there'd be some negative responses.
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:33:27
I have a lot tattoos, and a lot of them I got on a whim. Some of them are funny. I play poker, and I have the worst starting hand in texas hold'em tattooed on my leg. I have a piece of pizza on my other leg. I got the number 13 tattooed on me for $13 on Friday the 13th. This tattoo actually kind of means something to me, though. My father and I have gotten really close in the past few years, and bitcoin has actually helped us bond even more. And now, even if bitcoin crashes or we all become millionaires, we're both going to love that tattoo the same. 
So yeah, I'll always be stuck with a reminder; that we share the same blood.
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:31:08
I love bitcoin, I love game theory, I love Stanley Kubrick, and I love this thought. Sorry for not being constructive; I'm just in awe that you just combined three of my favorite subjects in one post. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:55:00
I have got to start looking at the web address before I click these coinion links. Every time I think to myself, "What? No way someone is that stupid... Oh, coinion! You got me again."
