Careful!  Bitcoin is a super cool technology (I write about it for a living), but it is super volatile right now, and we'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that nobody knows what the value will be in a year's time.  It does seem to be stabilizing (variance over time is declining), but it could go down significantly before it hits equilibrium.  Definitely don't spend more money than you can afford.  Caveat Emptor and all that.

Sure thing!  It's a super cool topic.  There's a lot of weird technical problems they have that nobody else does, and the possible solutions are super interesting.  I don't think the odds of it working are good, but I also don't think they're small enough that it's a bad idea.

That's simply not true.  
We've successfully [cryopreserved a rabbit kidney]( and then warmed it up and implanted it as a rabbit's sole functioning kidney, where it continued to work for months.  The technology will likely be used to keep human organs viable longer once it makes it through the FDA.
Pigs and dogs have been [suspended]( clinically dead, for hours at near-freezing temperatures, and then revived without damage.  It's worked so well that they're using it on gunshot victims now.  
Human embryos are routinely stored in liquid nitrogen without ill effect.  A number of species, including frogs and some fish, routinely freeze solid through the winter and warm up the following spring without incident.  The cryoprotectants used by Alcor are based on the same sugar-based anti-freeze that the frogs use. 
Granted we've never gotten a mouse down to LN2 temperatures and brought it back alive, but we have plenty of proofs of the principle, and it wouldn't surprise me if we made that leap in the next twenty years.  
Anyone preserved with current technology is pretty much banking on future technology being good enough to repair the damage that does happen -- which is a gamble, but doesn't seem particularly unreasonable.

They're very relevant!  We've shown that we can vitrify a living organ, perfused with anti-freeze, down to LN2 temperatures, and bring it back alive.  We know exactly why we can't do that with whole organisms (thermal micro-shearing), and it looks like the kind of damage that is, A, preventable with more research, and, B, likely to be repairable with future technology.  That's a really good argument that cryonics is viable.

Yes, but I don't recommend speculating on Bitcoin in that way.  Most people just aren't very good at it, and inexpert speculation contributes to the instability of Bitcoin.  Buy Bitcoin to spend it, not to try to play the market.  
If you want to try to use Bitcoin to make money, a better strategy is to learn to program and build a cool wallet or an app or something else that genuinely adds value to the burgeoning Bitcoin economy.  Bitcoin is kind of a wild west at the moment, and there's a lot of low-hanging fruit to exploit, even without any startup capital.

The world is a compromise, true.  If, however, you find yourself compromising at 50:1 with things you find morally despicable, odds are pretty good someone's got you over a barrel.  
Not all governmental structures are created equal, and the one in the US appears to be steadily and entirely failing to do anything useful, and has been for a while.  Most people subject to the government's rules don't like them very much, but game theory and a desperate, gnawing fear of their opposite number in the opposing party prevent them trying to change anything even with the tiny, tiny amount of influence their vote gives them.  
You'll notice that I'm not advocating a revolution.  I'm not suggesting we kill anybody.

The reason for that is actually super interesting: it turns out that most neurons stay alive for a few hours at room temperature.  The issue is that, after a few minutes with no oxygen, if oxygen is suddenly reintroduced, exposing the ischemic cells to oxygen suddenly triggers apoptosis (cell suicide).  That's why for a long time we thought that five minutes was the limit.  In fact, if you do artificial respiration and slowly wean the body back onto oxygen, you see a lot less brain damage.  
You can push that out a lot farther by keeping the brain cold, which slows down the process of damage accumulation (hence the frozen lake thing).  Furthermore, even at the point that the cells aren't metabolically viable (they've been ischemically damaged beyond repair), the synapses themselves can take up a day to start to fall apart, and with *very* advanced future technology, it may still be possible to recover the information, even if the original hardware is trashed.

So, investments in a deflationary economy are interesting, because invested money should continue to earn buying-power returns.  There's no real reason to hoard a currency and earn 4.5%, when you could invest it, and earn that 4.5% times whatever your ROI is.  The idea of people hoarding currency instead of investing it doesn't actually make much sense when you think about it (I've updated the article to talk about this in more detail).  That said, I'd suspect that for most consumers it wouldn't impact investment behavior much, as said behavior was already non-rational.        


It depends on how optimistic you are about future economic growth.  If you're [Robin Hanson]( and expect robot economies to produce economic doubling times of months or weeks, then maybe you should be more concerned about Bitcoin, as the deflationary effects in that sort of economy are going to be a good deal stronger.  


Not necessarily.  If you're a business and you want to hire a new employee, presumably you're losing money by not hiring them (otherwise you wouldn't want to).  The money that you're losing by holding out is deflating at the same rate as the money that you're refusing to spend on them.  It's the same situation as the hypothetical investor.  
As far as a dual currency economy goes, that gets really complicated really fast.  If you have some nominal prices set in an inflationary currency, and some nominal prices set in a deflationary one, it all gets a bit messy.  I'll think about it.

Bitcoin has enough problems with scammers without the community tolerating obvious ones.  We need to get mad when this kind of thing happens, and we need to do something about it.

You don't know what you're talking about.  Since it actually is my job to educate you, let's sit down and have a lesson on blockchain DNS schemes (Jesus Christ, I should be asleep).
Obviously, a DNS lookup shouldn't require making a transaction (as you imply).  That would be ridiculous.  Instead, you'd add a protocol (potentially on top of an existing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) that basically says the following: we all agree that transactions with certain formatting, which destroy a certain quantity of the currency, will be taken to register a domain, and connect it to some arbitrary string of information, like a private key, URL, Bitcoin address, etc.  From there, we also allow certain other transactions, from the same private key, to transfer control of that domain to another wallet.  You'd probably want to add regular (small) maintenance dues to make mass domain squatting / permanent domain destruction impractical.  These special transactions are all preserved in the block chain.  Anyone can find them by just going through the chain and parsing them into a rapidly accessible data structure like a hash table.  
From there, anyone running a full node can resolve their own domain name requests (or provide DNS services for users who can't practically maintain a full node (for example, mobile users)).  This would provide DNS services that are similarly fast to what we have today for lookups, and are generally decentralized and resilient to external attack, at the expense of having to store several gigabytes of data to access the web (and there are ways of reducing this expense, both for cryptocurrencies in general, and, more so, for this application in particular).

That's mostly not true.  Right now, we're good enough at vitrifying tissue that we can thaw it out alive pretty reliably.  We've vitrified rabbit organs and successfully warmed them up and implanted them.  We know that histological brain structure is extremely well preserved in best-case cryopreservation using modern cryoprotectants  
Thermal shearing is an issue, but I don't think it's unlikely that we'll find a way to repair the damage at some point in the coming century.  We aren't shooting blindly from the hip.  There's a lot of science that goes into trying to cause as little brain damage as possible during the vitrification process.

Stability is good, regardless of price.  If I could have Bitcoin crash to $20 and stay there (with less instability than USD), I'd do it in a second.  Price gains based on the speculation of day traders (without actual commerce to back them) are inherently unreliable, and cause the wild fluctuations that make Bitcoin useless as a store of value.  A stable price for a long time is going to be a necessary foundation on which to build a useable, closed-loop Bitcoin economy (one that will, in turn, fuel slow, sustainable price growth).

As far as I know, none of the best candidates for post-quantum cryptography are particularly mature or well-vetted.  Implementing them requires further study and implementation time.  On top of that, migrating over to the new scheme will be tricky, as you'll need to implement more than one kind of wallet in the Bitcoin network and allow transactions between them.

Let's be clear here: bitcoin IS a bubble: there is nowhere near enough legitimate trade to justify its current value.  The value is inflated (and made unstable) by inexpert speculation.  We won't see very much real growth until the speculation dries up and its value stabilizes enough to be useful as a real currency. 
That said, Paul Krugman is an embarrassing human being with a long, long history of being badly wrong about both economics and technology, so him commenting on the intersection of that Venn diagram is amusing to me.
What's more interesting is the article by Stross that he links to.  I respect Stross on a personal level, and it's harder to dismiss him as an idiot.  However, I do disagree with him pretty firmly here.  
Let's look at the points raised: first, that bitcoins are inherently deflationary: fair enough, I don't have an answer to that.  It's probably something that could be resolved in a future cryptocurrency protocol, though, perhaps by adjusting the difficulty algorithm of mining to compensate for some function of the number of 'lost' (long-term unused) bitcoins.  Beyond that, fiat currencies are inherently inflationary, and far less predictably so, which is just as bad, if not worse.    
Second, carbon footprint: okay, fair enough, but mining on consumer PCs really isn't profitable anymore.  It's a field rapidly dominated by dedicated hardware, which is much greener, and that'll only get more true as that arms race escalates.  
Third, bitcoin miners are distributed as malware.  First, this is getting less true fast, as it becomes less profitable to do so.  Also, there's been malware for a decade that uses spare computing power to crack credit card hashes.  What's your point?
Fourth, the Gresham's law thing: this will only hold up for as long as its more profitable to mine bitcoins than crack credit card hashes.  Which won't be long at the rate that dedicated mining hardware is advancing.
Fifth: people will do bad things with bitcoins.  As you may have noticed, people do bad things with cash.  As it turns out, committing crimes like abusing children and killing people leaves evidence that can be made useful by (gasp) police work.  Also, ask me how much I care about people buying drugs safely and anonymously via the internet.  Because I can tell you right now, it isn't very much. 
His last point is that bitcoins make it hard to collect taxes or monitor the citizenry.  I put to you that, A, there will always be institutions that cannot easily conceal their income, at least enough to ensure a basic level of government operation (the American government once maintained law and order and civil defense with less than ten percent of its current income), and, B, if the world has a problem right now, it is NOT that governments have insufficient powers of taxation and surveillance.
