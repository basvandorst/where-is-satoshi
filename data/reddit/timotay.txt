As a foreigner I can legally only send 500USD per day internationally. Chinese locals have a 50kUSD per year limit. Bitcoin can obviously bypass these limits
I think the simple question is Can the government control bitcoin in it's current form?
why would they ban it? They ban anything they can't control. youtube, dropbox, journalists even Chinese billionaires get detained regularly.
why hasn't it been banned already? I believe they see bitcoin as an investment not a method of funds transfer, they have already banned its use for real world purchases. Once there is wind of it being a way to leak money out of the country I personally believe it will be shutdown or at minimum exchanges must retain all bitcoin.

yeah I think I jumped the gun a little, because we were talking on wechat and then I got a fraud warning from wechat saying this user isn't to be trusted.
Then I checked the confirmations and it's stuck on zero and they have zero funds left in their BTC wallet.
fingers crossed tho,
thanks for your reply

yes QQ-coin

the biggest issue is China banning it
which I personally believe they will. The government is not aware, how much money is leaving the country via bitcoin and as soon as news breaks hundreds of millions is leaving China in bitcoin there will be problems.
They also banned Q-coin in a similar fashion in 2007 once it became too big and gave everyone 1 month to get out before it shut down.

stopped reading when she said bitcoin can't be traced

I think people should be worried about  this if the liabilitty moves away from merchant.
Right now the merchant takes responsibility for bitcoin and the risk.  If you sell bitcoin to someone and they do a charge back you get fucked, which is good. It means stolen credit cards can't be used to buy decentralized non-reversible assets without seller carrying the risk. This is how we want it, or a catalyst to ban it with a legitimate reason is formed.

do you think the last 7 hours have changed that 2900 given the market is a little more optimistic than expected? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:16:53
I think the issue most people have, is they don't sit and just look at the numbers all day, 
everyone is a manipulator, it's just learning how to spot the flow

seems like the reddit sub for bitfinex is now private?

feel bad for those lending to margin traders..
*I lend you 50% of a coin valued at 1000. 500 me / 500 you
* Price drops to 500, you run out of balance 
* auto-sell initiated to recoup for lender
* only coin available is $.2
* $.2 returned to the lender instead of 500
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:37:31
I'm not sure if you are aware that the people lending money, also lost out big if not bigger.  They only get back what the coins sold for.
* regardless. I wasn't suggesting there should or shouldn't be a bailout
* If something is being used to only cause malice or used in a way that wasn't intended it should be fixed or improved. 
The question: Should entities be able to close an order book for a microsecond to be able to rebuy orders that were force closed in a malicious way. 
I think it's pretty simple to see the rational answer here. If you're answer is still yes. I don't really see how it has a bigger benefit on the bitcoin ecosystem, short-term or long-term. 
* or how we couldn't achieve this without maintaining the same ideology.
P.S I still haven't worked out reddit formatting o_o

I think they go hand in hand really
you want a decentralized system that allows full control of funds that plugs into a centralized one when you need authority/regulation/functionality etc.
So I don't see a problem with the current model, I think you will see a client plugin that allows conversion of crypt -&gt; wechat client side to pay.

I think there should be a limit on what percentage the price can change per minute. For example 10% per minute (additional orders are queued). 
or any account that buys can not sell within 1 minute and vise versa.
You need mechanisms that impose restrictions on extreme profitable behavior.
In China a stock can only move a maximum of 10% per day and you cannot sell a stock that you bought the same day.

 I don't think this really reflects the situation at hand;
* wechat pay has become gigantic. Most people outside China have very little knowledge on just how big wechat pay / alipay are. They are the future China-gov wants because they are regulated and centralized and mass adopted.  
* I buy vegetables from a girl on the side of the street and she has an A4 sized QR code you scan and send her funds. ** In the last 6 months; I have not met an individual from taxi drivers, restaurants, couriers who didn't accept wechat pay..  ** I've even seen a beggar with a QR code, who was trying to get home to her family in a different city.
* The point is the land grab for a mass-centralized crypto currency is over IMO and this idea they are "testing" means the author knowns very little about the current situation in my opinion.
QQ COINS came about over a decade ago as the first big virtual currency. It got so big you could buy them on mobile phone and once people started integrating it for real items the government shut it down.
* Enter Q coin 2.0 .....  virtual currency with bank / government oversight.
---- &gt; Wechat Pay 
* if you want to see where China was at with virtual currency and coins in 2007 have a read

we have different opinions on what is malice then if you think forcing someone to sell their coin at $0.2 which was worth $400(don't know exact number) 1 minute earlier so you can buy it and it's back worth $400 1 minute after.
it's legal stealing
I fully agree that you should optimize yourself for the conditions/environment you are in, and the seller did that / arguably the holder didn't. But we also want the environment to prosper..
changing enemies heads to purple and centering purple to the middle of the screen was a great strategy to get headshots. Yet aimbots were a detriment to how most people wanted Counter-Strike to grow.

Somebody put in a 321 sell order above market rate, which froze everything up... wishing I had some cash on Stamp right now &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:14:27
I use it. Much better English interface now. Easy to deposit BTC, let me know if you have any other questions.
I guess the major risk is the price is highest so cashing out in BTC back to the UK might be more expensive
