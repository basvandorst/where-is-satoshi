Just want to add one more point I forgot to highlight in the post. 
As I've pointed out, the miner's sell pressure makes for inflation in bitcoin, above the inflation in fiat. This means that bitcoin is not a good "store of value" as it will decrease in price over time (after the price discovery that might take a couple of decades)

Another viewpoint, if you still don't believe bitcoin could be in a fractional reserve system. Maybe read how fractional reserves really started with gold. If it can happen with gold, why not bitcoin?

Why do you think that though? Is it because you think every channel incurs two transactions?
COnsider this -- a channel never needs to be closed. I fyou run out of btc in your channel, deposit fiat to a hub/sink which fills your channel again.
I think LN will make Btc amazingly scalable.

LN only designs transactions and checks for confirmations. There is nothing preventing centralized coin onto LN.
Even if it is actively blacklisted, layers 3 or layer 4 above LN will allow fractional reserve banking (Bitcoin becomes digital gold, LN coins become digital notes, layer 3 becomes digital banking system etc). It is the standard way bitcoin will get mainstream. Any recognition as a currency gives banks the permission to carry out fractional reserve banking.

I agree.

thanks for the praise. Looks like your enthusiasm isn't shared by others here. I am shocked of the lack of discussion. Maybe a 20k$ moon meme would be better appreciated in this toxic environment.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:47:31
Right on the topic. Looks like you are not up for a discussion, why? Did me posting something that disagrees with your beliefs hurt your fee-fees?

I personally believe bitcoin is revolutionary, but the current adoption is nowhere and the valuation is insane, so insane in fact that its reaching its peak potential.
I should take my ponzi scheme comment back, as I myself don't think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, but highlight that many of the current buyers will be saddled with heavy losses.

I like to think that I'm not totally out. I am just out temporarily expecting a crash within the next year. I cashed out at 17k so I don't have too much regrets till now. But if it doesn't go below 10k ever, I might stay out of bitcoin forever.
In any case, yes, bitcoin is deflationary right now and makes for a good store of value. But when it reaches a stable price in some years (5 you say?), it has that inflationary pressure of miners selling a few billions USD worth of btc per year (tens of billions if bitcoin is valued around 5T$). And that makes it a bad store of value, after all the inflationary pressure means your bitcoin are losing value each year. Currency at that stage then? But 5T$ would equate the world's M0 supply, surely that is an overvalued currency with no govt backing and really low usage.

XYZ bank rolls out their own coins pegged to Bitcoin's price. They are however centralized and are created by XYZ and not mined. So, XYZ will allow safe storage of bitcoins, and also give out loans in XYZCoins. 
Just your regular bank doing with bitcoin what they do with cash.

If you don't have anything meaningful to add, just post your downvote and leave. Not looking for trolls like you, but actual supporters of bitcoin who have put thought into it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:36:42
Thanks. Truthfully, a bit shocked by the responses here. 
I am surprised people don't see the rise of fractional reserve banking in cryptocurrencies. It is what made the modern financial system, and without it cryptocurrencies truly won't get mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:17:57
Do you have anything meaningful to add?
I shared my thoughts, and am willing to discuss actual critique. Not stupid comments about whether US gold reserves are adequate or not. Maybe they are not, what does it change about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:19:44
Finally some analysis I get to discuss. Ive seen that infographic. That's why I posted the rant about M2.
Most wealth in real estate, companies, derivates etc is not going to be realized in bitcoin (Well ethereum could do ICOs and successful companies, but I doubt the next Google/Apple/FB are coming out of Ethereum ICOs). 
You said 90T$ Money and 7.7T$ Gold. But that 90T$ (M3) money is only backed by 5T$ M0 Money, rest is built up on fractional reserves. Similarly, bitcoin's acceptance as currency will invariably lead to banks adopting fractional reserves -- which I believe will come as either new coins on LN or as new layers on LN.
With that belief I think you should take 10% of not 100T$ but (5+7.7)T$ ~ 1.27T$. This is pretty much what I did in my argument in the post.

My regular account would dox me.
US and Indian govt do maintain reserves, it is not explicit backing but an implicit backing that the govt is doing well and will not default on debts/Print money to pay off.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:32:52
So, when the price stabilizes and everyone comes selling it will be like a bank run? So, is bitcoin really working like a ponzi scheme?
I want to understand the mindset of people who believe in million dollar bitcoins, or those who are buying now. Bitcoin was more accepted in 2014 than it is now, and is merely reduced to a quick get rich scheme

Banks do the same thing to give out loans under fractional reserve banking.


Banks can advertise more, integrate more easily, give discounts etc to sellers, be FDIC insured etc and so on.


Maybe collatoral for a loan in bitcoin itself, maybe the bank runs several hubs and offers insurance/charge-backs etc. 
In any case, fractional reserve banking can arise as a separate layer on LN too. Acceptance as a currency will come conditional to fractional reserve banking, this is how the financial world works.
