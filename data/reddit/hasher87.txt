12 hours is way too long. Gyft has this features and it does this as instantly in receiving it

So are they gonna bring Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins?

I havent use Gyft yet, but from the looks of it, i could use some of my mined bitcoin to purchase stuff from Amazon.
Also, they have the best exchange rate as well!

Shame. This looks promising but the price for my local airlines is about 2x more than the normal price

Purchasing Playstation 4 using bitcoin/gyft/amazon would be my greatest achievement ever!
Why so? I only invested about 4btc and already i can get up to 12btc as of now. Enough to cover!

How exactly do we have to do to get the free bitquick debit card?
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:40:54
Legit as ever, though they can be that slow since they are doing it manually
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:14:51
Also, please use google wallet for the payment system. I'm not quite comfortable of entering my card details directly to your site
@_date: 2013-07-29 05:32:18
why not just use the web interface? Im outside USA yet i can still redeem Amazon USA gift card

i like that western union part. yes if your rep is there, i wouldn't mind using your service for that feature alone
@_date: 2013-07-29 13:47:38
Gyft, please give me the options to buy gift card from bodybuilding.com and colorware.com! I would definitely use your service more often :)

i hope this is as legit as it seems.
