HyperV on a Server 2016 box ;). Not NAT, this connects to a virtual switch that connects to a public DMZ LAN that only routes through, no NAT, on our security appliance. Only basic botnet/geo blocking enabled on the zone. I pass bitnodes.21.co and it connects, the connection bops up to 1-2 when I test it, then back to 0. Assumed its from my node not being fully sync'd yet but bitnode confirms its working.  
**EDIT** Realized it's getting a 5,000ms ping from a local system. Gave the system some more virtual CPU's... 100% CPU from doing initial sync was causing the VM to slow down too much and connections were sometimes timing out.

Yep! This is on a VM Host that runs 24/7 on a dedicated fiber line, so it will be up 24/7! The only issue is if it uses lots of bandwidth at once. If that's an issue I can shape traffic and QOS and lower it's priority a bit or limit it's bandwidth to something like 10-20mbit max.

Yes I do. Port 8333 TCP+UDP need to be allowed inbound. This device is not behind any sort of NAT whatsoever, it's in a DMZ zone on our security appliance and is only routed through it to get to our ISP. Iptables is set to only allow port 8333 UDP + TCP incoming through, all outbound. This is not a home or SOHO setup...  My system is still syncing, I still have over a years worth of blocks to grab before it will allow incoming connections as per I don't have the latest blocks.

Currently  reports "123.321.123.321:8333 /Satoshi:0.13.2/"

Oh I'm never keeping my balance on these ;). Already have a hardware wallet ;)

It's still syncing. I still got a years worth of blocks to go! 
The VM itself is directly connected to the internet, so there's no port forwarding and it's completely isolated from our internal LAN. I do have the local firewall set to only allow 8333 TCP and UDP inbound, no other ports.

Worked allowed me to use one of our spare IP's and severs with some spare VM host slots to run a full node. Now I have a local full node near me!

No need. This VM is directly connected to the internet. Just the local firewall on the system itself. It's set to only allow 8333 TCP + UDP inbound.

Meh. I like GUI's. The vmhost it's running on has 256gb+ of memory. I only allocated 4gb and it's hardly using over 1gb. I can easily allocate 16gb.

72 inbound connections and 600mb+ already sent just overnight since it became fully sync'd!
