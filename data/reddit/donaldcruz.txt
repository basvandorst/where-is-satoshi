$280 trillion is only $40k/person.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:59
This is only the beginning. There are only a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins!

Is Andreas going to cash out or hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:09
So should we put a global warming tax on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:14
So are you still hodling or did you sell everything?

Even at $3000 BTC market cap will only be $50 billion. Facebook's market cap is almost 10 times that and surely Bitcoin has more potential than Facebook. Bitcoin should be on its way to $30,000.

What about other cryptocurrencies? Is there a chance that they will eclipse Bitcoin?

The time to recovery is getting shorter and shorter. This means there's a massive amount of fiat on the sidelines just waiting to be converted into BTC.

Does this mean that some of the current DAPPS are going to be the next Googles and Amazons of the world? Which ones do you guys think will be most successful?

It's just healthy consolidation. We need to shed off some weak hands before the next leg higher.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:14
lol, we've been lifting off for weeks now.

Can Blockstream sue Jihan and Roger for attacking their business interests?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:52:17
You'll be richer than most people in a couple years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:52
Everyone HODL. Don't let $10k fail.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:40
Buy back. Set your stop to 9000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:09:20
What if I told you that a 10% rise every day *is stabilization*?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:52:30
I think that was the bottom. See this trend line: 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:44:57
$2000 was a big psychological number and it bounced right off. It's currently $100-200 above $2000 on most exchanges. Everyone on the sidelines was waiting for sub-$2000 prices to get in and they are rushing to get in now knowing they won't see $2000 ever again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:10:54
There are more possible lines, but we're already $300-$350 off the bottom so it would be pretty hard to go back down again.

With his parents' life savings and all the loans the banks will give him.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:30:25
Someone who put their life savings in Bitcoin at $2750 must be shitting their pants right now.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:25:48
The charts are showing that it's the bottom.
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:16:10
Yes, and $2.5k as well, possibly $3k. Strap yourself in, this rocket is going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:21:13
This fork is good for Bitcoin. Let's have forks more often!
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:48:18
It's already &gt; $200 off the bottom. I would say that that is the bottom.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:49:03
This is just a healthy pullback to shake out the weak hands. It'll be back to ATH at the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:31:46
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:18:19
No. Coinbase is a bigger POS.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:01:00
Buy half now and set an order for the other half lower. At least if it doesn't reach your order you will still at least have half your Bitcoins.
