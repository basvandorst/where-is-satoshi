Although I don’t quite understand the maths, interesting read. The tech is growing at an exponential rate. 
Their long term outlook seems promising.

It *seems* like the support level has been around $6000 or so. TA seems to work sometimes, but crypto is too volatile to get accurate price predictions — there’s so many factors.
Personally, I haven’t been as much focused on the price, rather the amazing teams and coders behind the coin. The Lightning Network — holy shit! Atomic swaps and instant payments off-chain? We’re living in an exciting time, and it’s just the beginning :) 
You’re doing the right thing by accumulating small amounts now. It *seems* like we’ve hit the bottom.

you’re doing God’s work.

Curious to know what’s happening - sounds a bit fishy to me.

Coinbase has a ‘Buy Bitcoin Instantly’ option. If you want your funds right away - make sure that option is on. The default is a bank transfer, which takes a couple days to clear.
Totally up to you on how you’d like to purchase, whether it be by bank or debit card.

Put it in a hardware wallet and forget about it for 5-10 years.
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:04:54
Did you send it from a hardware wallet, web/phone wallet, or an exchange?
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:16:22
how? just curious

Take a look at r/Monero if you’re looking for cheaper investments than BTC. They’re building their own dedicated Monero hardware wallet.. Think it’s still in development, but they’ve got a cool video [here.](

Could be a false bottom. Could drop lower. Could go higher. We’ll never know — so be careful and watch the market closely. Invest only as much as you’re willing to lose.

G’luck, friend! Hold on tight for the BTC rollercoaster. It’s gonna be a bumpy ride.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:45:54
Until another cryptocurrency surpasses Bitcoin in market cap and daily use, I think it’s safe to say Bitcoin is here to stay for a while. Every time I think that Bitcoin is dead, I like to check Bitlisten (bitlisten.com) where it harmonizes on-chain BTC transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:40:51
Nothing. But it would be a risky (and bad) idea borrow money for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:13:06
Tether was most likely a big one
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:37:27
Is the BTC on a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:48:15
oof.. You’d have to contact the mobile wallet provider. Gotta keep your keys somewhere safe!

Best explanation I’ve heard in months.
