Ross founded and operated an illegal online drug marketplace that just so happened to accept bitcoin as payment. His arrest and prosecution has very little to do with bitcoin or the technology behind it. The only thing the Silk Road did was cast a negative light on bitcoin and those who use it. Many of us see the potential in bitcoin and what it can do for society as a whole, not just those wishing to buy illegal stuff.

when you send a payment to overstock.com you are actually sending it to their payment processor, Coinbase. Coinbase in turn exchanges the BTC into USD and deposits it into Overstock's bank account. The reason Overstock can't send them back is because they don't own any BTC to send to you. You will need to wait for them to either cancel the order which will hopefully result in Coinbase refunding you your BTC or offer you store credit. This is new territory and I'm not sure how Coinbase is going to deal with this sort of thing.

I bring this up every time someone asks a question about lost wallets and while most people don't agree with me, I still think it's an important element missing from the protocol. There needs to be a way to reclaim lost coins back into the economy, but not for the reasons you may think. It would be detrimental to the US economy to simply introduce a trillion dollars of freshly printed money overnight. Hyperinflation and whatnot. If bitcoin ever becomes mainstream and entire economies are based on it can you image what happens when a million bitcoins thought to be lost are suddenly reintroduced into the economy would do? People like to cite the fact that bitcoins are infinitely divisible. What happens when an entire country is based off only a million bitcoin and now a single guy discovers or finds a wallet with 700k bitcoin? Is that guy now worth almost as much as the entire country? No, it will crash the economy because of the sudden influx of bitcoins.
My point is that there needs to be a way of identifying lost coins and recycling them back to the miners. I think the best way to do that will be to implement some kind of timer that will recycle the coins after a long period of stagnation, like 50 years. The timer would be reset every time a spend transaction happens on the address. In order to keep your coins all you need to do is send a tiny bit to yourself or someone else just to prove the funds are still accessible. Not that big of a deal

It's not something the miners could do without forking the chain. Also the funds would not be width drawn from an address, but rather marked invalid. The same amount of new coins would be allowed to be created and reintroduced into the economy. This way there will always be 21 million coins in circulation. The way satoshi intended.

I've stated this about a million times before. We absolutely need a way to recover lost coins. I believe after many years of inactivity the network needs to be able to reclaim coins back into the mining pool. A timer needs to be set every time a transfer is made. Let's say after 50 years if there is no activity on an address the coins should be marked as invalid and new coins should be mined to replace them. In order to avoid this simply make a very small transaction from that address once every 50 years or find some other way to prove the owner still has the private keys. I've heard all the reasons why this is not needed. Coins are infinity divisible, I don't want my savings to be taken, people should be more careful. These are not solutions to a very real future problem.

For that matter, we need to do away with the fee structure all together. It doesn’t cost anything to send an email, and it shouldn’t cost anything to make a bitcoin transaction. Once all the coins are mined the miners will only make money off fees which will increase the required fee amount. We need to deal with these things before they become problems. For the time being, the block reward should be good enough. The system needs to be built to be scalable and to support millions of transactions per minute if it is to become the defacto world currency.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:08

Because that’s where the utility comes from. Why not use fiat? Because I’d like to see Bitcoin replace fiat all together. I’d like to see a one world currency. I honestly don’t know how to solve this problem, but I can tell you it is most definitely a problem. Before the fees got so crazy, I used Bitcoin whenever I could and would just buy back the amount I spent in an effort to increase the adoption rate. Bitcoin is not only valuable because it’s rare, it’s valuable because it has real world applications. If those real world applications are not usable then there will be no value.

I have some strong feelings about this, but get downvoted into oblivion whenever I bring it up. I believe lost bitcoins need to be recycled back into the network. The problem is potential for hyper inflation.
Let’s say for example bitcoin becomes the world defacto currency. And let’s say it stays as it is and lost coins are gone forever. And let’s say one bitcoin is equivalent of $100m because we had to further subdivide due to so many missing coins. And then let’s say 50 years down the road a large stash of “missing” coins becomes usable again. There will be a huge influx of “new” money which will crash the value of all other coins overnight.
We need a system in place the requires all addresses to somehow prove the coins are still accessible. If an address sits too long without sending a heartbeat of some kind, then the coins are marked invalid and replacement coins are reintroduced via mining.

Bravo, excellent points. On the topic of regulation, I don't think the current systems are so heavily regulated because of technical issues, but rather due to law.

This man supplied an avenue that enabled drug addicts. We're not talking about weed, we're talking about every hard drug imaginable. I'm just as against the failed drug war as the next guy, but the fact remains, these are highly addictive and extremely damaging substances. They are illegal and Ross broke the law. You may not agree that drugs should be illegal, so work toward legalization, but the only reason Ross did what he did was to make money and the reason he was able to that is because he was providing a marketplace to sell ILLEGAL goods.

nobody thinks in terms of how many bitcoins something is worth. They think about the exchange rate and base the price on that. I wouldn't sell a pizza for 0.1 BTC just because that's i nice round number. I would sell it for that amount because that is the ~ equivalent to $10. It will be many many years before people think in terms of BTC.

I've stated this before and down voted into oblivion, but I don't think this aspect of bitcoin has been well thought out. It is so easy to lose bitcoins forever. We are only ~5 years into it and have already lost upwards of a million coins on a market that's limited to 21 million. THAT HUGE! People like to think it's OK because it increases the value to all the remaining coins. That is ludicrous and shortsighted. It should not be so easy to essentially burn your money. This is not only unsafe for the average user, think small child with lunch money, but unsafe for the bitcoin economy as a whole. I believe the solution is to implement some sort of recovery protocol into bitcoin that allows lost coins to be recycled back to the miners if a wallet sits unused for a very long time, say 50 years. All you would need to do is make a small transaction from that wallet at least once ever 50 years and the recycle timer would reset. If you don't make a transaction within 50 years your coins become invalid and new ones are created to replace them. It's simple and it keeps the intended amount of coins, 21 million,  in the economy. Allowing this amount of coins to be destroyed is irresponsible.

Cost opportunity is EXACTLY the same. If I want to buy something it makes zero difference if I pay for it with BTC or with USD because I could be spending the USD to buy more BTC instead. Besides, everytime I buy something with BTC I always buy the same amount to replace it. This way I am helping the economy while still maintaining my share of BTC. This guy is a douche.

This is why I wonder if a protocol should be implemented to recycle coins after a large amount of time. For example if a coin goes untouched for 50 years then those coins would be re-rewarded to the miners over time. To prevent this owners of coins should have to sign a message or move their coins once every 50 years
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:05:48
Another thought: What if we don't use this new protocol and 100 years from now half of all existing btc are assumed to be lost. To keep the economy going we are now using extremely tiny fractions of coins to buy expensive things. Then, unexpectedly, a large wallet is unearthed and too many coins reenter the economy. This could cause disastrous inflation overnight.

bitcoin may have been built on the ideals of anonymity, but in order to gain wide scale acceptance and thus become a sustainable currency, it must be easier to obtain. Compliant exchanges are the best way to do that.

That's why some kind of action needs to take place to tell the network that someone still has the private key. Once every 50 years you need to sign a message and submit it to something. This will reset the 50 year clock
