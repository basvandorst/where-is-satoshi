Invest what you can afford when you can afford it - even if it isn't much :)

Yes I believe so. On bitbargain though, I could quickly see that sellers had a rating, and had to be verified - the guy I bought from had a rating in the high 90's which basically means no fuck ups. You can also see if they have had any failed / cancelled sales etc

Perhaps you should add a disclaimer to say that your advice is only relevant in the US?

I'm in the 12% :D

Oh it's ok, I'm not planning on selling. I haven't bought a lot as I know that I need to get a lot more knowledgeable about it - however now I've got a little skin in the game, it's in my interest to get up to speed asap. 
My plan is to just squirrel away small amounts out of my salary every month (perhaps what I'd have spent on a night out, something like that - nothing I'll miss) and just see what happens much further down the line :)

I'm just starting! Don't really know what I'm doing yet but I'm reading all the info here as a starting point!! :)

Awesome :)

I'm not looking to make a quick buck - the aim is to keep on putting in as much as I won't miss, and just see what happens. Use it, as more places start accepting it, or just sit on it - definitely not planning to sell any time soon though :)

I like that it is cheaper for the merchant too, as they don't have to pay merchant fees on each transaction, like they do for card payments :)
