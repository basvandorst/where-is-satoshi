Amazing! I wonder if it will last and/or if it will force credit card companies to lower fees.

Is this actively used or more a feature of the protocol waiting to be widely adopted?

Paying interest on a credit card is stupid which is why I haven't done it in a decade. I think it's a bit disingenuous for a Bitcoin proponent to blame a technology (credit cards) instead of people who use it poorly (people who get charged interest). No technology can prevent poor human judgement (e.g.: bitcoin scams, lost wallets, etc.).

Square is 2.75% per swipe, but 3% is probably a fine estimate to go by.
Aren't large bitcoin transactions subject to fees? If so, how much?
Aren't there fees for businesses to exchange bitcoins back to the fiat they need to pay employees, suppliers, etc.?
I'm just trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison because as a consumer I'm obviously giving up a lot of nice features of my credit card if I choose to pay in bitcoin for the better of a business.

But right now it's not (usually) a discount, so why should I give up my benefits for nothing?
And as other people have stated the discount is likely to be around 1-2% which is usually not worth the loss of these benefits for me.

I'm unfamiliar with exchange or Bitcoin payment processor fees. Is it considerably cheaper than say the 2.75% fee Square charges per swipe?

Sure, so perhaps the better question in those countries is: why use bitcoin instead of the well established mobile payment systems?

True, I'm lucky enough to be able to get a credit card. Being free-for-anyone-with-access is definitely a pro of Bitcoin, although access to Bitcoin isn't exactly free for all.

Is it legal to avoid that tax?

Via a credit card statement, but there are plenty of other ways to track a person's spending. I would imagine discovering and tracing an average consumer's BT address activity is something the NSA is going to become quite good at if they're not already.


I've fairly easily solved that by only spending what I have. There's also prepaid cards to force yourself to spend within your means (only they lack many of the nice features of a credit card).


Surely BT exchanges charge fees? But I think I get your point: many credit cards charge foreign processing fees, but some do not. Bitcoin definitely has the advantage of operating the same everywhere.


Definitely. I'm mainly curious because this subreddit seems to get really excited over brick-and-mortar businesses accepting BT. I honestly just don't understand why that's appealing.

A better title would have been: "One Weird Trick This Canadian Knows About Bitcoin ATMs That You Don't!"

Huh, so USD 0,02 / $0.02 per kWh? So is the power even cheaper in China?

How would a decentralized currency prevent the sort of private banking abuses mentioned in this article?


With a $10B market cap and $4T in daily trades, it seems the not-so-invisible hands of giant investment banks could have their way with bitcoin if they so desired. Maybe they are already?

How does decentralization prevent massive investment banks from manipulating prices? The subtitle is even "There's no price the big banks can't fix" I don't see how cryptocurrency is immune (especially with their currently tiny market cap relative to the sizes of assests these banks are toying with).

It was last edited in December 2012, which was before the rise of ASIC miners. I assume the projections are therefore invalid, but I don't have the knowledge or expertise to correct them.

My bad. Thanks for the link.
