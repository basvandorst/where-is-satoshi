Indeed but there are also sacrifices to be made here, if the block size is doubled it reduces the security of the Bitcoin network. Also for the long term, it is also proven that as block rewards get lower and block size gets larger, miners are much more incentivized to fork the blockchain to take all transaction fees. 
This phenomena is explained very where in this paper: 
This is of course, very much down the road.
One other thing as mentioned below is that increasing block size also leads to centralization of miners for the reason stated below. It becomes too costly to run a node and at some point if (in an exaggerated situation) one mining pool owns 51% of the hash rate, then they could compromise by double spending.
One can argue that they don't have the economic incentive to maliciously attack the network, that is fine, since they do have billions of dollars of hardware dependent on this cryptocurrency. But when mining becomes that centralized, there is a single point of failure anyway, which defeats the purpose of the Bitcoin decentralized protocol. Hope these points makes sense. Thanks for the insight.

Thank you for the note, this was a typo and has been fixed.

Glad it helped, this topic has been very confusing so far for everyone.

Yes I am the author. I only recently started writing pieces and publishing them in a professional manner. I definitely intend to write more articles similar to this style as there is a lot to talk about in crypo. I would suggest to follow me on twitter, medium and/or follow my company linkedin page (all provided at the bottom of the article) for more upcoming pieces. Thanks for your kind words and interest!

I am unsure as to the details of why one mining pool is or isn't signaling for BIP91. However, they do still have time to do so before July 21st, all the signaling now is more of a promise. F2pool did indeed sign the New York Agreement, so please expect them to signal before July 21st.
The lock-in period for BIP91 is 336 blocks (approx 2.4 days) in which a 80% signaling needs to be reached for Segwit to pass.

I feel like you need to be more than just competent to be a Bitcoin Core Dev..

Great explanation and analogy to the medical industry, thank you for that. I definitely agree with you on all the points. The positive thing here is that at least the Segwit code is still from BIP141, only the names changed. Still extremely concerned that the Github domain will switch to btc1, and that the 2 MB hard fork is not reviewed at all.

Exactly, I believe that no one in their right mind would want to sabotage Bitcoin's price by a chain split. No one wants a complete armageddon situation which is why Segwit2x will most likely pass. I believe the point of BIP148 was to force BIP141 but in return we got BIP91 with a promised hard fork. Not the best way for Segwit to pass but sometimes we have no choice.
