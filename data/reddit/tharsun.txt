Technical Analysis. As defined by the Corporate Finance Institute:
 What is Technical Analysis?
Technical analysis is a tool, or [method]( used to predict the probable future price movement of a security – such as a [stock]( or currency pair – based on market data.
The  theory behind the validity of technical analysis is the notion that the  collective actions – buying and selling – of all the participants in  the market accurately reflect all relevant information pertaining to a  traded security, and therefore, continually assign a fair market value  to the [security](
 Past Price as an Indicator of Future Performance
Technical traders believe that current or past price action in the market is the most reliable indicator of future price action.
Technical analysis is not only used by technical traders. Many fundamental traders use [fundamental analysis](  to determine whether to buy into a market, but having made that  decision, then use technical analysis to pinpoint good, low-risk buy  entry price levels.

You’re better off dollar cost averaging (DCA) by buying a small amount of BTC with that extra cash each month, rather than getting a loan to buy a large amount at once. Because of BTC’s volatility, DCA’ing is a more prudent buying strategy, and as a plus you won’t be paying interest on a loan.

I appreciate the thoughtful response. As I've been learning more since getting into this earlier this year, there's a lot of noise to filter out, but I'm always interested in the thoughts of people who really know about it, like you obviously do. Thanks again.

I've already set the recurring deposit, it's "set it and forget it." I'm not going to be manually buying each week. I'm just wondering if there's an optimal time/day of the week to set this to - if there's an established pattern (like weekends having the weekly lows as of late) to make the most of it.

Thanks! That's what I thought but wasn't sure. If I may veer from the technical to speculative: do you care to share your outlook on the future of BTC? I'm particularly wondering about price, but am open to hearing about whatever you care to share: implementation, dominance, etc. I know, no one knows, but you seem pretty well versed so I am curious as to your thoughts if you have any you feel comfortable discussing.

Gotcha - are these new addresses for receiving generated each time I make a request to receive?

If you have enough conviction, go for it. I don’t think it’s wise, as the price could go any which way and it’s a risky strategy. The common advice is to buy what you’re willing to lose. You could really get yourself in trouble when you borrow what you don’t even have to lose; but then again, fortune favors the bold. Good luck to you,

How come each time I transfer BTC from Coinbase or CashApp to my trezor, the trezor gives me a new address? Thanks for being so considerate and explaining things to us noobs!
