The way rebalancing is supposed to work (if I understand it correctly) is that you send a payment to yourself (from one of your channels to another of your own channels - but the route can include many hops). So your total balance doesn't change, but the funds in all the channels on the route move to the other end. With good algorithm you can make such circular payments in a way to rebalance the channels you need (yours or of others).

I think the best bet would be to not only spend the same inputs, but also set fee to something really really big (0.05BTC?). Publish such transaction yourself and it will be included in the next block by any miner.

I agree that my fee is probably too high. But my aim was not only to win the double-spend, but to have transaction confirmed asap. I don't know the technicals, but from what I read miners using Asicboost sometimes pick non-highest fee transactions to meet Asicboost criteria. With only one satoshi difference both transactions will wait in the mempool for hours, increasing the chance for older one to be picked. I may be completely wrong about that, but personally I wouldn't want to take any chances with 13BTC at stake.

if bit1 gets over 95% hash power, segwit activates accroding to Core 95% rule. Imagine that miners signal bit4+bit1 and get 79% hash power, and on top of that, 16% of UASF users signal bit1. Segwit would activate (95%), but Segwit2x not (79%&lt;80%), so no hard-fork in 90 days. That's probably why Jihan doesn't want to singal bit 1, so that 95% threshold on bit 1 is not met.
