Meme or not, dogecoin is an alt coin that has doubled my BTC holdings.

Damn. I just realized that I went to school 2 blocks from Mt Gox and walked passed their offices everyday when I lived in Tokyo.

Hazard has a really good track record minus his slip up with Dogecoin. Seeing this makes me feel better.

Here in Japan where even the ATMs close or charge you "after hours" fees this chart is pretty much true. I can't even withdraw my money for free on the weekend. I had to take time off of work to open my bank account when I first moved here.

I really want to use Bitcoin to send my money home but due to no stable way of buying Bitcoin using my Japanese Yen and the overinflated prices of Bitcoins on the localbitcoin marketplace I end up getting more USD just using a standard remittance service. 
If anyone has had good luck moving Japanese Yen to USD cheaply using Bitcoin please let me know!

I'd translate it as "Ma."

The sell was placed as 102, but buy orders as low as 190 actually cleared according to bitcoinwisdom.com

Shit, doesn't it take like 3 weeks to set up a MtGox account? I'm a US citizen living here in Japan with 2 Japanese bank accounts and 2 US bank accounts which are already linked to Coinbase. This is so doable for me.

I'll look into Bitstamp services too. MtGox seemed easy to send funds in Japanese Yen to because they are also located in Japan allowing them to accept a domestic money transfer directly from my Japanese bank account for a very low fee (about 2 USD). When I saw how long the waitlist was to join them though I just ended up using a remittance service last time. I'll be sending money home again in about 3 months though so I've got some time research more on Bitcoin remittance.

Yup. Just got some cheap coins. Brought down my average purchase price some!

Not the best way to try to introduce Bitcoin to people. The first impression the reader will get is "get rich quick scam!" 
Also you should have made the paper more focused how to mine and what mining is and left out all the stuff about about making money and the legality of bitcoin.

I'm pissed I slept though the panic sale. I missed out on buying cheaper coins.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:12:37
I'm interested in this info as well.

I've always wanted to use Bitcoin to send money home from Japan, but there are no local sellers of bitcoin near where I live. It seems my only option would be to set up a MtGox account connected to my Japanese bank account and move any purchased Bitcoins over to Coinbase and sell them into my American account. I guess I need to get on MtGox's one month waiting list to get a verified account set up.

My little brother got a crypto currency bundle from me. Gave him 50 mBTC and 100000 Dogecoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:14:37
I was tossing around that idea as well. I gotta get a MtGox account set up funded with my JPY. Too bad it seems the process of verification will take upwards of 2 weeks to complete.

Glad to see it picking up some steam here. I live in a dead zone for bitcoin. Nobody selling or buying on bitcoinlocal near me (Hokkaido) and the closest shop that accepts bitcoin is over 700km away. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:02:02
I'll see if there are any trusted sellers around Tokyo. Still seems a little sketchy to do though bank transfers though. Too easy for either party to try to screw each other over. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:25:19
Actually, no. As of the time of this comment, 100k of Dogecoins is worth about 90 mBTC. I bought the 100k of Dogecoins for 50 mBTC. 
EDIT: Wow, I'm actually getting down-voted for giving someone Bitcoins. you so crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:38:25
Good luck with this!
One question though, I've never worked in a restaurant, but I thought that servers share the tips with the busboys/kitchen staff. Will you set up all your co-workers wallets too or just pay them cash?
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:35:36
Doing the good work of the shibe. Keep it up @_date: 2013-12-05 10:35:47
I wont get them instantly, but I will get them at the price I purchased at though Coinbase in a few days pending I don't get flagged as "high risk." If you have an American bank account you can use them.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:43:31
My tip account was starting to run low. I'll be sure to pay this forward. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:58:48
Yeah, I made the same mistake. I bought my first coin on the way up for around 1000, watched it peak at 1250 mark, saw it crash to about 1000 again, and decided now was my chance to buy some more. Then when it hit the 650 mark I did not have any more funds available use on Bitcoin. If only we could see into the future, am I right guys?
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:59:40
True, but unfortunately my loan debt is in USD so I'm always in need of sending money back home. Also my income is paid in JPY.
