His post sounds pretty fuckin made up to me. 
Either that or.. yes he needs marraige counselling.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:32:08
It also always goes up.. until it doesnt
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:03:19
Wont be selling until it goes at least higher than 800B market cap again.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:10:24
They really only see it from the point where they bought in at.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:50:38
Whoa. I hope this chart isn't real!  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:22
Well something like coinbase introducing bitcoin cash would have been useful news to me.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:18:38
The white balls are actually pictures of him and his family but I whited them out for privacy reasons. Also names were changed.
I gave it to him in a beautiful sparkly box I got at Sears for $2 and filled it with white tissue paper then laid the poster on top and filled it up with gold chocolate coins from Purdy's chocolates.

THank you for offering some much need perspective
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:54
Depends on the exchange. On my canadian exchange it went down about $1200. Has since gone back up by 600.
Could go either way right now. Have to wait and see
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:54
Sounds like fun!  
Ive completed every major goal ive had in life this year and I created a new one. Make 4 million dollars! Its stupid but with that, I can live off interest and quit my job and make games for the rest of my life.
Anywho, working my way there slowly with cryptos. Hoping this can help me in that direction. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:27:53
Thanks bud :')
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:57:04
Good job! I bought at 17.5 and sold at 15.3
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:10:23
Bah. Actually I sold 75% of my holdings last weekend :(
Boy do I regret it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:01
Definitely wont. Was starting to sweat a little there. But will definitely not sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:50:13
I also just bought a car, just got it today :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:59
YEP Its dipping now :)
It always dips after it rises this quickly. Dipped 800  edit: $1000 on quadriga, and a few hundred on bitfinex and coinbase
Edit: take what i say with a grain of salt. Only follow your research and gut feeling. Dont listen to some random dude when it comes to your money
Edit 2: its going back up. Nvm guys. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:26:41
Honestly? I was having fun listening to you guys saying "HODL!" and felt like I wasn't alone..
Then started reading all the fud comments. "Expect a crash anytime" they said :( "This isn't sustainable" they said :(
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:36:09
hmm. That's not a bad idea. I'd hardly know it was missing at all. 
I actually might do that!
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:49:36
I’m not hoping it to either
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:54:08
Welcome ;)
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:37:57
Maybe one post was enough 
@_date: 2018-05-13 05:12:56
Uuuuh.. ok great �� 
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:05:05
It always dips on bitcoin pizza day. Ppl are cashing out to buy pizza 
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:10:54
I think the last dip got people worried.. they reduced risk by selling their alts into btc.. then people Fomo to 10k..
Then people take profit because why not.. then people scared because its dropping and the last drop was already causing fear.. the fomo’s are weak and will sell as it drops..
I think this drop will go below 8600 this time. Maybe 8200 then back to 9k for a while. 
Im completely guessing all of this but maybe im right :)
@_date: 2018-05-19 06:01:41
Interesting, shorts went up at 11:00
Last time he moved btc, it went up 10% before a 20% dip
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:49:29
I really dont see the relevance.
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:48:25
You went from 5% to 1% now.. ok its the same thing.. car wrap ads are the most cost effective way to gain ad impressions. 1% retainment is still fucking amazing. A daily gain of 1% is pretty good man. Especially in vancouver which is over crowded (lots of impressions), tons of chinese and its one of north americas greatest tech hubs so theres going to be more people who know what crypto is.
The owner of the vehicle is likely paid monthly, they dont own the god damn car. 
This is good advertisement. Dont fight it. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:18:36
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:51:06
Yeah.. thats why it went up..
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:28:46
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:08:06
Were you here since the January dip? If you were and felt the pain of losing 90% of your portfolio calue, you wouldnt do this.
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:01:55
Not a waste. Its great marketing. Everyone already stares at lambos.. they are practically mobile billboards. It’s obviously effective, it got op to post this.
Its possible they paid someone who already owned a lambo to get this print. I doubt they bought a lambo for this.. 
Edit: and btw 5% would be fucking amazing. Car wrap ads have some of the lowest cost per impressions of any type of ad. This would be extremely effective. One vehical wrap ad can get 30-80k impressions in a day.. 1500-4000 people per day searching your site is pretty good man.
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:15:26
Lol. Love how you get down voted for this.. people in this sub are insane sometimes.. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:06:06
Posting this in /bitcoin is a death sentence. People here just dont care what anyone has to say unless they are shilling the bull run.
They did the exact same shit last time they moved coins. Market reacted by dipping, dip goes back up then a week later it plummets. Honestly didnt expect it to go exactly the same but what do you know? Fool me once.. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:37:49
The ST&amp;D formations are showing a full spread on the Eagle trading network. Bitcoin will test positive after going down all the way just before it erects into an explosive CUM formation all over my charts.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:19:05
I dont think itll go that high. Probably around 35-40k though :)
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:11:21
Why not? You are getting free money.. and can paint over it when your contracts up. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:47:16
Sorry but how do you know this? 
It may never reach 20k again 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:50:45
They buy at essentially a premium and they both short the market. He likely does sell otc as to not affect price and when they sell he can still say he did not directly affect market with his sale of btc because he sold otc
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:44:11
Whats june gonna be like ? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:10:00
I accidentally locked myself out of my exchange.. Had 5k that should be verified today..
I am willing to bet it will skyrocket through this week after the 100,000 new accounts + all the news of &gt;9000
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:15:11
I got in at around 5000 CDN when china backed out. But only bought $80 to test the waters. Did another test of $500.
And finally less than a week ago I bought 6K CDN at around 8000 CDN / btc. I have 0.74 btc now.
Wish I bought sooner but meh. I already have around $750 profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:09:54
Damn and I thought my $6000 was a lot.
Do they have a twitter? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:20:31
Good luck buddy. 
Can you also ask them nicely to make it easier to file taxes for us retards who bought/sold 10 million times.
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:10:03
Unless they can spin it in a way that seems like this could affect us.. i dont think this sort of thing will make the news here.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:45:31
Whens the next difficulty increase?
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:22:37
There is literally a post right bellow this one with the title
"The Story of Andreas Antonopolous: The Bitcoin Messiah!"
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:48:40
Ill buy 0.0002186 of your russian girlfriend
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:00:22
What is bitcoins “working product”?
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:55:38
Yay! More manipulation coming!
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:58:05
Its a pretty different game now though.. with governments cracking down and futures making huge price swings.. not to mention the spotlight its under from the banks and the media. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:06:13
Damn thanks for the info.
I need specific instructions like this while im still new.
Thanks man.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:58:55
Well its monday now and shits gone down more. So gg
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:34:44
Wtf. You dont think it consolidated enough at $7,000?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:59:18
Okay, thank you this answers my question. And the other question too I was going to ask. 
Seriously, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:33:20
Just be knowledgable of the fees you're paying.
I don't use CoinBase but there's probably a fee for every bank withdrawal and for every bitcoin transaction as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:58:43
Ill sell you 1 bitcoin for $10,000 ;)
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:59:30
Yaa i bought at 9060. But for real, am I allowed to start crying now?  I guess I should wait a bit first
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:09:18
Went up too fast from 9K.
 Needs to correct.
I have a stop loss at 8900. Remember how hard it was to get passed 9k? 9k is a big hurdle going up.. and coming down too. 
Edit: dont listen to me, im better at losing money than gaining money
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:58:42
Hahah. Nah I just stopped crying for a bit as it went up. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:15:53
This is the cutest thing Ive ever seen.
I bet you spend a lot of time looking at charts and stuff.
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:38:02
Just wondering, why do people say bitcoin is over valued? I mean, not what are their motives behind the statement but what does that even mean? 
How can we know what the value truly is? Or is it just a way of saying shits gonna dump.
