Isn't Gilfoyle a satanist? 
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:22:07
It wasn't obvious? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:14:03
Burstcoin's founder is unknown too. Maybe it's satoshi himself...

Why is this sub so against stickers?
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:38:56
When did stickers become vandalism?
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:01:46
Get over Bcash already, I'm sick of seeing so many posts about it. It's just all free advertising for them.

Look out u/jerkywez you're going to sticker prison

Are you a climate change denier? 
Edit: Bitcoin isn't killing the planet but it certainly isn't helping..

It's great for artists to receive money for their work.  Im doing a little comic on the Burstcoin page and some people have sent me a bit of Burst. It feels great! Well done on the 1K!

And how are you going to buy crypto with no bank account?
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:36:45
Oh definitely but as bitcoin grows it's only going to increase in power output.  It could become a major issue one day in the future.  Hopefully it will be a push for more renewables.

Accumulate while you can, sub 10K isn't going to last forever. Take this slow climb back as a blessing.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:26:50
Well it literally did only last days haha

Buy a few hard drives and mine some Burstcoin instead. If you're a beginner it's very simple to do.

Once the dymaxion is implemented the coin will scale with every new user that's added.

Burst supports proof of capacity which is much more decentralised than POS and POW since all you need is HDD space to mine.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:20:44
Proof of Capacity is a much more energy efficient process utilised by Burstcoin. Using free storage space on your hard-drive to plot nonces once. The miner then scans your drive to reuse over and over again. After plotting your drives the energy consumption is minimal compared to to Bitcoin.

I bank with Commonwealth. I was worried it was debit as well but credit is fair enough.
