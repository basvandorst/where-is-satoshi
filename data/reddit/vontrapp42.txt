WTF else is needed is not doing KYC when you trade some BTC for some JOE

The difference is that Starbucks isn't accepting bitcoin via bitpay.

A payment needs to be directed to indirection else it would just be undirected.

Blockchain.info works by storing an encrypted copy of all the private keys/seed. (At least the last time I looked into it) the data is decrypted client side. The server doesn't know and can't recover the unencrypted data without your password. You lose the password you're sol.
When you give the scammer your password they can get the encrypted data from the server and *decrypt it* using your password. When you change the password it's no matter, they already have the decrypted data, and continue to have it after you change the password. If you were daring you could try to counter scam them by moving the funds to a different wallet at the most special time, but might as well do day trading. :p

They can have the gpg encrypted private keys. Good luck.

Because you still need to pay bills and buy food. If you have to sell in an pinch for cashflow and the price isn't opportune in that moment then you can get really really screwed.

Using wireshark you could save the actual world data structures that could reconstruct the whole block by block structure. You could then load it into minecraft and remove the lava, or just decode the block placements directly.
You can't do this from the *image* though, not even with wireshark. You'd have to wireshark a live connection to the server itself. More likely is you have your client on your computer connected to the server in which case wireshark isn't even needed as the world chunks are already cached to your disk.
Also, if they were playing single player not on a server and not open to the network then there's no connection to wireshark.
Still, I'd have to be pretty brave to put a real private key with any large amount of bitcoin into minecraft in any form on any computer, network or not.

blockchain.info doesn't store your keys, at least didn't used to last I knew. they store an encrypted backup,  but they don't have the secret to unblock that backup.
to op,  the passphrase for the wallet backup is an AES passphrase to decrypt the blockchain.info backup data structure. there are python scripts to deal with their strange encryption structure. make sure you scrub the script for any call-home. should not be any socket calls. you could run the script on an offline paranoid computer for extra measure.

+1 ssss, this is the right way to do it without multisig

Can you include also the dollar reduction of each as a percentage of the market cap at the time of each halving?
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:45:26
this how
Bitcoin ASCII binary. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:13:59
you need to recover the seed itself (or individual private keys, depending on age of wallet) and generate seed/key phrase words from that.

I thought that in any case the time lock verifys would expire and all funds would default back into originating (or some kind of on chain) address? Is this not so?

The closer it gets the more it can be priced in - so far as the effects in price can be - and are accurately - predicted (which is only to some extent, not perfectly)
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:21:14
Unless you power on your server and tell it to force close channels before it gets sync. Which should issue a terse warning before letting you continue I think.
So... Don't do that.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:26:55
Savant? I don't think you're using that word correctly.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:08:21
Lol, fair
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:26:58
we need to frame such things as not about gender, or sex, really. One being very into cryptocurrency and space cats while one's SO doesn't get it is a broadly relatable experience, and the one into bitcoin may just as well be a female, or a male with a male SO, or whatever.
posts could be worded in this non-gendered way.
"SO: stares blankly"
but they can also be interpreted in non-gendered ways which is next best I think.

Yes inflation trends to zero (assuming no lost coins) and it's just a difference of time.
But if coins are lost at non zero rate, then inflation trends to negative (bitcoin) or to actual zero (constant issuance)
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:00:33
I do think a constant issue rate is more robust. We don't really know what percentage of coins are lost per year on average, and if that's too high it has the potential to make prices not stable enough long term (no prices aren't stable now nor would they be for a long time).
With a constant issuance you don't need to know or care about the lost coins rate. The issuance will balance it out on any long enough time horizon, and the circulation becomes constant.
Edit to add: and that time horizon is on lifetime scale.
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:42:18
10% inflation in 10 years. 3% inflation in 33 years.
Assuming coins are never lost.
