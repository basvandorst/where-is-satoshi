This is to the customer's advantage. Two options exist:
a) Hold off token trading for everyone. Noone will be able to trade it.
b) Allow token trading. As user, you still have the option NOT to trade it. You'd have the exact same outcome for yourself as if they chose option a), but others can trade if they like.
There's no downside for users with allowing BFX token trading, even if there's still not enough info out there to make informed decisions. In that case... just dont trade it yourself. Why restrict others from doing so, though?

Those complaining that bitfinex can buy back their own tokens cheap... well: they only can do that if you sell them cheap.
They can't pay 1 USD each right now, if they could there would have been no need to create them in the first place.
So either wait until they can pay 1 USD for them, or sell them to other users cheaper if you prefer to get something for sure right now, opposed to more (or nothing!) later.

Here's evorhees' thoughts on that matter:

True! My node being there doesnt affect the price whatsoever though.
Doing this just to support the networt (and, back then, to have a good reason to buy that small intel nuc and run it 24/7!).

My node right now already has a negative ROI and always will.

Miners are supposed to be mining whats most profitable. Why is Segwit2x supposed to be dead if some hashpower is temporarily moved? From what I've seen, there was no requirement for them to stick to BTC Core.
Segwit2x could very well still fork off on November with every signatory's hashpower.

wondered that too, and after 5 minutes of searching: those gift cards only seem to work on the amazon.com version of amazon, not on .co.uk, .fr, .at, etc.

There were two mentions of egifter before here, they seem to charge nothing on top of amazon gift cards. What would be the advantage of using all4btc?

Since "fill or kill" has already a specific meaning in investing (dont split up orders, fill the whole position or do not trade at all) there might be some confusion when using the same wording for a different meaning.

He wired money from a bank to a company. There's no bitcoins involved at all at this point, so there's nothnig 'bitcoin' can provide here.
Though, even if this was done with bitcoins, there's the same protections real cash money has.
Something similar about Bitpanda  popped up here recently:

I'm running a full node for about 9 months now as well, and still have plenty of bandwidth unused (10 MBit upstream available here). I get 1-2 GB of upstream traffic a day.
Having 15-30 outbound connections most of the time.
Only caveat: my ISP disconnects me once every 24h and I need to restart bitcoind then because I cant get it to update the public IP address in any other way. Node score always resets then.

Yup, joinmarket is the best one and has one huge advantage: you never give up control of your coins. You dont need to trust anyone to use joinmarket. Your coins cannot be stolen by a dishonest mixer/tumbler.
