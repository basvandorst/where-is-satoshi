I'm seeing several comments below and what comes in my mind and
Just stupid noobs and beginners would buy bitcoin with the price above 18k
The most idiotic people are the ones who think that when the price is high it will go up even more and it is time to buy
this is the stupidest thought there is
Everyone knows that when the price of btc is high many people are selling, withdrawing money so the price goes down, which is known as a correction
plus the noobs do not understand this, and when the price bo btc falls they panic and lose money
Other stupid thoughts are
You will get rich with btc
Buy now the price of btc is coming up
These are what a novice or noob think
A guy who is hodl, ie and expert and experienced in the btc market thinks this way
The price of btc is low, this is the best opportunity for me to get Hodl
I'm going to buy btc
The price of btc will go up as usual, this correction is healthy
The price of btc is high, and time to sell and get my profit under investment
Again the price of btc will go down, go down in a healthy correction
I'll buy again when the price goes down
Buy when you're down, sell when you're up, or the price of btc is high
Get your monthly profit and salary, and this way you earn your money
Think about getting rich and idiocy, make your profit, diversify your investments
Keep the focus and this way you will get an income from a CEO
Getting rich is out of the question, although this is the goal, do not think this way
Just think about making a profit.

yes,more probable

Your prediction is very crazy.
I do not believe it will be this way, everything will be a bit slower.
If your prediction is right, if the price rises to 70k and suddenly have a correction as usually happens down, that is to 40k many people or beginners will commit suicide
and this is going to happen, there are many stupid newbies who bet all their money on btc, and they are going to lose a lot of money
Just the old guys, HODL investors are going to make extraordinary profits
I'm really hoping that the price will reach 20.30,40.70, and up to 100k over 2018, more responsibly and slowly, so that we have healthy corrections and the usual investors can profit
Happy New Year friend.

I'm looking at trading bitstamp in these early hours of day 26.
I see that the price is going up slowly because it is making small automatic corrections of buying down
And this is very good, it means that the price is in a steady rise line, small corrections make the number of buy that can take the price down is small, and the number of sales taking the price up is much higher
I predict that the price may go up in the next few days to 17k, 18k or even 20k
Before a correction of 3k/4.5k in the new year
To rise again on days 2,3,4,5 of January
Then the price will shoot to 18k/20k/22k/ to 25k in other exchanges
My selling price and $ 17,850, I will get my profit and expect a drop before the 30th
Prepare for profit, correction and purchase
Happy new year and best luck.

BIG CORRECTION COME SOON
sell now and get your profit because soon the price goes down 4k/6k
many newbies are going to commit suicide :)
whenever btc on it goes down, whenever btc goes down it will go up
The current and unreal price, and does not hold, we will have a great correction soon
take this advice and you will succeed

Big correction come soon
Join 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:26
Sell when the price is high (HODL)
wait for the correction
Buy again when the price goes down
Follow this advice and you will succeed.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:22:25
Well, I'm waiting for this.
I hope the price reaches 18k until the weekend
Then we will have a media correction, or a great correction again before and after the 30th
For a price increase on days 2,3, 4,5,6 January
Hoping to make a profit in the next few hours or days, I hope we will actually see the prices arrive again 18k, would be ideal
I'm going to write a topic about my life right now.
I'm just holding btc
Merry Christmas and a New Year of Peace and Stable Profits Throughout 2018
HODL my friends, HODL
and what we need
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:12:58
Do this now before the big correction

Large investors are making the price rise because they will be launching BTC-based assets on the 18th
Then they will withdraw their profits, and guess what will happen?
The price of btc will go down, and you will see news in the mean saying that btc is dead
in fact and a big chance of success when btc goes down because you can get more btc for a lower price
Stupid people buy btc when the price is high hoping that the price will rise even more
Next the price goes down and then only experienced players get their profit
Remember this comment in the coming weeks.

You are not real
I saw you write this same answer in another topic
You are a bot, probably in the service of fake news
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:45:05
This guy is a newbie, probably an investor in the stock market who does not know how BTc works and other currencies,  he was probably influenced by stupid media or friends with stupid ambitions to get rich
The stupidest investor in BTC, BTCH, LTC and other virtual currencies are these guys who buy when BTc is up thinking that the price will go up even more
Serious and experienced investors as many here know that the best time and now
This is the best moment of the BTC when it goes down and you can get more coins to wait HODL, get your profit wait new fall and buy more coins
Who does not think this way is doomed to failure, never buy btc when the price is high.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:00:19
yes, well done
Yes, you're right, after Christmas comes the bomb
we can get 18k ha for 1 btc again
in January can by its sale price in 20k and get its profit
Thanks bitcoin, litcoin and btcash, I'm getting rich with these coins
I meet all of you in the world cup of russia in 2018, I want to fuck a Russian girl :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:53:40

I hope it's not an American who wants to build this
It would be our end 
The americans and their agency NSA the whole world and spied
Probably everything would be backdored
I hope novelties from the cryptocoins world never come from the yankees
We would be lost.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:12:00
Yes, going towards 8k
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:52:00
Probable yes
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:54:11
Probable yes
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:25:51
yes,more probable ))
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:19:50
In bitstamp it was only 3 $
I think that when we reach 8k we will have an avalanche of sales
Then the price may go up even more
Next title of topic
10k here we go, hahhahahhahah :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:55:27
IN THIS MOMENT WE ARE FALLING FOR 7K
BITCOIN WILL FALL TO 4,500 NEXT WEEKS, AND MAY FALL
 EVEN MORE IN APRIL OR MAY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER 
GREAT RETRIEVEMENT BEFORE REALLY STARTING A 
RECOVERY AT THE END OF THE YEAR
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:29:42
Cryto_Forever your dream
This will not happen until the middle of the year, when things are going to get better.
If the price goes up it will be difficult to stay above 10k
After the middle of the year, it will be possible.
Now, get ready for a slight rise in the price of btc and other currencies in general, and then go down by 6k or less.
