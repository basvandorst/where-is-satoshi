Why not set the block limit to .1 MB by this logic? Block size caps are artificial and so long as the limit is arbitrarily chosen it will be economically inefficient.

This is ridiculous! Bitcoins are electronic. There is no physical way for them to weigh a hundred pounds.... a few electrons maybe but... *sheesh* people.

Desktop storage (what your referring to) is only part of the overall user situation. Consider laptop users with necessarily smaller harddrive capacities or users with exclusively SSD's. Sure the storage capacity on SSD's is increasing steadily but the price/gig is and will remain significantly greater than their platter counterparts for the forseeable future. Now consider online transmission and data caps most users experience where 70 GB may well be half your monthly allowance.
None of this even addresses the more fundamental concern that should bitcoin really take off the rate of increase will also expand exponentially and within generational lifetimes the chain could well take up that entire 3 TB hard drive.

I feel like the transaction itself is a zero sum situation. Spend bitcoin to buy a life of bread and transfer an equivalent amount of USD to bitcoin or use USD. If you actually believe bitcoin is going to increase in value those are the two rational choices in a world where converting between the two is easy.

There are limits and there are physical limits. You don't best physics. Theres a reason the trend in CPUs has been towards adding cells and not further miniaturization.

Your vastly overstating the rate hard drive sizes will increase. The low hanging fruit has been picked and they are pushing up against fundamental limits at this point. Don't expect those sizes on a single normal sized platter ever much less in ten years.

What exactly am I seeing here? Sorry, I know relatively little about reading these sorts of graphs.
