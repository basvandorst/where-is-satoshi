Regarding Coinbase:  Yes it is useless at this point. I've been trying to buy &lt; 10 BTC for 2 weeks now. They predicted there would be way more liquidity than there is I suspect.  No coins to be had.

When I run this, it seems to spawn the buy() function exponentially every 5 seconds.    For example, when I first run it, buy() is ran, then 5 seconds later, two buy()'s are spawned, then four, etc...

It's good to know I wasn't doing something stupid. I'm using restler 2.0.1 with node 0.10.0 on macos.

I bought in from low 20's to mid 30's. I'm tempted to buy some more.

With spring coming, one could ride by horse in a few days. Plenty of grass and water - free "gas".
