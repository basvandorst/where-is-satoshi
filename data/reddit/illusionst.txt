GDax, Bitstamp, Gemini.

Yes it is.

They take ages the verify your account.

Any idea how much do they still hold?
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:16:30
I did. Fuck them. I just convinced my supplier in China to accept Bitcoins. In last 15 months, I've sent him more than $250,000. Goodbye banks. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:37:38
That's not a problem. I am allowed to move my funds.

Thanks for the heads up. The manager said I can still use the credit card. Although, I'm not going to take his world for it. Time to shop for a new credit card. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:49:57
That's what I told him first. The Bank Manager googled it and said they are a Bitcoin company. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:44:18
That is the plan. I have accounts with other Banks. Guess they are just scared of the future.

Money transfer company? You mean like MoneyGram and Western Union?

Pretty sure Mr. ROBOT/Elliot Allderson is responsible for this. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:55:48
I don't think it's worth the trouble. I have accounts at 2/3 other Banks. They would be more than willing to take my money.

Nice! How did you do that? Mind sending me a PM. I'm genuinely interested.

Story time:
I bought 36 bitcoins earlier this year for $36,000. I was HODLING them strong till May when I was tempted with ETH's growth and converted them to 303 ETH. Sure enough, Bitcoin mooned and ETH went sideways for months. I FOMO'ed and bought back into 20 Bitcoins. Altcoins started mooning. I decided on a strategy, diversify my investments and HODL for at least 6 months. I went 40% BTC, 30% ETH, 30% OMG. I further diluted ETH and OMG and added KNC and RDN. 
Advice: HODL, Don't trade
My only successful trade till date has been ETH&lt;-&gt;RDN where I made more than 200% gains.
I invested in OMG and KNC only because Vitalik was an advisor and I thought he would have done his research before committing his time. I was lazy. I plan to sell my OMG and KNC for projects that I genuinely believe in (hello RDN). 
Thanks Bitcoin and Altcoins.

Even if they are stored securely on Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:18:19
That's a nice skill to have. I'm impressed.

Virtual cards are not available worldwide though.

Q2. Yawn. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:05:55
You guys have been saying that for months. We don't trust you anymore. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:59:56
Screw the banks?

My Citibank savings account was closed because I bought Bitcoins. They also closed my credit card which had 117,000 air miles. I asked them to at least let me use my miles, they said their decision is final. No air miles. It's gone.
