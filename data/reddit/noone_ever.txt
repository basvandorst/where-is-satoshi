I’ve been waiting 4 days for a transaction to confirm from a Bitcoin ATM...
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:19:27
I knew

So, do they all get sold eventually, or do you get left over with some? How long does this usually take if you sell at the market price? I've got a small amount of BTC that I just want to cash out quickly and easily, I've never done it before.

It’s the only way for me to buy without my wife finding out

Grrr if it’s on an exchange that will tempt me to make stupid trades...

Prepare for more loss

I have the theory that in the far far future bitcoin will be a collectors item like an antique and still be worth loads. Some other crypto (or something else entirely) will likely become the major form of currency and blow bitcoin out of the water. 
Source: I know literally nothing about crypto.

Dude just wants to buy some bitcoin, why the elitism?
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:45:19
Yeah, but I didn’t even know about it until recently - I’ve been out of the game for years :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:36:22
Well fuck it I've just bought. Let's see what happens :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:21:18
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:38:48
Well now I need to know what happened
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:45:44
So you think it’s gonna go up?
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:43:03
Oooh that was me. Good job I lost my private keys in that time! (Found them now)
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:57:42
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:41:42
Well I’ve just done it. I feel less dirty now :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:06:03
Oh shit ok whats your address I'll send them along
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:40:14
Oh right, yeah. Woosh:)

Personally I like having it on my phone, means I can easily send receive if I ever want to, wherever I am. I am by no means an expert so maybe you shouldn’t listen to me though :)

I’ve just started using breadwallet. Like blockchain.info it has mobile app, but unlike blockchain there is no online wallet so it’s more secure. Plus it’s sexy.

Probably blockchain.info
