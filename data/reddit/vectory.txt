This is good to know. Makes me feel more confident about using this company.

Shit, I need to buy some bitcoin.

It's a way to avoid exploitative [rent-seeking](

How does the Federal Reserve this sort of power? Isn't it just the government's bank?

Sorry, I meant "the bank established by the federal government to act as a semi-private institution which the federal government does business with", not "the bank owned and operated by the government".
Why does it have regulatory power over other privately owned banks, if it's just the bank used by the government?

What should somebody who finds themselves in that situation do?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:14:15
Nah, but at least it's idiot-accessible.

The first.
In the second, the only possible option is to bite the pillow and think about visiting Disneyland.

I am not a clever man. I am not particularly good with computers. I hear about this new bitcoin thing, and I learn it runs on my computer? Wallet files? Private keys? Encryption? I don't know how to do any of that... But there's this online service that says they'll keep my bitcoins safe? That sounds good to me. A bunch of people use it already, and I don't have to worry about accidentally deleting my wallet, or my computer crashing, or any of those viruses I'm sure my computer has.
For people who *are not computer savvy* an online wallet is easier to use, harder for the user to mess up, and more comprehensible.

Is that a thing your bank does, or what?
