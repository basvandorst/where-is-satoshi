Got my buy order set at $7.5k. Can't wait to get some cheap BTC. Let's speed up this dip its taking too long to get there
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:10:30
Everyone has been talking about it.

Haha /s

I'm all in support of everyone being treated fairly, but this organization looks like total shit now that I've looked into it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:31:30
I use every exchange with no problem. Bittrex, Binance, Cryptopia, Gemini, GDAX/Coinbase, HitBTC, etc.
Just get verified on each of these sites before you start depositing into them.

As someone who has become increasingly annoyed with wh\*te people lately, I love this tweet!
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:07:32
That is what I've been considering. I wasn't sure if both split currencies could continue to exist long-term (which would mean I'd have more coin to mess with), but most people seem to think one will die out entirely quickly, unlike Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:57:34
Buy from an exchange like Coinbase. You don't really need to transfer such a small amount to your wallet though, in my opinion... you could just move it (free and instant) to GDAX to mess around with trading, if you think you'll get into that. Right now the network is a bit clogged so transferring to your wallet might take a bit more time/money than you'd like.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:51:43
Nice work
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:27:46
this is like an extended /s

Take advantage of the roller coaster :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:23:32
I've been thinking the opposite, "Ugh, it hasn't dropped THAT much, I'll buy even more when it finally gets lower!" Except now I'm not sure that it will get as low as I thought it would :(
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:26:12
Oh sorry what I meant was, if both 2x and BTC survive for a while (as happened with Cash), then investing pre-fork interests me, because I'd mess around with the 2nd coin that we will get. But you are probably right - it would be better to just wait, and buy when the price is lower, to just have more BTC.

That is not the cheapest fee on Mycelium. Drag over to Low Priority, then drag the price wheel over. I regularly make $0.01 and $0.02 transactions. I just did one yesterday, and one 3 days ago. They take like 8 to 14 hours to complete, but I really don't care. I use confirmtx.com to speed it up for free, I have no idea if that works but it only takes a second to do and doesn't require an account.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:37:17
I didn't, I should have probably sold a bit yesterday, but I think BTC will be back up next week so I am holding it. I have 0 BCH, I only have BTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:46:46
OK thank you! I will transfer to GDAX and wait, I won't be missing out on much in those 4 days since I don't have much money to invest anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:03:57
just use any exchange that does btc and bch, like bittrex
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:46
Just move the bitcoin between exchanges. On Bittrex you would go to your Wallets, then go to BTC (Bitcoin) and click the +, and generate a wallet address. Then send the BTC from your current exchange to that address (maybe do a small amount at first, to make sure it works). Then just buy BCH with the BTC!

When I went to last night 3 top posts on the front page were by this guy. I guess they mixed it up since it just looked ridiculous.

as someone who has never seen a Tesla, i figured this was an economy car with a nice display
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:16:00
Sorry, I do not know. There are other exchanges that do BTC and BCH though. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:12:11
I do $0.01 and $0.02 transactions regularly with Mycelium. They always complete after like 8 to 14 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:06:42
I get the "Unable to broadcast" message if I do a $0.02 fee, but it still goes through eventually. The message will switch as soon as the confirmations start, but it might take like 12 hours for that to happen.
Today might be different though, since today there are 100k unconfirmed transactions (I've been doing transactions when there are under 50k unconfirmed).
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:46:09
This happens a lot of the time with the most mainstream sub for a popular thing turning into Meme Central and having lots of other low-info posts. I usually don't feel that trying to fight it is the right idea - its better to get actual info from elsewhere, like a separate "serious" Bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:22:53
Congrats dude. I'm just waiting on my bank to confirm my account and I'll be joining you with my first small Bitcoin purchase :)
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:53:53
Oh ok, thanks, I never heard of him so I thought he was just a Twitch guy
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:46:52
Who created this clip? Does he make his own clips like this?
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:34:49
Oh yeah I just meant who edited the actual Bitconnect segment, because its well made
