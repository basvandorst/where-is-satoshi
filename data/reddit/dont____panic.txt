It means something different for securities trading that it does for numismatics or discussions of currency. 
In this context it means:  “what is it worth, even if people stop using it as a means of currency”. 
Gold has some intrinsic value due to its usefulness in electronics. But it’s market value is much higher than its base intrinsic industrial value simply because people “believe” it has that value. 
On the other hand, for example, coarse iron is priced basically exactly at its base intrinsic value as a resource commodity for use. 
The criticism of fiat currency is often that it is based solely on a promise of worth.  Fine metals (gold, silver, etc) are *partially* priced on that same principle, but commodities such as oil, iron, foodstuffs, etc are priced exactly according to their intrinsic value. 
That’s why a food-heavy CPI is commonly used as a basis for measuring inflation of various forms of currency.

Lots of crypto currencies don’t use Proof of Work.
There are at least 2-5 other methods of validating a chain/leaf/node on a crypto-ledger.

Gold isn’t a “true” store of value either. It’s been a very persistent one because of its age, but there is nothing “true” about it.

Huh?  I gather you got that from a misreading of the definition of numismatics. 
Numismatics is the ***study of currency***. 
“Collector coins” is just one narrow (not very interesting) part of that.
When referring to ***currencies***, the above definition applies.

Scaling the blockchain is a big one. Even with off-chain concepts like lightning, without doing a full tree-and-leaf, a theoretical ledger of even a fraction of all global transactions would be terabytes per month. A blockchain that tried to hold all of that would need to be petabytes in size within just a couple years and would confine to scale faster than the historic expansion of storage technologies. 
I believe It would quickly become untenable to have a “real” distributed single collective blockchain of all past transactions, and requiring a device such as a mobile phone to parse all history of this chain to determine the balance of an address is extremely problematic.  Maaaaybe not impossible, but extremely problematic. 
Also, proof of work as an algorithm for a single global currency would absolutely require that the network always be “burning” a significant fraction of the available computing power on earth and likely a similarly sized fraction of the electricity.  It doesn’t even “need” to do this, as a “proof of work” is not a hard requirement for a blockchain or a cryptocurrency. We currently burn about 3% of the worlds electricity and as much as 20% of the worlds total floating point computing power doing random and arbitrary reverse-the-hash math puzzles simply to prove that any given node on the blockchain is valid and prove that it’s unlikely someone has faked the ledger. 
I don’t think this is ecologically or economically tenable if the currency were to become globally dominant. 
Other issues with bitcoin include anonymity issues. If you give me your wallet address for a payment, I can look and see what other people payed you and how much and when. If it’s your primary personal address, I can see your salary, the amount you spend on your car and your house and possibly which shops you use or where you buy your sex toys and for how much (assuming these shops are using regular, stable wallet addresses). Bitcoin makes no effort to mask any of this (it’s in the nature of a public blockchain). 
Lots too many issues for it to become a dominant global currency, in my opinion.

That’s the reason they won’t do it. High risk of default. 
I remember January 2018 when a bunch of people cashed out their retirement or mortgages their house and maxed out their credit cards in a frothy spooge of FOMO and claims every day in that bitcoin at $1mm/coin was in the near future. 
Those people all fell silent and many sold out on the way down, falling into debt and despair. Many would still be upside down even if they held until today. 
Going deep into debt on a highly volatile asset is financially insane and the banks don’t want to underwrite that risk.

Thanks. This is great information.

Bitcoin, as implemented, cannot scale to the global market economy. The blockchain (even with lightning) will become untenably large and unweildly as block sizes balloon to accommodate increasing throughput and the PoW system is untenably power hungry to legitimately continue to power a world economy. Under the stress of a global world, POW essentially becomes about wrestling the bulk of the worlds computational power into essentially useless computations, simply to prove majority vote. 
None of this is tenable for a long-term solution to transaction processing. 
I support cryptocurrency concepts, but leaf-node chains with another proof system are essential to avoid these pitfalls and bitcoin currently has no means to fork into those concepts.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:44:56
So, fiat has the same intrinsic value, correct?
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:58:18
Sure. I’d argue it’s less durable.  I lost a buncha BTC in a drive crash that ate my private key in maybe 2010. No worries, I thought, it was only like 80 or 100.  Not even worth they drive they were stored on. 
They’re certainly the other things, generally.  Except if the algorithm gets broken, then they’re sufficiently untrustworthy that they are suddenly worth zero. 
But something missing here (because physical tokens of current don’t need to consider it) are:
- Private
- Scalable
Both are legitimate concerns for most crypto implementations and I’m concerned BTC fails at the latter and I’m certain it fails at the former. 
I also might add (bitcoin and gold fail especially poorly)
- Environmentally and/or economically inexpensive to make/maintain.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:25:10
Ok. PoW brute-force reverses several complex hashes looking for a pre-defined string of arbitrary value using an hash cipher of arbitrary complexity. 
Other than proving you can do an arbitrarily hard computational task, this computation has no relevance to the transactions. 
It then signs the transactions with this arbitrary key and continues on to the next block, attempting to calculate the arbitrarily difficult, arbitrarily defined hash for the next block signature. 
Nothing about cryptocurrency requires this. It’s just the first iteration of a stable chain validation system. 
It’s akin to a coal-fired steam engine in that regard. 
I see no reason why the world would want to globally standardize on coal-fired steam engines.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:55:40
What a weird ranty soup of words. 
Your issue with fiat is that it’s backed by.... faith in its value and nothing else?
Why was bitcoin worth only 0.01 a couple years ago?  Because it’s value is backed by only faith in its value. 
Blockchain represents a GREAT way to have a validated ledger of transactions. But the “coinage” itself is absolutely as arbitrary as any fiat. 
No, people can’t take it away or inflate it intentionally...  at least assuming the devs and early adopters don’t get in and muck up the system. 
But a satoshi is still just an arbitrary measure of value like a penny or a pence and has no relative intrinsic value. 
What if a flaw in the PoW system is discovered or quantum computers can crack the algorithm in seconds. 
Poof. BTC = 0.00
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:33:58
Sure.  But please don’t waste my time. 
I suspect this discussion will get old quickly.  It sure what you’re hoping to gain.

That’s well outside the definition of “inevitable”.

@_date: 2019-07-22 22:07:51
Their is NOTHING intrinsic in the value of BTC except trust that it has value. 
The blockchain is verifiable and the count of the tokens does not change. That’s correct. Those are all that it provides.  POW and decentralized ledger validation do that very well. 
The ***value itself*** comes ONLY from demand that people have for it. 
**It’s ability to pay for a cheeseburger or an hour of massage is QUITE arbitrary, just as much (or more) than any fiat.**
If someone makes “cryptocoin and the world adopts it, bailing on BTC, it’s value will drop precipitously. 
If the POW hash is broken (for example, by a practical quantum computer), the value of BTC **immediately** becomes zero. Boom. Poof. Gone.
That’s not something with intrinsic value.  That’s just an arbitrary currency with an apparently (but not certainly) reliable decentralized ledger and limited token supply.
The destruction of wealth in that latter example would make 1930s Germany or 1950s Hungary or 2000s Zimbabwe look like government wins.

I know EXACTLY how it works. I’ve wrote a pseudo-code explanation of each step of the chain validation algorithm for a presentation five years ago that a few of the popular YouTube channels cribbed from, I think.

Bitcoin purchase during a FOMO run so far has about a 100% chance of ending up upside down a year in the future. 
I’d guess if you trickled money in when BTC was flat for 2 years, they wouldn’t gripe, but when the markets gets hot and frothy, it is basically prime time to lose most of your investment.  
There’s literally nothing they loan for with anything near the volatility of crypto.

Can’t create bitcoin, unless you count the slow trickle still coming from the “mining reward”, but those will diminish to insignificance soon and end in the next 100 years.
Could fork an inflationary version I guess and try to convince people to use the fork that can inflate... :-)
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:50:26

Oh yeah, I mined a bunch a long time ago. 
Then I looked up the value and it was like $18.

Because it used to be profitable and it still could be if you have nearly free electricity.
But at standard US kwh rates, it's often operated at a loss.   Lots of the hardware was purchased during the 2018 spike in value, and as is clear, the actual compute rates have gone down as people pulling out of mining outnumber the people adding new compute hardware.

99.9999999999% of the processing power is just “burned” on an arbitrary calculation. 
However, it’s the “difficulty” of this problem that prevents fake chains from popping up and validates that the blockchain is valid and therefore all the transactions can be trusted. 
This computation is not strictly necessary and other means of validating the chain such as voting algorithms or “proof of stake” algorithms are useful for this as well, although perhaps less trusted.
Blockchain-like concepts including Nano, IOTA and others use these. Etherium plans to migrate to one in the future too.

The US maintains the world reserve currency (for now) and as such, they CAN just print money. As long as they can enforce the use of this currency, they have that power, but every dollar printed weakens that hold as it devalues the reserve, so that eventually it will be replaced.
When you “inflate” a currency, you basically “tax” (indirectly) all the holders of that currency, which, right now, is basically everyone in the world. 
If that “tax” begins to outweigh the currency’s marginal value, the value begins to evaporate more quickly, rapidly spiralling into hyperinflation. 
As a world reserve, the USD has a way broader base to draw upon for this “tax” than any other country in history, but it is not endless.

The biggest challenge is that the average citizen does not understand either the tech, nor the finance to a level that will allow them to operate a hardware on-chain wallet and keypair, still transact regularly and have access to the system, nor to really understand the danger of SMS 2FA, etc.
All of this is the realm of the top 5% most technically fluent people and will remain so, which will ALWAYS be a huge hurdle to adopting cryptocurrency.
That's a big issue...  It will remain so until there are more reliable means of handling this flow.
