I think I'd cash out like half, or however much it took to live comfortably and leave the rest, then continue to buy X amount every paycheck

If you hoping to buy low, sell high quickly then i guess you can say you lost $94.  As little as 2 months ago $10,000 seemed like a dream.  In the past month or so BTC has exploded.  It's not going to go up $5,000 a month but if you truly are holding, in a few years, you will have made a hefty profit.  There's post everyday on here about people paying off their house, debts, cars.  Just invest what you can and hold onto it until you've reached your goal or you're happy with you're earnings.

at $5,000 people thought they were too late, at $7500 people thought they were too late.  Shit I remember seeing BTC at $600 a coin and thinking damnit I should've bought some a couple years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:09:27
5 days?  the guy that commented above said it took 2 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:57:16
i must be lucky, mine just hit 2 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:57
well i gave it a try, let's see how long it takes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:44:33
they should give you an option to change it like most wallets do
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:41:31
Yeam man BTC can be a little scary with the huge day to day or week to week swings but if your here for the long run, those things shouldn't concern you.  If you look at a chart from when BTC started til now it looks like this / and i believe it will continue.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:40
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:34:57
I feel ya, you might've missed the get rich quick scheme, but there's still money to be made.  I'f you put $50 a paycheck in and in a year it went up 40% you just made a few hundred bucks.  I buy $50-$100 all the time, cryptocurrency  is so new.  20 years from now a coin could be worth millions, who knows?  In my eyes crypto is the lowest risk investment out there with big gain possibilities.  It is a volatile market day to day but if you look at a chart from when bitcoin started it looks a little something like this / 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:38
What he's trying to say is something like he buys at $15000 then sells at $17000 and tries to repeat the process to make small profits, instead of most people on here that buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:37:12
Yep and Gdax even pays your miners fee when you transfer to a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:31
gotcha yeah im just trying to transfer btc off gdax to a different wallet
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:59:45
is it possible that it never goes through and stays in limbo forever or will it cancel itself out at some point?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:54:27
so i would deposit into gdax, then withdraw into my wallet of choice?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:50:48
it's got a low fee considering how high fees are right now.  its like 157 sat/byte which would usually be fine but right now people are paying retarded fees
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:25:16
Yeah, it really depends where you live.  I'm in one of the easiest states to buy guns in.  I'd say about 70&amp; of people I know own or carry a gun.  From young men to old ladies, it's just the norm around here.  I worked retail for a little while and was surprised at how many little old ladies had little .380's in their purse, and these are good regular working people.  Seeing that made me feel like I needed something for home defense/self defense.  An AR might be overkill but with so many guns around, a home defense gun feels necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:27:58
Even if it's a bitcoin relevant question but a different coin is mentioned in the question, it get's shit on.  I understand this is a bitcoin subreddit not a crypto subreddit but if I was investing I would go straight to the exact two coins subreddits I'm considering investing in and see what their communities have to say about them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:11:17
I think I'm the minority but I like Coinbase.  Please don't downvote me if you disagree, if you know of a better one I should be using, let me know and I'll switch.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:32:05
Hold it and profit, then either keep holding or buy things you want with your profit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:29:18
And we're back!
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:56:42
Lol yeah at first I thought it was just a typo, then I kept seeing it so I'm like theres no way all these people aren't noticing the typo lol.  Thanks tho man
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:16:50
Yeah miners get their pay from fees but most are in pools, so they're paid what they contributed.  I cant just go and mine your transaction and get the whole fee.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:09:47
fuck no, no here is going to give you a whole coin for free.  We have people that have spent months, even years to acquire a full coin.  GTFO
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:54:34
bought, fuck it
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:08:39
lmao that's a huge request too
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:30:25
gotcha, well coinbase I believe has a set fee so I sent it over to electrum from there, I'm sure thatll take 24 hrs or so to make it there so hopefully our miners will be back by then.  It's kinda funny coinbase's set fee is usually considered high so it gets to where you send it extremely fast but right now I think they're the lowest fee out there lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:53:26
lol good answer
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:50:14
Upload your ID, they'll raise it to $750.  They already have all your info, might as well give em the ID
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:43
damnit, accidently bought using bank, won't see it for 8 days, oh well
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:54:29
You ready for the pitchforks and downvotes?  If you even mention Bitcoin cash in this subreddit everyone will start shitting on you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:27:35
You came here willingly and chimed in, maybe you are the one that needs to jump over to r/bitcoincash since you even clicked and commented on this post.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:58:51
I sent about $110 from one wallet to another
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:15:10
I think they both have their place.  Bcash is NOT taking over bitcoin but it'll have a spot on the top 5 or 10
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:51
Bcash is .05 more profitable.  that's such a small amount to cause a big swing. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:45:14
same here, pay check hit today that we're back high lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:24
You can mine ETH with your gpu them sell it or convert it to BTC, that's what I do
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:18:14
I bought into the panic and purchased something I've been needing.  I'm new to crypto and didn't realize how volatile it really is,
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:04:33
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:18:30
What wallet are you using, some give you an option to up the fee, or you can wait it out.  If BTC become like 2.5x more profitable than BCH like it did the other day you have a chance of going through.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:40:06
I'm a noob to this.  Does this chart tell me we have no miners?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:36:45
Yeah but your profit margins would be a lot smaller.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:47:08
Does this sub hate Coinbase?  I've never had trouble with it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:31:02
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:05:09
Oh well maybe it'll be $8k plus by the time it comes lol.  Since I bought today I get it at current price
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:41:57
If i was looking for info on drones, r/drones would be my first stop.  Idk what you're trying to say.  Is this subreddit toxic to new comers?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:57:00
gotcha.  It's got a $30 mining fee attached, I was hoping that would move me to the top but I'm sure there's a lot of panic investors moving thousands of dollars with hundereds of dollars in fees that keep pushing me back.  When I first sent it, it said 5 block wait time, now it's at 25 blocks and has stayed there for probably 8 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:04
Yes!  My transaction might finally get confirmed!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:08:44
There's no easy way to do it.  You'd have to have them set up a coinbase account, buy it, then send it to you, so if this is for a business then no but if it's a good buddy that owes you some cash, you can probaby get him to do it
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:47:57
Some people have their rigs in different states where electricity is cheaper.  I feel like everyone who kept mining BTC did so because they couldn't get to their rig lol.  Either way thank you Slush!!
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:46:20
I'm still tempted to buy but idk
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:06:24
I figured the people here would be able to notice sarcasm without a /s.  Of course I should've bought during the crisis not when we're on track to another ATH
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:46:21
Did Hodling come from someone speeling it wrong once so it caught on?  I was confused when I first got here and didn't know what people meant.  Is there some holdling thing I can do to increase my coins value? lmao
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:01:05
Some sports games let you pause but you only have like 2 minutes total til you forfeit
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:02:38
Hey man, you made a profit, and probably had a great day!
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:12:46
To Buy more...
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:05:04
Well I mean it is a BTC related question.  This sub seems very "how dare you ask or compare another coin to bitcoin?  GTFO"  If your post isn't "just bought more bitcoin" or still HOLDLING my Bitcoin" it's downvote central.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:13:54
you can send them to coinbase, then sell them and put the money into your coinbase USD wallet which is instant then buy BTC or you can use   I believe there is no fee for using shapeshift but you are going to be paying your eth mining fees and your BTC mining fees so expect it to shrink a little.  I use claymore's miner, there's also ethminer that works well too, but i prefer claymore's miner.  You're going to wanna overclock your memory to get better results.  nothing else matters, you can actually -100 your gpu clock and as long as your memory is overclocked your good.  Check if your card has samsung memory.  Samsung memory can handle some serious memory overclocking without crashing or causing problems. My memery is at + 950 and im mining as we speak.

reposted with a more relevent gif and no need to assumes sarcasm
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:34:56
Hmm, that's a good question.  $10,00 then buy half back (depending on how much of it was profit) in maybe?  I don't know
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:24:02
I paid close to 30% the other day
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:21:10
I have not bought a penny of Bitcoin Cash, nor do I plan to.  I invest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.  I'll sometimes throw a $50 into a really really cheap coin and see if it gains traction and gets me a pretty little profit.  Be in denial if you want but A lot of hype has been built around Bitcoin cash and a Train that size doesn't quite stop on a dime. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:52:55
Oooooohhhhhhhhh
