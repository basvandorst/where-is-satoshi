7AM Korea, things could get even more interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:13
Here we go testing that 13600 wall 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:08
14000 wall is tiny compared to 13600, also has support at 13900 will break 14000 wall easy
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:01:18
Yeah and also the biggest market, US really shit the bed on cryptos if Asia decides to sell off. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:31:52
Yeah no joke 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:09:04
Theres nothing positive about that huge 13600 wall and theres very little buy support. Asia will make or break this in a big way. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:02
Asia hasn't even woken up to see this (they are the biggest market not the US), if they decide to sell off only then can you call it a crash. At this point its hard to say what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:51
I doubt the exchanges actually crashed, just coinbase using manipulation in an attempt to promote BTRASH. Need to get rid of coinshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:00:29
Smaller than 13600
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:08:10
Is there any reason why BTRASH is BUYABLE and SELLABLE on COINSHIT but the other 3 aren't. Lmfao what a fucking scam.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:21
From what I see on cryptowatch etc its down several hundreds more
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:11:29
Lol you will see a crash if Asia decides to sell off, this will look tiny in comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:09:54
Adding to this I don't think we break that massive wall before Asia wakes up to actually start an upward trend. Buy with caution. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:07:16
4 AM for China
5 AM for Japan and South Korea
BIGGEST MARKET FOR CRYPTOS IS ASIA NOT THE USA
Expect to see a BIG swing one way or the other once they see what goes on. If you believe HODL if you don't SELL.

Coinshit 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:13
We broke through the massive 13600 sell wall, thats why things shot up so fast after the 13599 mark. As I type this that was a $200 swing. So there is upward momentum. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:47:37
The Asians aren't even awake to see this drop. Once they wake up and see it will drop even further.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:31:07
The 13600 wall has been up there for hours now lol... thats not on gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:13:31
Invest what you can afford to lose. Something big is coming one way or the other once Asia wakes up and sees the mess US has made. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:37
Looks like a bull run if it break the 13600 wall it will rocket up
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:50
Also looks like more buy support to stop it from crashing down than it had earlier. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:59:50
People really need to realize this, Asians are the biggest market for Cryptos and have the most invested in them. Coinbase really shit the bed and might cause a severe crash when they see the current drop.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:52
yeah... main support is at 13000 main resistance is at 13600 been hovering between those 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:34
Broken
