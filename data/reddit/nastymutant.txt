Bitcoin isn't a fiat currency though, surely? That's one of the main attractions

As someone who's bought Bitcoin almost entirely as an investment, that's exactly what I'm hoping for...
Am currently selling shares and buying gold and Bitcoin in anticipation of just such a thing...

I sold a load of stock the other day and am ready to sell more. 'The recovery' is just another bubble. The sovereign debt crisis was good fun, I got some cheap stock thanks to that. The debtor nations are a joke. We're being destroyed by our governments. I literally see Bitcoin and gold as rafts on the ocean of chaos, the best one can do for now to not get dragged under

RT doing their thing, eh... it's unfortunate for just some Syrian guy, but the piece itself says that that comes out of an over-zealous response to HSBC's own previous errors/crimes. The 'three Muslim organisations' mentioned and the Gaza connection insinuated is interesting but not as RT portray : it's not cos they're Muslim, it's cos they're Muslim Brotherhood fronts, chiefly the Cordoba Foundation, and it all centres around Anas al-Tikriti, a well-dressed, polite Islamist. When Cameron began a crackdown against them earlier this year, he and others protested that this was instigated by UK relations with UAE, which seems true.

The Cordoba Foundation and assorted Islamists and communists did a big letter to the Guardian which the Guardian have since removed, but anyway it was just a piece in defence of the Muslim Brotherhood and the eventual triumph of Islam on earth. Pretends to be all about human rights and democracy - classic :

This is after like 15 years of learning as well :'( always has been a crud system. Surprised Bitcoin didn't come about sooner.
Don't listen to the other commenters btw, they all work for PayPal for free at weekends

Yeah, I mean, none of this means that the banks aren't absolute criminal cunts in nearly every other way...

Hahaha... the bit where E J Fagan says that it's a big tool for evil governments... ah man.

I believe in this -

You reckon Bitcoin could be a great asset for the state? How come? I hope it's not
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:30:40
Nobody knows. It could collapse to $1 from here. I'll be pretty humiliated if it does but it could. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:35:47
I do. Carry on as though he/she said yes

Reminds me of this -

Yeah, he's no dimwit, whatever else we might think of him. I own some Bitcoin, I follow it and I want it to change the world but it might not and I might lose my money. I think I'm pretty likely to. It's risky. Buffett is strongly risk-averse.

You're right, I didn't know that. I mostly only know of them cos of their Bitcoin articles. Even that is too much. Lame site
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:32:23
Oh dear
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:08:09
...and I don't draw shit.
Ow! Fucking fascist!

Jackie Treehorn Productions? Hahaha
Good site (Y)
