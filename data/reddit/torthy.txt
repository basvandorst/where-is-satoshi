I live in Romania. A 1000 Mbps line costs $17 per month. If you only want 100 Mbps, that's $8.  And there are no  upload/download caps.

I meant the second step, the one when they send Storjcoins in exchange for the btc you send. The Terms say "We recommend you use Counterwallet to send your contribution as you will see your Storjcoin X within Counterwallet immediately after we process the transaction with no further steps."  Well, I've sent my btc to the crowdfund address, the transaction went through, it already has 5 confirmations, I could even see my exact amount on the crowdsale page, however, there is no trace of any Storjcoin in my Counterwallet yet.

How much time does it take for the storjcoins to appear in the counterparty wallet after sending the btc funds to the crowdfund address?

501k? Surely that's better than having a 401k!

Very nice improvements! The custom fee is long awaited, and I just tested it. With the economic fee, blockchain.info said that my transaction was going to be included within 6 blocks, and it had medium priority, but in a few minutes it already had 1 confirmation. So even with the lower fee, transactions go through fast.

Why did they even keep the documents on their servers? When verifying   my account on Justcoin, they sent this reply to my email: " For your security we have already permanently deleted our copies of your emailed documents." Every exchange should do that.

Both btcd and bitcoin-qt take a lot of time to synchronize, and I mean a lot. Even with bootstrap.dat downloaded beforehand, btcd has been running on my core-i5 laptop for 30+ hours, and it is still somewhere in september 2014 with the transactions. So it will probably take another 24 hours to be up to date. No wonder there are less and less full nodes run by enthusiasts, especially without any financial incentive to pay for the electricity/bandwith at least.
