My liquid is Dekang, I need to add that to the descriptions.  I have now added eGo-T tanks, thanks for the reminder.
I do want to lower my prices to be even more competitive, once I am slightly more comfortable transacting in bitcoin.   As I get more orders, my own costs from my supplier go down so I'll be able to pass the lower prices on to my customers.

the products currently have a fixed USD price which gets converted automatically with the current MtGox exchange rate.  Hope to be adding Tradehill when their API is ready, and maybe take an average of the exchange rates over a recent short span of time from various exchanges.    
Eventually, as the bitcoin community expands and/or the exchange rates become less volatile, merchants like myself will be more willing to price things directly in bitcoin

yes they are dekang, I will be adding that to the description shortly.   I am considering selling other vendors, do you have some favorite juices you'd like to see available?

Thanks for the comment.  I have received dozens of packages from my supplier, and others in China, in 4 business days via the EMS shipping method.   When tracking my customers' orders, I am seeing the same.
Many vendors in China ship via the cheap China Airmail which can take over a month to arrive in the US which is why I don't use this method.

I agree, I think we should keep growing the bitcoin economy at a measured pace.   I'm not sure the infrastructure is ready for Amazon.com and Buy.com to come online tomorrow accepting bitcoins and millions of new bitcoiners were to come flooding in.

The checkout process should be familiar as it uses an existing popular shopping cart interface.  When you do the final checkout it will give you a bitcoin address to send payment to.

Bring the gold and I'll bring me sack, don't be lookin for no trouble, I got friends to watch me back...
Bring the gold or I'll bring the pain. Sentimental or the dental if its gold its all the same.  
But once I had the 20MM in gold I'd still spend all my time messing around with bitcoins.

Austin, San Francisco, Seattle, pretty much the most tech savvy cities in the country imo.  NY and Chicago also high on the list, two cities known for markets and trading

I started telling my dad about bitcoin around $1.80, again around $5, $9, by $20 he was scouting newegg for video cards and planning a space to put a mining rig in his office!  After the $30 pop he now thinks fair value is probably around $5 for bitcoin but thinks it might be ahead of its time.  I'm a bit more optimistic, and run a bitcoin merch site and am soon to open two more.

aaaaand there goes MtGox.   With all the drama of today I've ditched MtGox altogether, my prices are now set based on the Tradehill exchange rate

Here is a list of existing bitcoin shopping cart interfaces - 
if you can't manage to implement one of these you should be able to hire someone who can help you set it up.   Eventually these things will be more matured and user-friendly
