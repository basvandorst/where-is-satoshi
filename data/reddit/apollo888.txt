It leads me to believe that something changed around June of this year and its been a slide down in uniques ever since.
That something was maybe the start of the 'censorship', or perceived censorship at least. 
I guess it all depends if you guys are bothered about uniques and what type of sub Theymos wants. It seems to me that he doesn't want what used to happen here thus is accepting a smaller but more controlled community. Which as he 'owns' the subreddit (under current reddit rules) and the mere subscribers opinion is moot, is his call to make.

Someone coming every week for $1000 worth of bit coins could be a regular drug buyer, shit probably is a regular drug buyer, but they could also be someone who sells them on and has their own side business selling coins to family or friends, or could be paying their high traffic website in BTC or something else.

Just the thought of them poking into *everything* you do financially gives me the creeps and I couldn't imagine actually having tax dodged ever sleeping at night knowing that you are one phone call away from ruin and prison. 
Jesus, even other federal agents are scared of the IRS. And if the NSA can do what they do, why *wouldn't* the IRS want a piece of that action?

@_date: 2014-05-21 11:46:56
Estimates are that over 50% of coins are lost. The evidence used for this is the fact that that amount of coins have been mined and not moved for many years so its not a super accurate guess as they could be just being stored etc., but it is likely to be a large percentage gone for ever. North of 20% easily.

But you won't and you don't. Its one thing *you* wasting your money but talking your family into this money pit of pump and dump (where the pump phase ended over a year ago) with you is just a shitty, shitty thing to do.
Do you keep them posted about bad news too? Let them know when scams are happening? Or do you just tell them about the bitcoin bowl and moon soon? Are they aware of how bad a start to 2015 its had?

It isn't it is always 50/50. (Discounting 'green'). The wheel has no memory.

Yeah starcitizen attracting hackers at launch seems a bad idea.
They'd have to worry about securing their system of exchange and also consider all the game theory implications of real money existing within the game too.
If there were thousands of coins floating around their servers they place a massive target on their back and even actual bitcoin exchanges struggle to remain secure.

*See: americanpegasus - when people like him become one of the loudest voices in your sub you should really, really, really, take a look at where things are going. He jumps on trains just as they derail.  You have teenagers here with zero knowledge throwing out 'investing' advice to people like Warren Buffet (who they hilariously deride as 'past it') when they have 0.5 coins bought at $800.

Thats because in this sub people try and bury bad news.
Not the mods, they are actually good in this sub and allow people to argue and give other opinions and stick to just trying to delete spam and multiple same subject threads (see: mastercard), some of the users hang out on /new all day ready to downvote negative posts for 'trolling'.

Sell it all NOW before it goes to zero.
You DO have an option, it is only greed stopping you selling immediately.
Sell now, admit you got scammed, be more careful in the future. You will sleep better, you will be a nicer person to be around for your friends and family and you will have paid for an expensive lesson.
Or you could do nothing, paralysed in fear and doubt, with a tiny sliver of hope that it will be all ok, this for the few weeks or months it takes to become clear that you've lost all your money. At the point its clear to you it will be clear to the other bag holders and you won't be *able* to sell the coins.
People talking about the scam are not ruining your 'investment' (gamble not investment), think about it. If the investment was really that weak that it could be ruined by a few 'trolls' on reddit / bitcointalk then is it really robust enough for you to keep your money in?
Yes you may have lost upwards of 70% of your money now but that is better than 100% right? You can still walk away with a little bit of pride in yourself that you pulled the plug before it completely died. You were still smarter than most of the others. Certainly smarter than the person you sold them to. That's the point you see, its *people* at the end of all these crypto schemes. Brothers and sisters, wifes and husbands, mums and dads, all trying to make a better life for themselves, all honest people (if a little greed blind, but I make no judgement, we've all been greedy at some point) who exchange real hard earned currency for these scams. 
Currency to be spent on lawsuits and bodyguards to defend the indefensible.

You need to look into anti-SLAPP statutes ASAP if you are not already.
Also, contact Ken @ popehat blog for help, they HATE people using lawyers to stop speech especially on small blogs, they often get top, top lawyers to help pro bono.
Not everyone of course but don't be bullied, the legal profession is not mostly shady, the vast majority hate this shit.
PM me for further details. IANAL but I *have* been involved in this kind of thing with porn copyright holders blanket sending letters extorting money, we were hit with a frivolous lawsuit trying to silence our *internet comments and posts* about it. Popehat and the EFF fucked them *hard*.

Yes but they are seizable as a physical asset. If digital money it is a reversible asset. If bitcoin whoever has the private key controls the asset with no recourse for them to get back other than voluntarily being released, hence they want identity and credit checks.

This isn't 'just' an SEC investigated scam now DHS are involved and they are relentless. Anyone who has their personal details on cryptsy are putting themselves in danger of DHS looking at them, and almost as bad, giving Garza the ability to dox you using the crptsy information.

Touched a nerve there?
It's true.
You can put your fingers in your ears all you like, but if you weren't part of the 2009-2010 crowd, especially if you are a 2013 post - gox person,  you are a late adopter thus bagholder.
Its just fact.
Also, there is no legit way to short bitcoin without using a dodgy exchange who could just run off with my profits.
And morally, its the wrong thing to do. Unlike you I am not looking to profit off my fellow man in a zero sum game of pass the bag.  Even if I win I lose some self respect.
The only way you make money on bitcoin speculation is if somebody else loses money and I prefer to be able to sleep soundly at night than make a few $$ off some grandma who has been badgered into buying bitcoins in late 2013 by a neckbeard grandson.

Best case scenario the funds are frozen and no-one can get them.
Worst case scenario, the escrow third party signature is a scam too. Think about it. No reputable company is going to escrow an illegal drug market so you are left with shady people as the third sig.
