How does Snowden connect to Bitcoin? Other than being a nerd that the government doesn't like.

All the Senator says is that you can't use Bitcoin to pay taxes. Which I have no issue with. He does not say that you can't use bitcoin to buy a pizza, but Hess seems to be trying to spin the story so that it sounds like buying a pizza with bitcoin will land you in jail.

I've always thought this kind of thing would be what kept bitcoin relevant. It's a financial ejection seat. If you ever end up in a situation where someone wants to prevent you from moving your money out of a certain country, if you can buy bitcoin you always have a way out. Of course if you own bitcoin in the first place you don't really have to worry about this.

Coburn never said it was illegal to for private citizens to use or own bitcoin, just that it was illegal for the government to use it as legal tender. Which means the government cannot accept it as payment or pay people with it, and also that the government cannot require that people within the US accept it as payment. Hess tried to spin Coburn's reasonable statement into some imaginary law that makes the existence of bitcoin illegal, and a bunch or mouth breathers fell for it. The reasonable thing to is to read Coburn's letter, realize that it presents no threat to bitcoin as it exists today, and ignore Hess. Don't send Coburn a bunch of huffy-puffy letters just because Hess twisted his words.

Use your bitcoins to buy the two on the right hamburgers.

I was mostly joking. They could do this, but everyone would see it happen on the BCC blockchain and freak the fuck out. *Maybe* if they only did it to really inactive users with lots of BTC on Coinbase who wouldn't bother checking, they could get away with it. But sandball is right, huge risk for small reward.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:29:05
They can start dumping BCC coins now for some real BTC value, and then buy them back once the value has cratered and give you the now worthless coins.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:38:45
If you're just speculating / hedging and not planning on spending/trading your coins, you can print out your private key or key phrase and keep your coins offline. There's risk that you lose the piece of paper, but in your case it's not a life changing amount of money to lose. I feel like &lt;$1k investment isn't going to make a $100 hardware wallet worthwhile.

The most dangerous thing about bitcoin &amp; crypto currencies is that they don't care if they are legal or not. Good luck enforcing a blockchain patent on millions of wallets all over the world, not to mention all the altcoins and ICOs and non-coin blockchain tech.

I tried listening to that podcast because I had a feeling they would talk about bitcoin. Had to bail before they got to it because it was basically a Schiff lecture with Rogan barely saying anything.

I was one of them. Learned my lessons and came back in summer 2015.

Will swaps through border nodes be free? Because if they aren't, I don't think it's a solution at all. Imagine if your bank charged you a small fee to transfer money from your checking account to your savings account. I would find a new bank.

The whole thing assumes that the 21e8 block and possibly the gensis block were vanity hashes. Vanity has means the block finder wanted a specific pattern to appear in their hash, so they used some kind of quantum super computer to find a working hash that fit their criteria *and threw away all the other working hashes they found along the way, basically throwing money away*. And they had to do this quickly before someone else found a new block and they had to start over. Basically impossible with tech that is known to exist today.  
The counter argument is that 21e8 is nothing special and not a vanity hash. 21e8 has shown up in the block hashes before. People are arguing that the two following zeros (21e800) are part of it, but they could easily be random too.

I'm guessing this is 100% for store of value purposes because no way are they paying current fees or waiting a couple hours for their transactions. Unless they're all using SegWit wallets.

The old days where all you needed was a Bitcointalk announcement thread, an "under construction" website, and a working fork of some altcoin blockchain to make millions.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:36:29
I don't think it ever will, and if it does it will be there for a day and then crash, kind of like the $20k level in 2017. $100k BTC would put the market cap at almost double any single private company. That means something would have to change so that the world decides that BTC is worth more than Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. I don't really see it happening. I could see it getting above the $20k level and staying there though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:40:33
Honestly probably $60k. It's extremely risky and volatile so %10 of your assets seems like a reasonable cap. Basics of risk management are that there are four possibilities in an investment: You make a life-changing amount of money, you make a non-life-changing amount of money, you lose a non-life-changing amount of money, you lose a life changing amount of money. You want to eliminate that last option at all times.

I love it when they use the term "Cyber" to talk about this stuff. It's like stamping "IDIOT" onto your forehead. Nobody who knows anything about technology has ever used "Cyber" to describe anything in real life.

Yeah IDK if OP noticed but there was a major terrorist attack the other day. That might be drawing some coverage away from "internet money gettin spensive"
@_date: 2015-03-28 12:58:13
This is pretty much the space it occupies now. When a government becomes hostile to its own people, devalues the currency and tries to either take or lock up the money in the citizen's own bank accounts, Bitcoin will become very important to that country. Traditionally paper US dollars would show up and fill that gap, but it's a lot easier to get large amounts of bitcoin in and out of repressive countries than suitcases full of $100 bills. As long as the internet infrastructure is still there of course.

It's fucking Venezuela. Anything that makes the government mad is illegal. No law necessary. Pretty sure it was "Electricity Theft" though because subsidized electricity is only meant for certain approved uses.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:12:33
Venezuela did this and it was pretty fucking effective. Bitcoin mining got big when their currency collapsed because they basically give away electricity for free. But they quickly caught a handful of miners and threw them in jail, and everybody else unplugged their rigs because they didn't want to go to jail. Would you continue buying/using bitcoin if it could lead to jail time?
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:57:00
It sounds like they want people to be able give WU cash and then have that money show up in a Coinbase account, at which point they can use it to buy crypto or whatever. Or sell their crypto in Coinbase and pick up the cash at WU. For developing countries where people might have cash and a smartphone, but not an easily accessible bank account. Only desperate people would use that because you're paying WU fees and bitcoin fees, but probably only desperate people are using WU at all anyway.

I bought in for &lt;1BTC at around $1k, sold at 830. Lesson learned, speculation is bad kids. don't do it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:59:42
This echos my own thought process. For years I thought of bitcoin as a fad and a ripoff. And I thought, you know what else I said that about at first? The iPhone.

It also presents a problem when people have real wealth, as in more currency than they will ever need to feed, cloth and shelter themselves indefinitely. Right now there is an incentive to invest excess wealth in non-currency assets wherever possible to avoid being hurt by inflation. If currency is deflating significantly and consistently, there is incentive to hoard currency rather than invest it. Wealthy people's bank accounts become economic black holes, driving the price of remaining currency even higher. You see this now with bitcoin where the majority of coins mined by early adopters haven't been spent on anything.
