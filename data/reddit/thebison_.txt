I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now, and the more I see it gain adoption the more excited I get about its future.
I've been thinking about selling my McLaren for a while and when I saw that Lamborghini Newport was offering Bitcoin sales for their inventory a few months ago it made me curious to see what would happen if I offered my McLaren for sale for bitcoin-only.
I know it's not common for people to sell "high cost" items for Bitcoin, but I'm hoping that Bitcoin sales of all sizes become commonplace as Bitcoin adoption grows. I'm planning on buying a new car later this year and I'm hoping that transaction will also be in Bitcoin. Bitcoin and cars are two things that I love. It would be great to see more cars being sold for Bitcoin.
By the way, I also saw the post a couple days ago about the guy that bought the Tesla "for Bitcoin" but turned out that he converted his Bitcoin to fiat first and then bought the car with fiat. That's a great start, and I'm glad that Bitcoin indirectly enabled him to buy his dream car, but I'd love to see more direct Bitcoin sales. Hopefully this encourages others to do the same!

Your post title really trivializes the process of designing scalable web applications and server infrastructure. It's not as easy as you think.

You might want to check out Crossrider if you haven't already: 
It lets you maintain a single codebase and automates the process of exporting your extension to all platforms. I've used it for a couple projects in the past.

Because I think the prospect of seeing positive changes in finance, politics, business, communication, etc. outweigh the risk of losing some money. I understand the risks.

It's a valid question. I'm definitely not annoyed.

Seriously? I already answered the question 8 hours ago...

What Auction House did you have in mind?
Alternatively, if you think you could make a reasonable offer I'd be willing to consider ending the auction early and settling on an agreed price.
I'm heading back to Los Angeles next week and you're welcome to come check out the car for yourself.
I'll send you a PM with my email address.

I've heard about that. I was trying to help a guy in LA buy an Aventador to export to Manila a couple years ago when they were first being shipped to customers. He ended up backing out because it was going to be way too expensive by the time it was through customs.

Chinese ATMs usually have an internal furnace that burns and destroys all deposits. This is actually what causes most of the air pollution problems in Beijing in Shanghai.
Don't feel stupid though. Most laowai don't know about this.

I believe Amazon had an auction site in ~1999. It never worked out for them, and eventually they became what they are now.

Awesome. This is great for developers. Thanks Blockr.io team.
Are you guys going to offer testnet in your API also?

Kraken is working on Japanese localization from what I've heard. I've met some of their guys at the Tokyo Bitcoin meetup.

LocalBitcoins is going to have a much larger network of local bitcoin traders than my Facebook friend list would.

UMDZete has the right idea...
Personally I'm comfortable with the risk of price fluctuation, but a lot of buyers wouldn't be.
If the price were to shoot to $1k/BTC right before the auction ends, I could imagine a buyer being upset and expecting me to adjust the price or outright refusing to pay. Not worth the drama, if I can avoid it.

These look great. I just ordered 100 from the order page. I'm involved with a startup that's developing a Bitcoin hardware wallet and a lot of people have Bitcoin questions when I tell them about what we're working on.
I should be able to distribute 100 pretty quickly.

I think few people would argue that Bitcoin is a stable currency at this point. It's still very early in terms of adoption and liquidity. That doesn't discredit the merits of the protocol.
It's still early.

What kind of ID verification are they doing at this location? Is it the standard government ID + palm scan?
And what's the exchange fee?

I'm a big fan of the McLaren F1 too. It was way ahead of its time in terms of performance, and the middle driver seat was awesome. 
I bet your California Special Mustang GT is super rare in Manila. Looks great. Good luck with the sale!

So what stops someone from skirting the Mycelium fee by asking the seller to send the BTC as a standard transaction after they meet in-person?
