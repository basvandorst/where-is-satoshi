It doesn't matter how good an idea is, the person that deserves a payoff is the person that can execute the idea.
Everybody has an idea. Hell, after I introduce myself to somebody and tell the I'm a programmer a significant number of people say "Oh I've got this great idea!" without realize how much real work would be required to meet their expectations.
Great, you have an idea, which are worth almost nothing. Build something / have a talent that can be used to build or promote the idea, now you're worth something.

I'm not bashing people who organize plans. If they're organizing plans, that's a skill that can contribute the success of an idea. I'm saying that it's not the 'idea' people that turn something into reality. It's the 'idea + some kind of skill and / or a lot of hard work' people that do.

Of all these crypto projects, MaidSafe is by *far* the one that gets me most excited. It just looks absolutely amazing--almost too good to be true. If they can release an initial stable version, I hope it can catch on.

What jobs are 3 million truckers, mostly older than 40 and mostly overweight gonna take in 10 years when trucking jobs go?

That doesn't really mean anything.
The owner of the automation then gets the money that a person otherwise would

Where does the money go with automation?

Well obviously the fact that something that was previously criticized becoming successful means that bitcoin will become successful. Simple logic! Criticism = success

..what do you run? Solaris?

Huh, interesting. Just out of curiosity what type of development?
Yeah, oops! I forgot it was Unix.

I would love to see something like that on MaidSafe, although they are still building it out. Probably not ready for prime time until 2016

Wow, I'm legitimately surprised. I have never seen anybody on desktop use anything but *nix or Windows. How do you like FreeBSD compared to the more popular OS's?

So go somewhere else or build something better.
The fact that coinbase is the de facto standard right now tells me that it might be just a hair more difficult than you make it out to be.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:43:58
That's exactly what I'm saying--if there was something significantly better than Coinbase, it would take hold of the market. It's just more difficult than you make it out to be, so when you say 


it seems rather ignorant. When you work for one of the three big clouds you have hundreds or thousands of the most talented engineers in the world with years of manpower building every single product at a scale that most developers can hardly imagine. They have the infrastructure to throw out a new product (read: Google) and already have unbelievable levels of scalability. Most companies don't have the infrastructure at the same level, be it dev-ops, HR, engineers, whatever.
All I'm saying is it's easier said than done.
