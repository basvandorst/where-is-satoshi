It \*is\* for their own good. It allows them to verify that their traders are genuine people and not scammers, and provides accountability. Why do you think the banking sector invented KYC to begin with? It's to stop fraud. Your platform is highly susceptible to scammers.

Who do you think was responsible for the 20k bubble? It wasn't whales. If it were whales we wouldn't have even had a crash. It was the flock of novice buyers that were trying to get rich quick, and at the first sign of trouble panicked and sold in a cascade. Without them, the people buying the bottom don't get to ride the juicy waves, so don't be so quick to dismiss them. You can't sustain a bubble if people investing $300 have to pay 50% of their investment in transaction fees because they're moving coins from wallet to exchange and exchange to wallet. Why? Because they won't invest to begin with... 
And to say "high fees are good" is a ridiculous cop out. Obviously the lower the fees the better.

You could say that about a lot of businesses that have done exactly that. You've obviously never created software in your life. You can't guarantee security, and you can't guarantee bug free code. You can cross your fingers and hope for the best, but there are no promises when it comes to this stuff. To say they've "solved" the custody problem is hilarious.

Uh, what? The point of money laundering is to wash money from the proceeds of crime. So yes, it's illicit activity. The less cartels we have the better. And yes, it is a business decision to follow the law... It's a personal decision too. Like I said, if you're such a revolutionary and a leader go create a business and do what everyone else isn't. You won't, because you're a hypocrite.

Sure, but I think you're overestimating the amount of people out there that are 'of sound mind'. There are smart people in the crypto community, but there are still a large portion of morons out there. The average IQ in America is 98, and 98 is a low bar.

This is a large part of it. Not going to lie, I wouldn't pay any tax if KYC wasn't a thing.
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:52:58


No, I'm arguing that it's illegal because it's a criminal activity. That should be really obvious.


Okay, and selling stolen goods isn't illegal either, right? The act of stealing was BEFORE that point, selling the stolen goods is just some irrelevant after-activity. Everyone should be allowed to sell stolen goods!
I see money laundering in the same vein as the above, neither should be permitted.

Not really true, KYC was implemented to prevent fraud to begin with. Without it, those companies would be losing a lot of money and opening themselves up to the risk of being sued when someone scams them, among other things.

It is a business decision for p2p exchanges. KYC makes sense for them, even if it weren't the law. And yes, they should, I don't think they should sacrifice their freedom for a crypto exchange. It's not worth going to prison for. Easy for you to say when you aren't in their shoes though. Why don't you create an exchange and skip all forms of KYC and tell us how you go. Have fun fighting the government, I'm sure you'll do so well! Hey, why not make it a drug marketplace, if you're going to ignore the law you may as well do it properly!
 


It's factual to say that KYC prevents fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activity. So no, there's plenty of evidence for it.

Ya'll have a short memory. High fees is what killed the bubble last time. I remember paying $40 for a transfer around the peak. Until Lightning Network is sufficiently encompassing the industry (implemented into all exchanges, wallets, and everyone is using it instead of the regular network) there is no way we can see another bubble without hitting that ceiling again. As such, I actually hope that Bitcoin doesn't go up for a while. If it does, it's going to come crashing down again, and it won't be a great look. We need to be a little bit patient and wait for LN to have sufficiently planted itself.

Eh, nobody gets Ripple for nothing. The only difference is that it didn't spend electricity to generate it. But who said that is a requirement of a currency? It isn't. Value is not only derived by the effort it took to obtain it, it's derived by the items utility. Ripple has utility to banks and in the payment industry, so it has value because people need it for certain things. This is simplifying things and obviously there are others factors at play such as culture and scarcity, but to say that mining is a requirement to have a successful cryptocurrency, or that only mined coins are "authentic" is simply not factual.
Now, mining does help with the value proposition, like in the case of Bitcoin. It's easier to say that these virtual tokens have some value because there's this air of tangibility behind them due to being expensive to create, but it's more of a psychological trick than anything. At the end of the day, they're only worth what people say they're worth and what someone will spend on them. Having a cost behind their generation does help, but it's not a hard requirement if people can derive value from other avenues such as utility.
@_date: 2019-04-28 23:38:49
Plenty of businesses did, and a lot of them didn't implement it on launch because software development takes time, and they weren't aware of how much fraud they'd be dealing with. It's hard to know until you actually start working in the payments industry, until then you have no idea how rampant it is.
As for why does there need to be a law, well, why is there a law for wearing a seatbelt? Most people would rather wear a seatbelt anyway, but it's still a law.

@_date: 2019-04-28 03:06:41
KYC serves a solid purpose. For p2p exchanges, it weeds out scammers. For regular exchanges and banks, it weeds out fraudsters and money launderers. It also ensures tax compliance (and I presume you're in agreement that people should pay some level of tax). Without KYC, the banking sector would be a shitshow, crime would be at an all time high and people would be getting scammed left and right. Most of the large criminal enterprises get caught because of strange bank activity (like all of a sudden obtaining millions of dollars). If those people did not have a name to their accounts, this would go on unaided and the world would be overrun by these criminals.
So sure, KYC might feel like a violation of your privacy, but in reality it actually serves a useful purpose and it does stop a lot of criminal activity -- which is generally a betterment for mankind. And I'm not one to subscribe to the "why do you care if you're not doing anything wrong", but in this case it does hold water. There's little to be gained by these institutions having your ID if you're playing by the rules.
Anyway, it's easy for you guys to sit there and claim that businesses governed by law should ignore the law, but I don't see you putting  yourselves at risk. It's hypocritical to ask others to do that for you if you wouldn't do it yourself, and nearly all of you wouldn't have the balls to fight the government, so why are you asking others to? Seeing a whole lot of hypocrisy and naivety in this thread from people who don't understand the real world and are living in some anarchist pipe dream.

Until that fades from their memory I don't see a strong reversal happening. Don't forget we had a +3yr long winter before this most recent rally. If I'm wrong about this it'll still be sideways for a long time to come. We also need to consider the last two catalysts as well, the first was in large part due to MtGox and willy bot, and evidence is starting to suggest that this most recent rally may have been in part due to Bitfinex market manipulation due to the Tether scandal.

That's because Bitcoin is seen as an investment by almost everyone and not a currency, and so to assess risk you need to know how it works.

You're spot on with your assessment. I love the idea of a decentralized exchange, but in practice I think it has too many pitfalls. In the end it just comes down to trade-offs, it's not a net win. I also don't blame the founder for wanting to move on. Having a centralized organization results in profits for the business, which is incentive to continually improve the product, enhance security, and expand. Without that profit, the incentive isn't really there so over time these products fail to centralized ones because they have considerable financial backing. 
It's a cool concept, a cool experiment, and a cool dream. But at the end of the day, as much as it pains me to admit, I think a centralized product is a much more logical approach to the problem. Just because something can be decentralized doesn't mean it should be.

Err, I know exactly what a double spend is. Your rant is useless to this conversation, you don't even understand my question.
You clearly don't get it. The point is to strike a balance between convenience and security for your users, as a business. Obviously more confirmations is more secure, but if there was no balance required you'd say to set min confirmations at 1000 and make the user wait weeks for their funds. My question is what is the lowest feasible number of confirmations that is still 'secure enough' so that there's little realistic risk of losing funds, with the bonus of giving users access to their money more quickly.
Btw, it's lose, not loose. Next time try not to be so arrogant.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:48:14
Yes. It’s highly unlikely that we don’t retest the bottom at the very least.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:33:03
That's how you trick someone into entering a 2fa code at login, sure. That's not how you get a 2fa secret key though. The code expires very quickly, and according to Binance the attacker stole funds from all the accounts at the same time. Meaning they couldn't have used the same codes from login. Again, this doesn't add up. Their story is inconsistent and full of holes. If they're high value accounts then they're forced to have 2fa enabled.
Also, don't forget that you have to confirm withdrawals via email. So are we really to believe that the "hackers" got all of the 2fa codes for all of the hacked accounts within ~30s of eachother, and had access to all of their email addresses as well? Yeah, that's not even remotely plausible. Binance is full of shit.
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:10:01
Yeah bro, I'm sure these hackers stole "thousands" of phones. Your "attack" is not realistic.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:43:17
So what you're saying is their api keys can be generated without any sort of verification (2fa or email) on Binance? If that were true (and if so it's a massive exploit in Binance's security model and thus I don't think it's fair to blame this on phishing at all) then I could see how this could be the vector at which this attack took place. 
Phish a bunch of accounts, and at the time of log-in also generate an api key for them. Hold onto these api keys until you have the api keys for a lot of different accounts. Once accumulated enough, use those keys to send funds to a different attacker owned user (or users) and then withdraw.
I really hope that Binance isn't that fucking dumb though, but it wouldn't surprise me.
Edit: Ah, actually. It does prompt for 2fa. But I see what you're saying, it doesn't require a new token from the one you used to log in with (assumption I'm making here, but it's the only thing that I think would add up).
So basically, for those uncertain what I'm saying here: Binance's security model has failed because the 2fa code you use to log in with can be re-used if it's within that 30second window on other account operations. Thus the phishers automated system had no problem generating API keys for these accounts really quickly within that timeframe. Kraken gets around this by enforcing users to wait for their code to expire if they've already used it in the past. Binance is obviously missing this security feature.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:12:49
They have all of the features necessary to stop a phishing attack already, which is exactly why it couldn't have been a phishing attack.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:52:01
* 2fa required for high value accounts
* 2fa codes only last \~30 seconds, so "phishing" a 2fa code isn't a viable attack vector because Binance claims all of the coins were stolen at the same time, meaning they'd have had to have every single phished account log in at the exact same time to get all of their 2fa codes at the same time
* binance has IP locking, so they wouldn't have been permitted to log into those accounts to begin with
* binance requires clicking withdrawal confirmation emails, so hackers would have had to have access to all email accounts on top of the insane requirements mentioned above
Claiming it was a phishing attack is hilarious, that's such obvious bullshit. Binance is worthy of 0 trust right now, and they should be investigated by the FEDs.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:16:36

Good to know. Well if this is true for generating an API key then I'm stumped again. Further to that, it's my knowledge that Binance does do IP address matching requiring confirmation via email, so if the attack vector is that they allowed reuse of a 2fa code then how did the attackers bot bypass the ip validation emails?

Having the API keys from trading bots instead of phishing is much more likely, because if it were a phishing attack there would still be the problem of verifying the new IP address on login from the phishing bot. If it were an already generated api key provided for free to a trading bot then none of that is a concern. I think you're on to something.
