All crypto is in a speculative bubble. If you don't understand that it will eventually crash you need to get your head out of the clouds. That doesn't mean that certain coins won't continue growing after the burst or that crypto will die, but you need to be aware that current rapid crypto growth is almost all from speculation

Dropping to zero is impossible. Bitcoin has an intrinsic value of ~$1500 because of mining costs to produce 1 btc. A bubble means it's overvalued based on its usefulness, which bitcoin currently is. A 10% correction could be the popping of the bubble, or a 95% correction.

It's still overvalued based off what it currently provides. Mark my words there will be a FAT correction for ALL crypto in the next 2 months. Not sure why you rattled off a spiel on intrinsic value, I understand that. I was saying that a correction to 0 was impossible because of bitcoins intrinsic value. OP seemed to think that a bubble popping meant bitcoin dropping to 0

when it will be more convenient to use btc instead of cash

You need to remember your 24/48 word mnemonic. That's what holds your keys to your bitcoin, which aren't actually stored on the ledger nano

Is Scrypt enough to keep litecoin relevant? I assume it could hold good value as an investment if there is a breakthrough in Scrypt ASICs? Could Scrypt protect from supercomputer attacks?

Bitcoin is being replaced by layer 2 and 3 blockchain altcoins

This isn't as big of a deal as many people make it out to be, especially with amounts less than 10k. Coinbase stores only 2% of funds in a hot wallet, and if those 2% are to ever be hacked you are insured (

Are you buying more than one BTC? if not waiting for a dip won't earn you much and you could miss out on more ATHs, just buy any time.

Nodes don't randomly crash, and timelocks can be refreshed automatically as long as there are no malicious actors in the channel. There is no interest to be malicious because you will not gain anything except a closed channel

GDAX &lt;-&gt; coinbase transfers are free, and gdax fees are .25% I believe while coinbase is 1.5%

Also batch tx requires trust in the exchange, not a good direction

why would it be great for litecoin? doesnt lightning network solve the problem litecoin was created to solve?

You may use the 24/48 words in a free script called bip39 that will give you the private key that you may use with any hardware or software wallet to gain access to your btc.

I think a full transition to litecoin will happen as people begin to realize how much bitcoin satoshi actually has. Having a coin with proof of 0 premining is what is needed for crypto.

Bch is a temporary solution, when LN is ready the proper approach is to fork with Segwit and a 4x blocksize. BCH doesn't have segwit and the 8x blocksize will only scale transactions linearly to 56 tx per sec

A very large concern I have with the adoption of bitcoin is Satoshis wealth. He will be the world first multi trillionare, and we have no way of knowing his intentions. No one person should have that much power.

As complexity increases it costs more to mine each bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:00:29
your purchase gets locked in at the current bitcoin price. you wont lose any money if it rises.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:55:10
If you really wanted to you could calculate it with the complexity, your electricity cost, and heating and gpus, but it's kind of a hard calculation

They will be gone forever, and bitcoins in the market will gain value as a result. Every wallet lost makes your btc worth more
