Hmm very anarchistic of you - I thought the whole thing was about decentralising power.  If the greedy pisswads can make money out of mt gox then let them - let people choose whichever exchange they want, over time this is the only way a truly stable system will emerge.

Plus a reduction in the bloated size of the financial services industry - which arguably doesn't really produce anything valuable but instead sucks talent from more useful places and deepens inequality

Yeah dude make a documentary and try and pay for EVERYTHING with bitcoin - or get it free. No fiat allowed!!

Yeah good perspective - if you are interested in the price of bitcoin the  it may well go through bubbles but if you are interested in the actual use and uptake then that is probably a very different graph.

Hmm let's look at the evidence.  
a) Karpeles is gifted the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world and manages to run it into the ground - I think it's safe to say he is a moron. 
b) Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a cryptographically backed currency invented by a shadowy character goes missing from an exchange that was initially set up to trade Magic the Gathering cards. I think its safe to say something odd is going

It will essentially require new approaches to economics, the implications of that are hard to predict. For example:
- Inability for governments to alter the money supply, which could result in it being harder to manage economic cycles, but then those cycles may be changed themselves. 
- Free, secure and easy to instantly send money to anyone anywhere in the world - that speed of money exchange will probably open up markets globally. 
- Harder for governments to track wealth for taxation purposes, which will be handy for the rich to avoid paying taxes even more so than they do now.

I thought that Quantum entanglement is pretty well explained if you accept multiverse theory? 
Before observing either particle the observer exists in a supposition of possible Universes including both spin states, when you observe either particle you collapse the possible Universes the observer exists in.
Does this fit with Bell's theorem?

Free market capitalism suggests that it would move to a Nash equilibrium with a profit margin equal to the prevailing rate of interest plus a discount rate for the risk involved.  So 70 to 80% could be reasonable at the current risk rate, but in the future the risk may decrease and we may move closer to 100%.  in fact if Bitcoin underpinned the global financial system then it's mining may become subsidized by the state in which case we could go beyond 100%.  .

Here's a different way of looking at it:
4,000 Bitcoins are mined each day, That gives you about (roughly) 1 million bitcoins per year, which represents an increase in the money supply of about 8 % per year, if there are currently 14 million bitcoins.  (it's actually more like 10% if you do the Maths correctly).  
That may be a problem or may not, depending on the uptake of Bitcoin.  If it stagnates now then that increase in the money supply will inevitably lead to inflation, so your Bitcoin will be worth less day to day.  But if Bitcoin total demand in fiat grows by more than 10% per annum, it's not a problem at all.  That can be measured by the market Capitalisation in USD, which in the last year has dropped, however this could be considered a correction as over a 5 year period market capitalisation has massively increased. 
The fact that miners have to cover their electricity costs isn't particularly important, the increase in the money supply is the important aspect for price drops.
The biggest problem that you've highlighted in your analysis is the idea that miners want to make a profit and in order to do so they need to trade Bitcoin for USD.  This suggests that Bitcoin is not as valuable inherently as fiat currency.  It is this idea that is the biggest threat to Bitcoin.  This can be counteracted by encouraging society to use Bitcoin for transactions for goods and services - a good place to start would be encouraging electricity companies to accept Bitcoin.

it's only "fair" because you deem it to be so.  Your morality is entrenched in free market capitalism which seems to be to be anything but "fair".
