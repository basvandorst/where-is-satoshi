I used to be a buttcoiner, until I turned 15.

If anything gox and this should teach libertarian children why financial regulations exist in the first place.

People still keep their buttcoins on gox? I stopped after they got hacked in 2011.

Because deep down buttcoiners know their monopoly money ponzi scheme will be made obsolete by apple.
Apple's new payment system uses fingerprint verification and new patented anti-fraud technology, backed by major financial institutions and one of the largest computer companies in the world. Apple also has the biggest share of smartphone userbase worldwide, which helps with proliferation of the service.
What is buttcoin backed by? A bunch of drug dealers, computer hackers, basement dwelling computer nerds, Chinese speculators, and exchanges who have no obligation to give your money back other than possible word of mouth?
Yeah, I rest my case.

Just don't go running to the government and beg them to waste MY hard earned tax dollars investigating your fake virtual money virtually disappearing.
If you can't figure out that buying into a totally faith-based economy, with no regulation whatsoever, of a currency that doesn't even really exist, through a broker that has no compelling reason to give you any of your money back other than possible negative word-of-mouth, is a bad idea, then maybe you should really consider spending less time speculating on BTC stock and more time getting remedial education.
There is this new wonderful thing called cash. It is legal, and you can purchase whatever you want while being anonymous. There are no fees to use it, and the transaction is instantaneous, as no authorization is needed. There isn't a single thing you can buy with bitcoin that you can't buy with dollars.

Never heard of it, not sure why you think it's relevant.

You realize the word troll does not mean "anyone who disagrees with me" right?

What's with the downvotes? For a bunch of self-proclaimed libertarians, you sure are quick to censor opinions that go against your world view.

Maybe someday bitcoin will stop being a heap of shit, but we are talking about 'someday'. It's always talk and talk about the future because in the here and now, this shit is hardly ready for prime-time. 
And since I have no interest in becoming a techie to appreciate and innovate gadget ideas like btc because I don't have to, I have no use for it. I can use a smartphone without knowing how to build one. That's why smartphones are a success and btc is still a steaming pile of shit. 
Don't try to sell me a betamax and tell me it's Blu-Ray, and then complain because I don't wanna share an hour discussion about future possibilities or 'appreciate' the technology.
"Ease of use" defines currency. Defines it. Without ease of use, you got a bag of shit and have the fucking nerve to resent people who dont want to pay actual money for the worthless monopoly money you're shilling for.

As I've said, gold is just another fiat currency that has nothing on the USD. It's actually more volatile and much less practical for trading.  Fiat money is money without intrinsic value. Gold doesn't have any intrinsic value either. It's a fiat currency regardless of whether or not you can print it.
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:51:44


rofl, there is a reason I listed paranoid conspiracy theorists in the OP you know.
It's impossible for the USD to collapse anytime soon. Too many countries have large reserves in it to let it fail. 
And as Alan Greenspan put it: “The United States can pay any debt it has, because we can always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default,”

What big names and companies?
Can I head down to the grocery store and pick up my supplies with bitcoins? Does the electrical company take bitcoins? Can I go down to the car dealership and buy a car with bitcoins? No?  
What's that? I can only use it to buy overpriced stuff (which I could get for cheaper from amazon anyway) from shady internet shops with bitcoins? Boo fucking hoo.

Just trying to do the neighborly thing here. Most of you here are young people, you have better things to do with your hard earned money than giving it to the bunch of scammers that made bitcoin.
Go out, kiss a girl, and you'll realize obsessing over your worthless little electronic coins is pathetic mkay?
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:59:47
Though after seeing all you ingorant little idiots eat up all this pro-bitcoin propaganda, I do have to give props to whoever comes up with this stuff. Goebbels would be proud.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:40:15
Increasing demand for a limited number of bitcoins drive up the price. Price of bitcoins get higher and higer as newcomers put more money into the system. Early adopters get richer because of the money put in by late adopters. That is by definition a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:54:50
You're not very clever are you? Whatever bitcoins you can buy with a year's pay these days is penauts compared to what the early adopters are holding. A few thousand bitcoins is pocket change back in early 2010. All you're doing by driving up the value of bitcoins is putting money in THEIR pockets.

The only value gold has is the value that people put on it, like the dollar. It has no value in its own because you can't use it for much. If people decided tomorrow that gold is useless, then gold would be useless. It's a fiat "currency".
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:27:43
Great. Now tell me why is it bad to be doubtful of a ponzi scheme posing as a fake currency?
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:01:13
You obviously didn't read my posts properly. I've already established why gold is just as bad as bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:27:53
The fact that gold has been valued throughout history doesn't make it any less of a fiat currency. It just makes it the most stable and succesful fiat currency throughout history.

Crap. The problem is that I'm in Canada and it's a LOT of hassle to go to a bank, set up a USD account, get the USD funds somewhere, deposit it, and sent it to the dealer by wire transfer. 
Would using bitstamp be a viable alternative?

Well little thread, you've been entertaining. I must take my leave for the day. Hope you'll grow big and strong.

Modern economies aren't inflatory enough to turn all fearful over it. A 1.5% inflation rate isn't going to wipe out your savings anytime soon.

I stopped because the difficulty was getting way too high and I was only getting ~0.2 btc on a good day. Plus battlefield 3 came out.
