Well I mean, a share of GE has intrinsic value because you are entitled to some share of future cash from a dividend. An apple has value because people need it to eat. Could you expand on what you mean?

Gotcha, I think that’s an interesting place to start. So would you say (just to throw numbers around) 30% of the value comes from payment-network potential and 70% from store of value use, and then value each of those separately?

Okay, cool video but he never talks about how you think about giving bitcoin a specific value. Like surely you must believe it is worth 20,000 if you buy it at 18,000, my question is how do you come to believe it is worth 20,000?

Okay I see what you mean. So is the whole value of the BTC blockchain is as a payment network? How do you think about starting to measure how much that utility is worth in the future?
Edited to expand scope of question.

How does that lead you to find a specific value though?

Okay, but let’s go ahead and say all living things (I.e. people, who are the only ones who would wonder what BTC might be worth) want to keep living, and thus need things to live like apples and shirts. Then can we agree some things have value?

True, on an individual basis people have different desires in different situations. But a market will find an equilibrium price (where supply=demand), and That’s what the going price will be. How do you estimate what that equilibrium/intrinsic price is?

Okay, so based on that, how do you arrive at a value for BTC?
