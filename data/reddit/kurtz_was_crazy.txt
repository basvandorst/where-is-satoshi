Extra crispy is clearly what The Colonel intended his chicken to eventually become. Original recipe crispiness was arbitrarily chosen and there is no reason not to evolve as the market demands more crispiness.

Arresting the founder doesn't make the coin disappear. I don't understand why you think this would matter.

Yikes. I'm from Texas and we don't have state income tax here. I didn't realize state capital gains taxes were a thing. I think moving to a state that has one seems like a bad idea.
Just looked. It appears that Florida and Nevada don't have income taxes either (I got the impression that you were saying that they had "favorable" ones). Others that don't are Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alaska. Two others don't have it on wage income but do on capital gains.

It looks like the folks in r/bitcoinmarkets seem to be doing the same thing that traditional daytraders do. My understanding is that those strategies don't actually work vs hodling whether you are talking about cryptocurrency or traditional financial instruments. Could you line out the 8-10% rule you are proposing?

It isn't usually a silent comedy thing, but this clip from Frasier is a pretty good example that isn't Mr. Bean.

OP said they want to minimize their taxes. That says to me that in the hypothetical scenario they intend to pay the taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:51:09
Am I understanding correctly that your strategy is to wait for the dip before buying?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:51:05
Unless you have access to some kind of information that other people don’t (like unknown exploits or insider information regarding an upcoming major and market changing move the IRS, Chinese Government, or maybe Coinbase is going to make) then I think you are probably better off being a passive investor. I think that the market psych stuff is pretty much the avenue for the cognitive biases. But I could be wrong. I just get the feeling that I am seeing a lot of folks in the bitcoin world making the kinds of choices that folks in the traditional investment community finally getting away from.

What do state laws have to do with capital gains taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:48:44
You don’t know the peaks and troughs before they happen. There are cognitive biases that make you think you do, but you might as well be trying to time the roulette table for red and black coming up. Just buy/sell/hodl as it makes sense for your situation. Otherwise the only thing you are sure to be doing is taking the hit from transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:11:15
In order to check your strategy, could you make it explicit? After BTC increases compared to USD by 8% (over what time frame?), the rule is to sell. What is the rule for buying back in? We can check that strategy against hodling over the last 6 months (hindsight, but worth checking) and even better, over the next 6 months. Would it also be fair to include a 1.49% transaction cost, or is there something much cheaper than Coinbase?

Real quote from what appears to be a fake article.

In the end, it didn't really matter unless they wanted to give him the death penalty. But that would come up with a lot of appeals and stuff that I could imagine the prosecution would want to avoid because of some of the procedural peculiarities. Maybe they had a good feeling that they didn't need the murder related stuff.
I honestly don't know. It just seems a little odd that they wouldn't have tried since I think the life sentence was not a sure thing.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:38:12
I am pretty sure that is how fake news often works. It is just on the edge of believable given what is going on there, but it is still captivating with the silliness.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:36:19
It looks like the quote was constructed to get our hackles up. Google the string and this website is the only one with it. Look up Hin News and it looks like the website is not reliable.

It seems weird that they wouldn't have tried to go after him for that if they had him dead to rights. The fact that they brought it up but never charged seems fishy. Did they have a really good idea that the sentencing would be as harsh as it was?

It appears to be a fake news site. Quote is probably not real.

By that logic nobody should ever want to take their money out of the bank so long as the bank is paying some amount over inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:33:13
Checked out the website, looked for quotes and I agree with you. This looks constructed to tickle our prejudices. Hopefully this goes to the top of the comments. I really hate for this sub to be a vector for legitimizing fake news stuff.

Going away from the whole deflation trap thing. I am not positive (not super technically savy), but I get the impression that allowing more divisibility in the BTC is a possibility down the road with some changes to the code (assuming we can get the miners to agree).

But banks have had interest rates above inflation and people still bought things.
Edit: but I also think that your belief that there is something inherently deflationary about bitcoin is off-base. I know that is something people say to promote bitcoin. I don't think they are right.

Holy mole. That is just not true. People buy things with their money even when they expect their money to be worth more tomorrow. Even if you told me that money I don't spend on a sandwich today would be worth 2 sandwiches in a year, I wouldn't just forgo eating for 365 days. People buy stuff to consume and they buy stuff to make money.
I just realized, the same logic people are talking about here with expected deflation would lead you to believe that nobody would ever borrow money at an interest rate higher than expected inflation. They do. People borrow for businesses, they borrow to buy houses and some people even borrow to buy flat screen TVs.

We know it's coming and we know when.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:18:14
Yes. We would expect to see an immediate decrease in mining at that point. But not cut in half or anything, because the ASICs are specialized equipment and fees aren't getting cut in half. I also wouldn't expect the price of bitcoin to change a bunch because of it. People know it is coming up so it should be baked into the price.
Edit: On second thought, about the reduction in mining: I am not sure now. I don't know what the reward elasticity (or whatever the heck you'd call it) would be. My gut tells me it would be less than unitary but my experience as a student of econ makes me not trust my gut.
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:38:54


Yes. Because we know it is going to happen and we know when. If you thought that it wasn't baked into the price, then you'd be able to profitably arbitrage until it was.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:35:35
You think the price will rise dramatically as we get closer to that date because people are not taking it into account enough? Sounds like an opportunity to buy some more and make easy money if you are right.

That's like saying parents shouldn't be trusted with their kids. If you disagree with me you should spend time with me at the child protective services office.
You work in a place where people go because they have drug problems. Of course the people you interact with have problematic relationships with drugs. If they had no problem with drugs you wouldn't see them. It is a selection issue.

It is possible. But I wouldn't do it.

Because we all bought at $6k, duh.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:05:26
I am not ignoring that part of the discussion. I am saying it's baked in. We know that it is happening and we know when. If it's happening 6 months from now and we know that, we take it into account. If it's happening 100 years from now and we know that, we take it into account.
