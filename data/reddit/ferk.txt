Thank you!!!

Yes.. I bet the only reason they allow paypal is because they can still obtain a billing address linked to your bank and they can explicitly forbid paypal accounts that do not have a bank or credit card associated.
They use the billing address to determine if the location is legitimate.. I'm right now on Spain for holidays and there's no way to buy since my IP now doesn't match my billing address.

I wish some big company like Google started supporting bitcoin in the "google wallet" thingy. But how likely do you think this is? 
I mean.. wouldn't bitcoin potentially remove the need of any Google/Facebook/Paypal intermediary? are there reasons for them to actually support a system that could potentially take them out of the game?

You can also send CP by regular mail or using the internet. Do you think that this justifies shutting down the postal mail and all the internet servers?
If law is to be applied is should be to the guilty one who introduced that picture in the first place, not to the whole medium. I don't think this would be bitcoin's death.

That simply is not true. It's algorythmically regulated, the maths of a program determinate it.
I would trust much more the regulation predefined by a stable algorythm with fixed, agreed and clear rules than the regulation by a man/organization that may have its own interests.

When an idea is good/bad, it will stay like that no matter who's supporting/rejecting it.
It's not professionals, names or nobel prices what can change the perception of an idea, but proofs, reasons and valid arguments (these might come from professionals, though, but not necessarily).

Thank you for the corrections :) I'm not a native english speaker.
Maybe the optimal algorithm is not as complex as it may seem. I don't think that we would need an AI so powerful, especially if we don't really need to replicate the monetary policy patterns of the current fiat monetary system. Maybe some modifications to Bitcoin system would suffice. But again, I'm not an economics expert, I'm not even sure about what flaws does Bitcoin currently have, if at all.

I didn't study economy, but I guess it follows some patterns and rules and it's not random.
Couldn't a stable "monetary policy" be implemented in an algorythm that effectively makes decisions based on the same patterns the government could follow?
if it follows the same pattern, why would it being an algorythm and not a government destabilize the economy?
Wouldn't it make more sense that an algorythmically regulated system was more stable, since it can manage more variables, make more measures and calculations and follow rules more consequently than a human?

I don't have the time to discuss over the other, more technical issues, but this one is pretty obvious:


Bitcoin meshnet is the biggest supercomputer in the planet, beating the next one by an order of magnitude.
I highly doubt a 51% attack would be possible or worth it. And on top of that it would be immediately detected.

I think that those are too long names for colloquial and slang use. Maybe make them shorter to something like "milli-bits" or "milli-coins"... or maybe just "millis". You can just guess that you are talking about BTC from the context.

I think that this doesn't have to do with Bitcoin. I believe that the same thing could have happened if you stored other non-BTC related sensible info in MTGox or invested on it using other currency.
If you really want to keep your Bitcoins secure, just keep your own separate wallet yourself, transfering the money from your other wallets there. Have it encrypted, secure, and never share the key.

The value will be divided to the fractions of each of the 21 MBTC, so, even having 0.000001 (1 µBTC) will be enough value to store it.
EDIT: Or do you mean that 8 decimals are not enough?

For me, the nuisance of a password is not remembering, what I want is being able to type it fast. That's why I don't like long sentences as password.
@_date: 2013-03-17 11:28:31
I would guess that not a lot of cracking software tries to actually check for all the complex possible correct combinations in a sentence of the crazy english grammar rules (in case it is english, I'm spanish, for example).
But yet, in that case you could just always add something like "p4ss: " at the beggining in all your passwords (so it's likely you wont forget that). Easier than doing base64 conversion

I think they already have some sort of electronic wallet thingy going on.
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:23:30
then this by itselfs makes the coins pretty worthless
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:39:45
Even if it wasn't unstable, it's convenient for it to be resetted once in a while to reduce the mining difficulty and allow people getting them easily (even without faucet). They are intended to be worthless anyway, so a reset is no big deal.

I tried that.. but the hair never really completely disappears, and that shady darkish tone in the head feels like you still have that island of hair there when you look at it. It's less noticeable when I keep my hair long.
I guess I'm not bald enough to look good shaved, but bald enough for it to be noticeable when I have short hair.
@_date: 2013-03-17 14:34:11
I agree. It's certainly way less crazy than Spanish.
I'm not sure if there exists a grammar that is sane and is not part of some constructed language (and even most of the constructed languages have inconsistencies, maybe Lojban being the main exception).

It would actually be stronger than most password gibberish...  [relevant](
