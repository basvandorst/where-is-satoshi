So I have some beef with bitcoin... it requires SEGWIT to allow it to have a chance at being the globally used currency - the process takes up too much memory and so there is a relatively small amount of transactions that can take place at one time. This will be very limiting. Also bitcoin is ‘de-centralised’ but I’ve been reading that there are holders of very large portions of bitcoin that are in partial control of the currency that said that they wouldn’t allow SEGWIT to be implemented in the system. Thus totally shutting down the crypto’s chance at going global. The idea of bitcoin is brilliant, but I reckon another crypto-currency to come will go global.

How can you determine that. Not as long as there are majority shareholders that have a personal and selfish interest in keeping SEGWIT or any other memory altering process at bitcoin.

But what about ruples?

Anything to add to that? When did it go live on bitcoin and more importantly is it enough to allow it to be globally up taken and process all transactions it needs to?

I thought SEGWIT only hit Litecoin?? Or has it been implemented in Bit too? Thanks for the help, will look up lightning. Just trying to decide what crypto is best for small investment...

Yeah i haven’t been paying much attention to it, but it has my interest for sure. Do you know if that is enough to increase capacity to a suitable level?
