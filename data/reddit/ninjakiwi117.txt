By the way, I track forks here:

@_date: 2018-01-22 02:46:35
this is all of them, to my knowledge
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:12:41
You can check all the forks here:

Yeah, at the time $5 was the most that was worth it. now I've put in $10 more :(

I will try this. My Ledger Nano was set up with a legacy account. I'll see about spending the change output into a segwit account!

I specified the 0.0002676 fee. but what is this .05 Total Input???

I'm in my twenties and looking to buy a house in a couple years. If this investment fails it won't be the end of the world, but it will take longer to save up for the down payment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:45:40
What is an average amount to pay in moving from legacy to segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:09:07
Bits! 60 bits for a buck $1 has a nice ring to it
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:17
no, $16,000
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:21:33
I'll straight up sell you Bitcoin. do you use Google Wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:07
After 2 weeks, if your trans is never confirmed, it will be returned.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:15
Is anyone else addicted? 
It feels like such a compulsion. I have multiple alerts set on my phone and have limit buys in place and I still watch the price like it's my ticket to a new life. Every time the price dips I buy more and more. Bitcoin is closing in on 20% of my total wealth and as a young adult it feels reckless. How do you keep from falling down the rabbit hole?

Once in the middle of the night I dreampt my seed was written down wrong. So I had to get up, wipe my Ledger, and restore the seed to have peace at mind
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:48:53
You should keep your 0.00005877 BTC in Coinbase for now. When the price of bitcoin rises. They will eventually lower the threshold amount for you to leave.

This is really good advice, thank you

They are not billionaires! They are each half of one billionaire 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:34
Thank you so much! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:18:24
How often? on a schedule?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:18
hahaha I was literally thinking today, "ugh I've had this $15,500 limit buy in for a while. I'm gonna wait one more day and then raise it." glad I waited!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:42:48
That makes sense, thank you! Does the amount of change affect anything?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:13
I just sent my first transaction from my Ledger Nano S. 120 sat/byte, so fee was around $5. I expect to wait a while.
@_date: 2014-04-03 20:37:56
+10 doge
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:53:39
hey man, I have faith in you to make it through the dip. HODL and stick to your original plan for this buy.  You got this
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:51:22
THAT'S...BK! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:21:36
If a large enough group sells at the same time, then the market will adjust to a lower price, right?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:10:43
If the group is isolated than the rest of the market demand won't know and will continue to buy
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:34:35
You can send them to a new address, but you'll have to wait till the network confirms your transaction
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:36:07
but when you don't know how much you want to buy or when to buy...you just have to place small orders at the right times, during dips
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:46:48
Any exchange will take it right? Is there a limit on something like coinbase?
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:50:15
What's your target amount of BTC? Mine was 1.00 but now I'm trying to get to 1.10 so that later I can sell some and still be in the 21 mil club.
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:37
what do you think it will drop to?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:41:54
The network will confirm on its own. Your application syncing is separate. You'll have to look at the actual transaction in the blockchain if you need to know exactly where your BTC is. I would suggest waiting till your wallet is synced
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:43:26
I don't get why some coins are gone forever. Can they write something to find which addresses aren't being used?
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:34:29
Stellar can help with this!
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:20:45
