do you have any specific hardware-setup recommendations?
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:17:52
thx so much for elaborating :) I really think crypto currency dev. is fascinating and the relatively low learning curb of the 21 product was very appealing. However - the more I read, the more it seems like snake-oil.

I am pondering getting a 21, but see this "the hardware is irrelevant" talk all over the place.. Is it possible to do the exact same stuff on say a laptop as on the 21 hardware? What do you hardware nay-sayers recommend I use instead of this "overpriced raspberry pi"?

Also blockstreams "dev' buy up/lock up", and subsequent handwaving contest in the dev' community changed the dynamics of the whole thing from an adaptable forward facing community, to a reactionary, price speculation and censorship crazed circle jerk...

go along with regulation, all the Orwellian regulation too..let em' have it.. this way more people start using it and soon we'll have a giant userbase who find it as easy as swiping your Visa card. Then we flip the script on the suckas' and start using darkcoin/dash/monero/whatever which is just as easy as going from using you Visa card to using you Master card. Now we have a huge educated userbase who has to two choices. overregulated Orwellian money or private free trade. ^^

is it possible to install extensions like Ublock and Ghostery in Brave browser?
@_date: 2015-09-13 08:20:20
Dash is tho'

Indeed, i see it Playing out as follows;
Bitcoin incorporates all the existing compliance requirements the corrupt financial system wants, making all Bitcoin transactions an Orwellian nightmare.
Financial and political institutions will love it and push it, so adoption grows exponentially. When the average consumer finds a Bitcoin transaction as easy as a Visa card transaction, we switch it up on the MAN.
Now that people understand one crypto transaction (as easy as a Visa card), they will have no problem doing another crypto transaction (as easy as using Master card instead) and all of a sudden more privacy oriented coins gain momentum.. Before you know it free libertarian trade will be a reality... any other optimists? :)
