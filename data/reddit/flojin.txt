The thing is, there will always be thieves and crooks. Regulations are us doing our best to stop them, and they will always be trying to get around the regs because they are slimy people.

One thing that you, and a lot of people on this forum do, that I disagree with is make an arbitrary distinction between government and industry. Corporations are entities with power, as are governments. They trade power back and forth, and they collaborate as much as they fight. Corporations are de facto governments and governments are de facto corporations.
The problems of concentration of power and corruption will not be solved by either getting rid of governments, or by getting rid of corporations. Socialists seem to think that if we just got rid of the profit motive and private corporations, we could solve the problems of corruption and greed. And libertarians seem to think that if we only got rid of government meddling and let the free market run its course, we'd have the best of all possible worlds.
They are both utopian fantasies. Regardless of what we name these groups of power, we're going to have to watch them, control them, and expect abuses of power and shady dealings.

It's not incorrect any more guys. In the 1300s, the word "awful" meant "inspiring wonder." Are you furious every time someone says "awful" to mean "bad"?
"Broadcast" used to mean spreading seeds. Are you upset when it's used incorrectly to mean disseminate media over the airwaves?
"Cute" used to be short for "acute" which meant shrewd or perceptive, and "Fantastic" used to mean "to exist only in the imagination." Now it means "great" or "amazing." Does that also disturb you? 
Why only the word "decimate" when it's used in a different way? Could it be because it's the only word that you actually know the original meaning of? Sorry to be a dick, I know I'm being a dick, but just like people using the modern definition for decimate bothers you, when people pedantically wish we were still speaking Latin in this on and only case, I get irrationally annoyed.

He said that it's not worth letting a 1,000 flowers bloom on the innovation side if we allow money laundering and all the things it facilitates. That is far different.
His point is that innovation on one hand and a complete ability to avoid all financial regulation on the other is not a wise trade.
You may disagree with him, but a thoughtful discussion of what the risks and the reward to society are with a new currency is what we want from our policy makers. It's his job to try to look at what is good, and bad, about an anonymous and unregulated currency and to try to decide if the cost/benefit to society makes sense.

No, of course not. But I think it's OK to have the government regulate business, to provide education to every child, and perform various other function. The fact that government does not make components out of raw materials does not in any way impede it's ability to carry out some of its functions, and it irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:36:36
Yes, exactly! And I believe that the solution to this will always be a constant, evolving reaction to various problems as they arise, and that ideology itself has no place in what is basically a problem of administration.
A perfect example is the drug laws. They are clearly not solving the problems of drug abuse. So now we seem to be going in the direction of decriminalization. I think that's a good direction. But it will also not solve the problem of drug abuse. I'm not sure what will, but I am sure that problems related to abuse will continue and we will continue, as a society, to find solutions.
Banking regulation is another. We have a concentration of power and wealth at a level not seen since the Great Depression. I'm not sure how we'll deal with it, but I don't think political ideologies offer us much in the way of a solution.

People don't understand that we got to where we are as a society by trying, little by little, to deal with all the problems of society. That's why we have banks and laws and democracy and government and NGOs and watchdog groups and lobbyists and corporations. We're constantly trying to solve the problems of people not behaving well.
Some people grab onto an ideology (religion, communism, libertarian, etc.) and think, "If only everyone followed these rules, we'd fix it all!"
Which is actually true. If everyone followed the rules we'd be fine. But they don't, and they won't, and that's why things are as messy as they are. Bitcoin may or may not help people move money around, but it's not going to solve the problems that relate to the human condition.

Of course I understand that if you dig deeply enough into any unit of measurement, you will ultimitely see that it is an arbitrary benchmark. But in any topic regarding measurement, especially in one where someone is cherrypicking data based on a non-standard measurement that they have clearly chosen only because it supports their argument, a criticism that their unit of time is arbitrary is valid criticism. To reply that all units of measurement are ulitimately arbitrary does not defend his argument.

You're a rich guy, but I'm going to do you a favor that, as a rich guy, almost nobody is willing to do. I'm going to talk to you like you're not a rich guy.
It's great that you want to help humanity, but apart from having a ton of cash that you lucked into, you have zero qualifications. That's OK, most folks don't.
So, rather than have guilt and opinions about how awful society is, take your fucking rich guy hat off (it's already fucking with your brain), and educate yourself.
If you really, honestly believe that humanity is as worse as it's ever been, that's only because you're so ignorant that you have no perspective other than you're own. That's fine, we all start off that way. But you need an education.
Start by reading "A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century" by Barbara Tuchman. Learna about Europeans in the dark age who had two popes who each excommunicated the other's followers, leading all of the people to wonder if they were going to hell.
Add the Hundred Years War, the bubonic plague, a freakish deep freeze that killed the crops and made the people think they were being punished by God, and then add the plague that followed.
Religious strife
climate change
All in one generation. Yes, Assad is starving and gassing his own people in Syria, yes there is pollution in China and the toilets don't work at the Olympics.
BUT JESUS, man. You're trying to tell us in an era when starvation and diesease is lower than it's ever been, when we don't die of mosquito bites or bubonic plague that it's as bad as it's ever been.
"Oh, but that's just superficial. I'm talking about the pain of the human condition. The greed, the injustice, the existential angst!" You may reply, to which I answer:
If wealth does not ease this condition, then give me your wealth. What, you don't want to part with it? I don't blame you! It's not a cure for heartbreak, lonliness, and the other adolescent pains of the trust fund baby that we all must suffer to one extent or the other here in the first world, but we sure can learn to love each other and get off the pity pot.
Read Buddha, read Jesus, read history, learn compassion, learn gratitude, get a perspective. Make yourself a student of how to love other people and who we, as a race, really are.
Then put your money to work and start helping. Make it a job, like any other career, and understand that as a person who wants to put his wealth to good use and be of service, that you have a lot to learn and you're only just starting out.
Good luck! I admire your wish to change the world for the better. Now get to work and quit whining.

I agree with you that economics is not a science. I also agree with you that economics is a matter of idealogy. 
I completely disagree with your ridiculous mischaraterization of my world view. I don't love banks, nor do I like malfeasance or misgovernment. I don't believe that the solution to the problem of greed and abuse of power is as simple as reverting to the gold standard.
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:49:35


This was the claim that I was disputing. There is much to discuss about politics and economics. We will always be working to make society better, and we will always be struggling against greed and misuse of power and the concentration of wealth and power into too few hands and the abuses that result.
But any time somebody says that adopting his simple policy will cause ""greater and smoother increase in prosperity than ever before experienced" I am pretty sure I'm being sold a load of bullshit.

Hear, hear! They get mad when the "sheeple" won't actually be led like sheep into doing what they say is best for them. "Hey, sheeple, stop being sheep and buy bitcoins like I tell you! It's good for you and it'll make me rich! So stop being sheep and just do what I say!"


The most annoying off all of this is the ignorant arrogance of people who think that they've got a simple solution to problems that have existed in human society for thousands of years. How quickly they discover that people and our problems are complicated and not just a matter of us not doing what some libertarian says we ought to do.

The claim was this:


The claim is that if we had a fixed money supply the economy would be better "than ever before experience." But for thousands of years economies had fixed money supplies, and yet next time would be different? Can you, or the OP, give me one example of an economy on a fixed money supply that outperformed any of the G8 economies? It's quite a claim to say that going back on the gold standard would cause the US economy to not only stop all waste but create prosperity on a scale never seen before.
editted formating.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:51:25
Exactly! If we're looking for an example of "greater and smoother increase in prosperity than ever before experienced" the 1800s in the US are a terrible, terrible example.
It seems like the people who want to revert to the gold standard are completely unaware of the fact that the global economy was on the gold standard for centuries. Fiat currency was designed to solve the problems of the gold standard. It comes with its own problems, but that does not mean that reverting to gold will be some panacea.
Idealogues always have this insane "This will be the end of HISTORY!" complex. The truth is, we got to where we are now by incrementally trying to solve all the problems of what came before. And the problems we have now are the unintended consequences of our solutions. We will never solve the human condition, we will only make some progress and make some steps backwards as we fumble and lurch from one big screw up to the next.

For some of you young folks, so far you were right about bitcoin, and I hope you stay right. I want you to be rich, why not? But just so you know, by the time you're in your late 40s like me, you will have seen a lot of friends and family who had one lucky break in life. Sometimes its buying that apartment in a bad part of town that turns around and becomes a gold mine. Sometimes its a screenplay that actually sells for a few million bucks. I even have a friend who wrote a play that wound up being a hit on Broadway. They come around, these once in a lifetime chances.
But hitting it right once, doesn't mean you know what you're doing. The younger you are when you catch a lucky break, the more you think you deserved it, that it happened because you were special. That's the kind of thinking that will make you blow all those winnings on the next few big things that don't pan out at all. Most of the time, these great tips are a bust.
I made a killing in the last real estate bubble. I got killed in the dotcom crash, I got killed in the last real estate crash. I've blown money on stock tips, on book ideas, on all kinds of things. It's great that you were right, but your friends and parents caution is not always stupidity. Most things that look too good to be true actually are too good to be true. Now and then something comes along that pays out. Enjoy it, but don't start thinking you've got a special knack for picking winners or you're going to wind up broke.
Most lottery winners wind up worse off than before they won. If you can stay humble you might actually keep your friends, family relationships, and your profits.

The gold standard failed because money is an abstract concept, always has been, always will be. People decided they needed a different concept for money, and so they made one.

That is a lot of money, but it's a small price to pay for your self respect. You now know that you are not a douchebag. That is a priceless gift. If you take someone else's money, you then sell that part of you for cash money, and once it's gone, it's very hard to get back. You know you have a principle when it costs you something. Well done, you are a young man of character and integrity. Those are not small things.

Energy has intrinsic value. The energy in a gallon of gasoline is worth hundreds of man hours of labor tilling a field. If you can't sell the gas, or use it as a medium of exchange, you can still use the energy in the gas to accomplish something that you could not accomplish without the gas: drive somewhere, saving yourself a day of walking, till a field, mow a lawn, power a generator, heat a home, etc.

As on oldy (44), I'd just like to add that you don't like it that they're into bitcoin, but for the wrong reasons. 
They are ideologically impure. They're not doing it right.
Libertarian, Christian, Communist, Capitalist...you name it. You see the world through a lense of ideology. You have "natural laws" like supply and demand, just like a Marxist has the dialectic, and when people don't live by those rules, you get upset. There is no religion or ideology that is some kind of catch-all fit for how to live in a community, and I think trying to make one is an exercise in futility. Just my two cents.
