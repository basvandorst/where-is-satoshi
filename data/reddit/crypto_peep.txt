Uhh, are you sure? He said Samourai, not Coinbase wallet.. or are you saying they share the same thing?

That's like Apple bragging new features while Samsung had that feature years ago. Hehe.

Who the heck would even want to trust this site.

Well, does that solve the problem now? Coz lots of UK peeps are pissed off with how bank transfers are going with Cb.

Yeah dude, what's your deal? You're being like squidward.

Normally i'd go with every salary I get, I use paxful since it's easy to buy there, you just need to have a gift card to purchase bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:02:24
There's just a lot of things you can do with Bitcoins and also blockchain technology, I wish that this will continue to succeed for people like me who uses bitcoins..
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:38:47
Let's pray for it's continued success specially in blockchain technology, this is the future..

Nah, but I asked you too. And it's somewhat rude to give an opinion that doesn't even have an explanation. Like leaving a baby after it was born. lol.

Still not impressed, but at least they are doing something in that country.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:01:06
Finally you said it, didn't have to be some plain "I think your opinion is not relevant." but thanks though right? At least if ever they saw this, they would know what to improve on creating a better substance for their web series.

Well, what makes you think Bisq won't do the same?  Why don't they have enough users? Maybe because they lack something.

If you are able to explain what a lightning network / lightning node is to  a grade school student, how will you? Coz i'm seriously clueless about this and I want to learn what it is, fast.

Well, it's not an exchange, more of a peer to peer platform, you should try either localbitcoins or paxful, but the thing with localbitcoins is they have kyc so they have or will need personal info which leaves you Paxful. Give it a shot. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 06:26:05
They actually do, pretty easy I must say, with account creation and all.. easy verification not so tight as localbitcoins kyc but it is still safe.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:15:18
Good news but, when's your app out? 
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:23:00
Lots of shady bullshit happens on Localbitcoins.. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 07:57:55
I think best would be a hardware wallet.
