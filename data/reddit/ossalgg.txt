Everyone says they will buy the future dips until it dips. Retard.

Hodl is a sound principle when Bitcoin is trading side to side (read: stagnant) and you're unsure where it's going next. Sell when others are greedy, buy when others are fearful. That's what everyone forgets. Everyone thinks you need to buy/sell at the very top and very bottom. The trick is to just catch the larger trends. Sell during huge upswings, buy back during the inevitable drops. They always happen. More than tripled my position the past month through pretty lazy trading. Patience is key.

You won't buy in at $500 and you know it. Stop lying.

New account, veteran Reddit asshole. Read: I have three accounts that have been banned in the past year. Just saying.
The point is, there have been thousands of posts of people saying they'll buy in at "x"...then when it hits "x" they get scared because "Bitcoin is crashing!" Some time later, they post "I wish I had purchased when I had the chance." They are pussies.

I've felt for a few weeks that this sub was dying, but this proves it.

Here. Get out. You're prematurely celebrating one of the many small rallies BTC/Crypto has had in the past five weeks. Why? It's still down big. It will likely dip again. Don't celebrate shitty memes and act like "fun" is what helps the market. Focus on the adoption of new technologies. Get out with your weak memes. Donkey.

New account but veteran Redditor. I get banned a lot. Purchased not nearly enough a Bitcoin at a price far lower than it is it today. Just saying.
