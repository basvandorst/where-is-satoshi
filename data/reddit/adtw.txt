Fully undetected eh?

I dunno dude I just set my fees manually based on the fee chart and only pay $2-4, however it usually takes 24-48hrs to process.
you can definitely pay less but it's still completely ridiculous that it's $40 to get in the next block

True but LN in a couple of years or a solution that will actually work in 4-5 years isn't helpful now, because right now these issues are driving people away from cryptos or to altcoins. If you think cryptos are *the* future like the internet was in the 90s, then you might not care so much. I think cryptos are in a delicate balance right now and it could really go either way. Cryptos will not be 'the future' or see widespread adoption if on-chain scaling takes 20 years.

LN will take a long time to build up a decent userbase, and it's deeply flawed imo - and not in the bcash shitcoin propaganda sense. I worry less about it's centralized nature and more about the fact that your average user will have to hold over $30,000 on the LN to actually have any useful transaction depth. That's something that 99.9% of bitcoin users aren't going to do, so I wouldn't be surprised if LN completely flopped.
My opinion is that cryptocurrencies aren't necessarily part of the future so we're just gonna have to agree to disagree on that front. I want them to succeed, all the same.

Slightly better odds than the lottery, but not by much.
