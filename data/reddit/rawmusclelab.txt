The same people who bought in at 1000 believing it would rise to 30000.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:18:32
Scary way to look at it.

Are you giving away your BTC or something?
If so.. I'mma here. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:08:26
Maybe he got a BJ with his BLT?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:38:08
It was, for many.
A few survived, but how many lost out? Most.
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:13:50
I wouldn't mind 800 bitcoins.
Any wealthy individuals around? :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:56:14
And why exactly does he need a payout?
There's a reason he wants to be anonymous, and if this is Satoshi, he's now a target.
This woman should of kept her mouth shut, she might of found the creator, fine, it's something you don't fucking release. She's got her 5 minutes of fame, but what's he potentially lost if it is him?
IF it's him, he now has to probably go into hiding.

It's pretty obvious what happened.
A number of individuals, bought in when Bitcoin and Greece were being mentioned i.e. Bandwagon, as soon as the news came in about Greece, actually from the rumours, they sold their investments, some for profit, some for losses.
It's about Greece, but it isn't about the Greeks.

I've grown up around Property/Investments my whole life.
The last thing you do is invest in a Country that's fucked.
Invest in a Country that's fucked and upcoming, now that pays, invest in an already popular area, that also pays.
If the Bitcoin community wanted to do something for individuals without going broke and even on the opposite end, becoming a big player in housing, then get together, sell coins you don't intend on keeping, and start a housing project in an area that will sell quickly.
Free Housing is a money pit, but here in the UK, we have regulations that mean those who build housing/apartments have to offer low income housing as well as, and the profit on these apartments/houses are tiny and sometimes zero.

How I hope someone sends me 600 Bitcoin in the future.

Could I get $1m?

My comment is simple, free Bitcoins.
I had this dream years ago when Bitcoins were rising up in value that I somehow had 10,000 Bitcoins through an anonymous donation on Reddit, it was the feeling of accomplishment, that I had enough assets to not worry about how I'd earn enough money to live or put a deposit on a flat, the price kept rising until it hit $1000 and I had become a Multi-Millionaire overnight, instead of working to earn a living, I could now work for enjoyment and help those who needed it.
I cashed out 30%, and kept the rest.
Then I woke up, and was massively disappointed.
So like I said, Free Bitcoins, what's not to love _niko?

And now it's shooting back up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:00:28
This sounds like you're going to get Bitcoins off of someone that doesn't realise what they're worth, correct?
If so, I'll be more than happy to be used as an anonymous person for this heist, PM Me. (Not for free, obviously) - If you don't, this guy's going to try and kill you when he finds out you've just stolen $20million+ from him.
What would I do? I'd cash out 20,000 coins, split the money over a few accounts and try to get the best interest possible (you could go abroad and get 15%, but if they go under, I doubt you'll be covered for your losses). I'd regret not cashing out and losing most of the money than cashing out and losing double.
20,000 coins would give you a hefty return (lets just use that as a number), every year, you'd get a lovely paycheck for sitting on your arse.
I'd leave the rest and see how the market moves. And as some others said, I'd donate some to some random users because it's just something I'd do (but I'd meet up with those users and discuss it, I wouldn't donate online otherwise I might just make someone rich and they go and waste it all on cars and strippers).

Night Satoshi Nakatomi, much love.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:30:53
It's already going back up at a tremendous rate.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:40:12
I'm clueless right now..
Am I a millionaire without knowing how to access my millions?
O_o ;)
Someone tipped me 0.001 earlier, I still haven't looked into that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:47:45
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:56:49
Why thank you, now you've forced me to get involved in Bitcoins. :)
I'll return something to you somehow/sometime. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:52:17
Well, whoever became Millionaires back then, congrats to them, they deserve it.
I was speaking to a friend of mine who happens to know someone with 40,000 coins, if it's true, he's now very very wealthy.
(Now I just need to figure out this Time Machine, build a farm, mine enough coins for £1,000,000, and live off of the interest happily for the rest of my life).
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:24:41
It does make me a little sick, that was around the time I spent £2,000 on a PC. Shortly after I was in Hospital, but damn.
I only knew of Bitcoin this year, I never knew you could "mine" anything back then, totally clueless.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:02:35
It only took a couple of days, on a basic PC, to get 7,000 coins back then?
Fucking hell...
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:37:27
It's all pretty interesting to me, I've been following it for a while but I haven't actually invested anything into it. I did the same with RBS shares, although not investing back then was probably the biggest regret I have regarding money.
Dropped to 12p, I was going to invest at 20p - My account got delayed (I took it as a "don't invest" message) so I decided against it. Think it peaked at £4.60 or something like that.
And this is looking quite unstable currently.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:56:39
This happened to me with RBS.
Was going to buy at 20p - Delayed Account - I decided against it.
Shot up to £4.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:27:08
Yep, it came crashing back down when it nearly hit $900.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:52:34
It would be bad 9 times out of 10.
It's currently a little mystery, which means any downsides that "he" potentially has about himself is unknown - He's currently a good "person" in the eyes of those that look into it. 
Now as someone said, if Satoshi is well known and popular, it would be very good for Bitcoin. But the chances of this are slim.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:32:22
Pyramid schemes do make others rich (those that invest early into the schemes, just like Bitcoin), those who are late into the Pyramid will not make much at all (if anything depending on how long the scheme can maintain itself). 
If it's a well planned scheme, then at one point, all investors make a return, it's only when the "initial" investor aka the creator of the scheme thinks it's time to run off with the money (which is what can happen at any time with Satoshi or any other big investor).
If a big investor decides not to reinvest - That can destroy the scheme overnight, and that's what can happen with Bitcoin at any time also.
Of course, the investors high up the scheme might get paid off at the end depending how decent the creator is, it's normally the high majority of small investors that lose their savings.

Mr Satoshi Nakatomi.
Make me a BTC Millionaire
(While I sleep, I'll be dreaming of Ferraris, High Stakes Poker, and 5* All Inclusive Holidays All Year Round)
From the interest of the money in my bank account of course! I'd never touch the million.
As they say, if you don't ask in life, you don't get.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:19:17
Didn't it drop a few weeks ago to $400?
Then it shot right back up again?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:12:10
You sound like you have a lot of Quark.
I'm right aren't I? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:32:47
No, No.. My heart, it skipped a beat, and then sunk into my damn stomach.
Heheh, thanks for the laugh (and sadness). ;)
Now, I'm going to sleep, and dream that "u" was a damn "i".
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:22:38
I have no intention of buying them now, for a start, I would only be able to buy 3 BTC with my life savings, it's not exactly a clever investment.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:00:56
"May I have 1000btc?"
"I have 300,000btc, so sure, here you go"
You have to have balls of steel to not cash out that amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:48:45
Will do tomorrow, thanks.
