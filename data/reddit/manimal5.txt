The fact that the screenshot of his tweet got 1000+ comments on this subreddit says otherwise. Stop giving the guy attention

Same here. Ive seen coinbase "crash" i.e. quit accepting sell order during corrections, but never seen the entire site go down. Hopefully this is nothing.

Same boat. If btc drops below 9k before funds hit, paying the coinbase fees might payoff better than waiting and missing the dip.

I get this is hypothetical, but with the US economy in a long term bull run there are plenty of other great ways to grow your money over the next 5 years than holding on an investment giving you zero return.

Haven't been watching: have either LTC or ETH outperformed btc at any point in the last few months? I've only seen them grow slower and drop more rapidly than btc lately. The low alt prices are enticing right now, but not worth it if BTC is outperforming them currently.

This is kinda how I feel as well. During the 2017 bubble, LTC and ETH tripled in the timeframe that BTC went from 10k to 20k. I imagine this will happen again during the next bubble but to a less dramatic extent, given their poor performance the last two months.

If you want cheap fees then use Coinbase Pro.

I bought at 7500 last year thinking it was the bottom, only for it to drop to 3k like 6 months later. Couldnt buy at 3k bc didnt have excess funds at the time. Its just nice to have the value back at where it started for me.
@_date: 2019-10-07 23:55:27
The price is back down to what it was when I bought two years ago. By HODLing, I failed to take advantage of the bubble this summer. Not only that, but the bubble hurt me because I bought again at 10k and 11k.
Yeah, things are looking up long-term, but if you ignore the short game, you may miss out on the only gains you might see over the next couple years.

Read through the Wikipedia article. That was enough to convince me to move my crypto from an online account to a digital wallet.

Just gotta put money in a week in advance or in anticipation of a dip.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:55:27
Well, your comment fits in with this cycle too. The amount of times I have seen comments like yours every time btc drops. Every time this coin "stabilizes" it seems to drop another 1k or 2k. Its not smart to invest at the bottom when in another month or two there inevitably becomes a whole new bottom. That's called watching your savings disappear.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:05:31
Yeah if we hadnt thought the time to buy back in was at 10k, or 7.5k, or 6k lol
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:31:43
I didnt say you only comment when it drops. My point is that this is a common rhetoric to those who whine when value drops. If one could magically predict the ATL, then yeah, your comment would be valid. 
But, Ive been seeing these types of posts from 19k all the way down to now, and in hindsight, none of them have been valid. Itd make sense to invest now, but youll be beating yourself up if it falls to 3.5k and sits there for a year or two.
Yeah, btc will one day likely climb back up well past 19k. One day. And anyone who was dumb enough to buy at 19k last December, and dumb enough to hodl that all the way through this dip, for however many years it takes for btc to make said climb, is going to have gains well overshadowed by anyone who buys at the initial stages of the next climb, or by any human being that partakes in any other type of investing in the years that will span this gap that btc is currently in.

One of Bush's last moves as president was pumping $800 billion into the economy. It mostly was overlooked seeing the election buzz was big, but I still remember reading that headline.
Kinda feels like the feds are plugging holes in a sinking ship trying to keep the economy afloat.

This aged poorly
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:06:37
I was begging to break even last winter when I thought I bought the bottom at 7.5k. Hodled a year and now I'm in the green and glad I didnt sell back then.

The alt bubble popped last month and collapsed past it's value. It is now adjusting. Im sure there will be a slight overcompensation and a smaller drop to follow.

I've heard people try and explain this to me on a couple occasions and this is the only one that clicked. Thank you.
