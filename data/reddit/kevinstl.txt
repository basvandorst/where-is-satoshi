Thanks for the support. Unfortunately there is just no way to know when the site will resume operations. We're consulting with a law firm on how to ensure the business is compliant with state and federal regulations. The business is operating on a startup budget so we do not have the ability to hire a team of lawyers to provide solutions immediately. That is why we are trying to get into the class that includes $100k in funding. The class will also help us build connections with people that have knowledge of how financial service businesses operate.

Thank you for the support! If someone wants to follow the rules in starting a money services business they need very deep pockets and plenty of patience.

Hi. I'm the creator of giftcarddrainer.com, Kevin Wilde. We just implemented bitcoin payments starting November 3. We combat chargebacks by using your bank account for identity verification. In some cases we ask for an image of the gift card.
The bitcoin payment has become very popular in the one and a half weeks since it's implementation. Our customers that have used it all seem to be very pleased with how quickly they receive their bitcoins. We allow ourselves up to 24 hours to process gift cards for bitcoin payment. We are often able to process the card and send your payment in bitcoins within hours of submission, if not immediately.
You can see our faq:  if you want more details.
