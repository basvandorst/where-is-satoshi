most people here are concern about the money that they put into bitcoin just to see it decrease by 50+% in merely months. It has nothing to do with the technology or whatever shit you are talking about...
or you are trying to  preach people that because the technology is never going away, bitcoin will always worth 400 bucks a pop while other coins that use the same technology such as lite or dogcoins, will only worth 10 bucks a pop?

i am sorry but a lot of people aren't rich enough to dump in hundred to hundreds of thousands of dollars into bitcoin cos they want to use it to start a revolution.
they were in it for the money, and watching their investment drop for almost a third in value in less than a month would make they worry.
dont talk like you are jesus. You won't be in the whole bitcoin thing if there is no money involve. 99% of people who invest into bitcoin is for the quick cash crab after seeing its price spike so much, but most of them would try to sugar coat it with "i am in it for the revolution"

dont you love what people can tell themselves to make them feel better after something tragic happened?
i'd be suprise if bitcoin can hold onto their current price with this kind of news happened to Mt. Gox.

one common thing that a lot of Bitcoin investers say these days are the following:
1. bitcoin is here to stay
2. Bitcoin is the future
3. Bitcoin is easy
4. Bitcoin is simple
It's almost like those people are hypnotize by someone that they can't talk about bitcoin without mentioning one of those points. It is why it had been so painful to talk to by coworker lately. They will keep telling me bitcoin is here to stay so it will rise back to 1k and replace usd in the future.

lol so my points doesn't effect you... that's why you should post a thread on reddit and tell others they shoudn't worry about their investment yet because it's not effecting YOU
sorry, but people like you is what's wrong with the reddit community
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:39:40
really? you think the people on reddit right now who are preaching about bitcoins are clean from debts?
Those are the people who are investing their money on bitcoin BEFORE paying off their debts and loans hoping there will be a spike again. I know there are people who live on paycheck by paycheck and they are dumping all their fucking money into bitcoin and use credit cards to pay off the living expenses. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 08:06:13
Keep smoking that crack. 
How insane do you have to be to actually believe that bitcoin will be 50k in a few years??
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:40:31
I guess it's too much to ask for those bc zealots to actually read the content before giving comments.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:55:27
lol.. I love it when one of those coin holders are trying to convince people to buy now in order to slow down the damage.
who are the sheeps? Speculators or people who believe in sharks like you?

Follow those right wing nuts jobs on reddit and buy more no matter what happens.
Price increase? Buy more
Price decrease? Buy more
Price crash to 100 bucks? Well it's time to pawn ur house, sell ur cars and kids and buy more!
Overall the whole bitcoin investment plan is simple. You buy.
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:39:57
your link has absolutely nothing to do with your title. In fact, it doesn't even talk about the whole banning incident.
got to love idiots panicing and start to post fake news to make themselves feel better.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:28:57
build what?  Why the fuck every bitcoin crazed people would have use analogy like this in order to prove a point? I am sick with the whole "building" or "light bulb" shit everytime people try to tell others how variable bitcoin is.
There are some people who invest and lost more than 50% of their investments in just less than half a year. Those people need to live, pay their loans and mortgage and other expenses. Losing 50%+ of your assets in any investment would be chaotic. 
and here you are, singing the same song that convince people to buy in at 700+, such as "we build shit so things will get better." No reasons, no logic, nothing but a fucking slogan.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:09:25
it has nothing to do with being brave. It is about being smart about your money. 
buying as much as you can regardless of price on anything is stupid as hell, and either that person is really stupid, or they are just saying it in hope some other people will buy more bitcoins in order to stop the price dip.
Use your logic and reasoning, and look at the overall picture. Do you really think the market will spike again without the whole chinese market? people like MC432 will be one of those who bitch about the government for making him poor and leech the society while it is himself who threw away money like candy in hoping his asset will multiply by ten times again in a year.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:42:46
you are however, implying it is a good way to invest.

.... wtf did i just read? an Australian coming to reddit and call Americans idiots and suggest them to ignore the IRS because he doesn't have to worry about the IRS in Australia ? I am not even sure if this dude is being serious....
it's people like this that makes the whole bitcoin community look like a joke.. and the community has a lot of them... This is even more stupid that people saying there is no exit plan for bitcoin
