thanks, that is what I was looking for.   
I will research more into it before acquiring anything. I want my seed to be completely offline.

exactly ! That is my feeling.. n00bs advertise how easy it's to jump in the coin wagon in 2min creating a online wallet.   
It's not that easy to have your offline seed, I'm already reading a lot of things for hours. 
I even compiled the bip39 and tested it to confirm that all online wallets can have access to your private key if they want. Since they run bip39 in the background while creating new wallets.  
So many fishy scams out there, one must take care of his money.

I agree with you on all aspects. I have vast knowledge on the field of IT and I also see Bitcoin only as a protocol as you stated.
My goal is to give the first step and join this revolution of trust, not as a investment per see.
My first concern is how can I safely find a way to create a wallet and ensure I’m the only owner of my own private key? This is a simple question but with deep meaning to it.
I’m reading about the offline paper wallet, but I still fail to understand how it can create a wallet being fully offline. I understand the patterns, but why another person 100 years from now, can’t have the chance of getting the same set of seed words as I did in the offline wallet and end up finding my private keys?
I know it’s a shot in the dark, but I lived in a time that people said 56bits encryption would never be break in the next 200 years.. well how did that turned out?
Machine power increases exponentially and I believe we will have enough power in the near future to brute force all wallet generating codes and find the seed words.
You seem very knowledgeable, how did you setup your own wallet?

My first problem is that I want to backup my private key, but when I create a wallet at [blockchain.com]( I can't see my private key anywhere.
Edit: Reading about bip39 now.

Thanks, after reading a while I came to the same conclusions. Now I will go to the same setup. First purchasing my own hardware to generate my wallet. Then purchasing a hardware wallet for convenience and keep a low amount for daily usage. I will sign my transactions offline to store the coins. And store away my keys outside my normal reach for safety purposes.
