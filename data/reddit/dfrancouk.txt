Long/Short equities fundamental investment is so dead. Stfu MR B and retire already.

It's not just BTC, the whole market is down 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:14:30
I'd hardly a call a 20K investment the same as 800 but sure. Assuming you only bought 1 BTC ofc. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:37:51
Worth it

This is exactly what institutional traders do its a chicken game. They pump it hard people panick sell deleting a ton of value and then they buy it all back again much cheaper for a double whammy.win. Dont fall for it, oldest trick in the book.

are you mental ? Why would he sell now when the bull run is just starting. 48 hours is nothing

Lol at all these paid my kids college posts - college is useless now I cant imagine how useless it will be in 20 years.
Good on you for being a good parent I guess, I'm personally going to LEND (not give) my kids the equivalent amount of tuition fees to start a business, if they want to waste 4 years smoking pot and writing useless liberal arts essays then they can pay for it themselves.

20K tomorrow more like...

Sounds like a good plan /s

This isn't about BTC though, funds are funds regardless if it's in FIAT, Gold, Property, etc etc. I don't know, maybe something in me grinds my gears knowing this prick can fuck my life savings at any moment he so pleases.

We're not in 2012/13 anymore. Regulation is good otherwise there would be complete anarchy, for the record, I have never been scammed in any crypto, honestly, the last time I was scammed was probably 15-20 years ago and due to being naive. 
But you can't say it will never happen to you, a lot of companies seem totally legit, for example, Mtgox, even recent cases like Walton and Tron, on the surface they look completely legit, but would you invest in those coins now ? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:58:26
HAHAHA, that's BS. I'm sure those people want the FIat price when BTC was $200-$300 back then. 
Why doesn't he just give them the BTC? That's a really good deal, 1 BTC now is worth 50x what it used to be.
Again, criminal

Bet OP dumped his bags on dumb money in December/January. Now mad because people dont like feeling scammed 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:44:31
that moment when you realise less than 1% of the population own BTC
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:49:44
Can someone explain to me why this criminal with 180K btc left is allowed to just play with people's lives ? If 2013/2014 wasn't enough he's now doing the same thing just because he can ? Why doesn't the government confiscate his funds ? In my country that's what happens when you declary Bankruptcy, you lose your house, savings, etc to pay back not keep the money so you can play with thousands of peoples lives and potentially bankrupt millions.
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy turns up dead in a few weeks as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one feeling the same.

Lawyer acting on behalf of criminals, same difference.
Ok so the owner of MT Gox should get a hit on his head, what kind of country can you fuck people over and just walk away with a slap on the wrist. I wish I lived in Japan, I'd start robbing banks, 5 years on prison/holiday then I'm a billionaire, awesome.

The British are great at scams. Honestly, I'm European and moving to the UK I was surprised how many scams exist, some of them you even think, what is the point of that, there are easier ways to make money honestly, it's incredible.
