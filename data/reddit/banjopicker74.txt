Because by and large, reddit is filled with dogmatic overzealous athiests who downvote anything that mentions religion. Specifically Christianity.

I see this as a failure of developers to innovate fast enough and miners who prioritize short term financial gain over long term health of the asset.  Mix that with the whole schism that is btc/bch.

So your saying the crazy fees, cherrypicked transactions and resulting transaction delays are part of the plan?  
I don’t think that’s true. But if it is, bank or no bank, bitcoin and it’s derivatives prestige will fade away.

Based on the schism between btc and bch, the community may be Bitcoins downfall also...

Most everyone will tell you not to do this and they are absolutely right.  
However, you will teach yourself a very valuable lesson in life if you do try to trade it.   Many “traders” are now HODL’ers having learned that same, very valuable, lesson.

So a $20 gift turned into around $800 this year. Not bad.  I gave all my direct line managers bitcoin this year. Would love to tell the same story on two years

Prolly as good of way as any to capture a piece of the bad new dips.

For the people not familiar with ripple, this statement is patently false. Do your own research....

Is the paper in the picture the actual print out of the wallet or did you make it pretty as part of the gift.  I am graciously stealing this idea for Christmas.

This is the root of the new modern money theory the economically ignorant have been writing about lately.

This what I do.  No transfer fee from gdax to my nano after purchase. 
I think market buys (market taker) have a small purchase fee and limit buys (market maker) have no purchase fee

This is great news!

Based on the difference in coin price between Coinbase and everywhere else on the last downturn, a lot of these are probably people opening accounts for arb opportunity

Chinese looking for an overseas exchange?

So question.  Got my nano and BTC wallet option was legacy or Segwit (1.0 I presume). What wallet should I have picked?
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:38:04
That’s my method.  GDAX has my info from coinbase.  I now bank transfer to GDAX, buy, transfer to hardware wallet. 
Have not had to pay a transfer fee going from GDAX to nano wallet.   Coinbase wanted $27 for that very same transfer. Glad I accidentally figured out the GDAX savings.

I am more specifically looking for the steps to capitalizing on the forks safely from a hardware wallet

$200.  $50 per week.

Trezor doesn’t hold ripple. That made my mind up for nano.

I am looking at how to safely sell the alts without risking my core btc. Thanks.

Transferred my coins off coinbase to my new nano today. I saw the transfer fee in coinbase and had a WTF moment.   Moved it all to GDAX for free, then sent it from GDAX for free.  They don’t charge a network/ miner fee to transfer and the transfer validated fast.
