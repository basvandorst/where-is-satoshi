The probability of success is a function of the attacker's hashrate (as a proportion of the total network hashrate) and the number of confirmations the merchant waits for. For example, if the attacker controls 10% of the network hashrate but the merchant waits for **6 confirmations**, the success probability is on the order of **0.1%**.

I knew bitcoin was **exploding** in popularity, but I didn't expect it to **catch fire** like this! It is really **blowing up**!

This is a great story. Everyone I tell about bitcoin thinks Sean's Outpost is a fantastic use for bitcoin.

It was pretty easy. He has a laptop sitting on his checkout counter. I made a really simple wrapper around the blockchain payment QR generator. He rings up a sale and instead of punching into the CC machine, will enter the total on the form and have the customer scan the QR.
When the payment goes through, the blockchain page beeps and he can see it come in.

And wringing hands worrying about what people 'might' perceive something as is pretty much a waste of time. You don't have to look far for real, concrete examples of how bitcoin is being perceived en masse. Useless selfie is useless.

They think they have some fancy AI anti fraud system, developed at AirBnB or something. 
All it really does though is seem to cause problems.
I'm just glad it has never flagged me.

After a discussion on  it seems trying to get everyone on the old chain again is the least risky solution.
If you're a miner, please do not mine on 0.8 code. Stop, or switch back to 0.7. BTCGuild is switching to 0.7, so the old chain will get a majority hash rate soon.
If you're a merchant: please stop processing transactions until the chains converge.
If you're on 0.7 or older, the client will likely tell you that you need to upgrade. Do not follow this advise - the warning should go away as soon as the old chain catches up.
If you are not a merchant or a miner, don't worry.

According to  the 0.8 chain will be invalidated, and clients should move to 0.7 for now.

“The dream is to come up with a proof of work function that could be useful for science,” he says. “That’s challenging to do, because it has to be something that we care about that is difficult to compute but easy to verify.”
It is hard to combine these three factors – scientific relevance, difficulty of calculation, and ease of verification. “The last two are easy with hashing, the first two are easy with our research. But the verification part is hard to do.”

A specific type of ECC is backdoored.
Not all ECC is vulnerable.
ECDSA != Dual_EC_DRBG

The particular crypto flaw your link references, Dual_EC_DRBG has been known since long before Snowden.
It is entirely possible that ECDSA also has a backdoor. But unlike Dual_EC_DRBG, there is absolutely no evidence of that.
