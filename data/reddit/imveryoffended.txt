Due to the amount of hopium-induced delusion I see in these subs, I don't know whether or not you're trying to be funny.

You mean mass speculation?  99.9% of the people buying for the first time right now will never take their 0.02BTC off the exchanges.

Can't help but laugh that this was posted in a "don't invest recklessly" thread:
["when a satoshi becomes worth $1000"](
This is what delusional greed looks like.

It's incredible how many people in cryptocurrency forums have the ability to see the future.  You guys could make good money running side gigs as psychics.  You'd have just as much credibility as you do now, too.

Fucking LOL
Yes, each bitcoin is going to be worth $100B, and bitcoin will have a market cap of over 2 quintillion dollars.  That sounds totally within reason!

The only thing that would rise if people fled Tether to BTC is BTC's value *in Tether*.

What other conclusion could you draw from a creepy looking guy who appears to be 80 years old posting pictures and videos of himself with a row of 12 year old girls shaking their barely-clothed asses in his face?

Out of curiosity does it hurt to be this stupid?

As a delusional cultist gambler, do you sometimes find it difficult to relate to your foolish gambler friends?

The demographic that would respond to this positively has already suffered plenty of cranial impacts.  Then again, my guess is that you have as well.

Some say that if you look closely enough, you can still see the scar where the lawn dart penetrated this man's skull as a child.

This isn't really true in the price range of the car in this thread.  A large portion of people who own cars like this are trying to signal that they're rich, while actually being buried in massive amounts of debt.
Sorry, sounds like you fell for it.

The only way you could improve his sales pitch more than he has on his own, would be to get him high on flakka before sending him out to wander the streets spreading the teachings of the cult.
The evil dirty fiat banks won't know what hit them.

It's not just the engine.  The new Supra is literally a BMW Z4 with a Toyota body.

Are we going to pretend miners aren't middlemen?

It's possible to do both, believe it or not.

The only clock that resets more often than the "minutes since last exit scam" clock is the "minutes since last time bitcoiners said something incredibly embarrassing" clock.

"Don't put all of what little money you have into a single high risk investment, but instead spread it out among several high risk investments"
Sounds like a recipe for success.

They'll probably be able to add "SFYL" or "got penis'd" to their qualifications soon.

Then they can come back and rent half of the house they used to have, and spend the next few years buying and desperately shilling shitcoins with what remains of their rapidly dwindling bank balance.

I don't resent bitcoin, but I absolutely resent what the "community" surrounding it has become in recent years.

So much cringe, but you've certainly given his parents a great opportunity to teach their kid about something important.
The title of the lesson will be:  "Your uncle is a shyster who would happily convince you to spend your communion money on a pyramid scheme if he thought it would benefit him"

A 15 year old is a child.  Then again, so are most modern 25 year olds, so I could see how someone on reddit might consider 15 years old "an adult".

They're in luck.  Most ICO scams are using stock images of random models as their "staff".

How many MLM schemes did you get suckered into before you stumbled upon bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:07:14
Yes, I'm sure you'll be "slaving away" flying on chartered private jets to "try to get assets distributed to creditors around the world (particularly the warm, tropical parts of the world, though)".
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:26:28


That must be why various organizations have stopped accepting Bitcoin completely.  They're just using reverse psychology.
