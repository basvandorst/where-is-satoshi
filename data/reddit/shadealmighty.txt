Centralised exchanges colluding with miners to increase fees who would of thought... Be glad this outage happened to supply us with proof, now they will pled stupidity and implement batching and segwit.

I just tried to add it to my android pay, but unfortunately the card does not have a CVC so doesn't allow me to add it. The CoinJar app doesn't have a tap and go function, you literally have to swipe this card to use it.  Hopefully they are working on a new version with chip and app support.

Got my vote!

Same reason you waited hours to download a mp3 on dial up instead of buying a cd. Because its cool and has tons of potential to add new functionality, and don't ask me what they will be because if I knew I'd make them and be rich

My thoughts exactly. I was going to type a similar thought out in a reply to the other thread, but decided it wasn't even worth it.. Most probably will fall on deaf ears
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:44:25
I'm thinking so

Ask them to send a different amount for each person.
Bill = $45.01
Josh = $45.02 etc...

Happening to me too. 
Also coinjar.com wont load either - same error. Should we be worried that most bitcoin websites are using the same service (CloudFlare)?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:53:54
All the sites just started working for me again. That was odd
EDIT: all except BTC-E &lt;.&lt;

There is a fair few on Kindle &amp; Google play books. I haven't read this book but the reviews seem positive. Good luck.

Just checked coinbase - same thing. 
Yes, I'm in Australia and my ISP is internode

Glad  you've decided to try out Bitcoin. My advice would be to just play around with the system and some of its features. Heres some things I'd recommend you do.
* Send money to/from different wallets
* Use and play around with multiple wallet systems(Web wallet, bitcoin-qt, Mycelium, ect)
* Get a feel for the 'mining' system, even if you only make 0.000001 Bitcoin, it makes it feel "real" if you try it out.
* Buy and sell on localbitcoins.com even if its only $20. It is well worth it just for the fact you will have a few feedback if you need to get investment out quick or invent quick. Plus if you decide to do it in person, you can meet some pretty nice people this way.
* Read( or Listen( to the "Bitcoin White paper" satoshi wrote
Hope you have fun with this new technology! Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:12:57
Haha nice.. now what is coinsquare?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:21:15
Amen... Altcoins are one thing but this deliberate forking of the chain is catastrophic... I mean if Bitcoin cash actually does survive/replace the original btc then what's stopping btc X replacing btc Y when ever there is a conflict...

Makes sense the Korean government would want a centralised digital currency. And if you count the other Korean exchanges, it's close to 60% of the total volume.

Well done to all the people who contributed and to all the Bitcoin users!����‍����

You only lose money if you sell low!

In 10 years from now people will be searching all the rubbish dumps for old phones hoping for that old B0.001 that's now worth a fortune.

Seriously.... I love mBTC but we should not force this ONE option on the people! 
The top 5 or 10 options should be choosable, Let the most popular choices gradually rise to acceptance.
