Lots of doge people don't have bitcoin to convert. They just buy bitcoin to buy doge or buy doge directly.

Sell gift card for cash, buy BTC with cash locally (localbitcoins or find a guy who knows a guy)

LTC uses Scrypt, which is somewhat ASIC resistant due to memory requirements.  Scrypt ASICs are currently being developed and released, but the algorithm can be tweaked to effectively double the memory requirement, breaking current ASICs and shoving it back to GPU mining.

Try getting a mortgage or car loan from BTC.

Pay for dogs in doge. Makes perfect sense.

Because it's perpetually inflationary, at a certain point it won't rise in value per coin (the market cap may continue to increase, however) and will be more lucrative to spend on other things than to hold as an investment.  Just like every real-world currency.
Early adopters are still going to make bank, because eventually it's going to find its niche, whether it's an "underdoge donation" currency for less popular charities, or a reward system for internet content creators, or something else entirely, and it'll be the thing you buy to do those things.  I say it'll do those things out of hope due to my pretty sizable holdings, but also because I've seen the motivation and creativity of its community...which is giving me hope.
It also attracts a different crowd politically.  I'd say Bitcoin has a larger an-cap/libertarian/fiscally conservative base than Dogecoin does.
Someone on said that Bitcoin could stay Gold, and Dogecoin could be the Dollar.  Doge is attracting people who do not give even a tenth of a fuck about the difference between gold standard, fiat money, or a cryptocurrency, they just want their cute, fun coins that they can send to other people for making things they like.
And no, there's nothing stopping them from doing that with Bitcoin, but...well, different crowd, different attitudes.

I don't think you can have debt in a trustless system, but I could be wrong.  It would simply be fiat debt with translated currency units, too, since the price volatility is a bit too risky for someone to borrow/lend BTC directly (who's going to borrow 20 BTC (~$9000) and then risk BTC shooting up to $5k, then they have to spend $100k to pay back the debt, even before interest?  Likewise, who would loan out 20 BTC when it's worth $9000 then risk it crashing to &gt;$100?).
If the price stabilizes for a long period of time, you might see these kinds of experiments.  I don't see it happening when the value fluctuates as much as it has over the past year.

How do you prove that?  Seriously, there's no way to prove that the cold storage isn't a brain wallet the Karpeles has memorized, that he's waiting to abscond with the second people stop looking at him.
Secondly, no, it's not possible to just "create" a new, 750,000 BTC wallet.  If the coins ARE in fact, completely lost, forever and ever, then there are 750,000 fewer BTC in circulation, forever and ever.

Lack of mutual trust and established infrastructure is the only thing keeping cryptocurrency loans from existing.

Twist:  That's the brain wallet key for their cold storage!

I bought a bit of BTC a while back from a guy I know, basically I gave him my address, I watched him send the coin, once it had a verification I handed him a crisp clean $50 bill.  I'd imagine the process would be the same for meeting a person from Localbitcoins (an exchange that connects people for in-person cash transactions).
As far as selling your gift card for cash, I don't know how to help you there.
