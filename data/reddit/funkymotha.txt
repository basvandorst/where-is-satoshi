Some are exaggerated from BCH trolling. Right now BCH has lower fees but there's 2000 BCH transactions compared to BTC 150000 and that's what they're using to try to get people to switch over. Their fees will go up as well and I have ZERO trust in the CEO of BCH so that's a definite pass from me.
Yes the lightning network if it gets up and running will speed up transactions with lower fees.
I was going to make a post and completely forgot to, about maybe coinbase being the reason for the high fees right now. You can set the tx fee yourself, but not on coinbase. So if you wanted something to clear for a purchase you'd set a higher fee so it confirms faster than say you transferring between your own wallets where you can set a low fee and wait. With coinbase having set tx fees and a TON of new users maybe this is raising the fees faster than it's ever been.  Maybe these tx are pushing out the more reasonable fee tx causing everything to go up. Anyone else think maybe this is why?

I came for the gains, but staying for the revolution. Hodling in hopes I can use it on a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:35:23
But the sub says otherwise
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:18:58
Don't. Tell him what it's about not why he should invest. Plus it's not a definite he'll gain, so if it drops he'll look at you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:43
This is sound advice. If you have 1000 to buy say, then buy in increments on the way down.

While I agree with this, it's a bad analogy. 
A better one would be. Jon produces 50 apples a week but has to give 20 to the land owner. Sam produces 500 apples and has to give 60 of his apples to the land owner. Jon complains that he has to give nearly half his product to the land owner and that Sam should give an equivalent share. Sam says it is fair because he gives the land owner more than what Jon produces for himself alone. Meanwhile Jon has to give over nearly 50% of what he produces while Sam gives little over 10%.

Did they buy with a card? If yes then the difference is the fee coinbase took for the transaction. They charge you a premium for instant access to your coin.
Also on the everyday use while we're on the tx topic. It would be better for businesses since the purchaser is paying the fees not the business. Places have minimum purchases if your using a card because if you buy a cup of coffee with a cc they're loosing money. Also some companies like American Express charge you a monthly fee to accept it on top of the tx fee. Your card declined? Business still pays a fee on that. Until prices stabilize most places won't accept it though. Sell something for 1000 today have  only 800 the next day is not good.

Something's wrong on your end. I'm on iPhone latest version of coinbase and the fees are there

Sold my fork when I did research into the tech and Roger Ver-min. Seriously how anyone can support someone that just robbed you and said there's nothing wrong with it, is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:00
Ahhhh your title makes it sound like you believed him. So then how does he not know about Ver and bitcoin.com?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:31
So why are we screwed if he sold all of his BTC? This isn't a surprise for anyone here. You do know the owner of bitcoin.com is Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:11:18
If it's better why can't it operate under its own name?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:45:17


I'm having a hard time understanding why more businesses don't accept BTC for this reason. Even when a card is declined some cards charge the business. They need more awareness of this.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:03:09
You need to look more into the specifics of the numbers. Does that 50% have taxable income or are they avoiding their taxes? The rich pay 90% but how much of their income is taxed? And what percent of the total income are they responsible for?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:41:32
Um yes it has. Did you just come out from under your rock?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:37:15
Bitcoin is not safe? You'd have to be retarded to not know bitcoin.com isn't for bitcoin? How do people believe in this guy? BCH is seeming more and more like a cult.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:45
Reset your phone? I honestly don't know but it's still there. From your screenshot you're missing the total at the bottom too, so it seems it's not fully loading right.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:35:13
Zoom out
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:05:50
Well that's why the *war* in the Middle East has gone on for so long. It's become a business.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:14
This. At first the dips are scary. Then when you've been through a few you remember that after the dip comes a new ATH
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:25:28
Like ones run by a single dictator? That doesn't care about his people just how much power and money they can take from their people?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:19:28


Was he talking about coinbase adding BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:41:53
He's already been fucked by Ver enough. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:36:52
There's more than enough, if the corporate loopholes are closed and the rich pay their FAIR share. Can't keep asking citizens that live week to week for more and more this long without push back.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:00:36
Na dude I don't own bcash
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:22:50
But what if they paid their fair share?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:57:44
Do you need an offline computer to transfer like for paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:19
It's your bank, call them
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:56:35
Breadwallet was what I was leaning toward but there's almost no reviews for any of the wallets. Just for Coinbase and blockchain.
Thanks for clearing that up. I was assuming a wallet is a wallet. Plus good thing I listened to this sub before buying through coinbase and just leaving it there. Can't even log into it now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:33:07
It's on your banks end. Call and make sure they didn't freeze your card before you go out and try to use it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:14:33
But if he does it'll reach that
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:20:07
From one new person to another I'll tell you the two lessons I've learned. One, don't try to time the market. You won't buy the bottom. Buy on the way down, if you have 1k just spend a few hundred at a time. And second just hodl. The price jumps around so much just don't sell, if it drops it will come back.

Mel is a hodler. Yes he does get slaughtered in the end and so could all of us. But remember, like Mel we do it for FREEDOM!!
