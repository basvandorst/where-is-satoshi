This technology has the *potential* power to completely skull fuck the entire global currency markets and Tulips are effectively useless. There might be too much market exuberance right now or might not be. Who knows.

If you're so sure that bitcoin will crash then go all in and short it. If you're right then you will become extremely wealthy.

Sure, there are better alternatives, but they're not on the front pages of newspapers world wide. Bitcoin is. That gives it a unique advantage.

Instead of crypto kitties, how about bitcoin doggo /s
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:54:37
eh, I agree with his economics but he does pump gold a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:17:25
The problem with bitcoin is that normal people dont get it. Its only going to gain mainstream adoption once its understandable by general society. Id say that we are quite far off given the general society is FUCKING RETARDED when it comes to anything computer related. A new type of crypto needs to be made that looks more like todays currency.

people shouldnt blindly follow investing advice on the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:42:10
Maybe it will, maybe it wont. No one has proof for it either way so dont bother arguing about hypotheticals.

How does tax payer theft fit into pension funds allocating some of their capital to VC?

Bitcoiners are so god damn childish.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:09:18
Bitcoiners learnt the term FUD and now they repeat it like the idiots that they are.

Ya, there's only like 12 ish million wallets out there. That's NOTHING. Americas population is &gt; 300 million alone. Bitcoin still has a long way to go.
