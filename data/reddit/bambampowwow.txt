So, let me get this straight, we can file through the bankruptcy trustee OR the people who they hired who actually know what they're doing? I'm going with Kraken. Plus, they're offering this crazy sick deal:

Yes, thank you. The promise of bitcoin is definitely misunderstood.

We can try to use words to help the situation until code gets there. So true.

Hey, can you make an EDIT4 that states that Mycelium and Kraken aren't behind this?
