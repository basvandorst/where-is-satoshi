Bandwidth is controlled through me *and* my ISP.  If my ISP doesn't like how much bandwidth I'm using, they cut me off.
Storage is controlled by me *alone*.  If I need more, I can buy more.  I can't just "buy more bandwidth".  I'm already at my highest residential bandwidth tier and going higher crosses me into "business" territory. 
Others' bandwidth limitations are more severe.  However, nothing stops those people from adding a $60 1TB hard drive to their rig.

Bad implementations of random number generators in certain software could allow an attacker, given multiple transactions signed by the same address, a hint as to your private key.  If the implementation is bad enough, two or three transactions signed by the same private key could give an attacker enough information to yank your private key.

Um, no, because I don't *control the printing press*.  If you control the printing press, controlling the amount of currency in circulation is *controlling the amount of currency in circulation*.

Maybe I'm being semantic, but people who are lending *by definition* have to trust the person they are lending to.  The point of interest is *how much that trust costs*.  If you are a "bad risk", you have to offer a lot to buy that trust.  If you are a "good risk", then you are easier to trust, and therefore can get a lower interest rate.

The US exports a lot of its inflation.  Other countries use the USD to stabilize their economy, which increases demand for USD.  Increased demand means you can introduce new supply without the value being disturbed.  Increased demand + steady new supply = stable price.
The problem occurs when they stop finding new demand.  That's when the fireworks start.

That's *exactly* what it means in the bitcoin world.  Heard of the "51% attack"?

@_date: 2015-06-16 17:33:28
But when you say "risk", it's important to define exactly what "risk" is actually being discussed.  There is a very low risk of anyone losing funds, because both chains would maintain balances.  So only double spends are a concern.  But, most major merchants utilize bitpay or coinbase, so they're insulated from the problem.
Again, I don't see there being a whole lot of risk because those most at risk are following this the closest, and those who aren't following closely aren't at large risk.

Why?  If the fork abides by the rules of the network and has higher proof of work, *it* becomes the longest chain.  If it doesn't, then the network doesn't recognize the fork, and only those running forked software will recognize the forked chain.
I'm not sure why it carries so much risk; the client people use will determine what chain they use.  Just because the two chains share the same history doesn't mean they aren't completely separate after the fork.

There are other reactions to this besides "Pay high fees" or "Don't use it at all".  Take Amazon for instance.  They don't offer free shipping if you only buy one thing.

It also makes hash power more profitable.  Do you mine?


Yes it does.  If blocks come out at 10 minutes no matter what, less miners means a bigger share per miner. 


Yes, that's the point.  Decreasing block reward *may* cause miners to drop out (if fiat conversion price doesn't change).  The remaining miners will have a larger incentive to continue mining.  It's a self correcting system.

@_date: 2015-06-09 11:27:19


Let me educate you.
If 51% of the miners mine the old chain, they all produce 1mb blocks.  The "new" miners mine the new chain, which produce 20mb blocks (theoretically).  However, 20mb blocks aren't recognized by 51% of the miners.  Whenever one is found, the majority of the network simply doesn't recognize it.  They make another chain with 1mb blocks, as before.  This chain becomes the longest chain (since 51% are mining on it), so 20mb clients follow it, because *that's how bitcoin works*.

Not really.  Miners help determine the max block size because they won't mine on bigger blocks, so if the majority of miners mine smaller blocks, your reference client will follow them because it's the longest chain of work.
So nodes may reject blocks *bigger* than their reference client allows, they won't reject blocks *smaller* than their reference client allows.  So the nodes can say "Hey!  We like bigger blocks", but if the miners say "no thanks" then no bigger blocks are generated.

Um... that's the way it works with *all* business, no?  
For creditors; that's why you evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness before you loan money, and that's why loaning money gets a high rate of return; the risk.
For shareholders; that's why you evaluate a business' fundamentals before you invest.  Shareholders get dividends, and/or additional capital as stock becomes worth more when a business is doing well.  The flip side is the stock loses value when a business is doing poorly.  If a bank fails; it was doing poorly.


In Cyprus is was only for people who had over the insured limit in the bank.  They *considered* doing it to all account holders, but the backlash was so strong and so sudden that they re-considered.  This sucks, but:
a) it teaches us a lesson; don't hold more than the insurable amount at any one bank.
b) it shows us which banks can be trusted and which banks can't.  Think if the bank were your buddy.  You asked him to hold some cash for you one night because you were hammered.  The next day, you say "Hey, let me get my money back" and he said "Sorry bro, I'm on hard times.  I can only give you *some* of it back".  Maybe he's not the guy to ask to hold your money next time.


I think the template is the best idea considering the circumstances.  It does indicate that keeping more than a working amount of money in a bank is a risk that needs to be calculated, instead of a certainty that can be depended on.  In my opinion that's a good thing.  I think individuals should take more responsibility for their own assets.  


I don't feel like they ever were.  It's like the stock market; it could go up for a long time.  But it isn't guaranteed to (no matter what anyone tells you; if someone promises a stock will always go up, run for the hills).  When I see "GUARANTEED", even if followed by " BY THE US GOVERNMENT", I'm still *a little* skeptical.  The US government is governed by politics that change.

You mean that?  No, I still don't feel a lot of sympathy for people who lost money in MtGox's implosion.  How the fuck can you sit here and talk about how greed is causing people to see Bitcoin as a feeding trough, and then turn around and sympathize with people who knowingly kept money on MtGox to try to turn a buck?  What the fuck kind of hypocrisy is that?


Not feeling sympathy and being a sociopath are completely different.  The fucking writing was on the wall for *months*.  Anyone who didn't take their money and run as fast and as far as they could knew they were taking a risk.  


I'm sorry, but you're fucking delusional.  Bitcoin was *4 years old* at the point MtGox imploded.  This sub *routinely* reminds people not to invest more than you can lose; bitcoin is still an experiment.  There was *no regulation*, *no consumer protection* and *ample evidence* to suggest that investing in bitcoin via MtGox was a bad idea.

What's the effective difference between destroying currency and holding it as a reserve, if you print the currency?  Don't you agree that holding currency effectively removes it from the market, and releasing currency effectively re-introduces it?
The ECB controls the supply of currency.  Holding/Destroying removes currency from the market, while Releasing(Spending)/Creating introduces currency into the market. Manipulating the supply to devalue your currency affects savers.


Yea, you could do that, I agree.  That would make your exports more competitive while not immediately increasing the costs of imports.  That's 1 other way that isn't directly the supply of currency. 


Whose devaluation are you speaking of?  Because the ECB just decided to create [60 billion Euro a month]( to buy bonds.  How is that not QE?

The *COUNTRY OF HONDURAS* is using it to secure land titles.  Do you really believe news like this comes from *lack of adoption*?  No.  In fact, there's a huge debate about block size because we're beginning to get hints that we could soon come close to the limits due to block size.  Some people who aren't well served by it tried to accept it too early, and are dropping support for it now because they aren't ready for it.

Ugh.  How barbaric.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:20:06
No no no.  We *started* with the assumption that 51% of miners *had already* not switched, and concluded that they would be able to maintain the small blocksize in spite of exchanges switching.  This was in direct opposition to your statement, which makes you *absolutely wrong*.
You can't now back pedal and say "Well, but who's to say they'll even not switch".  Your statement was rude, obnoxious, stated that I've shown a pattern of misunderstanding bitcoin, and when you're shown to be wrong (while simultaneously demonstrating that you *don't* understand how bitcoin works at the protocol level), you get all hand wavy and say "Well, that'll never happen anyway."
Admit it when you're wrong.  Otherwise you come off as petty and immature.
Now, to address you're moved goalpost, miners don't have to "launch a 51% attack".  If 51% *simply don't switch*, then they maintain the block size limit at 1mb, regardless of anyone else's feelings on the matter.  Indeed, all exchanges and nodes and 49% of miners can switch to the new client, and it'll work just fine.  It's just that 20mb blocks *won't be recognized* by the 1mb blockers, which will cause a re-org every time a 20mb is orphaned by the 51%-ers.

@_date: 2015-06-09 17:16:32
But that's not just increasing the blocksize, that's *also* intentionally ignoring old client blocks *despite being able to handle them concurrently*.  That's more than just an increase in block size, which is, again, you moving the goalposts so you don't look foolish.
Edit: On top of that, this is not a *broken understanding of bitcoin*, but an unclear understanding of your proposed fix (which is not clearly defined anywhere that I've seen, and I've looked).  My simple question "Why do it if it won't affect anything" was met with your derision.  Why do you have to be a douche, when I didn't start the conversation that way?  You could have simply said "Hey, that's not quite how it works, let's talk", but instead, you approached it with a very dickish condescending tone.  You don't win people over that way, because they immediately close up and get defensive.
TL;DR take a fucking communications class or google "How not to be a dick".
Edit2: Even if this is the proposal, why would we want to fork it in this way and risk losing such a large percentage of mining capacity?  That seems spiteful.  If miners see they're leaving money on the table, they'll switch.  Not recognizing their block simply because "Version; Muh Blocksize!" is not effective.

Human nature has a tendency towards personal bias.  That's why large scale medical studies are done "double blind", for instance.  If you have a desire for a particular outcome, it *will* skew how you approach the problem, whether intentionally or not.
For instance, in software development (my field of study), we have to insert "dumb" testers between us and the client, because even when testing, I have made assumptions that are not readily apparent to me.
Intentions only work so far; we have to know that human psychology skews us towards results that we desire.

I would agree that silver's industrial use is a detriment to silver as money.  However, as a hedge, silver may be a better commodity than gold *because* its value is propped up by utility.

The only people really at risk for what you describe are casual users, and they're mostly spenders, not merchants.  I don't see this as a major concern; the people most at risk will be monitoring this REALLY closely, and most people recommending any fork are suggesting it be released now, but only actually be implemented when more than a certain percentage upgrade.

Nope.  Nodes accept or reject blocks.  Their consensus matters too.

Indeed.  They *can* do whatever they want.  *Have* they?  No.  They *have* stated that XT will contain *support* for big blocks, but not that it will initiate a *hard fork*.  Hence my original fucking question.  Fuck.


But that was never part of our discussion.  It began with "Assuming 51% of the mining power...".


Nor did I intend to.  My statement began with "If 51% of the miners remain on the old protocol".  No "collusion" (which implies planning and forethought) needed; if 51% are simply too lazy to switch or decide independently to switch, they would remain on the old chain *without collusion*.

For the given network.


Creating two separate networks


Therefore the 1MB chain has consensus among itself.


If the 1MB block is valid on the 20MB chain, then it's the same chain.  Blocks point back to their parents.
If a hard fork happens and two chains are formed, then that means two groups have decided they can't reach consensus together, and so each follows a new set of consensus rules.
If you say that implies a lack of consensus, then there's no such thing as *true* consensus while any alt-coin or even other currency exists.

Of course you're right.  And if we're looking to create a unit of exchange, then this is important.  And I believe that bitcoin works well as a unit of exchange.  So in this matter, I concur.


I'm not sure that's true; gold was volatile back when we were pegged to it; that's one of the big reasons we decided to leave the gold standard.  Dollars aren't as volatile because there's a central bank who changes the inputs in order to force it to be relatively stable.  This happens to *any* commodity that isn't centrally managed.


That's true.  But when it's necessary, it's VERY necessary.


No, that's not true; gold is a great store of value and, as you say, gold is NOT widely circulated and accepted for commerce.


BTC will still be volatile though; different parts of the world place different value on different things.  A worldwide store of value is still going to fluctuate and swing, because the markets do.  The only way to stop that is to have someone actively tweaking the inputs of the function that is currency.  Without it, things inherently change due to the fact that *life* changes.

Bitcoin is not rising in price due to deflation.  It's rising much faster than deflation could ever account for.  The rise is due to increased adoption.  Once it's worldwide, only then will deflation really start to affect the price.  Notice a lot of other crypto-currencies with welldefined *inflation* rates are becoming more valuable too.
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:40:05
The value decreasing is only from the immediate sells.  Adoption is more important than immediate valuation.  More places to spend/use it = higher value based on use.  Higher value of use ~= higher monetary value (most of the time).

Which is as it should be, but not the way it is.  It may not warrant an investigation, but it can warrant seizure, and civil forfeiture is not the same as a criminal charge.
I'm saying the *effective outcome* is unreasonable search and seizure.
I'll ask again, and then we can leave it at that.  Why is money laundering considered a separate crime if concealing ill gotten gains can be considered tampering of evidence and/or interfering with an investigation?  My suspicion is that it is a tool to catch those who otherwise cannot be caught due to lack of evidence, and I firmly believe it is at the cost of personal liberty and privacy.  Banks are scared to let people withdraw (yes, WITHDRAW) large amounts of cash without asking probing questions.  Large cash proceeds cannot be deposited without sourcing the funds.  Agreed that these are bank policies, but they derive from the laws on the books.

One of the things I don't understand about these conversations is how neither side gets that it doesn't have to be *one or the other*.  It *used* to be one or the other because gold was heavy and hard to divide past a certain value point (being mechanically difficult to divide ever).  USD had advantages over gold because multiple denominations made the value easily divisible, and not nearly as heavy.  Now bitcoin can be an asset like gold, but also be easy to transmit.  But that doesn't mean USD has to disappear.  USD will continue to exist because it has the world's most powerful government using military force to keep it's value stable.  No other thing on earth can make that claim.

Yes, because of its intrinsic properties that give it usefulness in jewelry and electronics, like bitcoin gets value from being a decentralized clearing house, making it valuable as a payment mechanism.


The majority of its value comes from speculation though.  I read somewhere that gold's industrial value only makes up 12% of its demand.


Huh?  You can exchange gold and fiat.


Arguably; gold has other uses, and fiat can be used to pay taxes


But it's value is not only as a store of value, but as a payments mechanism.  So if the theoretical "bitcoin 2.0" does that better than bitcoin (say, 10 second confirmation times with the same or better security as bitcoin), then *that* crypto will be a better payments mechanism, which will increase its usage as a store of value.


Not without a third party, which is what differentiates bitcoin and makes it so technologically impressive.


Completely disagree.  Something could come along and do bitcoin better, and maybe displace it.  There's no requirement that it be bitcoin or nothing.

Good in the sense that other ideas can be tried without affecting bitcoin.  
The idea that alt-coins destroy the scarcity of bitcoin is silly.  Bitcoin has a network of people, many of which who don't see the benefit of adopting *another* cryptocurrency when bitcoin is sound and more widely known and accepted.  This "network effect" makes bitcoin better than all altcoins.  And bitcoin embodies the idea of competing currencies; altcoins are a natural extension of that.
That being said, so far they're mostly stupid.  I only support Litecoin because A) it keeps my GPUs profitable :) and B) a second chain helps with mixing/anonymity.

Not at all.  Banks are directly protecting their assets.  Stakeholders in bitcoin are *indirectly* protecting their assets by mining, because if they are the only ones mining, their assets are still just about worthless, so they *rely* on others to also mine and provide security they couldn't provide themselves.  If this is not incentivized directly, it won't get done.  It's like saying "Everyone likes to live, so they are incentivized to clean up the environment, or eventually they could die."

Blaming bitcoin for increasing online theft is a red herring.  It's not *bitcoin* that should be blamed, it's the fact that its a *new industry*.  The players in the first few stages of bitcoin's evolution may end up losing their pants.  The second stages should provide more stability.  
Edited to add:


Bitcoin does too.  It's called escrow.  Again, you have to compare apples and apples.  Cash does not have a mechanism for chargebacks.  You must still involve a third party.  Bitcoin has m of n transactions, which, unlike current money systems, never expose the transaction to the risk of theft or seizure from the third party escrow provider.

It looks like you're right on debit cards:


that the rule and model language should
focus on the ‘‘authorization’’ of ATM
and one-time debit card transactions,
rather than ‘‘payment’’ of such
transactions. The final rule generally
retains the language regarding
‘‘payment’’ of ATM and one-time debit
card transactions as proposed. While an
institution decides whether or not to
authorize an overdraft, fees are typically
charged for the institution’s payment of
the transaction. Additionally, in some
instances, transactions are not
submitted for authorization before the
transaction is presented for payment (for
example, where a transaction is below
the floor limits established by card
network rules requiring authorization).
As discussed below, the final rule does
not provide an exception allowing
overdraft fees to be charged for payment
of a transaction that overdraws the
consumer’s account where authorization
was not requested by the merchant or
other party. Moreover, some
transactions that are authorized into
overdraft settle into good funds and do
not result in overdraft fees.
However, the final rule and
commentary include the word
‘‘authorize’’ where necessary for
accuracy. For example, § 205.17(b)(4)
provides an exception to financial
institutions that have a policy and
practice of declining to ‘‘authorize and
pay’’ any ATM or one-time debit card 
So even if there is an inadvertent ATM/one-time debit transaction that overdrafts; they can't charge you for it.  Intradesting.

There's no way to actually tell if a bad actor is submitting a block.  Otherwise there'd be a way to intrinsically tie bitcoin to an identity, which there isn't.
I just actually posted; I wonder if a p2pool only chain could be forked, and instead of trying to filter OUT bad actors, p2pool would be the only place for a block to be mined, basically filtering IN.  If you weren't a p2pool miner, you didn't get to participate.  I'm wondering what the drawbacks are here.

What do you mean "arbitrarily"?  All difficulty rounds are as long as they are for arbitrary reasons.

And I've tried more than once to tell you that the conversation isn't about encouraging widespread adoption.  It's about whether or not a method of security is "laughable".

I've given you examples of things that are highly secure, but rarely engaged in by the "layman".  Those highly secure methods are not "laughable".
You are trying to establish a metric here that doesn't work.  Your criteria for "absurdity" is whether a normal person would do it.  That's not a valid criteria because normal people don't normally engage in the most secure method of storage for their valuables.  The most secure method to transport cash is via armored car.

If someone has a gun to your head, the TREZOR is a trivial step in the process.  Without it they only have to compel you to give up your private key.  If you have access to it, a gun is a compelling reason to give up that access.  TREZORs don't protect from that unless you put them in a location that is not easily accessed, which you can do with a paper wallet too.  TREZORs protect against digital security risks, not physical ones.

You're twisting it around.  I'm saying that building systems that require us to "make people do what most people think should happen" works less than building systems that "naturally encourage people to do what most people think should happen".  Bitcoin is a good example of that; it encourages security through monetary incentive.  It actually harnesses the "tragedy of the commons" to provide additional security.  If all miners agreed to just keep their level of income, difficulty would never move, and security would never increase.  But because of the tragedy of the commons, some miners will increase their power, and thus other miners have to increase theirs just to keep their income level the same.  In this way, the bitcoin ecosystem actually *utilizes human greed to strengthen itself*.
New approaches to these problems are warranted IMO, because using force of law to solve them allows those with the most money to buy the law, and thus exert force in a way that appears to be societally acceptable.

Proof of stake doesn't do well with consensus because you don't lose anything by contributing to the consensus.  Therefore you can participate in multiple forks simultaneously.  How do you validate which chain is the RIGHT chain if everyone can use their stake on all the forks?  With bitcoin, you have *work* that you lose when you contribute to consensus, so you lose *something*.  You don't want to be on the wrong chain because then the fruits of your labors (mined coins + txn fees) will be abandoned by consensus.

The real reason (IMO) that bitcoin is so amazing is that it introduces a system that assures scarcity in a digital world, without a third party.
In the beginning of the internet, everything could be copied copious amounts of time.  There was no way to be sure that the file you were holding was the only one.  Someone could copy the file and you wouldn't know.
Then, they started with servers that kept track.  Think WoW Gold or Linden Dollars.  Scarcity was assured by third parties.  But you still had to trust that these third parties hadn't created a copy in secret.  Works fine if you trust the third parties (like banks), but some people don't want to *have* to trust *anyone*.
Bitcoin creates a decentralized network that allows you to trust that there is one sole owner of this network's unit of account (bitcoin).  This instantly creates a worldwide ledger that is accessible to just about anyone, just about anywhere.  And if you hold some of the units of account, there are other people willing to trade for those units.
It's just amazing to see scarcity that doesn't rely on a single third party in an endlessly reproducible digital world.  
To me, and I think Satoshi and many others, that makes the network more valuable than simply a payment system.  It reduces the requirement of trust to do business on the internet, which lubricates the digital economy in many ways.

Not necessarily.  Think of the cold wallet like a long term savings plan, and the hot wallet as your wallet.  Then when you *obtain* bitcoin, you put what you want to spend in your hot wallet, and your savings in your paper wallet.
Then you can segregate your paper wallets into denominations (.1btc, 1btc, 5btc, etc) and if you need them quickly, you can pick the denomination you need.
Forethought eliminates a large amount of hassle for any endeavor.

How do you allow consensus, but prevent consensus from being malignant?  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Either the ledger is kept decentralized or it's centralized.  If it's decentralized, there will ALWAYS be a chance that someone will control a majority of the decentralized actors.

Depends on how you look at it.  I trust Dell and Newegg because I have previously done business with them and recognize their brand.  I wouldn't hesitate to pay cash at a Newegg or Dell outlet with every expectation of being able to return my products should they break.  In fact, most large stores offer return policies that are legitimate, and the only time I can foresee using chargebacks is with shady businesses and unknown individuals, in which case I'd prefer to use credit or some other escrow to protect my funds in case of scammers.
Bitcoin gives us the choice.  Over time, that choice should pan out to mean more savings for those of us willing to trust the merchant.  Just as many brick and mortar businesses offer a cash discount, now online companies can do the same.

You got it right.  Some people have a limited understanding of the goals ethereum is attempting to achieve, and only see another altcoin.  As an alt, it's not great; large pre-mine and steady inflation is something that's been tried before and failed miserably.  But it's not really trying to be a currency, and that's why I think it holds promise.  I don't think buying ether will make you money though, it's probably going to end up being pretty cheap to buy, especially at first when there's not a lot of contracts on which to use it.

You got burned.  That shit sucks.  I feel for you.  But if you held it there long term you were either 
* a daytrader 
* naive
* uninformed
* stupid  
You seem well spoken so I'll assume it's not that you are stupid.  You say you are a semi-early adopter so you have to have heard all the problems with MtGox.  If you were around in April 2013 you'll remember MtGox buckled, causing the last crash.  That was when I started scratching my head.  When they started having fiat withdrawal problems, I ceased any trading I did on MtGox.  It wasn't worth the risk that I wouldn't get my money when I had other options for trading.  Also, as a semi-early adopter you are probably familiar with the time during which MtGox was about $100 more than other exchanges, and the almost daily "If I buy at other exchanges and sell at MtGox, won't I be like, instantly rich?" posts.  And finally, you would have seen when MtGox was blaming malleability on their "issues" which eventually led them to bankruptcy protection.  So you had to be aware, and therefore probably weren't uninformed.
That leaves naive or a day trader.  If you were truly naive and believed the whole time that MtGox was on the up and up and everything was a result of external factors, then I do have some sympathy, but you kind of had to completely reject all the naysayers of MtGox.  You should have at least taken some out of MtGox when you started hearing there were potential issues.  
And if you were a day trader, then well, that's on you.  You should have known better or not been day trading.

No, in fact, there is no *functional* difference.  *Functionally*, switching the display and leaving the protocol vs switching the protocol and leaving the display are identical from a user perspective.  There's no difference in usability.  As long as all holdings are equally multiplied across the space, how is anything different other than the display?  Please explain to me how multiplying everyone's holdings by 1000 and making it 21 billion instead of 21 million negatively impacts *anything*.  
I do, however, see two benefits to this approach; first of all it makes it more approachable to a broader audience (as with stock splits), and second of all it provides a solution to divisibility, since the protocol can currently not handle anything smaller than a satoshi, which could possibly require subdivision in the future.

I don't think bitcoin provides a technical solution to money laundering and withholding deposits, because that's not really a technical problem, but a human behavior problem.  Bitcoin removes the NEED for these guys, taking away some of their power, meaning the whole "bank" situation can be avoided if you choose.  Right now you kind of have to give them your business if you want to participate in online commerce.  Routing around them is a major step forward in making these kinds of problems avoidable.

It's not a flaw, dumbass.  It's a core concept.  Bitcoin is designed to achieve consensus among miners.  If 51% of the mining power votes a certain way, then that's the way it goes.  The flaw is based in the idea of consensus to begin with.  It's a similar flaw in democracy in general.  If it's such a major flaw, why don't we just throw out democracy too while we're at it?

The term volatility means how much and how often it changes.  Making it change more often is the very definition of volatile.  An antonym would be "stable".  Changing the difficulty to 10000 blocks would make it more "stable".


But the big miners get whatever portion of the network in hashpower they have over time; that doesn't change if you change the difficulty settings.  Remember, it is also a shorter time during which SMALL miners can take advantage of the lag in difficulty.  


Yea, I don't see the real downside either.


I think Satoshi picked two weeks arbitrarily.  It could be a deal shorter or longer without much effect.
My real question is why the hard cap of 21,000,000?  Seems just as arbitrary; why not 20,000,000?  And for that matter, why start the reward at 50?  Why not start it at a multiple of 2, like 64, so when it halves it stays round numbers all the way down to 1?

Right, it makes it more difficult.


But withdrawals to international ATMs can raise flags, giving them more visibility than if you just carry a bunch of cash.


Debit and credit cards are generally used to purchase directly, so while there are ways around it, they generally know what you are buying.  Additionally, there are limits on daily withdrawals, which make it more difficult to quickly move money.


Agreed, but if you want to move $50k, $1000 a day means you have to spend seven weeks withdrawing money.  Even the $10k limit means over a week worth of daily withdrawals.  It's not an all out prevention, but it does make it take longer, which gives them more time.


It shows you spent it abroad.  This may or may not be an indication for the bank to flag your account.  It gives them more visibility than if you carry cash.
I agree this doesn't stop money laundering, but it makes it a hell of a lot more inconvenient.

Right here is where you lost me.  This assumption right here is where I disagree.  It doesn't necessarily hurt the economy.  This is IMO a fallacy that I'd challenge you to prove.


This would never happen.  Many people want to GROW their savings in a large, measurable way.  Not everyone just wants to "store their money".


Except now you have people who are not necessarily experts REQUIRED to invest their money so as not to lose value.  This means if they don't want to lose money, they must pay an expert.  


But the downside is that everyone with any notable extra wealth is now REQUIRED to invest in order to preserve that wealth.  This is part of what fueled the housing bubble most recently, and the dot-com bubble before that.  People who are not experts at investing HAVE to invest to preserve wealth.


And keep them for future expenditures.  Or maybe, if he chooses he can invest them if he would like to make a higher return than the rate of deflation.  However, he isn't FORCED to do so as he was previously, since now his savings grows slightly instead of decaying slightly.


I disagree.  Small known depreciation wouldn't be the same as hyperdeflation, and I think the capital market crises you describe is not created by a small amount of appreciation over time, but a large hyperdeflationary scenario.


Rational Actors have other motivations for selling than a small return based on deflation.  It's easy to beat that return by investing, *if you choose*.  We're not talking about *hyperdeflation*, we're talking about a slow, widely known amount of deflation.


It's not a *strong encouragement*.  The protocol's minting of coins is a slow, stepped down deflation that occurs over time.  This encouragement is *weak*.


And yet, the bitcoin economy is gaining traction.  You see, when a currency is gaining value, merchants have to entice users to part with that currency.  Merchants want as many bitcoins as they can get their hands on.  So, the deflation actually DISCOURAGES frivolous spending, which many people believe is part of the cause of our decaying environment.
It's not all as simple as the straight Keynesian model most economic textbooks teach.

It's not "such banks", it's "such products" within a bank.
A bank is now required to offer assets that are *not insured* that will be used first in the event of a liquidity crisis.  This is in contrast to the previous situation where taxpayer dollars were used in the event of a liquidity crisis.
It's like making banks provide for their own insurance, and having the banks source it from willing participants.
But if people want FDIC insured deposits, they'll still be able to get them.

You may be able to argue that anonymous is not exactly private (although I'd say they were very close in real world usage), but anonymity is not THAT difficult to acheive.  Buy bitcoins locally, for cash.  Transfer through a mixer to another wallet.  Now no identity has been tied to your bitcoins and even the seller doesn't know you still own them.  Maybe that's not "private" in your dictionary, but it's a hell of a lot more "private" than dollars at the bank, and only slightly less anonymous than gold/silver.

Fast difficulty retargeting causes all sorts of problems.  Look at terracoin; the retargeting was done every 10 minutes.  The difficulty fluctuated so badly, if you were a miner you never had any idea if you were profitable or not.  Then, people started gaming the system, getting the difficulty up real high and then pulling out as soon as it retargeted, making it impossible to mine.  People would all abandon ship, difficulty would drop to nothing and the gamer would fire up his power again, taking control of the network.
Fast blocks don't do much for security, as litecoin demonstrates.  Two minute blocks are about 1/5th as secure as 10 minute blocks, negating any security benefits after the first confirmation.  It does help reduce the lag time for the first confirmation, but we already have that.  Litecoin is the only "first-gen" coin I see existing side by side with bitcoin long term.  Etherium and darkcoin seem to be the two "next-gen" coins that I'd bet on.

Printing a string is overly complicated?  Now you're just trolling me.


Linux users know exactly how complicated it is.  And adoption rates are only abysmal among retail consumers.  Business users are adopting Linux at higher rates than ever due to the lower cost and higher control it provides.


But people don't need to do this *just to use* bitcoin.  That's my whole point.  The security here is only for investors and long term holders.  Until bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous, holding long term savings in bitcoin is an exercise in speculation, not simple savings.  This is not something the average Joe is even expected to do at this point.  Right now it'd be nice to see the average Joe using bitcoin to subvert higher ACH fees and take advantage of merchant discounts.  Not store thousands of dollars in bitcoin.

I may not really understand this problem, but don't time-outs make this problem realistically moot?  The way I understand it, the Byzantine general's problem address the fact that a packet (or pigeon) can't be known for sure to have been received without an acknowledgement (or pigeon) being returned.  This acknowledgement has the same problem as the original packet, so a separate acknowledgement is needed, which has the same problem as the original packet, and on and on forever.

"Nothing at stake" is most definitely NOT a myth.
What prevents minters from minting on multiple chains?  In bitcoin, it's the expenditure of resources that causes miners to choose the right chain and stick with it and only it.  But if they could mine on all chains, they would, to increase their profit.  PoS can't prevent minters from using their minting power on multiple chains, because minters don't have anything to lose by doing so.  Hence, "nothing" is at stake for them to mint on multiple chains.  So consensus is not reliable.

Ok, I understand the point you were making about economic booms.  Yes, I concede that inflation occurs because of economic booms.  Yet inflation has other origins too.

But a gold coin is indeed "portable cows", if cows have a ubiquitous value.  
Bitcoin is based on "HashCash", which has the word "Cash" in it.  The whole point of bitcoin was to demonstrate artificial scarcity, which previously was not possible in a digital environment absent a third party.  That's why it's "internet cash" or "digital cash", because there's no need for a third party to verify the transaction.

I too have noticed that all currently available hardware is not profitable.
My strategy, which I have employed with some degree of success, is to wait for the newest/greatest thing to reap rewards for people with deep pockets and expensive electricity.  When they dump it, I swoop in and mine until it's no longer profitable with my electricity costs, at which time I pass it along to someone else who either has cheaper electricity than me or doesn't math.
It's a fun hobby and it generally pays for itself.

Clarify for me would you?  My understanding is that dogecoin continues to create more dogecoin forever.  It continues to increase its monetary base, slightly devaluing the currency, which encourages people to spend, not save.  This, in my opinion, is detrimental.


Anyone CAN have a hypocritical opinion, but mine isn't hypocritical.  I believe bitcoin brings something better than USD.  I don't believe dogecoin brings something better than bitcoin.  That's not hypocritical.


But the changes are tiny and its obvious to everyone in the room that the costume was just ripped off from the original.  Sure you added tinfoil antennae, but it doesn't make the costume look better.  Now it looks stupid.


Agreed, and I'll keep an eye out for things that implement the core concepts in better ways.  I'm paying attention to ethereum and NXT.  Dogecoin just cloned litecoin and tweaked one or two settings, and smashed a stupid dog face on their icon and called it a day.  Let's be honest here.


Indeed different, but not applicable to doge.


Already covered in Litecoin, of which I'm a fan, since I like the idea of keeping ASICs at bay a little longer and think that at least one other similar blockchain is beneficial for the economy since it allows for easy mixing and a lifeboat in case bitcoin ever gets perma-banned by name.


But dogecoin isn't one of them, and it's got a stupid meme to boot.

But they have to appease their voters or they lose their position.  In a private industry, they only have to appease their shareholders.


Because parties with no primary interaction have no power.  In the state, even though I may not be involved directly, I can express my discontent with the entire process by voting someone in office.  I admit it's not perfect, as voting processes can be usurped, politicians can (and do) lie, etc.  But it's a different approach than pure money, which makes it *more difficult* to usurp the process.


That's not true.  The "cartel" you speak of challenges itself all the time.  It's called "Appeals".  It's called "overturning judgements".


Yea, society would band together, and maybe choose people well suited to the task to lead them and fact find for them.  Not everyone is fit to run a campaign against some company.  Maybe these chosen people get paid a salary made up of a pool from the society as a whole to advocate for their interests.  Sounds familiar...


As the state is seen as a people-sanctioned unit.  Therefore the usage of violence must be sanctioned by the people.  When that process gets corrupted (as it appears to be doing now), the state attempts to use violence against the sanction of the people.  Too much of this and the government loses all power through revolution.


The government is not a single entity.  It's not a "monopoly" because it's not one monolithic unit working towards the same end.  Elected officials work to get re-elected by their constituents.  Their constituents' wants and needs differ, and thus are regularly at odds.

I donate as it is to homeless shelters, food banks, cancer research and the VA.  And that's ON TOP of taxes.  If I didn't pay taxes, I'd have a lot more income and I would donate more to those things.  On top of that, I believe that a private model would work better for public roads (not ALL roads, but major arteries like interstates), and public education should be "opt-out" because I feel like the federally mandated curriculum is not personal enough and I'd prefer to take my money somewhere where they tailor the education to the individual.  I like the idea of local government, but the federal government is too far removed to decide what's best for my community in regards to homeless shelters, public roads and public education.  Giving me an option to personally allocate a portion of my federal income tax would go a long way to placating that concern in me and in a lot of others I've talked to.
Again, I too foresee people misallocating 100% of their tax funds due to ignorance, stupidity, apathy or malice.  That's why I suggested only a portion be personally allocated.

Depends on what you mean by "sort itself out".
Most humans are against swings in the markets that affect them (basic food sources, gas, electricity, etc).  They attempt to regulate the *swings*.  Others believe that if you incorporate those swings, then your outcome is generally more favorable than if you try to force the issue.  Yes, it may be more chaotic.  Yes, some people end up hurting.  But humanity overall is better off and less people suffer than when you try to force markets to behave in an orderly fashion.  I always go back to the analogy of the wildfire.  If you let leaves accumulate in a forest year after year to avoid a little fire, you end up with a situation where you have too much fuel and if a small fire does happen spontaneously, it's way more likely to kill everything in the entire forest.  Small brush fires generally don't reach the treetops, so most small fauna can escape into the them.  Large animals smell the fire coming and GTFO.  Losses are minimal, and the underbrush comes back stronger and more robust.  By trying to either "smooth out" or force markets to behave a certain way (for instance, real estate), you end up painting over problems until they reach a point where they're systemic.

Ok. BFL sucks.  Avalon fucked people over.  But there's tons of hardware that HAS made it to market, that has been successful.  Antminers come to mind as a good example.  Asicminer too.


Yea, reddit's not the best place for economic advice.  I'll try again, because you seem to have skipped it completely:
Mining requires system administration.  It requires data center expertise.  Profit is maximized by up time.  Making ASICs requires foundry experience and manufacturing experience.  In fact, ALL the major ASIC manufacturers get their chips made at a foundry that they don't own.  
It's kind of like saying "Intel is gonna corner the market doing scientific research because they have the best chips, and why would they sell those chips to research centers when they could just crunch scientific data themselves?".

The answer is **no** because the velocity of money itself is an *indicator*, and not a root *cause*. 
I don't get how you can keep shouting this from the roof top.  Money changing hands is an *indicator* of economic activity.  If me and you deigned it necessary to increase/decrease the *velocity*, and did so in an *arbitrary manner*, there would be no net effect on the economy.  Why aren't you understanding this?


Notice how your quote says it's a *correlation*.  That's because arbitrarily modifying the velocity of money doesn't affect economic activity.




So economists see a *effect* of an increase in the money supply and an increase in velocity if there's an increase in money supply.  Exactly.


Nice hedge, wikipedia.  I can do that too:  Either aliens, evolution or both are responsible for life evolving.  That's a correct statement, right?


Read a little further:


See, what you left out here is that the velocity of money is increasing *because sellers are demanding a risk premium for holding the money*.  Right here in your supporting documentation, it says that the base cause is not that money is changing hands more rapidly, but that sellers want to be compensated for taking money that is dropping in value.
There's no fundamental property of money that causes it to lose value *simply by changing hands*.  There's no way for that to cause anything.  It's an indicator of other fundamentals.  If people use it more, then it must be going down in value, because people aren't willing to hold it.  If people use it less, then it must be going up in value, because people don't want to get rid of it.
There's no need for you to get all snippy and irritated.  That just leads to anger, and to you calling me names, which doesn't help your argument.  Challenge yourself to understand the actual discussion and refute it.  Show how the simple act of changing hands causes money to lose value.  Just try, one time.

Bitcoin arguments
* Backed by nothing
The intrinsic value theory is a dying concept.  Look up subjective value theory. 
* Ponzi Scheme
Ponzi scheme pays early investors' returns with new investors' investments.  Once investors run out, scheme fails.  Bitcoin doesn't fail when people stop buying; it continues to work as expected.  It also doesn't promise any returns
* Security is difficult to implement
This is true; security for bitcoin is not the best.  This is one reason I wouldn't recommend my Grandma get into it yet.  Things like the Trezor are coming though, and we should see leaps and bounds in security this year and next.
* Bitcoin is deflationary, and therefore evil
Two points here; one is that bitcoin doesn't have to replace the dollar.  Gold is deflationary but the market for gold is huge.  The second point is that inflation influences our economy in many ways, including encouraging consumption, which is bad for us as humans and the environment.

Agreed, but you can lie to them and tell them you didn't make that transaction.  That's free.


The dispute being the key here.  If the dispute is "That wasn't me", it's hard for the merchant to prove it unless it was in person and they have a recording.


Source?  Would also like to see what percentages are where the merchant loses because of identity theft, and ends up eating the cost of the chargeback plus the cost of the stolen good.


Yep, that's true.  The banks definitely try to prevent chargebacks wherever possible.  The cost of fraud is still to the tune of over [$11 billion annually](  


Again, source?  Because my source (Wikipedia) says that there are a number of ways to [attack EMV](

It would be ridiculous to propose that people will stop selling furniture because it'll be worth more later.  Well, that same argument can be applied to currency.

Sigh.  Dude, you don't get it, or you have a reading comprehension problem.  You can't just magically create an algebra equation to simulate the complexity of the real world.
The algebra equation provides you with a causal, one way interpretation.  This isn't high school algebra, it's college level economics, which you obviously aren't familiar with.
The **REASON** velocity increases when price drops is because PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT.  If you manipulate the velocity by INTENTIONALLY forcing the velocity to increase, you don't magically reduce price.  People aren't looking at how fast money is moving and saying "Hey, other people are moving money too quickly, I don't want it now".  
Don't you understand the basic adage "Correlation does not imply causation"?  Velocity is a LAGGING INDICATOR of price, not the other way around.
The formula doesn't encapsulate everything about the system.  Think about your assumption and what it means in a real world scenario.

Origin and cost basis are different.

I believe a second cryptochain is beneficial for better coin mixing.  I believe multiple altchains allow us to experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the ecosystem, like how Terracoin's 10 minute difficulty changes cause mining volatility.  It also allows us to see how people could attack the system, like when feathercoin was hit with a 51% attack (they let it stand instead of invalidating other real transactions that took place at the time).
There are definitely good reasons to have altcoins.  Most are kind of junk, but one or two serve real purposes.

Until they use guns, and then it becomes a real battle.


That's true.  It doesn't apply in a 51% attack, but if SHA256 is flawed, then yes.


Because in one scenario, there's a high likelihood that the newly chosen algorithm won't change again.  In another scenario, there's no reason to expect it won't.


You can pay bills in bitcoin with third parties.  Hence not incorrect.  I see no explanation as to why its irrelevant; miners were some of the first customers demanding products be priced in bitcoin.


How is changing the algorithm making it so the network can't be 51% attacked?  My whole premise here is that a new algorithm doesn't take away the risk of a 51% attack, *at all*.


All algorithms can be attacked.  Do you understand what an ASIC is?  ASIC stands for **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit.  It means a chip developed especially for a given algorithm.  All algorithms can have ASICs designed for them, and thus all algorithms are susceptible to 51% attacks in a blockchain based model.


Then why bitcoin at all?  Visa does a pretty good job at centralized payment processing.


Sorry bud, but this argument doesn't fly.  Miners provide the backbone off which the network is based.  If you destroy their investments, they don't continue to play ball.
 &gt; You act like the current miners is the same as all possible miners. This is simply untrue.
Yep, you got me.  Other people *could* mine.  But the people who've invested time and money in to bitcoin would disappear.  Your network would shrink to alt-coin status immediately.
The fact is, if a 51% attack is successful, it will put crypto's in fringe status, if anyone sticks around to participate.


It's not at all like an overpaid union worker.  Replacing the algorithm is like a huge safety recall.  Union workers can go on strike, and you can bring scabs in, but if the product itself is shown to be unsound, neither the union workers or the scabs will have a job anymore.

It's easy to join, and while it's a little more difficult to setup, it's not at all bad for anyone with a large mining operation who is used to sysadmin option.  It indeed merge mines namecoin (albeit as a solo miner).  The fee is zero, uptime is 100% (since it's decentralized) and DDoS resistant (again because it's decentralized).
I understand why GHASH may be attractive.  It just seems weird for people with large amounts of money invested in the network to do something that contributes to damaging the image of that network.

Are you saying that the pool gets blacklisted?  How do you accomplish that?
Otherwise, the malicious pool would build ON TOP of the current chain, so the client wouldn't know to black list it until it had already added the chain to the end.
Here's an explanation for what I mean.  Take a look at this picture: 
Assume the red blocks are the blocks that are part of the "checkpoint", and the checkpoint is 5 blocks.  While the rest of the network works on the green blocks, GHASH.IO works on the blue blocks, in private.  Once GHASH.io solves the sixth block, they submit them all at once, and they now have the longest chain.
This holds true for whatever checkpoint you want.  Seven blocks back?  No problem, GHASH.IO just mines eight before the network can mine 8.  Now they have the longest chain.  Are you starting to see the problem?

Yes, I completely agree with you.  Unless there's something to be gained like a bitcoin discount, doesn't accept credit cards, or site makes you paranoid (think porn sites that debit your credit card without your knowledge), then regular ecommerce for individuals in developed nations probably have no reason to convert to using bitcoin.

Admittedly, no.


And this only gets worse when you add hash rate to P2Pool. The difficulty retargetting algorithm would make it even harder to find a share.
I see.  So variance is par for the course.  More miners means more variance due to the p2pool chain.  I would still think it wouldn't be a 1-to-1 ratio (more miners = more variance), since the blockchain is so much higher in variance, but I understand that there would be an increase so it's not as simple as "more miners, less variance".

Musicians and consumers benefit the most from a decentralized model.  Hence my original comment.  Do you disagree that the centralized model benefits the record label?

But if a single company runs it, it's not unforgeable any longer.  They can fork at will to reverse charges.  Additionally, they can refuse to process payments.  Those are two of the biggest draws to bitcoin; charges can't be reversed and payments aren't refused.  
Otherwise it's no longer digital cash, it's just a transparent Visa.  Of course not everyone would be averse to the idea, but the true value of bitcoin would be lost.

The narrative that governments are afraid of bitcoin is laughable.  The United States has the largest economy in the world.  Demand is everywhere for the US Dollar.  Why would they be afraid of bitcoin when they make the rules that dictate how the largest economy on earth operates?  They just tell businesses how they are allowed to use bitcoin, and by and large businesses will do it that way.  There's no reason to be afraid of bitcoin, and therefore no reason to spend $1 billion to kill it.

It's entirely possible that the welfare she was provided was factored in by her employers and as such she was paid lower than her contribution to society is actually worth because her employer was letting the government foot some of the bill.  It's a common practice.
Also, I've seen first hand what can happen when you are on income-based assistance.  The way many of these programs are designed, it's likely that a small raise can end up netting the worker less money because that raise disqualifies them from the program.
I believe that welfare and social programs like this have good intentions, but often end up with unintended consequences that can make it worse on people.
Also, I don't believe was implying that every single person on welfare is not deserving of some kind of assistance, so your anecdotal reply probably isn't warranted.

But massive amounts of transactions were failing for people who weren't even involved in attempts to steal.  I believe that someone saw a vulnerability in MtGox's system and bogged them down by messing with as many of them as possible.

I agree, but this deviates from the point I was making.  First; you don't comment how the watch was obtained.  If Hitler gave it to you, there's no ethical conundrum.  If it was stolen from him, that's when we run into the ethical dilemma.


This is a good point to respond to using [Dunbar's Number](  Reinforcing my belief that humans are just a step above animals, we see that primates have pretty well defined group sizes.  Beyond that size, we really don't care about other people.  I'd prefer my child to eat and some unknown merchant's child to die if that was my only choice.  So again, principles are great, but I'd throw most of mine out to ensure the safety of my child.  Expecting others not to is naïve.  To be upset with me for making that choice demonstrates a lack of understanding of human nature.  


I personally believe that there are better ways to approach the problem.  As an anecdotal example; my mother's friend worked at a day care and received disability from the government.  She recently received a $.25 raise in her paycheck, which resulted in her no longer qualifying for disability.  I like to refer to these situations as "speed bumps".  She'd have to get another $2.50 in raises before she even equaled the level of income she received before the raise.  She had to request that the raise be rescinded so she could keep her disability.  This highlights the "All or Nothing" approach.  Tiered services are the only way to go IMO.

Never said that.  I said it is libertarian because it allows freedom of exchange.  Not because it uses cryptography.  You suggested that cryptography is libertarian and I agreed.  But it's also statist, which is why you wouldn't say it "leans libertarian" or that it "leans statist".  But bitcoin is *not* used by the US government because that would decrease the demand for the very dollar that gives them power.  So bitcoin "leans" libertarian because it favors their ideals over statist ideals.  See now?


Yes, it was used and developed for personal freedom


Never said that either.


Another swing and miss.  I said it had a goal to further the libertarian cause, not that it's *only* goal was to further libertarian cause.


Yea, because you made them up.


lolwut?  I think you need a lesson in reading comprehension.


Which is *ok*.  But only if they *want* it.  When there is no option to opt out, there's tyranny.  If I have a *real* choice, then it's free association.  If I want to follow someone, I should be allowed to.


To that I can agree.
My whole point is that there are real connections to libertarian movements.  You can say that the tool is apolitical, but the truth is that free association is one of the fundamental tenets of libertarianism.  Bitcoin is a tool that facilitates free association.  This is my argument, plain and simple.  It's not circular as you have suggested.  It's direct:
Bitcoin allows freedom of association ---&gt; freedom of association is one of the core goals of libertarianism ---&gt; bitcoin furthers this libertarian goal ---&gt; bitcoin leans libertarian. 
Additionally, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists played a major part in the early promotion of bitcoin, and were some of the first adopters to use it.  Linking to those subs is a way to show appreciation.
It's simple.

The only trustless way is as and mentioned, using M-of-N addresses.  You would create a 2-of-2 address and have all the funds deposited there.  Then you could have a program that listened for inputs, and created transactions that used those inputs to generate a transaction using predefined addresses as outputs, sending the coins in a predefined split.  Then all you'd have to do is have both members sign the transaction to release the funds, and then broadcast the now valid transaction.

I definitely would, because having that private key doesn't guarantee ownership, and therefore shouldn't be considered ownership.  In fact, I don't think bitcoin can be "owned" at all in the traditional sense.  It can only be "under your control".  I think the distinction is usually irrelevant, but for this specific discussion is the crux of the disagreement.


I just explained why I think it's right.  Telling me it's wrong doesn't advance the discussion.  The blockchain (the bank) holds the bitcoin (the dollars).  Transferring bitcoin (the dollars) requires a private key (the user/pass combo, atm card + pin, id + account number, or whatever other method you use to access your account's contents) to send bitcoin (the dollars) to a recipient.  **How** does this analogy not work?  **What part** of this analogy is incorrect?

Bring it on.


I was implying that I'm not against competition.


Anyone who uses bitcoin *at any point* is a bitcoin owner, so yes, the value of using bitcoin is value to the bitcoin owner.  That doesn't seem like an argument...


The general public is just starting to get wind of bitcoin.  Have you noticed that big companies are taking it and the value is climbing?  Value doesn't climb if people don't see value.


Which drives the majority of its value.


Which allows the value to appreciate or at least stay stable relative to inflationary currencies in the long run.  *This* is a major reason why gold, silver, palladium and platinum all have value.


I don't see where you stated "Why" artificial scarcity is worse than natural scarcity.


As will I.  I have no notion that bitcoin must defeat or otherwise supercede the dollar.  It's just *an option*.




Oh, I see where you got confused.  **All** cryptocurrencies have value because of their shared function; a blockchain secured with proof-of-work and some form of community.  Bitcoin just has the *most* value because it's the most *well known* and it has the biggest community, biggest developer base, the biggest user base and the biggest merchant base.


No guarantee, but is the obvious front-runner as of now.


Converting to fiat is neccessary for two reasons; A) right now there is very little supplier adoption.  That will change over time.  B) businesses have to pay taxes in USD.  Overstock's CEO has said that they keep a portion in bitcoin.  That doesn't imply that bitcoin has no future; quite the opposite.

I think you may have to be in this situation to REALLY talk to what you would do; starvation is a sick and twisted way to die.  But I get your point.


Let's take it the other way.  If you were starving, would you steal an apple from someone?  Let's remove the theft part; if you were starving, would you eat an apple that *someone else* stole?  The degrees of separation from the negative act have a great influence on our propensity to benefit from that act.  We aren't strictly animals, but we share tendencies that say "Pragmatic full bellies beat principled starving" for many people.  Then, when you factor in that poverty correlates inversely with intelligence (not implying all poor people are stupid, just that stupid people tend to be poor), you can't expect most poor people to even *understand* the chain of events that fill the coffers to enable the welfare programs.  They just see the government doling it out, and assume the government is right because they are in authority.
My whole point is that many people vilify the recipients of welfare, which I think is misplaced.  Instead, the ire should be directed at poorly run government subsidy programs.  Hence, "Don't hate the player, hate the game."

That's not fractional reserve; fractional reserve is only having a "fraction" of your loans backed by your "reserves" (hence the name).  IIRC The FED sets the fraction that a bank can have.  Interestingly, I asked this in another comment, but does anyone know what the requirements are that the reserve *be*?  I believe gold can satisfy reserve requirements.  Would be nuts if bitcoin could serve that purpose.

Utilities are usually run or tightly regulated by *local* government, which I'm in favor of; in those situations, you have an extremely illiquid market (its inefficient to run multiple water mains to the same house, for instance) and the market breaks down.
Housing?  Why can't you choose to buy or not buy a given house?  The market is saturated with available housing *right now*.
Healthcare?  What a farce; the government distorts everything about healthcare.  I don't even want to get into the health care debate.


No, you derided the "free market" (which is essentially **laissez-faire** capitalism), and I was pointing out that when you have a large regulatory body that's for sale, you basically let large companies purchase the monopoly on force (corporatism).  Our government is run by big business.  This is not laissez-faire, because the government reserves the sole right to the use of force, and then sells it to the highest bidder.


I do believe there are certain cases (see the discussion on utilities, above, plus other limited situations) where government serves a purpose.  That's why I christen myself a "Libertarian" and not an anarcho-capitalist.

Because that doesn't matter.  The real danger isn't the pool achieving 51% with other miners, it's all 51% belonging to a single actor, and if that actor has 51%, where they point it or who they payout to matters not, because they can assume control any time they wish.

It *IS* safer.  Absolutely.  That's pretty much a given.  There are very few situations where your BTC would be refunded, and there are a lot more situations where your cash is refunded.  You do, however, give up some things in return for this safety. First, you have to attach your identity to it.  Second, you may have to agree to an inane fee structures.  Third, as we've seen in Cyprus, you lose some control over your money.  So it's a trade-off.

But if I've already spent my money, then I do.  People don't always have an extra couple hundred bucks set aside just in case their bitcoin purchase from a week ago plunges in value.  Please tell me you understand that a sudden loss in purchasing power is harmful to some people.


The "why" is unimportant here.  The statement was made that "bank runs are harmless in bitcoin".  The mentality behind it is not what is being discussed.  Many bank runs are irrational.  That's beside the point.  The point is that "bank runs" can be harmless to people because it lowers the value.  That's my point.

It's only a magic number for someone who actually owns 51% of the hashpower.  A true 51% attack takes time and foregoes participating in the main chain.  It's obvious and potentially very costly.  Shutting other miners out is even more costly and time consuming and even more apparent.  If either of these take place, miners are incentivized to leave the pool and join another.
The only real worry is that an actor with economic incentives outside the network (a large bank or a government) will take over the chain with their own hardware.  Otherwise it's business as usual; trusting miners to behave.
Here's a question to ponder: What's stopping miners from colluding to take over the network now?

Economics is a social science.  It's inherently *subjective*.  There's no logical way to assert that the claim "inflation is necessary" is objectively true, because in economics there is no way to run a trial twice; once you've done it once, you've altered the landscape and that makes it impossible to run again.  Can you objectively tell me the result of NOT leaving the Gold Standard?  No, because we can't rewind time and see what would happen if we hadn't.  
I would prefer not to get sucked into your long-winded argument here, but I did have to say that nothing in economics is truly objective.  Indeed, the foundation of economics; trade, is based on subjective value.

How would you mitigate issues where a node simply didn't see the transaction before it was included in the block?  Not all nodes see all transactions.  How do you verify that the previously unseen transaction is simply because the node didn't receive it due to inherent internet uncertainty and not because the transaction was an intentional double spend?
It's an interesting thought though.  Maybe some sort of node consensus; if more than 50% of the nodes *did* see the transaction, then the block is accepted by the nodes.  If not, then it's rejected, regardless of why.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:08:43
The point I was trying to make is the irreversibility by itself is not a reason to reject bitcoin because other scenarios already work with this model.  Bitcoin is designed to be irreversible because there previously was no other digital method of transaction BESIDES reversible transactions.  It is *designed* to be irreversible.  Chiding bitcoin because it performs exactly as designed is stupid.
You are right, bitcoin is easier to lose because you are connected to the world.  I agree.  Which is why I'm so eagerly anticipating Trezor and things like it. 
I've never had BTC stolen, but then again I use a full node with an encrypted wallet and I'm not stupid about what I install on my computer.  It definitely needs improvement as far as security goes, but again, that's not because its irreversible, but because it's digital.

I don't know.  I think it *is* a tragedy of the commons for miners, because if they all colluded to just keep the exact same hashrate, they'd all make the same portion of money as they are now indefinitely.  Anyone who wanted in would have to buy from someone who already had hashpower.
So, what's so cool about bitcoin is, the protocol *takes advantage* of the tragedy of the commons.  Since *some* miners aren't willing to just be happy with what they have, more and more hashpower is added to the network.
Which has the side effect of making bitcoin an even more secure network.
TL;DR Mining is a tragedy of the commons among miners that bitcoin turns into added security.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:41:33
I understand your sentiment, but the problem is that intrinsic properties have different values to different people.  Saying something has intrinsic value implies that the value derives from the object.  But the very definition of value makes this a paradox because you must have a person who values said object (for it's properties, or as speculation on others' value of it).  Thus, value is derived from a person or people, not from an object.  So the very term "intrinsic value" is an oxymoron.  How can something have value irrespective of a person valuing it?  
My point is that it's a bad description when talking about things, because value does not derive from the object itself.

What about my statement isn't true?  The pool decides how the hashrate *directed at their pool* is being used, but the miners decide where to *direct their hashrate*.  If a pool operator is doing something that goes against the best interest of the individual miner, they can jump ship at any time.  So while the next block or two may be withheld, if they try any kind of long-term attack (freezing out other miners, large scale 6-confirmation double spends), miners will drop off in droves.

Of course it doesn't even out to zero; it should even out to the probability of honest mining.  As in, the advantage of *selfish* mining is reduced to zero.  The advantage of having the highest hashpower would be unaffected.

Ok, so the loan allows the money to be multiplied by (1 - reserve requirement), which creates money *on paper*.  This doesn't mint new currency, but it expands the money supply.  When the loan is paid back, the money supply contracts.  No currency is destroyed, but the money supply is contracted, which is the destruction of previously fabricated money.  Is that a proper interpretation?

No, it just drops in price.  The "pyramid" doesn't have to increase for bitcoin to be useful.  If the number of adopters stayed the same, we'd see slight declines based on rewards that flatlined over time.  That's the difference between bitcoin and a pyramid scheme.  Bitcoin doesn't have to yield a return to be useful.


I think it's more that people dream of being rich so they concoct these stories.


Please explain what you mean by "crashes".  If you mean the value drops, then I agree, but a price crash doesn't destroy bitcoin as a tool, only as an 'investment strategy'.  If you mean "is destroyed" or "fails", then you're wrong.  Bitcoin doesn't have to go "to the moon" to succeed.  In fact, I'd argue it is already succeeding since people are using it to make their lives easier or to be able to keep more of the earnings from their labor.

This is a good point.  It *would* be good if a currency held consistent value.  The problem is that consistent value requires a central issuer who can issue more when the value rises and pull currency out of circulation when the value drops.  There's no way to do this programmatically.  What value would you input to the algorithm?  A certain exchange?  A host of exchanges?  What if exchanges leave?  What if new ones pop up and become popular?
There's literally *no* way to write a program to do this because you'd have to hitch it to some human determined value.  The US does a pretty good job of keeping the value of their dollar on a steady 2% decline by appointing humans to make the decisions, which is OK for an economy.  It'd be nice if the newly minted dollars were distributed more equitably, but we can't have everything.  I don't think bitcoin will ever take the place of the US dollar, but it's nice to have options.  Bitcoin may do a lot of replacing gold investments.

No, otherwise the price would have bounced back.  That was rationality winning out.  Large businesses rely on government approval.  Without government approval, people go to jail.  People don't want to go to jail.  Rationally, it's better for most people to operate within the confines of legislation, regardless of their personal opinion on the topic, than it is to make a statement and go to jail.


Maybe, but that's irrelevant.  What matters is that shops quit selling it and large scale investors stopped investing in it.  Also, the reason that weed still enjoys demand is because people value its intrinsic properties.  People don't value the intrinsic properties of bitcoin, as seen by the low value of the copy-coins.  They value it because other people value it.  If governments make it illegal less people will value it, and thus it will have less value.




Only over what would be fair market value were it allowed without it being contraband.  $1200 was a bet that people would find bitcoin valuable.  China made it so that many people wouldn't find it valuable.  The $1200 bet lost.

1) I assume it's because of the relative risk for a given investment.  Banks give 6% on a 10 year CD because they have all the money in their account for use, and relatively low risk.  With a mortgage, there's a higher risk since they have to involve actuarial science to determine how likely they are to lose their investment.  Answer to the follow-up, I assume because banks were making bank on derivatives and they didn't care about the return on the mortgage, because they were making money hand over fist splicing that mortgage up and selling it as an A+ investment, right?

Toll roads do suck, but most of those toll roads are government run, meaning their revenue can be re-distributed to other locations.  Additionally, if most roads were toll roads, then A) they would be more streamlined (higher need for increased capacity = more people working on fixing the problems) and B) other taxes would be less, meaning more people who actually use the service would be paying for it, and less people who don't use the service would be paying for it.

It's not a *priority* because it's not a problem at the moment.
If you feel like it's a priority, then you fix it.  Otherwise, the people who actually work on the technology will work on the problems that appear the most pressing.


But it's *not* a problem.  It's only a *problem* when txn quantities are *much* higher.  And then it's not a "OH MY GOD BITCOIN IS BROKEN BECAUSE TRANSACTIONS JUST INCREASED SLIGHTLY" type of problem.  It's not binary (either it's a huge problem or not at all a problem), it grows slowly.

Bitcoin is meant to make exchanges garner less business?  I'm unclear what you are saying here.  If you are implying bitcoin is opposite of requiring security from your exchanges, then no.  Bitcoin provides OPTIONS.  That means that it's on you if you trust someone else, because you don't have to.  And that means it's on you if you don't trust someone else, because you can.  Bitcoin is meant to make you responsible for your own choices.  That's the point.

I'm gonna have to ask that you justify that answer.  Increased demand causes the price to increase, so more people demand it.  Who loses money here?  I'm gonna need you to map that out for me.


Again, please map this out for me.  If you are only talking about exchanges, then I could see more where you are coming from, but bitcoin is mined, so as long as the value of bitcoin is over the value of mining, at least *someone* is making a gain without someone *losing*, right?


Well now you're just being snarky.  Can we talk srsly for a minute?  I'm honestly curious why bitcoin is "zero sum".  Are precious metals "zero sum"?
Also, how are you tracking value?  If bitcoin rises in USD, does that always imply that bitcoin got more valuable?  Or could it imply that USD became less valuable?

You can't buy a lot with bitcoin; that makes it less liquid.  The more things I can purchase with bitcoin, the more liquid it is in the economy.  The liquidity you are referring to is on the exchanges, which isn't as important since, as you say, bitcoin is so divisible.


True, but since not many businesses have a need for suppliers who accept bitcoin, not many suppliers are accepting bitcoin.  As more companies acquire it, suppliers may be able to get an edge with THEM by accepting bitcoin, and thus increase the companies' incentives to hold instead of sell.


For now, that is true.  But overstock may prompt many other large companies to take bitcoin, which increases the incentive for suppliers to take it as I mentioned above.


This was discussed during the black Friday event too.  And yes, it's true, this will create a temporary depression on the market, as any large sale would do.  But increased adoption means more places for people to use bitcoin, which increases its utility, which ultimately increases it's value.

Ok.  I'm willing to go along with that assertion.  I still think that removing government safety nets from banks, without changing much of anything else, would have the net effect of strengthening the financial sector.  I feel like even with the monopoly on printing money, banking presents more risks when not supported by taxpayer money.  Letting those risks directly affect banks would make them more cautious IMO.  But I see where removing their monopoly (a la Bitcoin), could also take away a lot of risk. 


Agreed, which is why businesses who don't have taxpayer funded insurance typically won't engage in this sort of behavior.

That's the opposite of what was being said.  I know a lot of people who know about bitcoin and are neutral too.

The system is *completely* voluntary, so if someone thinks it's bad, they should just not use it.

This is not actually selfish mining.  It's "block withholding".  Selfish mining refers to pools hiding their blocks from *the rest of the network*.  Basically, if they find a block, they hold it back and work as if that block is already in play.  If someone else broadcasts a block, then they broadcast their own block.  At that point it's a race.  But, if they mine the *next* block on their own chain, they will win if someone submits a single block.  Once they find a second block, they will beat anyone's single block.  Once they find a third block, they beat any *two* blocks, etc etc etc.  The more hashpower you have, the higher statistical advantage you receive.

Not true.  Shelter doesn't have to be *purchased*.  Shelter can be *borrowed*.  It's called "renting", and anyone without the ability to carry the kind of debt needed to purchase shelter has access to this process.
Edited to add:
What actually happened is that people not well versed in finance trusted their banks to tell them what they could reasonably expect to be able to borrow.  Banks were "persuaded" through the [Community Reinvestment Act]( to loan to minorities and under-privileged.  Banks were then allowed to mingle commercial and investment banking funds when the [Gramm E Leach-Bliley Act]( repealed the [Glass-Steagall Act](  Bam; introducing, mortgage backed derivatives.  All of a sudden a bank could slice and dice a mortgage, buy insurance from AIG or some related bond insurer, and take a shitty mortgage and turn it into an A+ asset.  The only problem is when those mortgages start failing all at once.  Then those derivatives, that were sold as A+ assets, start failing at a high rate.  Botta Bing; 2008.
So it wasn't because people were left on the streets if they didn't take on exhorbitant loans like you present with this comment, it's that banks thought they found a way to upgrade assets for free and lied to customers about what they could afford.  Those people got in over their head because they trusted the scammy greedy bankers, and/or they ignored their own gut instinct and signed on the dotted line anyway for double or even triple what they should have realistically borrowed.

Ok, so when a purchase happens, it gets recorded at the end of the block chain (chain of blocks) when someone adds a new block.  If 51% of miners decide, they can pretend like that block didn't get added, which means the transactions inside *haven't* been included yet.  If they wanted, those 51% of miners could submit a NEW block with a DIFFERENT transaction moving those coins somewhere else.  
It's not about miners "confirming" the purchase itself, it's about miners "extending the chain", and the number of blocks deep the purchase is are known as "confirmations".  If miners build on a different chain, then your transaction doesn't have any blocks on top.

Bitcoin is the information of what private key controls which bitcoin software tokens.  If you have the sole ability to manipulate the tokens in a given private key's recorded balance, you could think of it as "ownership".

Think about it this way.  Let's say you are a grain farmer.  You base your living off of selling grain.  You wish to grow and sell grain, not participate in the relatively volatile grain market. 
Enter hedging!  
If you were smart, you may sell grain as a *futures* contract.  This would allow you to lock in the price of grain *before* you sell it.  Effectively, you have *hedged* your grain sales.  Regardless of the market, you now have a price someone is willing to pay for that grain in the future.  This allows you to be more confident in investing in fertilizer, irrigation and new tools, since you are now locked in to a certain profit for your grain.
This is what the article is stating you can do with bitcoin; lock in a price *in the future*.  People selling these futures think the price is going to *drop*, or at least wish to stabilize their investment.  People buying these futures think the price is going to *rise*.  If the buyers are right, they make a tidy profit.  If the sellers are right, they protected themselves from loss.  This "futures" market allows people to hedge their bets (or in other words, protect them).

First of all, condominiums are a terrible investment to begin with, I can agree.  You don't actually own any land, you just own a square of space.  I find that disagreeable to begin with.
But second of all, You aren't comparing apples to apples.  Condo fees aren't the same across the board, and cover all kinds of services you don't get when you rent from an apartment building.  We can't do the math here without knowing what the condo fees cover and what you are paying for those services now (or whether you even WANT those services).

No one is suggesting we as a society "move to a currency like bitcoin", at least not the important people.  Local currencies have their place.  


Chargebacks are provided by third parties in the legacy banking system.  Ever tried to magic your cash back from a vendor before?  Yea, no.  Because cash transactions are also "irreversible", which means that the only way to get your cash back is for the other party to agree to do so.  If I buy a product at Walmart in cash, and keep my receipt, Walmart *agrees* to allow returns *if it meets their policy*.  There's absolutely no way for you to force Walmart to give you back your cash.  If you are referring to Credit Cards or banks providing this ability to you, then you are utilizing a third party, which is just as possible with bitcoin.  Ugh I'm so tired of this argument.


That was an artificial limit to prevent spam in the early days.  When bitcoin needs more, it isn't technically challenging to raise that limit. 


But no one is advocating we get rid of gold, only that we don't base a nation's economy on the gold standard.  No one is seriously suggesting we replace a nation's economy on the bitcoin standard either.  That's a quick way to lose sovereignty of your money.  
 &gt; Krugman, who understands the topic rather well, explains why deflationary currencies are so problematic:
This is why *a nation's currency* shouldn't be based on deflationary currency, not why we shouldn't have alternatives if we wish.  This is not a dichotomy, both USD and bitcoin can live together.


We shouldn't "move to bitcoin" at all.  Bitcoin should always remain voluntary.  To suggest otherwise is silly.

In a pure-bitcoin economy, has the value leveled off?  Assuming it has, wouldn't interest rates, instead of 5, 6, 7% be more like fractions of a percentage?  Obviously it wouldn't be negative, since lenders would rather just hold.  But now, aren't interest rates set by banks with inflation taken into account?  So if inflation is 2%, a mortgage interest rate has to be 3% or more for the bank to make money in the current economy, but an interest rate of 1% or even .5% would make money for the bank in a pure-bitcoin economy.
As for your points regarding employment, in a pure bitcoin economy, you wouldn't get a "cost of living decrease", employers just wouldn't need to up your pay for no reason, since the cost of living decreases over time.  So your pay would stay the same over time, and that by itself would represent an increase.  Companies that don't give a standard of living increase now would be "forced" to do so, because no one would work for a company that *decreases* your pay over time.
In reality though, there's no reason for a pure-bitcoin economy.  It's difficult to implement something like that because bitcoin is global, but economics are usually localized.  How can a global currency adjust to the micro-economics of a single country?  How does that country fluctuate against the changing variables around it?  Without sovereignty of money, governments can't modify the parameters to tweak their country's economy.  I for one never see major powers giving up their control of money.  And as long as they have all the guns, they can charge taxes and force you to pay those taxes with their currency.
I don't think inflation is always a bad thing.  As long as there are assets that are easy to obtain a position in that don't inflate, an inflationary currency may actually do a lot of good.  Before bitcoin, gold and silver were simple to get ahold of, but were cumbersome to store and secure.  This drove their value down (as in, made them less appealing as a store of value).  Now, with bitcoin, we have an asset that doesn't inflate like the US dollar (like gold/silver), isn't controlled by a government (like gold/silver) but can be transmitted anywhere (unlike gold/silver).  That makes it a much more attractive store of value than precious metals, assuming the markets thicken up a bit and act more like gold/silver do now.
I foresee bitcoin in the future being a store of value like precious metals, but also as a reserve currency since it is so easy to transmit.  A pure-bitcoin economy is a fun thought experiment, but not really workable in the real world.


Edit: clarification.

I'm not debating that.  I'm debating whether or not that value springs spontaneously from bitcoin itself (innate meaning, coming from within).  Value can't do that.


Well, you don't seem to understand the distinction if you claim anything has "innate" or "intrinsic" value.  It doesn't.  All value comes from its use *by an individual*, and therefore cannot be innate or intrinsic to the good/service.  This distinction is important, and the one I've been trying to make all along.


You don't "own" the coins either.  You just "control" them.  It's another important distinction.  The coins are just an internal record keeping token.  They never leave the blockchain, because they are *intrinsic* (meaning, comes from within, is a part of) to the protocol.  What you pay (or steal) from someone else is the right to dictate where those tokens get recorded.  In fact, multiple people can control the same group of coins if they all have the private key.  That's not ownership in the traditional sense.


Correct, because intrinsic value doesn't exist.


In the past fifty years, economists have come to realize that nothing indeed *CAN* have intrinsic or innate value, because all value is derived from a subjective viewpoint.  


It's fun when people get mad because they're clueless.  :)

You said "**Criminality** and drugs".  You linked them together as two separate evil things.  Nice how you left the other half of your comment out in your reply.


To state that we should "rid the world" of any human behavior is naïve or ignorant *in the literal sense*.  There's no objective way to eliminate criminality, because criminality itself is not objective.  There's no objective way to eliminate drug usage, as the "War on Drugs" has shown.    


Ignorance and naivete, while they do have a negative context, don't literally translate to a slur or insult.  They mean literally to be unaware or to lack the proper experience to understand.  Calling me a rude cunt is just an ad hominem designed to belittle with no other meaning or intent.  So no, it's not the same, and that's a false analogy.  Thanks for playing though.


I call it like I see it.  Your blanket statement was incredibly ignorant of human behavior, and thus I called it out.  If you want adult discussion, make adult observations.

What?  You can be both, and you don't have to have your coin on an exchange to be hit with exchange rate woes.  If I bought a bitcoin last week @ $800 and then want to spend that bitcoin this week, I only get $700 in value.  How does that not hurt people who have read the whitepaper?  How is that different for a speculator than for someone who actually believes in the currency?  Both lose purchasing power.  Both are "harmed" in the short term if they intended to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange in the short term.

Food has intrinsic *properties* that people value.  But people value those properties differently.  It's not the value that's intrinsic, it's the properties (calories, flavor, presentation, etc) that people value *subjectively*.
That's why we don't use food as a unit of measurement for value.  We need a way to measure subjective value in a standard way.  The measurement of a specific good or service's value is unique to each individual, but as a society, bartering is inefficient.  If we all agree that a certain commodity is a representation of a unit of value, all of a sudden we can all subjectively value things using the same measurement.  Then we can all barter for the *same* good, and use that good to barter for other goods.  Whatever good we use as the medium for exchange, we call "money".  Now, whether something is *good* money or *bad* money is another topic, but suffice it to say we don't use food because 
* Food rots
* People like different types of food
* Food (i.e. an apple) may be different than another of its kind (another apple).
Nothing has intrinsic **value**.  Nothing.  Ever.  Value is a subjective term; each person has a different idea as to what value means to them.  Goods and service only have intrinsic **properties**, and those **properties** can influence subjective value.

MtGox was pegged for filling out paperwork inappropriately and had $5m in Dwolla funds + a Wells Fargo account frozen by DHS.

I think a good option would be for the government to let you allocate a portion of your taxes; say 25%.  You could fill in a form when you filed your W2 to give weight to certain programs, if you wished.  That would be a good start and would connect people to their taxes, so they didn't feel as much like an invisible arm was swooping in and extracting taxes in an abstract manner.  If they can allocate a portion, maybe people would feel less gypped by their government.

Easier is a different topic, although with their ubiquity, credit cards *are* pretty easy.  You said in your post 


That fee, the interest rate, is not a fee for using *Visa* or *MasterCard*, but for borrowing money from the *lender*.  If you don't actually borrow the money for more than a month, they don't charge you *anything* (except fee based credit cards, but those have other services you are paying for).  So your point doesn't make sense, because that fee isn't for using the payment network, it's for *borrowing money*.  *THAT'S* why those people claiming credit cards are 'zero fee' never mention the annual INTEREST, because it's a charge for a **different service**.

Selfish mining doesn't require 50% of the hashrate.  You can do it with less, as long as you have a significant portion (30% or so).  Selfish mining is a broader concept than what you are talking about.  Your reference is to a subset of the 51% attack.

Additionally $200,000,000 worth of these particular form of ASICs aren't currently available for sale.  They'd have to fabricate a new design (or lift one from some other ASIC manufacturer's personal computer), contract a major foundry and have a large amount created (all without it leaking that a major unidentified player is making 1/5 of a billion dollar investment in bitcoin), then have them mounted to PCB boards before they could be powered up.

But we can see those situations play out when mining pools get large; people don't leave the pool (even though they are contributing to the real risk that bitcoin could be attacked) until the public start screaming.  So these miners are indeed gravitating toward smaller variance at the risk of giving large pools too much power.


I would be inclined to agree, which is why it confuses me why people continue to mine on the largest pools, knowing it makes the network seem less secure and therefore putting downward pressure on the value of bitcoin.


True, but then the miners should know that large pools make the network appear less secure due to the potential for gaming and/or attack.  GHash.IO has already shown itself to attack some bitcoin businesses, so it's already happening.


That doesn't apply as much to my point that large pools are that way because of selfish miners looking for low variance.  I agree with your theory, but we're actually seeing the contradictory behavior right now.

IMO pools hitting 51% isn't a big danger.  If you were caught doing something malicious that would hurt the network in which your miners have invested time and money, they'd leave en masse.

Orders of magnitude smaller than a bank would charge, and not on a sliding scale either.  Want to send $1?  That'll be $.001.  Want to send $1000000000?  That'll be $.001.


It's more difficult to do fractional reserve with bitcoin because the bank can't issue "bitcoin certificates" that can be accepted anywhere bitcoin can be accepted.  Their "certificates" will only be accepted as such, with the knowledge that they are not "true" bitcoin, but bank-created "bitcoin certificates", and will undoubtedly be accepted at a lower value.
With the current system, the bank just creates money out of thin air that is used just like any other money.  So there's a big difference there.


Escrow is available if you don't trust the merchant.  Multisig, etc.  For big names like Amazon or Walmart, how often do credit card companies even have to get involved?  With 90 day return policies and customer service departments, buyers getting ripped off is only a major problem with unknown merchants.

I've never been a fan of this mentality.  Government currencies are not going away any time soon.  Large governments will not give up their sovereign currency, so taxes will still be collected in it, which initiates demand, so IMO sovereign currencies won't be "replaced" by bitcoin.

And those billion scenarios you speak of are handled by third parties with cash, and yet cash still has a higher than 0% chance of mass adoption.  With bitcoin, it's just more transparent what you are paying for those services, as opposed to credit cards, which make it appear like the escrow/dispute resolution they provide is free.  Additionally, credit cards share the cost among all users, instead of only charging people who use it.
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:29:45


I interpret this to mean "value" more easily flows out than in.  I agree, and I'd venture to speculate that this is what our governments prefer.  They erect barriers of entry for allowing "value" in (exchanges have strict AML/KYC laws that prevent entry, large transactions in currency are investigated, etc).  Governments don't want their citizen's value flowing *out* of their local economy, so they make it harder to exchange out.  Look at China.  It's very easy to bring money IN to the country, but trying to get money OUT is very difficult.
Bitcoin is the "OUT", and governments are going to do everything they can to keep us "IN" their economies.
Of course, this is only one piece of the puzzle, but I think its a big one.

But since bitcoin is programmable, this doesn't really end up happening.  You can accept bitcoin without a provider.  You just have a harder time converting to fiat.

It's known as a double spend, but in practice it's a reversal of a previous spend, and then a new spend.  The same coins can't be spent twice in the historical record.  It's just that with 51% you can control the historical record and change things. It takes a lot of work, even at 51%, so many believe that unless you hate bitcoin and want it to die, you'd have no reason to want to do it.

You wouldn't... just like you wouldn't convert your wages to Paypal.  You convert what you need when you need it.  Holding an unstable currency without the specific purpose of speculating doesn't make sense.  Why would it?  Who proposed you SHOULD do that?  They're wrong.


You don't.  You want your money in a form which works best for you.  When you get offered a discount with a reputable company, bitcoin may be better.  If you need to send money quickly to someone else a fair distance away, bitcoin may be better.  If you want to donate to a cause that Paypal or Visa doesn't condone, bitcoin may be better.  It's just a tool, and it has benefits *sometimes*.


That's never gonna happen.  That's part of how a government creates demand for their own currency.  But that's not an argument against bitcoin, really.  I pay my taxes by proxy; my employer *really* pays my taxes for me.  I just have to double check their math at the end of the year and settle with the IRS.  


I like avoiding fees.  Am I not the average person?  What makes someone *average*?  And why is it a requirement that the average Joe adopt it before it is successful?  Businesses pay *LOTS* more than individuals in bank fees.  
The point is, bitcoin is not some deliverance from all of Earth's evils.  It's a decent tool that improves *in some ways* on currencies of major governments.

No, there's no *explicit promise*.

This is not the only mechanism that could increase the monetary base, only the one that benefits those involved with the FED the most.


Yea, and in so doing creates asset bubbles like the one we just watch explode with Real Estate, or the Dot Com bubble of the late 90's/early 2000's.  Savers are vilified for saving their value, but it ends up in the market eventually anyway.

You are arguing in circles around yourself.  "Money laundering is a crime because it's illegal".  I'm trying to convince you that *the reason* it is illegal is so that people can be presumed guilty of *another crime* until proven innocent.  Maybe I didn't articulate it properly, but what I'm trying to communicate is that *making* money laundering a crime is the same as assuming someone is guilty of *a different crime* (like child porn or human trafficking) because they aren't transparent in where they received their money.  Hence, declaring money laundering a crime is presupposing that anyone who conceals the source of their money is a criminal.  The *act of criminalizing money laundering* is the same as saying "People who don't expose where they get money from **must** be guilty of a crime, and so we'll criminalize concealment".  Don't you see how that is assuming people are guilty of *another crime* before there's any proof?  It's not that hard to understand.

The whole point of being a trusted business is that they're willing to help you if there is an error.  Amazon has taken two or three hits to their bottom line because a package of mine got lost in the mail.  


Yes, it is great.  I'm not denying that.  But it's nice to choose when to pay for the protection.  That 1%-3% back from credit cards comes from people using the *loan* services.  You ever see a debit card give cash back?  Nope.  The rewards points you get back from credit cards are a perk for using their credit service.  To just use their payment processing service, you can't get the same perks.  It's nice to have the option.


Do you think Visa/MasterCard just pay for fraudulent charges out of the goodness of their heart?  No!  They charge a higher percentage than they lose to fraud.  You literally pay to cover fraud for other people.  It's like insurance.  Again, if you feel the need for it, then good for you.  Some of us (yes, I am a consumer too, and yes, I buy bitcoin as I spend it) would rather have an option.  Bitcoin provides that.


Except for the list of other benefits I listed that you conveniently ignored.


For people with good credit who live in first world countries who wish to work through a payment processor, who can freeze you out at their whim or the whim of the governments that control them, maybe it's easier.  But for others, it's definitely not easier, and there are many situations where it is not cheaper.

For things that cost less than a dollar, it's not profitable to accept credit cards because the fees tend to have a flat percentage.  Also, for less than a dollar, the risk is small.  This enables digital goods to be sold where they might not have now.


Technically, yea, but for most internet based purchases, either the cost is low enough that the merchant is willing to take the risk, or the wait (shipping time) is high enough that 5 minutes don't matter.
Also, remember that not everyone can get a credit card, so this is a big deal for them.
Edit: Also, for anyone who has ever paid for online porn - once they have your credit card, they can claim that you "opted in" to a monthly fee that was hidden on the sign up page.  That shit can be devastating to someone without a lot of money.  Think debit cards + bank overdraft charges.  Yea.

As for the rest;


Right, and when p2pool gets bigger, it will find more blocks per timeframe on average, which will decrease the variance of *the entire pool*.


Because the internal blockchain in p2pool acts just like the external bitcoin blockchain.  When more people mine on it, the difficulty adjusts so a share is found every 30 seconds.  More miners means the internal difficulty adjusts upwards, so finding a share is more difficult.  This increases variance.  Smaller miners are affected the most.  I'm actually not sure of the relationship.  I presume that the lower variance of the entire pool will compensate more for the higher variance of the internal blockchain, but I haven't run the numbers or anything.

Buying a miner exposes you to bitcoin risk AND mining risk.  If bitcoin goes up, both bitcoin holders and miners make more.  But if difficulty goes up too fast, miners make less, which doesn't happen to bitcoin holders.  So basically you increase your risk, and so far the track record is that you don't really increase your reward, since mining has become so much more difficult so quickly.

You are arguing past him.  He's saying that everyone with a stake can affect the value of a given bitcoin on exchanges.  The higher the stake, the more "counter-party risk" bitcoin experiences.

If there's a bank involved, then **they** *bought* the house, and agreed to sell it to that person on a payment plan.  You conveniently leave out the part that banks *actually do* for people.


You need to explain how they aren't equal.  If you are the bank and you give me a $400,000 house, then you have an "asset" (my loan debt + interest) and a debit (the $400,000 house).  The difference between the "asset" and the "debit" is (interest) and is your profit for being my middle man.  That's the price I pay to not have $300,000 in my pocket, but to have a desire/need to own a home.


No they can't, it's not out of "thin air", it's by assuming "Risk" that their loans won't get paid back.

By making your money into 1's and 0's that can fly across the internet, they were previously providing you a "service" that required "fees".  Bitcoin is now that gatekeeper, where the fees are transparent and no one can keep you out.  It de-politicizes internet money and becomes the sole gatekeeper, which is provably honest.
Banks provide other services too, and those will never go out of style.  The people thinking bitcoins will take down big banks fail to realize how essential it is to have access to on-demand liquidity at a certain price, both for big business and individuals.

It's not bitcoin that you have to worry about, it's everything else. :)  The technology operates exactly as designed.  The problem is that it is a new concept; that a standardized 58 byte string (your bitcoin private key) can be the key to actual value.  Protecting that string is hard.  If you properly protect that string, bitcoin is indestructible (so far).  Protecting strings turns out to be pretty damn hard, when previously you let your banks protect your money, and held your bank liable when they lost it.
Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan.  These are just three of the most recent large-scale leaks of personal data.  So even big companies have a hard time getting it right.

Not quite.  "Inherent" implies something intrinsic to the company.  Nothing is "intrinsic" with reference to value because value is subjective.  I'm using the word "real" to mean the value the company provides.  The stock value has the value the company provides (which is subjective, but nonetheless measurable) included in it, but may have other factors that are NOT related to the value the company provides (i.e. the political stance of the owner, which has nothing to do with the value the company provides).
I guess what I'm trying to say is that the stock value represents the "total value" that is priced in, while the "real value" is the utility the company provides, without things like political leanings of the leaders or other such things that don't actually affect the utility of the company, but that affect people's subjective valuation nonetheless.
Does that make it a more coherent statement?

It currently operates best as a payment method, that is true.


But bitcoin as a payment method solves issues like exchange conversions and opens up potential markets for people who have a harder time getting USD than getting bitcoin.  Right now the impact is not great because there are not many large companies adopting it, but if/when bitcoin is more widely accepted, it facilitates doing business with currently "unbanked" people because they'll have a desire and the means to use it.

It fixes the second one because no one can deny you access to funds if you don't keep it in a bank.  One of bitcoin's main philosophical features IMO is that it removes the "gatekeeper" status that banks have maintained with reference to the digital economy.  Until now, if you wanted complete control over your money, you had zero access to digital transactions.  You ALWAYS had to pay the banks whatever fees they wished to transact online, and they held the keys, which were ultimately controlled by regional governments.  If you hold bitcoin, that's not the case any more.  Just because banks can continue on as normal doesn't mean that it isn't a big win for humanity, because now we have *options*.

There are a few other quirks that have been in existence for longer.  Those haven't been addressed either because they have been deemed lower risk or lower reward for the devs.  If you feel they are wrong, you can jump in yourself.  Criticism is hollow if you also choose not to do it.


The "bitcoin development team" is primarily a group of volunteers proposing fixes and analyzing them **for free**.  The only person I know of who is getting paid for any development is Gavin Andresen and he's paid by the Bitcoin Foundation, a self appointed group of people who are crusadors for bitcoin.  They don't get paid by the blockchain, and so don't technically represent anyone who doesn't want them to.


I'm saying that you shouldn't criticize a group of people who don't get paid by anyone, let alone you.  They are doing what they are doing because *they want to*.  They have no responsibility to you or anyone else here.  And if you feel that they are doing a poor job, you are able and welcome to do better.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm giving you a solution to your problem.


You implied that a group of volunteers who have no vested interest in your happiness upset you because they didn't address a quirk that can A) be avoided with proper implementation by anyone (see Kraken) and B) doesn't pose a very large threat since no balances can forcibly be altered.
TL;DR you didn't pay for it, and it's open source, so if you don't like what they are doing, pay someone or do it your damn self.

I agree; heating your entire house with space heaters is crazy.  However, many people use central heating to provide a low base level (say 60 degrees) for the entire house, and then just use one or two space heaters to up the temp in rooms they use frequently.  This can save a lot of money because while it's technically more efficient to use the central heater, it's wasteful to heat rooms you aren't in.

Currently, yes.  But remember that an increase in transaction volume doesn't correspond to an increase in miner effort.

"Nothing at stake".  "Historical attacks".
PoS doesn't require that you forsake anything to mint multiple chains or to try and fork the network.  You can try over and over again and lose nothing.  With PoW, you have to lose time and power that could have been spent on the winning chain, so you are incentivized to go with the longest chain, instead of all chains.  With PoS, if one chain loses out, you'll have minted on the new, winning chain already with *nothing lost* (hence, "nothing" at stake).  Also, you could attempt to fork right after you sold coins because you can mint on a new, forked chain, without cost (changing recent history, or the "historical attack").  There's no financial incentive to participate in the consensus.

I agree, it will hurt the public very bad.  But then, when the banks dissolve and their assets are sold, companies that weathered the storm get a fire sale on assets, and assets move from companies that operate poorly to companies that operate well.
I like the analogy of the forest fire.  If you put out all the fires, then the underbrush gets so clogged that when a fire finally does get away from you, it torches miles and miles of forest, burning EVERYTHING.  But if you allow small fires to consume the underbrush, the taller, more robust foliage doesn't die, and fuel doesn't build up to such a degree.  The result is a healthier forest, at the expense of some of the underbrush that eventually burns anyway in the big fires.

Evangelists.  That's the point.


If your goal is not simply to acquire goods but to spread adoption of bitcoin then it's worth a premium for some to do so.
The point here is that if you want to get mainstream adoption going, yelling at companies over email to accept the coin is not going to work as well as spending it at places that accept it, even if the cost  is a bit more.  Obviously your personal value system may or may not call for this behavior; that's a personal decision.  I personally only use bitcoin when its convenient or expedient.  I order Amazon gift cards on Gyft because I get 3% back; that's a benefit.  But I'm saying that people who are making it their life's work to get bitcoin adopted should pay a little more for it.
It's kind of like the way I see minimum wage.  If you truly don't like the way Walmart or McDonald's or Burger King or whatever treats their employees, shop somewhere else.  If it's not worth the extra price to go to your local grocery store, or shop at places that treat their employees properly, then you are saying "I don't value this property of business enough to pay for it".

When you have to comment on the status of the argument, you're usually losing.


No it's not, which is why I tacked it on to the end of the argument and didn't group it in with the rest.  We are all reasonable people here and understand that heroin, cocaine, and meth are highly addictive and destroy the lives of many people.  So are all of the following; cigarettes, alcohol, gambling and pornography.  Just because it's bad for you doesn't mean the government should lock people in jail for doing it.  Being a social problem doesn't, by default, make it also a legal problem.  These kinds of things require support and putting people in jail robs them of any kind of support.  And locking up dealers is not dealing with the problem.  As long as demand exists, supply will appear.  You have to deal with the problem, not just hide it away in prison.

Because once you find the nonce that matches the difficulty, including the transactions takes milliseconds?  Why pass up $200 for less than a second?  If you are looking at less than a second influencing your attack, you probably don't have enough hashpower to really be attempting the attack at all.

But can you really discuss the "decrease in purchasing power" with relation to bitcoin?  It's like saying that my house is deflating because I can purchase more dollars with it every year.  That doesn't really *mean* anything.  
Also, the fluctuation of bitcoin due to speculation shouldn't really be mixed in with the concept of inflationary/deflationary because it fluctuates so rapidly.  If you use speculative fluctuation to determine inflationary/deflationary status, bitcoin is currently inflationary, but last week it was deflationary, and you can make bitcoin either inflationary or deflationary simply by changing the time period to which you are referring.  Isn't that *more* confusing than discussing the monetary inflation?  Price inflation/deflation is constantly in flux because bitcoin is so speculative...

Saving doesn't imply stimulation of the economy.  To "Save" means to keep for later.  Putting your money into a bank is not keeping for later; it's an attempt to gain interest.  Ever notice how "savings accounts" require "insurance"?  If you are simply saving, why the insurance?  Putting your money into an account the bank labels as a "savings" account is a loan to the bank.  In fact, the money in the savings account counts towards the bank's assets, because it's theirs.  You've *lent* it to them.


That's not holding; that's lending.

Price is a very rough approximation of value, but it isn't *value* in and of itself.  


That's one reason.  Also most utility companies don't accept it, most suppliers don't accept it and you can't pay taxes with it.  But if suppliers and utility companies took it, there'd be less of a requirement to immediately cash out. 
Also, if more merchants accept it, more people can choose to be paid in it, since they can directly use it to purchase goods and services.

The record industry and production industry USED to provide a very valuable group of services.  A talented artist would need to pair up with a large label who would record their music in a professional level studio, package it in an easy to consume format (record -&gt; tape -&gt; CD -&gt; mp3), distribute it, advertise it, convince radio stations to play it, and fund tours to drum up business.  The recording, formatting and distribution are no longer valuable services, since technology has made them obsolete.  We can now consume music and video made by people across the globe in their basement.  Why do we need a record label for that anymore?  
Honestly, technology has upended the value production companies add to art.
Now, that's not to say that production companies will go away.  Advertising and bankrolling are still essential, and production companies will still be able to convince many people to pay for distribution (iTunes seems to be doing well).  It's just that things have changed.

I think "astronomical" is a bit hyperbolic, considering that by your own word, upwards of 2 million people worldwide own bitcoins.  We can pretty much eliminate a large swatch of populations who don't have bitcoin AND don't have a need for videography services.  Even considering *every* human on earth, 2 million / 7 billion is around 3/10,000, which is hardly *astronomical*.

Use python or c++ or java to communicate with a bitcoind protocol, generate a private key/public key pair using the brain wallet algorithm, check to see if it has a balance (using blockchain.info or native berkley db to read the blockchain), if it does, import, create a transaction for the full balance and forward to an address you control.

Agreed.  The only people that are really considered a threat to bitcoin are large banks, rival payment processors and governments; the only real identified victims of bitcoin who have enough money/legal clout to really do something.  Governments are more likely to just use their ban hammers known as regulation, so the only real threats IMO are banks and payment processors.  Payment processors could be a threat, but I think the most likely enemy of bitcoin is a major bank.  Which then leads to the question, which is more profitable for payment processors and banks?  To take bitcoin down or to participate in the system?  Most people are betting on them participating, myself included.

How much more do you expect it to be worth tomorrow?  If it's a ton, I don't expect you to spend it much.  If it's just a little, I expect you to spend it when the utility of obtaining whatever it is you are buying is worth more to you now than the appreciation in bitcoin.
Here's a flip question; why would you ever want to save dollars if you expect them to be less tomorrow?  How come you don't keep your bank account precisely at zero?  My reasoning here is that the utility of having money at my disposal is worth more to me than the miniscule value I'm losing throughout a month's period.  
You can't state definitively that people will always hold an asset that is appreciation.  If you could, no one would ever sell precious metals, or real estate.  But the truth is that life is about more than just an appreciating asset, and most would rather actually enjoy their life than sit on an appreciating asset.

It's being treated this way because volatility is high, since adoption is low.

Not due to regulation; this is also a free market idea.  Visa had a contract with merchants for a long time preventing them from changing their prices.  The way these things have developed are not due to government intervention, and are therefore free market developments.  In fact, the only thing NOT free market at the moment is that governments have forced Visa to allow companies to charge differently for different payment methods.  Visa shouldn't have to do that.


A monopoly?  You've got to be fucking joking.  Paypal, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, etc make them very much NOT a monopoly.


You could


How is this NOT a free market concept?  Most major merchants accept Visa because they *want* to, not because they are forced to.


Only if you want to buy from those merchants.  If you're mad that Visa is wildly successful and you don't have a lot of alternative merchants that *don't* accept it, then that's one thing.  But this is all free market stuff.  Governments aren't mandating that businesses take it, nor are they mandating that businesses charge the same for different payment methods.
If you don't like it, then convince merchants to change it by keeping your dollars away from merchants that don't offer cash discounts (there are lots of those) and shopping more at places that do.  Pretty simple.

They are making it difficult to get bitcoin, which makes bitcoiners frustrated.  Yes, they are complying with laws, but they are still responsible for closing accounts and holding up legitimate transactions.  They are an enemy, regardless of why.


HSBC is not an enemy to bitcoiners because of this.  The investigation and subsequent "punishment" exposes the hypocrisy of our government.  HSBC should be allowed to provide services to anyone with cash, no questions asked.  But there are laws on the books preventing it (which I disagree with).  However, when a bank is big enough, no one actually goes to jail.  They just pay a big fine.  Contrast that to Charlie Schrem, who is serving time for subverting AML laws.  It's fucked up how a business escapes justice if its big enough.

The seller takes the money, and then when the contract is up, buys the bitcoin.  So If he sells a bitcoin future for 1 bitcoin @ $400 in six months, and in six months the bitcoin is worth $200, he takes that $400 and buys the bitcoin in six months, making a $200 profit.  If he had the bitcoin now, he should just sell now if he thinks bitcoin is going to go down in value.

This basically said that the money multiplier model works by credit driving deposits instead of the other way around.  I'd agree, because that's what brings the banks revenue.  It's expected that they'd seek out credit and then try to fund it with deposits.  The problem is (as addressed by your article), that central banks aren't willing to 


By allowing intermittent liquidity crises, banks have to be more cautious in their dealings, because they may get caught with their pants down.  Not allowing these liquidity crises is what it means to be a "lender of last resort" and loan at low to zero interest rate to prevent banks from going under during these times.  My argument is in part that if you remove this safety net, banks have to be more careful with their business.
And, as I read into the next page (How a bank becomes insolvent), it addresses that here:


So it's still true that the fed controls FRB, despite your claim.  It's just that they maintain it in such a way to, as your link states, remove "moral hazard" from the equation.
So the fed should not be able to control FRB the way it wishes to, because those "insolvency" periods are consolidation periods that allow banks in good positions to buy up distressed assets of banks in bad positions and thus we have the banking system trickling into hands capable of proper financial management, and away from hands not so capable.  That's the market version of natural selection, a management technique taught to us by nature.

Bitcoin is also low risk for 0-confirmation transactions.  The only time it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations is in public, high transaction volume scenarios (betting sites come to mind) or large transactions (like buying a car).  For small transactions, it's very low risk.  The risk can be lowered even further by building a peer list of trusted nodes in different geographical locations.  


You can't except out the exact risk that bitcoin addresses.  That's not fair.

@_date: 2014-06-12 14:37:50


That is correct.  But when you say a "simplifying assumption", it conjures up the impression that Satoshi's analysis of the 51% attack was incomplete (simplifying) or that the concern regarding a 51% attack does not take factors into consideration (assumption).  In fact, it's actually a "&gt;50%" attack, with anyone controlling *the simple majority* able to dramatically control aspects of the network.  Indeed there is no mechanism that even can be provided to mitigate this problem because without an identity, there's no way to determine who a given member of the community even *is*.  
So if I misinterpreted, my apologies.


I don't think that's the case.  I believe Satoshi saw the problem (he spoke about it specifically in the white paper), but was unable to find a reliable way to identify a given entity, given that said entity could control multiple machines.


Collaboration is not a very big threat IMHO, since economic incentives are mostly aligned with participating in the network as opposed to attacking/destroying it.  I'm not particularly worried about GHASH.IO or any other pool who identifies their solved blocks.  Miners would abandon ship if any pool threatened their profits.  Indeed, even if a single actor achieved 51%, he'd likely disguise his edge.  My only real concern are motivators outside of simple profit, such as governments or large banks, though even large banks would more likely participate to profit.

That's not true at all.  It just limits it in certain scenarios.  I've been saying all along that bitcoin isn't great as a point of sale currency.  It is and was designed to be cash on the internet.  The 10 minute confirmation time is inherent in the design.  There are TONS of use cases where this vulnerability matters not at all.  Basically every internet store that ships a physical good is completely unaffected.  Every service (VPS, Netflix, ISPs, cable, electricity, gas, etc) only have to cut off your service if the payment doesn't go through.  Again, completely unaffected.
Bitcoin has a lot of very good use cases.  Currently, instant in person transactions for physical goods isn't a great use case.

Not exactly sure what your intent is with this post, but I take it to mean you want a bank which won't take your money.  I do too; I'm saying that when you allow banks to privatize gains but socialize losses, you create a breeding ground for problems.
It's like a casino owner saying "Certain players get to keep all their winnings, but when they lose, I'll reimburse them."  Only these casino players are playing with their customers' money and keeping the winnings for themselves, but when they lose, they get TAXPAYER money to compensate them. 
I would FAR rather these players lose their customers' money when they lose instead of being compensated by TAXPAYER money.  Customers respond quickly to perceived threats to their money.  If one or two major players suddenly lose some of their customers' money, customers will be looking for assurances that other banks won't do the same thing.  That's when we start seeing bank accountability return.

That's true, but actually accepting bitcoin at a brick and mortar, especially for goods that are traded immediately, can be cumbersome, especially for higher priced goods that would require confirmation times.  I wouldn't expect a grocery store to allow me to walk out with $200 worth of groceries without at least 1 confirmation.  That means 10 minutes after checkout.  Ugh.  For restaurants it isn't so bad, because you can pay and then hang out at the table and chat for a minute and finish your drink or whatever.

Any business utilizing the blockchain should be running a full node to ensure the data they are using is legitimate, and not relying on companies like blockchain.info, which are centralized sources of failure.  Additionally, mining pool operators and solo miners are all already operating as a full node.  There are incentives for people to operate full nodes already.
That being said, individuals are less incentivized because it costs them money, may exceed their bandwidth limitations and doesn't provide them with any benefit.  Until a way to incentivize full nodes for individuals is devised, we have to rely on the incentives that exist.

No you aren't.  You are comparing bitcoin to *one facet* of fiat now; the trusted third party storage mechanism.  Bitcoin cannot *only* be compared to this facet, because both fiat and bitcoin have other facets.  In order to understand a good comparison, we have to compare them with all facets.


No.  But that's not what you are saying.  You are saying "Tire A brand are worse because GoodYear only installs Tire B".
The fact that banks are better at holding your money than you are is not a critique of the money *itself*, only a critique at the *storage mechanisms*.


I don't disagree dollars are easier.  I never asserted that.  Go back and read the thread.  It's not about which is *easier*, it's about which is better to *trust*.  Trusting *bitcoin* vs trusting *dollars* is not the issue.  When you mention banks, you're really just saying "I trust these regulated, historical institutions to hold my *money*."  You are saying "Fiat is better because there are institutions I can *trust* to hold mine, and they are established and held accountable".
Let me ask you; what if Wells Fargo had private wallets you could sign up for?  They'd be backed by the bank's reputation and legal frameworks the banks are required to operate under.
Would you continue to stand behind your position?  Because if not, you now see that comparing dollars to bitcoin because *banks* is not a very good argument to make.

Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption.  A lot of people are putting the cart before the horse.  Your concerns are valid for today's user.  People who have a hard time with these concerns shouldn't participate.  Here's my take:
1) Agreed; in person is much easier with fiat.  That's why I refer to bitcoin as the "currency of the internet".  Getting money through the internet is easy with bitcoin.  If I'm already in a store, I don't need to involve the internet at all.  Cash is king here.  CC is better than bitcoin because the third parties that accept it have a robust network that can process transactions very quickly.  Internet sales are where bitcoin shines.
There are use cases where bitcoin is better.  Bitcoin is not better at EVERY use case.
2) Security is a very big concern.  MtGox had the writing on the wall for a long time, but there have been other issues with other seemingly trustworthy sites.  I attribute this to growing pains.  It is truly awful that incompetence exists in the world, but bitcoin hasn't matured enough to shake out the incompetence because there is no competition from competent people.  As that starts happening we should see better options.  Again, that doesn't help anyone NOW, but the potential is there.
3) Consumer protection is possible with bitcoin.  You have to remember that using bitcoin directly is like using cash.  It's irreversible.  There are escrow providers and many people are working on fixing that right now.
**TL;DR** More services need to be executed properly before the protections that the laymen require are in place.  Many people investing now should be investing because of the technology's *potential*.  Because the potential is astounding.  Current execution is a little lacking.

No.  


We're not talking about an insecure algorithm.  SHA256 could be secure and a 51% attack could still happen.  If it does, to the biggest network that exists, then it shows that *all* such coins are susceptible.  If the most secure network is shown not to be secure, how can you possibly expect that a restart, with less security (less miners) would be any more secure?


And once more, I say to you, if the first attack is successful, then how do you expect anyone else to believe it won't happen again?  And again?  


Sometimes the cost of doing business is more than the business is worth.  If a 51% attack happens, switching the algorithm would just be the nail in the coffin.

A private transaction is an anonymous transaction whose existence is unknown.  The only difference between the two is the existence of the transaction is known.  If no one knows who did it or why, it's functionally the same thing.  


There is a difference, but it's not massive by any means.  That's hyperbole.


Future potential doesn't dictate current functionality.

I see not all dogecoiners are as lighthearted as they claim.


I think dogecoin is stupid.  I'm being demeaning *intentionally*.


Let's not try to make me *sexist* because of a play on words referencing a vaginal cleaner.  If I called you a dickhead, would it mean I hate men?  Referencing genetalia is not indicative of sexist behavior.


I do, and have no wish to stop people from *using dogecoin* or *participating in the community*.  


What's the difference between a dogecoiner and a spammer?  Spammers are choosing to involve, use and promote their cause/idea (making money) in a certain way, that's THEIR personal choice.  Right?  I'm saying dogecoiners are making me feel like I'm being spammed, and it's not a good feeling.  *This* is the feeling that I'm referring to, and the one I'm warning bitcoiners not to do.


I am being insulting; dogecoin is stupid and I'm sick of hearing about it.  If you want to use it, then go fucking use it.  But I think dogecoin has made it's point and people are aware that it exists and has a "silly" community.  It's starting to feel spammy.

What?  That doesn't make sense.  Contract law can be upheld without brute force reversing possession.  If I can prove I owned that coin, and it was stolen from me, then I recover it just like any other asset, through the court system.  If unrecoverable, the judge requires the thief to pay me in dollars, just like if the thief had destroyed the stolen item or had stolen a consumable good.
Thinking that the protocol is somehow a tool to enforce legality is laughable *at best*.  Legality is not a mathematical construct; it's subjective.  Bitcoin is only interested in objectivity.  That's the WHOLE POINT.

Also remember that a fork invalidates actual transactions too.  How many forks (and thus transaction reversals) do you think are possible before the faith in bitcoin is destroyed?

Again, not upset about using dogecoin to get people into cryptos.  I'm not even against the tips.  I have been tipped some dogecoin and at first was even a little excited about it.  But I just don't want to hear about it any more and I think the tone of many dogecoiners is kind of heavy handed.

I think many people are indeed confused, because prior to bitcoin, there was no way to establish scarcity without a third party.  This is the fundamental awesomeness that is bitcoin (the coins I own are mine and mine alone, and no one can copy them).  Before bitcoin, you *needed* someone in control; you *needed* someone to have the reigns.  It's a difficult concept to grasp because for most digital goods, if you don't have a third party controlling the good in its *entirety*, people will and do copy said good.

Well, not exactly true.  It can still have *value*, but it may not support any price point.  For instance, I find air infinitely valuable as I can't live without it for more than a few minutes.  However, I'm not willing to pay anyone for air because it's virtually infinite.

Technically, you don't *have* to take the volatility risk.  Well, I should say that you *usually* don't have to take the volatility risk.  There's some risk with being unable to complete this theoretical example, which would expose you to the volatility, but consider; you buy bitcoin.  You very quickly transfer bitcoin.  The receiver receives bitcoin, and very quickly sells bitcoin.  This has the potential to create a large payment network that is very efficient at transferring and converting money, since the purchase, transfer, and then sale of bitcoin happens over a short period, and therefore the risk of exposure to volatility is low.

Bitcoin is a temporary conduit for "value".  Fiat is also a representation of "value".  What's cool is when you start thinking about how the fiat on one end of the conduit doesn't necessarily have to be the same fiat as the other end.  Then all kinds of cool possibilities start popping up.
Bitcoin can be used as a store of value too, but it's really early in the game and the volatility makes that a difficult proposition for people looking to "store" their value.

Bitcoin the protocol, not the users


I agree.


Maybe, maybe not.  There's no concrete evidence either way, although Satoshi did discuss how those political ideologies would be enhanced by bitcoin's special utilities.


But the point is when you use bitcoin, you further the free market ideology by promoting a system that is truly free market (i.e. no regulation on usage).  While governments can regulate it, citizens now truly get to decide whether or not to abide by those regulations.  All of a sudden the world has a truly, *truly* free market.  That definitely furthers the political viewpoint that free markets are better for humanity overall than regulated markets.  So by using the network, you are promoting a specific economic/political ideology.


Amen to that.


Also 100% agree.

From the bitcoin white paper:


this paper, we propose a *solution to the double-spending problem* using a peer-to-peer distributed 
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
This is the "thesis".  This is the point the paper is trying to make
From [Wikipedia](


(emphasis mine)
So you can have whatever opinion you like, but bitcoin was not created to be some new futuristic currency to replace all fiat, it was created by a computer scientist to solve a computer science problem (the double spend).  It's usefulness as a currency is currently a topic of hot debate (since it's so volatile and all), but it's ability to solve the problem of the double spend is elegant not really up for question.  
Honestly, I have no interest in continuing with someone who just keeps saying "You're wrong" over and over again.  If you have something new to impart, please do so, but otherwise I'm done.

People who post these kinds of things misunderstand the issue.  Bitcoin is designed to discover consensus using peer-to-peer technology.  If one person achieves 51% of the network, **they are the consensus**.  There is no fix because it was *designed that way*.  
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:11:14


I think the advantage here is smaller than many would have people believe; the risk of a double spend is very small, and I would say smaller than the risk of a chargeback.  I think the true advantage of credit card companies is escrow.  CC companies usually side with the buyer in a dispute, and so protect their users.  This is a cool feature worth paying for in a lot of scenarios.  Paying for food isn't one though, since I've already ingested the food by the time I pay for it.


One thing we all need to remember is that bitcoin began as a way to create scarcity in the digital realm where it previously wasn't even possible.  The idea behind bitcoin was to create a system where a digital good could be known by all to be the only copy of that digital good.  What good is proof of scarcity if you don't actually make it scarce?

Absolutely.  But is this necessarily a bad thing?  Look what's happening now; the Fed has interest rates at 0% and still having a difficult time getting people to borrow money.  Here's a good parable that describes the problem with using interest rates to encourage borrowing:
Yes, a small amount of deflation would make people more responsible with loaning money, because instead of having to bail out of their currency as fast as possible, they'd evaluate loans and only make them when the risk is low and the return is high.  It makes it harder for people to get loans, but it makes it ~~harder~~ less likely for them to default too (which you may remember is a major part of the reason we had such a large economic downturn in 2007).

Technically an address is in use if there's ever been any activity on it.  You *could* check the blockchain to see if the key has ever had any coins transferred to/from it.  However, unless you were doing something silly like using a brain wallet with an easy phrase (like *correct horse battery staple*), this isn't a concern.  If this worries you, you should stop swimming in the ocean, never go outside in the rain, quit using your car, and for God's sake, don't go for a jog.

Well, there's a different set of assumptions you operate under in the real world vs online.  Bitcoin is the safest and most secure because it protects your identity, not because it protects your bitcoin holdings.
If someone gets your identity, they can rack up FAR more in debt than you could ever hope to have in bitcoin, and you'd then have to rely on the good will of Visa/MasterCard to be made whole again.  That's why bitcoin is safer and more secure overall IMO.

Libertarians are generally (in my experience) pragmatic anarcho-capitalists.  We (as I self identify Libertarian) would like to believe that the world would work with no state whatsoever, but feel there are certain situations where that model isn't the most effective.  For instance, I believe that profit motives should not be the main drive in the justice system.  I believe in contract enforcement as one of the only real responsibilities of the courts, and worry that if courts are privatized, then contracts will overwhelmingly be won by the party with deeper pockets.  I feel like we as a society need to work towards removing profit motive from the justice system.  That doesn't mean that government in this situation is perfect, just that the alternative appears to promote *less* justice than the current model.

Fractional reserve lending is very much a part of capitalism.  Were the banks actually responsible for themselves, they'd use statistical analysis and forecasting methods to determine how much cash they would need on hand.  If a bank fucked up, they'd go under and lose people's money.  It'd be up to people to determine what banks prospered by patronizing the stable ones.  Even FDIC is cool if it was just DIC, insuring banks and providing a lender of last resort.  This company would use actuarial science and analysis of banking methods at a given bank to determine insurance premiums.  
The problem isn't *fractional reserve*, since banks can and should do this (why keep 100% deposits if you don't need to?  Proper risk analysis could net you tons of money).  The problem is when the government steps in and *bails them out*.  If banks truly had to suffer the consequences of their actions, they'd be less likely to overextend themselves.  But when you provide a safety net like the government does, you distort the risk analysis by making these kinds of risky behaviors *less risky*.
Remove government intervention, and all those shitty banks would have crashed and burned.  Would have been temporarily shitty, but other companies would have scooped up their assets for pennies and recovery would be done by now.

Except that there are explanations for all of this, and they were posted here: 
Let's not go assuming guilt until guilt is proven.




If they can prove that you "had control" of other people's money and lost it, I'm pretty sure the consequences are more than "a light amount of time" depending on the amounts.  Of course, IANAL, but again, to say that he "took the money and ran", and then to turn around and say that he's going to do time, is an improper characterization of the situation.  That's **all** I've been saying.  If he does *any* time, then the phrase "took the money and ran" is improper.


Except how do you spend it?  The blockchain is public; any movement of these balances will be noticed.


Ok, there is a possibility that he did indeed steal the money.  I'm just saying that he didn't *run* afterwards.  He is being put through the system.  Saying that the system will inadequately handle the situation is not the same as saying he "ran".  That was the only clarification I was intending to make from the beginning.

A difficulty period that is too low is easy to game.  Terracoin was this way.  Every 10 blocks or something the difficulty changes, so large rigs just mined it until the difficulty went WAY up, causing people to switch away, then abandoned it for a few periods, causing it to drop back down where they could profit more from it.  Rinse &amp; Repeat.

IMO Large Bitcoin Mining Pools aren't a big risk.  The real risk is a private entity gaining 51% physical control.  If a 51% miner misbehaves, he loses his customer base (miners).

Yes.  But once you hit the maximum capacity of the CPU, in order to continue increasing the hashpower, you need another CPU.  To see the difficulty increase, you need to add hashpower.  Therefore, if you want to see difficulty increase, you need more hashpower, and thus more CPUs (or GPUs or FPGAs or ASICs).  VMs would not solve this problem.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:34:40

Yea, you are completely wrong.  


If we increase the block size, that means there are a lot more participants.  Running a full node is not simply altruistic.  Many businesses need a local copy of the blockchain to provide their services.  More participants mean more businesses getting into bitcoin, which means more nodes.

Bitcoin is designed to be a protocol for sending tokens that are provably unique.  Bitcoin doesn't attempt to fix market fluctuations and human behavior...


Say what?  Do you truly believe this?  If news came out that Fort Knox was empty, you don't think that'd have an affect on gold prices?  You don't think the daily fix does anything to gold prices?  Come on, man.


What?  Scarcity?  There is no way to create economic parameters to respond to market forces without relying on some metric of human behavior.  Bitcoin is a technical protocol that was designed to be independent of human behavior.  The only economic parameter I can perceive that you are referring to is scarcity, and the whole point of bitcoin is to provide scarcity in the digital world where everything can be copied.  Without the "scarcity", bitcoin isn't really as cool of a concept.

It's not against the "bitcoin creed", it goes against the **very reason** bitcoin was created.  If you can chargeback, then you need a third party to arbitrate.  There's no way around it.  Otherwise, the spender has all the power, and the merchant has none.  Bitcoin is created to eliminate the need for a third party.  If you need this, you must find someone you trust to provide it for you.  Chargebacks are built on top of irreversible transactions.  That's just the way it is.

The devs aren't "in business" though.  They are volunteers (except Gavin who gets paid by the Bitcoin Foundation, which is just a group of self appointed spear headers) and as such work on the things they find most interesting or most pressing.
If you have lots of money in bitcoin, you might consider paying someone to fix flaws you believe to be a serious threat.
Additionally, this problem that people are "exploiting" just generates a bit of confusion, it doesn't actually modify anyone's transactions.  So it's still not really a big deal unless your company is being socially engineered in an attempt to profit from your company's inability to handle the confusion.  No one's balances are at risk unless they don't know what's happening.

Tiny miners have a hard time on p2pool because variance is high.  Larger miners are not hit as hard by variance.  I think for those below 10 GH/s, mining on slush or eligius is better than p2pool.
But I see no reason why any miner should mine on the biggest pool.  All miners should look at the pool graphs and pick one that's large enough to get paid, but small enough not to threaten the network.  That's the way I do it.

When you say "client" are you referring to the software client or a client as in a customer?  Because if its a customer, why could you not conglomerate the clients' transactions into your own "Hash block" and submit the hash of your personal "hash block"?
I guess I'm still unclear exactly why you would need to pay someone for something you could write yourself very quickly.  A small business may want to pay someone else to hash their data and submit a bitcoin transaction, but anyone with any volume who decides they would like to utilize the blockchain for timestamping/proof of ownership could very easily hash their own data in whatever configuration they'd like...

I was thinking about this, and what if there were multiple simultaneous broadcasts on different bands?  I know next to nothing about radio transmission and receiving, but I was thinking, starting from the genesis block and transmitting would take a long time, so if you joined mid chain-transmission, you'd be missing the beginning.  If you missed a few blocks, you'd have to wait until they started over to get the missing blocks.  But, if you had a round-robin style of broadcast on like 10 frequencies, you could start transmission of the blockchain on one, then wait until it was 10% done transmitting, and begin again on the next frequency.  In this way you could reduce the wait time between retransmission of blocks to 10% of the blockchain (or whatever percentage based on the # of frequencies you were broadcasting on).

I really don't have time to educate you on what makes things a currency, but MasterCard uses your local currency as their unit of account, so "by my logic", USD is a currency.
If MasterCard used MasterCoins, and they were accepted everywhere, and people used them as a medium of exchange, they'd be a currency.  


To re-iterate, it's a method of payment in USD.  MasterCard doesn't have a separate unit of account that they use to keep track.  Your bill says dollars, the price is in dollars, the merchant receives dollars.  MasterCard doesn't offer you "MasterTokens" with the option to "convert" to dollars, does it?


Like Western Union makes dollars a gift card?  Or Visa?  Or any other "gift cards" denominated in USD?


No, they are offering a payment method denominated in bitcoin.

I frequently purchase music that I enjoy, even though I could get it for free.  The reason being twofold; one is that the platform I purchase from affords me conveniences over downloading it for free.  For instance, Amazon's service stores my music purchase on the cloud, meaning I can access and download it over and over and over again, from anywhere on earth.  To set this service up for myself, I'd have to pay money to a provider for it anyway.  This way, I have a good portion of the earth's musical history cataloged in an easy to use interface that I can "one-click" purchase and listen to instantly. 
The second reason is that I have an appreciation for what those artists have done for me.  They've entertained me.  I, as an empathetic human being, appreciate when someone does something that improves my life.  In return, I'm willing to show a token of that appreciation.  $15 (the avg cost of a CD when I was growing up) is more than I value that appreciation.  $.99 is much more in line.

The incentive to keeping a full node is being able to independently verify transactions.  For many, coinbase or blockchain.info or electrum are widely trusted enough to be relied upon for verification of transactions.  For these central servers, keeping an accurate copy of the blockchain is in their best financial interest.

It's not international and it's slow.  It's not fine tuned for the internet.  It's not transparent.


Bitcoin is decentralized.  Miners aren't the end all be all, since nodes choose whether or not to accept a block, and pools are decentralized miners working together.

Right.  So I'm guessing that the majority of the network doesn't give a flying fuck about Counterparty and would rather provide smaller OP_RETURN lengths since the nodes don't get paid to store higher OP_RETURN lengths.  Therefore, the incentive doesn't really sway the majority of the network.

All you need is a single place that provides a basis.  I thought bitstamp had an API where you could query the spot price at any given input date.  I may be wrong, but surely there's a database out there somewhere that can be used for this purpose.  Then just run all inputs/expenditures' amounts and timestamps through a for-loop that multiplies the amount times the basis as of that timestamp, and you'll have all your gain/loss.
It really isn't extremely difficult.  If a wallet can accurately report your expenditures and incomes, the basis really isn't a technologically difficult variable to incorporate.

What I mean is, when you have a change every 2016 blocks, you know it'll stay that way for 10-14 days, depending on the speed of the network.  If you changed it to 1008 blocks, the difficulty would only be the same for 5-7 days.  504, 2.5-3.5 days, and so forth.  It doesn't really do anything tangible except increase the volatility of the difficulty.  This makes it easier to game, and doesn't actually provide any tangible benefit.

Correlation does not imply causation


What's scammy about it?  No one is promising anyone a return on their investment, and anyone who wishes can get the facts.  Some people have an interest in seeing this come to fruition aside from pure profit, which is what most altcoins are really all about.


I've only just started hearing about this.  Isn't this a side chain, something that hasn't even been prototyped yet?
And as for Counterparty, what is the point of creating scarcity of this nature in something designed as a financial backbone, and not as a store of wealth?  Artificial scarcity is a tool used to drive investment, and ethereum really isn't about investment.

And additionally, mining pools have multiple levels of control.  The pool operator may *appear* to control 51% of the network, but unless he owns ALL the hardware (and is thus basically solo mining), he can't do any kind of sustained attack that the pool participants disagree with, because as soon as they find out, they jump ship and he loses his hashpower.

Options 3)
Realize that pools are *miner collectives* and that the only real long term threat is a single actor owning 51% of the physical hashrate.  Controlling a pool only works as long as the pool participants agree that it should.  GHASH owns 25% of their hashrate, so .5*.25 = 12.5% of the network.  That's much less than 50%.  
GHASH + CEX has shown a great pool operator business model.  I guarantee other people are taking the hint.
I think option 1 is not viable, and 2 should only be revisited when a single actor has 51% of the power.

The concern is not about how a mining company would act; of course a 51% attack threatens their business model.  But other actors, like traditional banks or governments interested in maintaining their hegemony, may have different motives that make destroying bitcoin a worthwhile endeavor.

People could theoretically force a fork by having the client say "this block is invalid, regardless of whether or not it passes the checks."  Then, the rest of the blocks on that fork would not be considered valid because they are chained to an invalid block.
The real concern is that the new fork would be just as vulnerable as the old chain.  Forking away from a 51% actor does nothing because the new fork can be attacked too.

After the first confirmation, you are right.  But it's much more difficult to double spend a transaction that's been confirmed than one that hasn't, so that first transaction actually does provide quite a bit more security.  I don't have the statistics memorized, but if pressed I can probably locate them.  
Look at it like this; until a transaction has been confirmed, anyone can broadcast multiple transactions using the same inputs with different outputs.  After a transaction has been confirmed, you have to have the doublespend transaction mined into another block that is built off of a block one level deep.  No miner is going to build off of a block one level deep unless they are intentionally trying to doublespend.  In this manner the first confirmation provides A LOT more security than each additional confirmation.

Dogecoin may be fun for users, but for big companies looking to transact real amounts of money, dogecoin's image is too whimsical and I think that's going to keep it from being adopted by serious business, where the real money is.

Yes, and so here you speak of long term investment.  Not everyone using bitcoin cares because they aren't invested.  If it's cheaper to use, that's where I use it.  If it's as/more expensive than fiat, then I'll use my fiat with built in escrow and arbitration + chargebacks.  Trying to see it any other way feels like evangelism, and not smart business.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:50:03


With this logic, why would you sell *any* durable good?  Since fiat is designed in the US to inflate at around 2% per year, you can hold all of your precious metals, tools, glassware, wooden furniture, etc and their value will appreciate.  So there are tons of "deflationary" assets that people trade for dollars EVERY SINGLE DAY.

With POW, you have to invest a non-recoverable resource (electricity and time) to mine on a chain.  with POS your resource (ownership of coins) isn't wasted by minting on a chain.  If there are competing chains, with bitcoin you have to pick exactly one.  With peercoin you can mint on all of them at the same time.  So consensus can't be reliably reached with POS, because there's "nothing at stake", while with bitcoin there is.

How is it atrocious?  How does it even hint at a pyramid scheme?  That doesn't make sense.  If Ethereum does not add value to society, no one will use it and their 29.4% stake will mean nothing.  So in order for them to profit *at all*, their product needs to be used.  In order for people to use it, it has to be useful.  So they are maintaining a stake in a product they believe people will find useful.  Ethereum is about smart contracts, not pumping and dumping like other altcoins.  There's a serious and real purpose behind Ethereum besides just recreating the experience of being an early adopter.

This is the source of the *current crisis*, true, but fractional reserve lending is not "the source of our mountain of personal debt".  That lies squarely on the shoulders of the individual choosing to take on that debt.  And in bailing out the banks, the government has sent the message that banks can loan out this created money to bad lenders, grab as much as they can, and then default, and the government will pick up the lion's share of the tab.
If the government didn't offer the safety net, banks wouldn't lend to people who couldn't pay back, and banks would be forced to be more stringent with their credit.
Blaming the banks is like blaming the millions of people on third-generation welfare.  People (and businesses) take advantage of whatever they can, and rightly so.  That's how life works.  Governments are giving them the opportunity to take advantage of our tax dollars.

Really?  Having a safety deposit box is pretty common.  I'm pretty sure the average Joe can handle it without too much trouble.  And it doesn't even have to be a safety deposit box.  In a home safe is pretty damn secure too.


Is Joe making a sizable investment in bitcoin?  I'd argue that if you make a sizable investment in *anything*, you should be prepared to take the steps necessary to secure it, so your argument is moot.  Insurance documents are complicated and can be difficult to understand, but I think someone buying a house should undertake the effort required to do so.  


Only for *sizable* investments.  That's not circular at all.  Any sizable investment should be secured properly.  Printing a paper wallet and locking it up is among the least complicated ways to secure sizable investments.  You stated the *average Joe* won't do it.  But then you said the *average Joe* was making a *sizable investment*.  For the average Joe to *use* it, he doesn't need to take said precautions.  For the average Joe to *invest* in it, he most definitely should, and I don't think it's overly complicated or silly to print something off and secure it physically.

"Market process theory assumes that there is no force and fraud. Force includes force by individuals in the form of theft and so forth, and force by the government in the form of taxation, regulation, and so forth. Austrians recognize that force by both individuals and governments exists, and that market theory does not completely explain reality. Instead, market theory allow economists to understand the processes at work in a market society and to isolate the effects of force. **Attempts to analyze real-world markets must account for government and individual force. Austrian analysis of government policies thus includes not only the direct effects of the policies, but also the effect of the policy on the functioning of the market process."** (1)
This remarkable paragraph essentially calls for the utopian perfection of the human race before the Austrian model can be applied or even criticized!
The quoted paragraph states that government and individual force is neglected to isolate the effects, while mainstream economists make no concession for their "perfect" starting points.  I must stop, this is just too much.

Tupperware is built on the pyramid model.

Of course, if you can mine a block quickly, you can fuck everyone over by just submitting the one.  If they have only 1, then you get there first and you invalidate their work on one.  I would assume that smaller miners would find it advantageous to submit a block as soon as they found it in an attempt to beat the larger pools from submitting multiples.
I guess my point is that it's not as easy to game as it sounds, because other actors may be doing the same thing, which reduces your chances of successfully "selfish mining".

Your link states that deflation is bad, and then uses bitcoin's adoption curve as an example.  But the two aren't related.  Your link refers to people holding due to deflation, while showing that people are holding due to the adoption curve.  Bitcoin is still extremely young.  The rise in price is not due to deflation, but increased consumer adoption.  You'd expect this kind of behavior in the early days of any emerging technology. Only when bitcoin has penetrated the markets and become relatively stable will we begin to see true effects of deflation.

You can't do anything in the bitcoin client that is linked to the price, because the price is a human phenomenon.  How would the system know the price?  An exchange?  Which one?

This necessitates the need for a force the courts can employ to enforce their decree.  Otherwise, it should be kind of up for grabs.

First off, people want zero confirmation spends even if it is not a natively trustworthy option.  That creates a market for someone willing to assume the risk for a fee.  How can you not have it both ways?  Zero confirmations are not a viable option without insulation, but that just introduces a market for insulation.


Maybe not intentionally, but double spends happen regularly, even accidentally.  Blockchain.info highlights them for all to see and they pop up from time to time now.


I understand that, and agree that it does indeed increase the severity of the issue, although had miners previously been interested they could have also provided this service and have thus far not chosen to do so, at least not publicly.  I still contend that this is not a large problem, since waiting for a single confirmation is viable for many internet venues, and there are services who will take on this risk for you for venues where it is not viable.


Or just wait for a single confirmation.  Or pay someone to assume the risk.  Except that these two options are *already available*.


I agree they probably won't make money, but I don't think it's a giant waste of resources any more than the transaction malleability attack wasted resources.  It exposes a flaw and forces the community to either adapt or accept that the flaw exists.  This drives progress and I'm actually pretty excited that this has exposed how risky zero-confirmations really are, and prompts many to begin working around a drawback inherent in the current system.

No, but power plants use steam to run turbines.


I know what merged mining is, which is why I asked you to clarify; what other currencies would you be mining for and why would that put individual miners at a distinct advantage over industrial scale mining?


For someone deriding me for not knowing these basic concepts, claiming that the mere explanation of them would give you a migraine kind of puts you on uneven footing here.  The thing is, I asked you elaborate on why you think two phase mining would disincentivize industrial mining, not describe *what it is*.  If you understood it, you would know that it only disincentivizes *pools*.  Industrial miners aren't using *pools*, because they have enough power to mine *independently*.  In fact, making pools less desirable causes *more* centralization, since pools are the only way small miners can even participate.  So please, before you get all haughty and pretend like you have any clue what you are talking about, please make sure *you actually do*.


Based on your avoidance of discussing your own position, I'd say you are the one who needs to go learn how this stuff works.  You are making baseless claims that "some magic pill" that you don't care to elaborate on and don't have any sources for would make individual mining more incentivized than industrial scale mining.

It can be, but Kindle's service can revoke your access, so it's not a concern to offer zero confirmations.  For most online services and online shipping companies, zero confirmations is fine because if, after 10 minutes, the payment is double spent, the shipment can be cancelled or the service revoked.
There are some situations where it's not perfect, I agree.  But it's always been this way.  This guy's business doesn't expose anything or change anything.  This has been the nature of bitcoin since the beginning, and a necessary evil.  Other alts have had faster confirmations and it can have issues with faster block generations.  Litecoin has a 4 minute confirmation time, so in light of this "new development", people can look into alt-coins for those situations were quick confirmations make a difference.  It's one of the more justifiable reasons for an alt IMO.

If they are mining with 51%, that means they have 2% more than the current rest of the network.  If they could maintain this lead, then to mine 6 months back, they'd need to mine for 6 months / .02 = 300 months 
So to go back 6 months they'd need to mine for 25 years before they'd overtake the rest of the network.  Which assumes that they could keep upping their mining power 1 for 1 with the rest of the network.

Indeed it is.  A 51% attack is not the same as having 51% of the hashrate.  If a mining pool obtains 51% in secret, and never uses it, then there's no *attack*.  Obviously no one can ascertain for certain if a single entity obtains 51%, but should it happen, and be used for evil, it only needs to happen 1 time.  Subsequent reactions matter not, I'll be selling along with the rest of the panicked sellers.


I don't believe that a rational, purely economic actor would ever 51% attack the chain, even if they were to obtain 51% of the network.  I believe that a 51% attack would *only* make sense as an attempt to discredit the network, and wouldn't be prudent for profits' sake.  


To assert that the 51% margin is "a simplifying assumption" demonstrates a lack of understanding of the problem.  Feel free to point out where you believe I misunderstand core concepts.

Aha.  So I see here that you are not completely versed in bitcoin's technological breakthrough.  I'll give you a quick run-down.
Before bitcoin, anything that was considered "digital money" had to have one of the following properties;
A) A central server is required to maintain balances.  This "3rd party" had to be a trustworthy party.  Banks serve this purpose remarkably well for the most part.  Paypal and Square and Visa and MasterCard do too.  However, you have to trust that they won't make off with your money.  You have to trust that they'll accurately transmit your payments to the intended recipient.   These intermediaries (Paypal, Google Wallet, Visa, MasterCard) charge a 2-3% fee for using their services, and reserve the right to refuse service to people they don't like (gray market business like gambling and porn, political dissidents, etc).  
B) Easily reproducible.  In the digital world, most any file is easily reproducible by copying/pasting.  In order to detect that someone has done this, you need property A.
The value of bitcoin is that it provides a technical solution that facilitates online commerce by removing the need for a central third party and by being verifiably unique.  Obviously you either don't believe this solution is as impressive as I make it sound, or you weren't previously aware of bitcoin as a *technical solution*.
So you can compare it to "e-bracelets" if you like, but unless those e-bracelets are verifiably unique without requiring a third party, they aren't as good as bitcoin.

Satoshi Nakamoto did discuss several libertarian applications of bitcoin.  It's up in the air whether or not he prescribed to the ideals he was discussing, but even the creator admitted that bitcoin has a lot of libertarian/anarcho-capitalist applications.  The thing is, just *using* bitcoin supports voluntary interaction.  You won't ever be *forced* to use bitcoin, and no one will ever be *forced* to accept it, because it will never be in any country's best interest to do so.

I don't think we ever actually agreed upon the bar.  Your definition was ambiguous, but doesn't really apply well to most people.


That's not safety of funds, that's care in what contracts you sign.  I agree that push is worse than pull.  But that doesn't make it *safer*.  If a company fraudulently pulls, then the bank re-imburses you.


No; but as I said before, insurance.


Because you said "who haven't bought in that Bitcoin is safe and ready for the mainstream".  When comparing e-commerce platforms, we compare banks with bitcoin because banks provide the same service as bitcoin.  Bitcoin is *safer than cash*, but not *safer than banks*.

I'd disagree with that statement wholeheartedly, since I believe it to be much more rewarding to actually perfect the craft than simply making money.  But even if money were the ultimate definition of rewarding,  I'd point out that in a system with less regulation, scamming people would be harder because they'd be less trusting of companies who aren't as established.

Thus, your personal dealings are effectively private because there's no way to tie the transaction to YOU.  What are you missing here?

How was the guy trolling by saying "up to 20 minutes"?  The implication is that "up to 20 minutes" is a trolling comment, meant to incite a negative reaction and possibly being an intentional lie.  I saw it as something different so I just claimed luck ran bad.  


I agree that if he had meant this, it would have been incorrect.  But that's not how I read it.  I read it as the author thought 20 minutes was a cap, which it isn't.  It can even go higher.  In that light, how does it change everything?  20 minutes is not an unreasonable time between blocks.  The author was trying to show that 10 minutes sometimes isn't even enough.  


See, but you are assuming that the author meant on average when I'm pretty sure they didn't.


Not even close.  Computers can't use context to determine what the programmer meant.  They are dumb interpreters.  We are supposed to be *smart interpreters*.

zero confirmation transactions are inherently not trustworthy.  Anyone trusting them should be aware of the risks.
There's a real risk of chargebacks with credit cards too, and the window for that risk is 90 days.  10 minutes is a much smaller window.
Also remember that bitcoin is not intended as a real-life in person transactional mechanism.  It was literally designed to be cash for the internet.  One of the drawbacks is that the initial confirmation time is longer than instant.  Bitpay and Coinbase mitigate that drawback by accepting the risk themselves for a fee.

This link was actually very good.  It discussed that there are indeed *different types* of speculators, and focused mainly on *Market speculators*, which was only one of four types of speculators mentioned.  There are many cases where speculation smooths prices and limits booms/busts, most notably because weather is a leading indicator of food commodities.  I agree that certain forms of financial speculators have caused volatility in the past, because it is in their best interest to do so.  Complexity in financial derivative markets (which is in itself a fledgling market compared to many other long standing markets) also exacerbates the problem.  But this article itself states numerous times that causality is difficult to determine, so a blanket statement saying "Bitcoin's volatility is caused by speculators" is untrue.  Bitcoin's volatility stems from a low market volume that is susceptible to shocks coupled with a new technology that the world is struggling to understand.  


I am not disputing bitcoin's volatility.  We are discussing it's *cause*.  The bubbles were driven by speculative mania, I concur.  But those bubbles are limited in scope.  Bitcoin's volatility doesn't stem simply from speculation.  Volatility is influenced on a MUCH greater scale by shallow markets, and those shallow markets are moved VERY quickly by changes in regulation and business failures/successes.  


Another good link.  Thanks for finally digging in and having a reasoned discussion.  Still some issues with your comingling of ideas, but at least now we're having reasonable discussion.
Here's a good quote from this paper:


This states outright that some speculation is required.
Here's a link that argues that the jury is still out:


It's not a simple issue, and blanket statements like "Bitcoin is volatile because speculation" is inaccurate at best.


Just because regulators regulate, doesn't imply that they are RIGHT.  Indeed, this link states:


Again, jury still out.  Regulators appeasing lobbyists


They stated what they think should happen, and then cite where others agree.  Not a lot of statistical analysis, and this page feels like it's pushing an agenda.  


This talks a lot about volume, but not much about speculation creating volatility.  It does say that long term bets don't have a big effect on energy price volatility, but not that speculation DOES have a big effect.


Another good link.  Backed with rigorous study.  It's conclusion is that speculation is needed, but excessive speculation can increase volatility.  It also acknowledges that the causal relationship is bilateral, indicating that increased volatility can fuel more speculation in a feedback loop.  A good read, and worth the time of anyone still following this thread.  It still doesn't make true the blanket statement that speculators are causing volatility in bitcoin.  I continue to contend that volatility is influenced in a MUCH stronger way by a shallow market coupled with worldwide uncertainty of bitcoin's place in society.


Yea, it talks a lot about bitcon's volatility, but it doesn't say WHERE that volatility comes from.
Look, my entire point was that you can't just say "Speculators are ruining bitcoin".  That's not true at all.  All of your *good* links indicate that speculation is *necessary* for most markets.  Some of them do indicate that excessive speculation can INCREASE volatility, but not that speculation *always* causes volatility.  
Thank you though, for finally posting a reasonable discussion with links that ACTUALLY support your assertion.  This was much more enlightening and informative and I apologize for assuming you were a nitwit.

There is plenty of evidence to the contrary.  People sacrifice for others all the time.  While I agree in general that most individuals are motivated by heir own self interest, a) that's not always "profit" motive, as there are other motivators besides profit and b) there are situations where individuals aren't motivated by self-interest.  Ask any parent a hypothetical regarding losing their own life or that of their child and see what they say.
But my actual point was, not all people are money-hungry pure capitalists at heart.  Many people desire real justice for people.  Many individuals *actually* experience empathy.  Just because you may not doesn't mean it's not true.  
And then, besides all of that, private justice would *cost money*, and justice should not be withheld from the poor.  IMO, you should be forced, at gunpoint (but only if absolutely necessary), to provide for basic justice for all human beings.  I'm a supporter of the NAP in general, but this specific case I'm not; you should desire to promote justice in society because it makes it better for you and everyone else.  If you don't, then you should be coerced.  
Edited to add:
I feel like this point is fast becoming moot.  With decentralized contracts like Ethereum promises, we won't need subjective humans to enforce contracts; the contract will automatically enforce itself.  With that in place, there will indeed be little reason left for government IMO.

I've heard FDIC more than a few times as a reason to trust banks and not bitcoin.  Seems a lot of people still trust the government as a whole, and people believe that companies that have the government's promise to keep them from failing should they do so by themselves are safer than companies that don't have that promise.

If you fork, you won't have the same mining capacity that exists now.  That mining capacity won't stop, and then you'll have to convince people to move.

Once the utility of bitcoin increases (with further adoption), cashing out will be more expensive than paying suppliers directly, and people will do less cashing out.

I think that many businesses should *voluntarily* utilize auditors and insurers.  Any large company dealing with great sums of other people's money should be *eager* to find holes in their security first and to protect their holdings against loss.  I think companies providing these services for bitcoin related businesses will soon play a much larger role in the evolution of bitcoin services.
Regulators are unnecessary if companies voluntarily provide what the people want, which is security and accountability.

I agree.  I don't send any kind of large bitcoin transaction to untrusted/unfamiliar vendors.  That'd be silly.  I use the proper tool where the proper tool fits.  But sending money to my friends/family?  No need to pay a couple bucks and wait 2 days when I can spend 1/10th of a cent in an hour.  Buying things from trusted vendors?  No reason to pay (or have the vendor cover) the 2-3% it costs for credit cards/paypal.

It creates digital scarcity.  Before bitcoin you *required* a third party to completely control a digital object so you could trust you had the only copy (like WoW gold or Linden Dollars).  Without a third party in *complete* control, you couldn't be sure there weren't like 4 million other copies out there.  And even with the middle man, you couldn't be sure that *the middleman himself* didn't have additional copies. Bitcoin removes the need for a trusted third party to assure scarcity in a digital space.  It's quite a phenomenon that can be applied to many different ways to prove ownership of something.  The blockchain is more than just a currency and the things that are coming may very well blow your mind.

I said 10 blocks, not 10 days, but that's beside the point.


Agreed, but over time, if you truly have more than half of the mining power, you will catch up to the rest of the network and overtake them.  But that wasn't my main point.


These paradoxes you link are thought experiments.  Obviously I can travel from point A to point B just fine, even though technically I have to travel halfway from point A to point B, and then halfway from THERE to point B, and then halfway from THERE to point B, ad infinitum, because that's not how motion actually works.  These paradoxes don't really illustrate anything to your point.

I don't think that's how it works.  From the white paper:




NEWCONTRACTFEE (100x) - fee for creating a new contract, not including the storage fee for each item in script code


* STORAGEFEE (5x) - per-byte fee for adding to contract storage. The storage fee is the only fee that is not paid to a miner, and is refunded when storage used by a contract is reduced or removed.
* DATAFEE (20x) - fee for accessing or setting a contract's memory from inside that contract
* EXTROFEE (40x) - fee for accessing memory from another contract inside a contract
* CRYPTOFEE (20x) - fee for using any of the cryptographic operations
The coefficients will be revised as more hard data on the relative computational cost of each operation becomes available. The hardest part will be setting the value of x. There are currently two main solutions that we are considering:


Use proof of stake voting to determine the fees. In theory, stakeholders do not benefit directly from fees going up or down, so their incentives would be to make the decision that would maximize the value of the network.
A hybrid solution is also possible, using proof of stake voting, but with the inverse square root mechanism as an initial policy.
Can you point me to where you got the idea that the fees won't be collected until after execution?  Because the [whitepaper]( flowchart specifies that a fee is paid within the execution loop or the program terminates for "insufficient funds".

It's difficult to draw this comparison because for the most part, many people are cooperating together to try to find the block.  Solo mining is only for a few enormous mining companies, and even then there's no "guarantee" that they'll find a block at all.  So to make your analogy fit more closely to reality, the cab would be running these airport trips all the time, and most of his trips end up paying him *nothing*.  He is competing with all the other cabbies to get that $31 to appear in his pocket.  And, if cabbie B gets lucky instead of cabbie A, then cabbie A's passengers *disappear* and pop in to cabbie B's cab, leaving cabbie A having driven all the way to the airport for nothing.

Well, the credit card companies (until recently) prevented via contract the pricing of the same good differently based on payment method.  So the merchants had to absorb the cost across all of their goods, effectively driving the price up for anyone purchasing from a business that accepts CC's, whether or not any given individual was using a CC.  So in that sense, they kind of did force us to pay fees.
But I was also pointing out another flaw with Checks (that you mentioned were a good idea); they still have to be cleared by a third party that can be identified and pressured to not clear your transactions.  They can't do that to bitcoin.

Regardless of the direction of affiliation, bitcoins appeal to A LOT of libertarians.  The two will always be linked.


The post you were responding to concedes that Satoshi's political affiliation is inconclusive due to the wordings in his quotes.  But the fact remains that the genesis block refers to an article about bank bailouts, and Satoshi mentioned libertarians directly as a group who would appreciate his work, and bitcoin aligns closely with libertarian ideals.

This assumption is wrong.  You send money to the tumbler.  They record the input.  They use other inputs to send the money to the destination address.  The link between the two transactions is only in the tumbler's database if they choose to store it.




Use multiple transactions through the tumbler to another address for a different amount, spend once from new address.

But it does increase the payouts.  How does that not decrease the variance?  Maybe I just am not familiar enough with p2pool's workings, but I thought all miners got a share of the payout based on their p2pool and since the p2pool difficulty is so much lower than bitcoin's, the variance of the pool is MUCH less than the variance of the block chain, and thus increasing hashpower would increase the variance in the pool, but decrease variance *more* overall.

Yes, the lack of third parties is a main selling point.  So yes, it doesn't work well for low level in person transactions.

How would you know?  IP and btc address are the only two things you can tell.  If a 51% attacker just obfuscated this, you wouldn't "know who it is pretty easily."  Not everyone would leave the "dishonest fork" either.  Legitimate miners who found a block on the "dishonest chain" may choose to stay to preserve their newly minted coins.
 


Not *all* transactions, since every abandoned block would have at least one transaction that would be lost in a fork; the generation of new coins.  All those newly minted coins from legitimate miners will be reverted and the legitimate miners will lose that income.  Those can't be imported into the new chain since the chain is made from different blocks.  Plus, previously confirmed transactions become "unconfirmed" again, leading to the possibility of transactions being re-broadcast in a double-spend attempt that were previously assumed to be confirmed.
Forks are messy, and cause people to lose money.  Read up on what feathercoin ended up doing; they just accepted the attack and continued on, because the alternative was to rip money out of people's hands.

Things move fast in the digital realm.  A year ago is a LONG time in bitcoin years.  MtGox used to be the go-to back in the day.  That's why they still have relevance; first-mover advantage.  In April 2013 they triggered the crash because they couldn't handle the volume.  In late November 2013 they started having major issues with fiat withdrawals, creating up to $100 spread between them and the next major exchange.  Now they're having bitcoin withdrawal issues too.  They may have been the exchange to go to in 2012, but they've fallen from grace since then.
You'll find that, in the US, coinbase is probably the easiest and most popular way to obtain bitcoin.  For trading, bitstamp seems to be clawing its way forward, although lots of exchanges are competing over the carrion that MtGox is leaving in its wake.

How do they get infinite credit?  They have the power to regulate the printing of money, and therefore print themselves as much as they want.  That's how they GET infinite, by being granted that power by us.


As long as there is a body, sanctioned by the populace, who is solely granted the power to initiate force, there will be companies seeking to control that use of force.  Money is a tool to influence that force.  The money is a link in the chain that leads to force.


They'll always be able to manipulate it as long as it can be traded for their currency.  What makes you think bitcoin can't be manipulated?  It just can't be frozen like USD can.  With USD, they hold the keys to the economy.  If they don't like you they can freeze you out.  If you don't comply they can freeze you out.  This is prevented with bitcoin.  Freedom of manipulation, however, is not guaranteed.  The thing with bitcoin is, they aren't frozen out either.

Sorry, **you're** incorrect.  You assume that if the US bans bitcoin, it will be banned worldwide.  We don't yet have a one world government, so there's no way for bitcoin to be shut down worldwide.  Countries **will** disagree, and countries that let bitcoin thrive will be hubs for bitcoin business.  Unless all major governments collude (which has happened, never), bitcoin cannot be shut down.


Again, you assume that some worldwide conglomerate has decided to shut bitcoin down.  Such a conglomerate does not exist.


Maybe in your country, but in other countries bitcoin will be adopted if nothing else than to spite the current powers that be.  The most powerful government on earth, the US Government, as well as Russia and maybe China, could indeed wipe out all living things.  But short of that, they cannot stop bitcoin because they do not control the entire world.  You're missing that extremely important piece.

It's about removing the banks as "gatekeepers" to online transactions.  It's like there was a giant natural fence around the digital world and only by paying gatekeepers could you get access.  Those gates were ultimately policed by regional governments whose laws differ and create friction, along with banks and payment processors who take fees for escrow services even if you don't need them.  
Bitcoin is like a giant hole being blasted in this fence.  You can now transact using the internet without a middleman.  Maybe it doesn't make sense for you with your credit card rewards program, but it does for people who have NO access to banking or who want to do business internationally without having to deal with beauracracy and legal friction.  
Tiger Direct accepting bitcoin in the US is just targeting early investors' newly created wealth and capitalizing on the enthusiasm of bitcoin in general.  Plus they save 2%, which, while it doesn't change the world on its own, does encourage adoption, along with reduced friction in general.

I agree with this.  Visa provides an amazing service that revolutionized how we conduct business.  Many here rarely carry cash because it's linked to a card that provides *some* protections over carrying cash, as well as being incredibly convenient.
You may not like it when a porn site can charge you without explicit permission for each transaction, but it's goddamn convenient for the elecric company to do it every month so I don't even have to think about it.
I love bitcoin, but it doesn't have to "take down" other forms of payment to be an amazing technology and a boon for humanity.  Bittorrent is awesome, but people still pay for media because it's convenient and safe.  And that's OK.  Instead of fighting big banks and credit cards, just quietly use bitcoin whenever it makes sense to do so, and tell people if they are interested what it's about.

Agreed, additional time adds additional security, regardless of the number of blocks in that time.  However, the **first** confirmation changes a double spend attempt from a simple script that broadcasts multiple transactions with the same inputs, to forking the blockchain, which requires mining power.  So that first confirmation can make a big difference in security, even if subsequent security is more a function of time and not confirmations.

One thing to consider is that the Bitcoin network is international.  One reason a gold standard is bad is because a single government may need to devalue their currency to compete with neighboring governments for exports or any other number of things.  This means they need to have control of the issuance of their specific currency.  But since bitcoin is international, this requirement is not necessary.  It also means that bitcoin won't ever be used as a backing for another currency, since doing so removes the country's ability to control their currency, which they will never do.
Bitcoin really does compare better to gold than any national currency.

In a true free market (of reddit posts) mods wouldn't have the power to take action.  This post market (has regulations decided by unelected officials.  
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:42:42


That's not the dichotomy I was presenting, and it's not the only other option besides no regulation.


It's kind of like [biological control gone wrong]( (warning, pdf).  Regulation exists to cure one problem, and results in a host of other problems.  There are those who believe that ceasing any attempt at regulation will allow the market to naturally produce the best outcome.  Using bitcoin is a vote in favor of this ideology.


Regulation is generally unnecessary IMO if you operate from the assumption that people are responsible for their own actions, and should view companies that are not well vetted as suspect, and do their research, and understand the risks involved in the activities they choose to undertake.  But that's beside the point.  Regulation doesn't just exist to prevent a breach of trust.  It also exists to attempt to control individuals.  Take, for instance, Wikileaks.  They aren't stealing from people, but governments still prevent payment processors from doing business with them.  This is a good example of where the governments have used regulation to prevent people from voluntarily transacting business.  They use it to enforce their political will.  Another good example is the war on drugs.  People are prevented from transacting voluntary business on the assumption that their business is immoral.  This isn't all about trust.  A lot of it is about voluntary interaction.  Bitcoin has no central point for a government to target and therefore cannot be controlled in the same way traditional financial institutions can be.  This is what I mean by *free market*.  


I think you are only looking at it from one angle.


This statement shows exactly why regulation doesn't work in the end.  How can any kind of regulation exist with incentives that large.  It's not that the current regulation is inadequate, it's that ALL regulation is inadequate.


If this is the case, then I'm a doctor because I can shoot an AIDS patient and the virus will die.  I guess we could add the qualification "Without nuking the entire planet, governments cannot control/stop bitcoin".  Does that satisfy you semantically?  Is that less ludicrous?


It is indeed a question of capability.  Governments CAN'T attempt to ban/control bitcoin without failing.  And when a government attempts control and fails, it weakens their power.  That's why I believe China has made some terrible moves in their attempt to ban bitcoin.  When bitcoin didn't die, it showed people that China's power is limited.  Any government attempting to control their population's use of bitcoin will end up with egg on their face.  And since the government exists solely because their people wish it to, demonstrating their inability to ban something they wish to ban just weakens any control granted to them.


Agreed.  But in the end, there's a specific ideology that bitcoin represents.  Whether or not it lends itself well to other ideologies is irrelevant to my point.  My point is that bitcoin represents a specific ideology; that of truly voluntary association.  You can't participate in bitcoin without promoting that cause.  Some people believe that truly voluntary association is dangerous (drugs, terrorism, child porn, what have you).  Others believe that the evils born from truly voluntary association are less than the evils brought about by attempts to regulate those evils away (government; wars, coercion, monopoly on force, etc).  You can disagree and debate it until you are blue in the face, because it doesn't matter what you *say*.  If you participate in bitcoin by using the network, you are bolstering the network and furthering the cause.

If you replace "dollar" with "Euro", that happens *right now*.


The "added cost" is a percentage of your gain.  If you want to consider that in your cost analysis, you have to consider the gain that you made when buying bitcoin low and selling bitcoin high "profit".  So while there's an added cost, there's also an added discount.  You come out ahead if you end up owing the IRS, because by definition the IRS only taxes you when you *make money*.

I think in your analogy, the "without ever doing a favor" is a misnomer.  They ARE doing a favor, they have a network of people that will accept promises from them as the same as the real thing.
They don't just loan cash; they loan on *collateral*.  They don't just give out spendable money, except in the case of credit cards, i.e. revolving credit, and those have a much higher interest rate, and they still don't give you "Cash", they just buy stuff at your request and expect to be paid back.  The one exception is cash advances, and since that is the riskiest investment of all, it's usually the highest interest rate.  In general, they buy the thing *up front*, and then give it to you on the expectation of getting paid back.
THAT's how loans actually work, so this: 


is also not true, because *they already bought the house*.  If you don't pay them, then they SHOULD be able to take it back.  This provides more people with the ability to own their own home and build equity.
THAT'S the "favor" they are doing.  
So, when you say 


I call horseshit.  I'm very indebted to the bank that provided me with the option to have a home I own and whose entire being *I control*.  I gladly pay them every month because without them I wouldn't have been able to buy my house.
And finally, if you say


You forget that your part of the bargain is to actually provide me with a million dollars in purchasing power.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:19:46
I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say.  The government's primary concern with moving large amounts of cash is that they know when and where you spend it, so as to attempt to prevent people from A) not paying taxes and B) funding illicit activities.  It's very difficult to do either if they know what and where you are spending it.  With a debit card it's easy to track what and where you are spending it.  With cash it's difficult, so they interrogate you about it to make sure you aren't trying to do A or B above.

I guess the act of polling your node and including the transaction takes time, not enough for a miner to ignore the ~$100 or $200 that the fees currently add to a block.  


Are you saying a selfish mining technique somehow influences a double spend attempt?  Because that's not correct.  Double spends can be done with A) any miner finding blocks or B) a well connected node who isn't even mining.  That's why 6 confirmations is considered secure.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:17:24
This has been possible from the beginning.  Bitcoin has NEVER been superior to credit cards/cash from a consumer standpoint in a brick and mortar situation.

This is sensationalist; the "bail-ins" being discussed now are new debt instruments that will be used as "bail-in" funds, and transparently so.  Therefore banks will have to offer a yield for these instruments that corresponds to the risk of them requiring a "bail-in".  As far as regulations go, this is one of the better ones.


Misleading.  This only applies to those holding the "bail-in" funds, that they bought with the expectation of higher returns in exchange for more exposure to the risk of the bank's failure.  It does *not* apply to existing account holders with simple checking/savings accounts.
Edited to add:


Nope; this won't happen to current account holders.  It can only happen to people who invest in banking bonds that specify that this is a possibility.  That caveat is *not* in your normal checking/savings account fine print.
End Edit
Banking is bad enough as it is, it doesn't need to be twisted to make it look worse.  Sensationalist stuff like this tarnishes the bitcoin message.

Two main reasons I know of;
1) If the random number generator used to compute your public keys is weak, then using the same private/public key pair to sign your transactions can expose the weakness and leave your coins vulnerable
2) Repeatedly using the same address means once you participate in a transaction, the other party/parties now know at least one address that is tied to you, so it can leak personal information (like who you do business with, what your spending habits are, a concept of what you're worth, how active you are in the bitcoin economy, etc).

No, they're not directly related to mining difficulty.  They are *indirectly* related though, as chips that use energy more efficiently can be more widely utilized for profit.  Which means difficulty should adjust upward after new generations of chips are rolled out.  So there's that, I guess.

Ah, but the difference is that actors can't be shut out of this "fixed currency supply of 21 million units".  Anyone with math can join the system.  You misinterpret.  I've stated before, bitcoin as a concept doesn't *destroy the elite*.  It just takes away *one tool* in their toolbox.


I think it is the best option, yes.  I think that people figure out the most effective answer in the absence of government.  Not always, but in business dealings, I definitely do.  And what historical fallacies did I cite?  Standard Oil *was* losing market share, and for more than the reasons you cited.


Well, for starters, the economic incentive exists because of labor laws and environmental regulation.  So the argument is pretty solid.  It's why companies in the US are outsourcing so many manufacturing jobs despite the label of "hostile nations".  It's *already happening*.


I'm talking about the people who buy shares, sorry I didn't clarify that.  Miners pointing their own hardware there are simply short sighted.

No, dude.  You are seriously confused.  Since it's infinitely divisible, the ~~supply~~value has *elasticity* in that it can assume a greater and greater value without failing as a currency.  Gold couldn't do this.
When you add *supply* while *demand* stays the same, *price* diminishes.  So people holding a currency with an inflationary monetary base will lose value just by holding, while people holding a currency with a fixed monetary base will *not* lose value just by holding.


You seriously need to re-read what's being discussed, because I think you are off on a tagent.  It's not *what the cap is* that is important, just that there *is a cap*, which prevents dilution of holdings.

Even long term; the IRS can't even audit the majority of people's filed returns *now*.  There's no way they could police bitcoin on any kind of granular level; they just don't have the manpower to pursue that.  Add in trying to determine which transactions fall under which sovereign nation's jurisdiction, and I see far more work tracking people down than it's worth.

The thing is, you're right; the government HAS funded some things that have advanced human kind.  But it's difficult to say what *would have* happened in their absence.  How many innovations have been stifled by bureaucracy?  And on the flip side, how much money would people donate to scientific research if they didn't have to pay taxes?
Not trying to get into the ancap type argument, it's just that it's difficult to say how things would have turned out without them, and that it's perfectly reasonable to assume that there are people out there who would (and do) spend their personal capital for no other reason than to discover.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:54:43


Not quite.  IMO that's a misnomer.  We trust that the democracy of 1 hash 1 vote will turn out for the best.  Bitcoin is basically a demonstration attempting to prove that economic activity is the most honest form of democracy.  
Plus, have you read the source code?  You're already choosing to trust that it's written properly and devoid of bugs.  You're already trusting that the information you submit is the information you intend to submit.  There's plenty of trust required.  It's just *less* trust than a closed system like a private bank or government.  Private banks do horrible shit for years before someone finds out.  Government is usurped by money and used to fuck people over to benefit corporations.  With bitcoin,  GHash got close to *having the power* to do bad things, not even *doing bad things*, just *being able to*, and the community went nuts.  Miners left GHASH, other pools went up in response.  Investment into competition was made.  It was *transparant*.
If you eliminate voluntary association somehow in the protocol, you speed up the centralization process because small investments no longer result in reliable returns, and without large amounts of money, you can't participate.
At least now you can throw $300 or so at something and be able to maybe ROI (if you can time the market).  It's easier for small players (who are more likely to have long term *as well as* short term incentives at play) to participate.  
So I'd rather have a few people being policed by a *truly* decentralized network, than have a few people *with no accountability*.

So as OP was saying, p2pool relies on an inner block chain whose target is every 30 seconds.  So you are mining for this inner block chain, and (i believe) some of the inner block chain nonces also solve the bitcoin block chain's next block, and thus your miner shows other miners that it is mining by solving the 30 second chain (kind of like shares on a traditional chain) while attempting to solve the bitcoin block chain.  Someone correct me if I'm mistaken.

Even with free electricity, cheap miners require hubs and those hubs need to be connected to something running the mining software, neither of which are free.  The old miners' profits (with zero electricity costs) asymptotically approach 0 as difficulty increases.  Buying up old miners and mining is not a profitable exercise.  Right now, a 333 MH/s block erupter on free electricity will gross around $1.15 in the next year.  For the year after that it will gross $.03.  For the next, it will gross around $0.00095.  After three years it will have made less than $1.20.

It's not JUST blockchain size.  If we make the block size too big, there's never any competition for transaction inclusion.  As the mining reward decreases, transaction fees have to take their place.  What incentive would users have to pay a higher transaction fee if every transaction, regardless of fee size, was processed immediately?  The idea is that if you make the block size a little less than the demand, then users will pay higher fees for faster confirmations.

Or for the coffee maker to assume the risk of a double spend (much like the risk of counterfeit bills and credit card fraud), or pay someone else to assume it for him.  It's not the end of the world, folks.

Well, since I'm not OP, I didn't lie about it, but the fees are negligible for a transaction of any reasonable size.  And fees aren't very large even for tiny transactions (less than $1).  The Bitcoin-QT client has a default minimum, but that's not protocol based.


Bitcoin can't eliminate the need for a middle man in EVERY case, and it's not attempting to.  It's just providing an alternative for when no middle man is necessary.  For me, when a middle man is necessary, paypal or CC's usually fit the bill pretty well.


I disagree; middlemen are not needed for big companies, so why do we pay for them?  They should only be paid when I need their services, and only people who need their services should pay for it.  With CC's and paypal, ALL participants pay when only a FEW actually need it.  Why am I paying 3% on top of all my purchases at Newegg when I don't need escrow with them?

That's true, the market isn't as free as it could be, but I'm saying that these problems don't directly derive from force.  Merchants mark up their products for the services Visa provides because they make more money taking it then they do not taking it (and pocketing the % difference).  It's not a government decree that forces merchants to accept Visa.
And even with regulatory barriers to entry, there's still competition.  So it's not like you don't have options, but that's the picture you try to paint.
However, this is all beside the point.  The point is that you are trying to shape the services banks provide as some kind of evil thing and it's not.  Many people are very happy with the level of convenience and safety banks provide.  They're willing to give up some of their privacy (voluntarily, without coercion) in exchange for the service.  That's the prerogative of the individual.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:25:22
Sounds like it might be worth a little bit to a business owner to adopt bitpay or coinbase; they accept transactions with zero confirmations (under a certain threshold I believe).
There's also almost no reason to wait for confirmations once a valid transaction is sent to the network.  Inconveniencing a customer isn't worth the risk of a doublespend, just like making them wait 60 days before they get the good wouldn't be prudent with a credit card (although that's how long it takes to "verify" the transaction for a credit card company).  Companies release goods all the time on the faith that a customer's payment is good.  And a zero confirmation transaction (that's been picked up by the majority of nodes) being double spent is expensive or improbable anyway.  


Agreed, which is why bitcoin's use case is not "every situation requiring an exchange of value".  Making a customer wait 15-30 minutes is completely unacceptable.  I could see it being reasonable to make a customer pay upon ordering for bitcoin-based transactions, instead of after the meal, but that's still not really good.  Until more trust is established in the network, merchants will be wary of accepting transactions that are only verified by nodes, and not by blocks.  That comes from the strange feeling of the payment being so easy and simple, and it'll fade as people get more used to bitcoin.  I know it did for me.
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:08:19
Fees are eliminated (read, reduced to miner fees, which are negligible for most transactions) for merchants who can pay their employees or suppliers in bitcoin and for miners.  Fees are indeed higher when an exchange/payment processor is required, which is one reason there are so many people trying to get bitcoin adopted; the higher the adoption rate, the cheaper it is to conduct business.

Variance means that the miners need extremely large investments to make a reasonable assumption on returns.

How can you run the business on bitcoin if no one takes it?  Even if companies are using a payment processor, if they take it, others can take it too, and pay them with it.

No, it's a case of the government constantly monitoring everyone's bank account, always.


So say you.  With cash, this is a reasonable stance, even though I still disagree with it.  With bitcoin, it's not reasonable, since there IS utility to laundering money, since all transactions are public.


If it was private, there'd be no way to convict people of money laundering without a warrant.  As it is, they can simply query the details of your bank account at will, because it is distinctly **not** private.     
 
Your whole argument is that we can't reasonably expect our financial business to be private because you don't find utility in it and there are criminals who do.

I assume you are alluding to the concept of diminishing returns.  Well, eventually we will smack up against physical limitations, and when that happens, the only way to add hashpower is to buy more of the same efficiency hardware.  The thing is, adding more of the same hardware, while it does mean more hashes, doesn't mean more hashes *per watt*, which means that anyone paying ANYTHING for electricity reaches a point where adding hashpower isn't profitable.  Even those who pay nothing for electricity recognize that paying more for a miner than it can ever be expected to produce is not profitable.  That's when we'll reach equilibrium.

Ah, but the resale value also plays in.  At least at the moment (and as we've seen at places like CEX.IO), there are people who don't math and are willing to buy miners for more than they are worth.  So if you can time it right, you can get a good deal of hashpower, mine for a while, and then resell for no loss, or even for profit.

I wholeheartedly disagree.  Try taking a payment of $.50 from a credit card.  You either have to A) Charge double because of the minimum fee, or B) sell "credits" in larger blocks.  Bitcoin is definitely meant for small transactions.  In fact, from the original bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto:


minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions
Bitcoin was indeed meant for micropayments.  It's in the intro of the original white paper.
The thing is, the minimum transaction fees right now are a little high because they were put in place when bitcoin was $100.  It's at almost $1000 now, and the fee will most likely be re-adjusted in the near future.

Can actually be taken back a few blocks; more if they have sufficient hash power.  If I start from 10 blocks ago, it'd take time, but with 51% I would inevitably catch up over time, assuming I maintained my 51%.  If I had 51%, I could theoretically start from the genesis block and mine a completely separate chain the would eventually (in a few years) surpass yours.  Not likely, but possible because math.
The fork going forward is just the mose *expedient* attack.


It is most likely not going to change history, but it's POSSIBLE.  I'll concede it's not much to worry about, but my basic premise is correct; it's consensus that establishes the history to begin with, and its consensus that allows that history to grow.  The history in the blockchain is a history of *previous consensus*.  Much like the democratic process selected a new president, just because you can't go back and change who got elected last term doesn't mean it's not a democratic process selecting who gets elected NEXT term.


Let's not get condescending.  I hate when discussions devolve into pissing contests about who can insult the other more.  If you look at my post history, you'll see I've been here a while.

Ok, so you made your point.  Satoshi's personal politics are logically unproven.  They *are* strongly suggested by Satoshi's desire to market bitcoin to them.  If you are only trying to market a tool, why go after a political group and not the public at large?  Additionally, Satoshi was obviously concerned with the financial situation, and believed voluntary interaction was the best course for humanity, which implies removing government coercion.
The fact is, is that bitcoin's effects on our society align closely with libertarian agendas; namely returning sovereignty to the individual.  Whether or not Satoshi is a libertarian is irrelevant; the tool he created furthers the libertarian agenda.

Metal has some pretty cool properties to it that bitcoin won't ever have.  Coins have history.  Coins are collected for more than just their monetary value.  Gold will always be a hedge for people who want to physically maintain possession of their goods.  I don't see a reason for metal to lose its luster (get it!?) in the foreseeable future.  Paper money, however, is already endangered.  I barely ever actually transact in fiat with physical dollars.  It feels so archaic.  On the off chance that I do use cash, I often find myself feeling self conscious because the extra time it takes for the transaction, and how I'm holding up the line for that 10 seconds it takes the cashier to figure out how to give me my change.

No, because the bank is insured.
That's why you trusted the bank with your deposit; to keep it safe.
If you have *CASH* stolen, there is no way to "reverse" the theft.  The banks have to eat the cost of a bank robbery as a cost of doing business, and pass that cost on to the borrowers and large-scale bank service consumers.
But the *CASH* was still *STOLEN*.
Depositors do not hold cash.  The bank does.  When cash is stolen from them, it is *GONE* unless they physically catch the guy and retrieve it.

It *does* introduce friction into moving money.  It's not a large amount of friction, but it does exist.  This friction creates inefficiencies, which in turn cost money.  What does it take for the bank to fill out the paperwork?  Not much.  Sometimes they have to follow up with you about it; that takes a bit of time.  Then what does the IRS do with it?  File it away, probably.  That costs processing time and computing power, not to mention the disk space required to maintain the database, along with the extra electrical costs and the man power it takes to maintain.
It may not seem like much, but in aggregate I bet it adds up to quite a chunk of change.  Regulatory Compliance is overall a costly endeavor, and filing reports on large money transfers is a portion of that cost.

But ghash's antics actually threaten the protocol itself.  With mtgox and silk road, those events didn't threaten the core of the protocol.  A bad actor gaining 51% and double spending does more than simply generate bad PR.  It actually erodes trust in the mechanism itself.  So in the Zimbabwe scenario, the threat of a 51% attack is as if the bills themselves couldn't be trusted to actually exist.

Only in a peripheral way.  Saying "financial world" implies financial goods and services.  


If that's true, then how come credit cards are so popular?  There's potential fraud there, and that's acceptable.  Cash is vulnerable too.  Whatever gave you the idea that a non-zero percent chance of fraud is unacceptable?  We operate with a non-zero percent chance of fraud all the time.  The gas station could not pump the proper amount of fluid, your cereal box could have less than the printed amount.  Potential fraud exists almost *everywhere*.  So please, quit talking like this is a bitcoin-only problem.  It's not.


Bullshit.  Both situations mean that the merchant no longer has the money OR the goods, and both situations have a duration of time for which the transaction is susceptible.  They are very simlar.


Oh I see, so customers only use them for legitimate purposes.  That's fair.

But when you say "marginally reduce the probability of a 51% attack", what are we reducing the probability FROM and what are we reducing it TO?

Based on those costs, are there motivated actors who could actually pull it off?  It seems that the word "marginally" here is subjective.

Exactly, because all of those things are controlled by a *central third party*.  Prior to bitcoin, there was no other way to ascertain who owned what, since data is infinitely reproducible.

Indeed, it is impossible to ensure decentralization.  We're all banking on the idea that bitcoiners will outweigh the bad guys.  There are only a few people with true economic incentives and the means to destroy bitcoin, and so far they (major governments) haven't shown any real hostility towards it.
It's been a worry from the beginning, as evidenced by statements to that effect in Satoshi's white paper.

The lower price indicates that holdings on MtGox are worth less.  This indicates people are less willing to have bitcoin holdings on MtGox.  Why do you propose that is?  What is "panic mode"?  Would you not say panic mode is people not trusting their coins to be present when/if withdrawals are re-enabled?  
Let's explore. The definition of "market" is a group of people buying and selling a given commodity, right?  The truth of the situation is uncertain, so anything at this point in MtGox is a "gamble" where people "bet".  So far we've established that the "market" on MtGox is a place where people are currently making "bets" (in practice, all markets are bets; buys are bets it will go up, sells are bets it will go down).  The truth is that the price of MtGox bitcoins is less than the price of bitstamp or coinbase bitcoins.  So people on MtGox are willing to pay, or "bet", less on MtGox bitcoins.  Why would they be less on MtGox?  There must be some situation that makes MtGox less desirable.  I'd posit that the continued disabling of bitcoin withdrawals would probably be a good reason to find MtGox coins less desirable.  If the market as a whole expected MtGox to re-enable withdrawals soon, then this trait would not really affect the price.  If, however, the market expected MtGox NOT to re-enable withdrawals or to take a long time re-enabling withdrawals, this trait would make bitcoins even less desirable.  No one wants to lose access to their bitcoins for long periods of time.  So we have the "market" making "bets" already, and it appears that they REALLY don't want bitcoins from MtGox, at least by around 1/2, if the price is any indication (hint: it is).  So we have the "market" making "bets" that "withdrawals" won't be "enabled" in the near future.  The greater the spread, the less confidence people have in MtGox.

Bitcoins are not *owned*, they are *controlled*.  There's a difference.  It's a kind of new concept that doesn't really have a physical analogy.  The "driveway" in your analogy is only easily accessible by a tiny subset of people; namely those whose geographic location is close to the driveway.  The internet is instantly available to the majority of the world.  On top of that, the key is derived from a *simple phrase*.  This isn't the same as the lock, which is derived by fitting one physical object within another specifically designed to only match that metal object.  I can't even think of a proper analogy to this because there isn't one.  If two people independently come up with the same private key simultaneously, who "owns" the key?  There's no real precedence for something like this so you can't really make a judgement either way.  Can anyone simply own the answer to a mathematical equation?  That fits most closely with intellectual property rights IMO, but even then, it's not *the equation* that's in dispute as is traditionally seen in IP, it's the *parameters* to a completely open and public equation.  New territory, my friend.

Think of it like this.  Most of the time everyone is working on the same blockchain.  As long as the majority of miners are working on the same blockchain, it gets longer.  However, if a group decides to mine a different chain, (known as a hard-fork), whichever chain is the longest will be accepted by the current software.  Therefore, if you are stronger than the rest of the network combined, you can (eventually) make a chain that is longer than theirs, and thus basically control the blockchain for all bitcoin nodes.  Therefore, if someone's hash power is greater than the entire rest of the network, they control more than 50% of the *entire network* (including themselves in the calculation of the percentage), and thus all of bitcoin.
It's not hard coded.  It's, as you say, a given due to the nature of decentralization.

I would have made less, because I measure my profit in bitcoin.  How is this relevant?  My personal investment decisions are not pertinent to the concept of switching algorithms in a 51% attack.  I'm quite happy with the investments I've made.  
The point is, despite all of your head shaking and ear plugging, is that once a 51% attack is successful, it will invalidate the model that Satoshi put forth, and it will demonstrate that the economic incentives inherent in bitcoin are not enough to balance a system based on mutual distrust.  Switching the algorithm won't change that.  Another model will need to be erected, and before you parrot it back again, proof of stake has already been shown to be ill suited to the task.

Warren Buffet's opinion matters in that it influences investors, so if you are here to invest in bitcoin directly to make fiat gains, Buffet's opinion negatively affects your portfolio and therefore matters very very much.

And a decent sized block that makes a LOT of money is better than a tiny block that makes a LOT LESS money.  People rarely find blocks simultaneously.  One second extra propagation is not a guarantee of an orphaned block.  You seem to think you already know exactly how people will be motivated in the face of higher profits.  People will push the size of the block as high as they can until they start seeing higher orphan rates, at which time they'll pull it back.

Also, from the white paper (and additionally to refute &gt; If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
Satoshi discussed the economic incentives for a 51% actor to behave *in the whitepaper*.

It doesn't hinge on altruism.  It hinges on economic incentives.  It's always been that way.  The early days of bitcoin saw fear erupt over the possibility of botnets taking over the system.  You know what they did with those botnets?  They just mined; they participated instead of trying to take it down or double spend or short the system or freeze other peoples' blocks.  The incentive is greater to participate legitimately than to participate maliciously.  That's the way bitcoin was designed from the beginning.

Notice I said I still object to money laundering laws generally, but concede that your argument has merit, even though I disagree.  But it still raises important points; the old laws were written *assuming privacy*.  That's no longer a valid assumption, and so old laws don't necessarily apply.  That's part of my argument here.


Good luck conducting modern business without a bank account.  And let me know how the IRS feels about you conducting all your business in cash.


Do you agree that a person's house should be searched based on a spike in utility data without a warrant?  Seems like an apt analogy here.  


Dude, have you been keeping up with the news lately?


That is the intent of the law, but that is not the outcome.  The outcome is that all incoming funds must be sourced, or it is considered money laundering.  In order for your argument to succeed, they can only charge someone with money laundering *after they catch them committing the crime from which the money was laundered*.  But instead, they take a pro-active approach.  That's *my argument*.  If they have evidence of a crime, and evidence you covered it up, then there are already laws on the books for that.  It's called "tampering with evidence" or "interfering with a criminal investigation".  Why do we need a separate "money laundering" charge unless it is specifically different from "tampering" or "interfering"?


Agreed, but the act of concealing its source has *become* evidence of wrong doing, which is what I'm saying is wrong.


But this is the crux; you are saying that "If you aren't committing a crime, you should have no need to hide the source of your funds".  I'm saying that your statement is increasingly irrelevant in this day and age.

True, but USG creates an artificial demand by A) Collecting taxes and then B) Demanding that only USD will settle that debt.   So the value is artificially propped up by creating demand where none may have existed before.

They'll have a hard time gettin MULTIPLE blocks orphaned until they get around 51%.  If they are at 50%, they mine a block on average for every block the rest of the network mines.  Less than that, and they are at a disadvantage to the network, so most likely they'd only be doing it on one block at a time.
Also,they have to withhold a winning block routinely to perform this attack.  Not a lot of people can look 25 btc in the face and say "Double or nothing!".  Short term profits have a tendency to override long term gains, which incidentally is why a 51% attack has any incentive AND why big pools attract miners.  The 51% attack would create wealth for the spender, but destroy faith in the network.  Big pool attract miners because of lower variance, even if the size of the pool could shake faith in the network.

Just because they settle their debts in fiat just means that there aren't enough *suppliers* yet to settle their debts in bitcoin.

Which is why you should wait for 6 confirmations, because after that the likelihood is low that consensus is not reached.

It just equates to *more* security *in general*.  I agree that open source &lt;&gt; 100% secure code.  But with open source, there is a community out there using it and tweaking it and changing it and with closed source, the only people changing it are the owners, and the only people reporting bugs are the users who pay.
I agree, it's not 100% (although that's not fair because nothing is), but open source is more secure *in general* because large, fatal flaws are *more likely* to be found.

It is not incompatible with the narrative that is pitched to merchants.  The narrative is "no chargebacks" and "no fee for accepting".  Plus, if they want the feature of zero confirmations, they can pay a fee (which is lower than all credit card companies) for processing where the company assumes the risk, as well as the volatility risk, for said fee.
The narrative hasn't changed.  Unless the narrative you were told was pitched by someone who doesn't understand bitcoin, and then I would say not to blame bitcoin, but blame the uninformed person who pitched it to you.

He did, and even stated that he didn't believe a 51% attack would happen due to incentives.  
From the white paper:


assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:25:13




These two ideas are incompatible.  If the community can hard fork because we don't agree with someone's possession, this is just as bad, IF NOT WORSE, than altering the protocol.  If the community EVER forks just to reverse a legitimate (albeit illegal) transaction, I'll jump ship *immediately*.


These kinds of situations are gameable.  How do you prove they are sitting idle due to data corruption instead of being stored in a cold wallet that someone doesn't pay attention to?  I can claim corruption, and be lying.  


No, there isn't.  Only people who want bitcoin to resemble a credit card discuss this.  Once they finally understand, they stop it.


Thanks for highlighting the demand for hardware wallets, bitcoin banks, etc.  This again doesn't have ANYTHING to do with forking the chain to recover funds.


Why not?  It is with cash, at least to the individual.  If I have $20k in cash in my house, and it burns down, that wealth is destroyed.  Also, the coins being lost increase the value of all other coins.


It doesn't destroy the protocol, or the idea.  It may destroy a few of the entries in the ledger, but that's nothing compared to the trust that the only way to take my money is by having my key.  Otherwise, governments could dictate a hard fork whenever large sums were donated to their rivals.  Who the fuck wants the community to have that kind of power?


It most definitely is.  Can you hard fork recover physical gold?  No?  Then how come it's touted as one of the best stores of wealth in the history of mankind?  You sir are mixed up.


Demand accountability.  MtGox has a list of the people whose coins they had and whose fiat they had.  MtGox should be accountable for making those people whole.  In 2008, people lost millions of dollars because of improperly managed investment funds.  How were those people hard-forked back to solvency?  They weren't.  Bitcoin will not protect from people losing wealth.  Nothing does.  To think otherwise is to live in a world divorced from reality.  This imaginary risk-free world only exists in your mind, and the notion that this risk-free world exists and can be attained is fast becoming one of the biggest fallacies of our time.

Most gas stations I know only verify that the card's account is active and in good standing by setting a hold for $1.  Then the charge goes through the batch process at the end of the night.  My buddy used to overdraft on purpose over the weekend by paying for my gas on his card.  As long as there was $1 in his account it'd go through, and I'd pay him cash.  He got paid on Mondays so could have money in his account before the charge was finished processing.

No they couldn't.  They *could* not include it in their blocks, but they can't prevent others from including it in THEIR blocks.  Unless they have a sustained 51% AND good luck, they can't prevent other blocks from making it onto the chain. 51% is not the end all, be all, **especially** with a pool.
Edit to add; 51% sustained is difficult for a pool actively engaged in shenanigans.  Miners have short term incentives to mine on the longest chain.  If a pool operator doesn't mine on the longest chain, he's risking the rewards he could otherwise be capturing.  If his 51% is unsuccessful, those rewards are *lost*.  Miners don't like variance; that's the whole reason pools get so big as it is.  There is variance in a 51% attack, especially right on the edge.

I'm not taking this conversation seriously because you are obviously trolling.
Of course the bitcoin network doesn't protect my freedom.  But it does grant me freedom of exchange.  Should I be locked up in prison, bitcoin's not going to do me any good.  But since bitcoin doesn't fall exclusively under US jurisdiction, using something like Coin Validation or trying to regulate how bitcoin can be used will just drive innovation to other countries.  I'll still be able to use it if I please, unlike traditional systems which create bottlenecks at ACH clearing houses, meaning the government can target those central bottlenecks and freeze me out of their system if they please.
Bitcoin is the next step in the erosion of the omnipotence that states traditionally enjoy.  It's not the end-all-be-all, but you make it sound like it's a pointless endeavor.  It's not.

However, the network is still considered "decentralized" since 75% of GHASH's hash power is in the form of independent miners, who can choose their pool at will.  Contrast that with an actor having 50% of the hashpower in physical machines, and you'll see that a large pool is a MUCH smaller threat than a true 51% attack.

@_date: 2014-06-16 14:23:05
But the whole idea of bitcoin is consensus.  Bitcoin isn't completely devoid of trust.  It trusts that the majority of the actors participating will abide by the rules of the road.  If the majority of actors are bad, and can collude to be bad *in the same way at the same time*, then they can bring the network down.
Bitcoin set out to remove a *single* trusted third party, and replaced it with a *network* that comprised a trusted third party.  You trust the network to report transactions correctly, as opposed to one single monolithic entity.
The entire concept of bitcoin is based on community.  If the majority of hashpower decides to be bad together, then Satoshi's vision was wrong.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:47:41


It's not a trustless system.  It's a distributed trust system.  There's a difference.


Better than trusting single mining operations.  Without pools small actors can't participate.  That means trusting *only* the large scale operators.  If small scale miners are to have any hope of making money in this space, they need to pool their resources.

Wider adoption?


Fine; enjoy your coin.


No, but right now the network effect makes bitcoin MUCH more valuable. 


Exactly, so why use a new coin when bitcoin serves the purpose just fine and has the network effect?


It's valuable because scarcity could previously not be guaranteed by a computer program.


Part of bitcoin's appeal is that it functions like digital gold.  Otherwise, why not just use the dollar?  It's inflating too, at a target of about 2% per year.  And it has smart people actively tweaking it to keep it on target in response to other environmental factors.  


But scarcity-derived value is part of bitcoin's function.  Dogecoin's 5% inflation doesn't do much in a voluntary currency.  Why would I choose to do business in dogecoin if I know that holding any portion of it will cost me money in the long run?  Why wouldn't I just use dollars?


I believe all crypto-currencies are seriously undervalued, bitcoin included.  But what you see is the market saying "This doesn't actually bring anything new to the table", which is why the value is so low.

It's not an alternative to a 51% attack.  If proof of work doesn't work now, what makes you think changing the algorithm isn't just a "rinse, repeat" scenario?  If the algorithm is changed on miners, no bitcoin-like structure will ever gain traction again because people won't be willing to invest R&amp;D into a system whose core rules can change and invalidate their investment.  The basic structure would be ruined.


This is a different scenario from the one we are discussing.  This separate scenario also would very likely destroy bitcoin in the eyes of the average person, but let's keep focused, shall we?  


No it wouldn't, not for bitcoin.  Miners ARE users.  In fact, miners are probably the heaviest users, since they must trade their bitcoin for fiat to finance their energy expenses, and mining equipment is one of the first closed loop, all bitcoin economies.


Um... that's how this all started to begin with.  It's doing quite the opposite of deteriorating.


Yea, the miners, who provide a *secure* decentralized ledger in which to participate.


It's not a resort at all, since it doesn't reliably achieve consensus.  That's the whole point of the network, to achieve consensus without relying on a trusted third party.


It's not nonsense.  There's a very real (albeit small) chance of something like this happening.  I suspect China's government may make moves in the near future.  Absolute control + access to multiple chip fabrication plants + a desire not to have their currency undermined = a very real possibility of some kind of attack.


The miners are the ONLY thing that makes bitcoin secure.  Without proof of work it's just a ledger everyone participates in and everyone trusts everyone else to play nice.  Without the miners, you don't have a viable alternative to trusted third parties.
And the reason I continue with this line of thought with you, despite your obvious lack of understanding of the core bitcoin principles, is for other people's benefit.

This isn't quite English, but I think I grasp your meaning.  You can't make a blanket statement where owning a house is always good, I agree.  What I'm saying is that owning a house is more lucrative long term than *renting the same house*.  


Yep, economies of scale help make *even more money*, but to compare apples to apples, we have to assume your landlord only owns *your condo*.  Are you saying it's never better to own a single apartment as opposed to renting it?  Didn't you just get done saying that it's based on the situation?
In general, owning the property you live in costs less over time than renting the same property, because by owning you pay the same costs as you do renting (they're more visible while owning, but your rent covers those costs whether you acknowledge it or not), except you don't pay the profit to the landlord and you build equity.

The problem is that the blockchain doesn't store identity, and doesn't have any barrier to entry (except a computer and internet connection).

Savings accounts give interest (or used to).  That interest would be higher if they didn't have to pay insurance and cover business costs.  You're taking a hit on interest to let them hold your money.  
It's like they take their cut out of the money they generated from borrowing yours.  It's not really a big deal, but there's seriously no such thing as a free lunch.
As for checking, banks *do* offer that as a loss leader, but they make up for it in other services (which bitcoin would be terrible for, like mortgages and car loans and other lending services).  So if you have other services with a bank, you're paying for the cost of your free checking account along with others' free checking accounts.

My apologies, I misread and was in a hurry.  I thought the $105 was contingent on purchasing the stock for $100.  
If you get $105, that's GOOD because you didn't have $105 before.  Just because it COULD HAVE been $125 doesn't mean $105 is BAD, just that it wasn't AS GOOD.
Understand here, someone offers you $125 for a good, and someone else offers $105 for a good.  *All else being equal*, you should take the $125.  That's the "objective" part you are referring to.  However, *nothing is ever equal*.  You have to decide if the terms of the $125 are the same as the $105.  Maybe you don't want to do business with the guy offering $125.  Maybe his payment method isn't one you are willing to use.  Maybe he's a shady guy.  Maybe the $105 is offering cash money in hand, and the $125 is a promise.  Maybe the $125 guy is offering $100 in cash and $25 check.  Maybe the $105 guy is your friend and you want to hook him up.  
And then you still haven't addressed where the $125 valuation even originates.  Who decided that $125?  Why not $126 or $124?  They made a subjective decision to offer $125 dividend as an incentive to invest.  Where did that value come from?  How is it objective?

I for one pick up cheap miners near the end of their profitability for two reasons:  1) difficulty increase is slowing down and 2) even at a *slight* loss it's still better than paying fees at an exchange to get coins.  I can convert dollars to miners, and then miners to coins and have exchange free coins.  Plus, there are lots of people who'll buy these even at a *big* loss, so I just unload on them once the profitability goes down for the cost of electricity I pay.  I've ended up making money on every miner except the first ASICMiner that I paid 2 btc for (got caught in the hype).

Color is EASY to fake.  Immunity to corrosion is a feature of many alloys, most of which can be easily colored to look like gold.  Neither of these features are unique to gold, and can be replicated much more cheaply.


Agreed, but my point is that jewelry is NOT the main reason gold is valued so highly.  I contend that gold is valued highly because it is scarce and inert, which make it well suited to being a store of value, and it is soft, which makes it well suited for coinage.  These reasons made gold a store of value way back when, and when coinage was no longer necessary due to paper bills, gold retained its store of value status because people stick with what people know.

But the "regulation" is always voluntary and not at all forced.  This is truly a free market strategy.  If companies offer regulations voluntarily, governments don't end up needing to step up.  Set aside the belief that the governments want to kill bitcoin and compare bitcoin to motion pictures.  The MPIAA willingly offered regulation to movies with the rating system.  ESRB did the same thing.  When consumers have the option to self regulate, they don't feel the need to call for government engagement.  
As a community, self regulation is a much better option than government regulation.

A fair set of rules that keep the system operating, and no coercion to make you use it.  Truly free association.

All deposits and withdrawals from either exchange or mining pool are on the chain.  If the off-chain transactions don't exist anywhere, then it doesn't exist for the IRS either, and your final gain/loss is all that really matters.  Same thing with mining pools.  The on-chain transactions that deposited money into your account from a mining pool would be considered mining income.  Easy peasy.

This isn't the "finance world", it's the "food service world".  Most restaurants that aren't fast food joints allow you to finish your food before you pay.  There is risk that you won't be able to pay for your food after you've eaten it, so the risk analysis is a lot more lax than in the "finance world".  Additionally, credit card transactions have a non-zero risk of chargebacks and fraud as well.

To my knowledge, there has been no successful 51% attack.  To date, there's no evidence to support the viability of a long term 51% attack.  GHash's power is derived in large part from individual miners and thus is not truly a threat at the moment.  Therefore currently, there's no reason to believe that the most secure cryptocurrency on earth is susceptible to a 51% attack, because the difficulty in achieving 51% is rising rapidly.




It's not a simplifying assumption.  It's the point at which someone achieves consensus alone, thus becoming a trusted third party, which is exactly what bitcoin was designed to route around.  Bitcoin's entire premise is based on the idea of simple majority.  If a single actor gains the simple majority, then the network no longer offers reliable consensus.


Indeed it is.  How could it not be?  Altcoins have been 51% attacked already.

As far as I understand it Ripple is meant to be simply a payment network, with it's "currency" not meant to have much value on it's own, but meant to represent value subjectively to each debtor.  I haven't looked into it too closely, but it appears that the system itself could have value if you trust the players.  The tokens should not be considered a speculative asset though, because it's all been premined and basically owned by a third party. 
If a lot of people utilize it, it could be an interesting clearinghouse for all things of value; consider trading airline miles for gold, or bitcoin for gift cards.

Debit cards are great.  But they do cost the merchant to accept


Merchants see it though, and have an incentive to get people to use bitcoin, by providing discounts or other forms of rebates to bitcoin buyers.


As more businesses offer cash discounts, this point becomes more prevalent.


At the moment not as much.  However, discounts from big business does cause some people to use btc instead, and bitcoin is a great exit from an economy many people believe is on the verge of failing.  Also, if going to another country, depending on the country, bitcoin can be beneficial since there is no exchange rate of bitcoin to bitcoin. :)

How is it a problem hampering long-term adoption?  Do you have statistics on how many day traders are also bitcoin converts?  Do you have any statistics showing that people trying to make money off of bitcoin are indeed hampering long-term adoption, or is this just a feeling you have based on nothing whatsoever?
People trying to make money create a market for bitcoin.  Many people adopted bitcoin at first to try to make a profit, and discover just how awesome it is.
By the way, I didn't mean "that's ok" as in "that's legal", but rather "that's not hurting bitcoin's long term adoption rate".

Just like there are no *intrinsic* consumer protections with cash.


Me too.  I just think it's time for the online cash option.  We have in person cash options (that aren't really traceable or trackable, that have instant confirmation and where possession is the only form of confirmation), but until bitcoin there wasn't anything remotely like bitcoin.  Now, although it's (kind of) trackable and traceable, confirmation is (relatively) instant and possession is 10/10ths of the law.  That doesn't imply that these characteristics are always desirable.  What it does mean is that in situations where these characteristics ARE desirable, we now have an option, where before, there was none.

Um... p2pool?  And even if not, so what?  Pools can be changed at whim.  


No, they don't "distribute" profitable hardware, the "sell" profitable hardware for quick turn around, no requirement for maintenance (system administration and manufacturing are two separate industries the last time I checked) and return customers.


That's speculation.  Specialization is what makes humans great, and long term business understands that.  Selling chips and running hardware are two very different industries.  Companies that don't understand that may surge ahead for a short while, but will be overtaken by other companies that specialize.


Absolutely, which is why decentralized methodologies like bitcoin make so much sense.  Notice he's referring to "public policy".  Politics doesn't have to make economical sense as long as it pleases constituents.


Better a technocracy than a Corporatocracy IMO.  Also, invoking the phrase "military industrial complex" should be followed by the observation that the military industrial complex is funded by the very power bitcoin seeks to remove and it is further required to maintain the hegemony of the USD, which bitcoin may challenge in the future.

The only reason I see this as being anything close to true is that day traders don't make up the largest percentage of gold owners.  I watch gold swing on the news all the time, albeit not as much as bitcoin, but bitcoin's market depth is small.


This is by design; the idea is that large amounts of hashpower make the network secure.  You'll never come up with a proof-of-work algorithm that doesn't suffer from what you refer to as "centralization"; eventually if there is any economic incentive to mine, people will figure out how to capitalize on it and people with deep pockets will be able to achieve much larger results than people at home on their computer.  There is no way around this except proof-of-stake, which then means that the people who hold the most make the decisions, which is just as "centralized".  It's not "centralized" as many people sensationally refer to it, it's "specialized".  Anyone can mine, you don't need to be a data center to do it, but if you invest time and money, you deserve rewards.  These people are doing you a service by making the network more secure.


How is this any different from a Pre-IPO company making it big?  How come no one refers to Facebook as a bubble even though Mark Zuckerberg maintains such a high stake in Facebook?  


Sorry, but the myth that a deflationary currency shuts down economies only holds true of government controlled money, and even then there's a lot of debate around the topic, despite what your econ 101 book says.  Bitcoin is an alternative like gold, and gold is deflationary, but gold doesn't cause economies to grind to a halt because it exists.  The concept that bitcoin will one day become *the only* currency is ludicrous; governments will never give up their power of currency.  Additionally, bitcoin is *already* a viable global currency.  We're watching adoption take place right now.

In a court of law, if you gave a pound of gold for services, and gold's value fluctuated vs the dollar equivalent, a judge will order you to pay in USD based on the USD value of the service.  When they say "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and *private*", they mean that if you take a breach of contract to a court of law, they'll use USD to settle, because it's the only one with the legal status to be awarded in the absence of the actual good.
IANAL but some simple Googling will show you that there is a lot of precedence for awarding USD value for services not rendered, regardless of the payment method.
What if I agreed to pay you in sandwiches and then you didn't perform your service?  How would I pay you those sandwiches back?  What if a rampaging virus killed all the wheat in the world and all of a sudden wheat was $10,000 a pound?  Do you honestly think the judge would make you pay me back in sandwiches?  Of course not, he'll determine the fair market value in USD for the services rendered and that'll be his judgement against you.

So if a tool can be used equally by multiple sides, then maybe it shouldn't be considered to lean politically in any particular direction.  However, bitcoin can't be used to *support* current monetary (and by extension political) policy, so it most definitely leans in a particular direction.
 &gt; They're tools, embodied with political ideals by the people that use them, if the opposite were the case then fiat would have converted anarcho-captalists believers to the statist viewpoint eons ago.
Fiat drives anarcho-capitalists away since it leans towards granting more power to traditional governing systems.  Bitcoin leans towards removing power from traditional governing systems.  That's what *lean* means.


Which supports the idea that they don't lean one way or another politically.  


Capitalism is an economic position.  Communist is a political position.  Hence the need for the distinction *anarcho* in anarcho-capitalism; many political ideologies can incorporate capitalism.  That doesn't change the fact that capitalism leans toward democracy because it gives the people choice in what is manufactured based on the use of their dollar.  So this economic position is *democratic* leaning, which is why your example is a peculiar one, because dictators traditionally don't grant this kind of democratic freedom to their people.  It does go to show that even though an economic tool leans a certain way politically, it doesn't *have* to be. 
Would you get this upset if linked to even though is an economic position and not a political one?


No, but democrats would lose more spending power if they did, so while the gold doesn't corrupt the democrat, the democrat rejects the gold as a monetary system.


Where did you get the idea that leaning towards an ideology is the same as converting people to said ideology?  It doesn't have to "convert" to lean a certain direction.


That's a cop-out.  Because some ideas can be twisted doesn't imply that this idea is twisted.


It may be.  Which is why you don't have to sign a libertarian oath to create a wallet.  Kind of the whole "voluntary association" thing in action.


Agreed.  Not sure how this applies to linking to subs that support the idea of a completely voluntary way to exchange value though.  Remember, the subscribers to these ideologies were a large part of why bitcoin is growing in popularity.  Linking to them is just showing the connection, it's not necessarily trying to change a political environment.  


Not libertarian "only", but very libertarian oriented, and appealing to those modes of thought specifically because they believe in "freedom to pursue whatever" we desire, instead of being told that we can't simply because the government says so.
Say what you like, but there's a connection there, and it's not going away.  This "freedom" movement is strongly embodied in both bitcoin and libertarianism.

But this doesn't happen to every individual at the same time.  At some point people will trade even an appreciating currency for luxury items.  It's like when people cash out their IRA or 401K, even though it's making 8% returns.  Eventually people want to trade their value for something that they enjoy.


Massive bubbles and crashes do this to an economy too, and it can be argued that a currency constantly *depreciating* exacerbates this issue as people are constantly looking for the next vehicle to keep their value from disappearing.


Most companies give raises every year to offset the cost of inflation.  If you aren't beating inflation with your raises you are losing money.  Keeping the bitcoin amount frozen means you get a built in raise every year.  


To that I can agree.  Bitcoin discourages leveraging debt.  Which is why I also agree that bitcoin shouldn't replace all currencies.  


It depends on the level of deflation.  A small 1 or 2% deflation wouldn't necessarily create this doom and gloom you speak of.  


Can you show me examples of tightly controlled deflation being an economic nightmare?  Using this argument, you could say that inflation is a nightmare, economically speaking, because of the Wiemar republic or 2008.  The great depression had a lot of problems going for it, including *easy credit*.  Deflation wasn't the big reason for the great depression.

That's not how humans work.  Obviously they'd want to remain "unbiased" in theory, but in actuality there'd be all kinds of under the table dealings.  


And that's part of the problem.  Who are they accountable to?  In an ancap society, they've no requirement to expose anything.  And how about collusion?  You don't think courts would work together to maximize profits?


It's not that simple.  Look at arbitrage today; when you sign a contract, the drafter has already decided upon an arbiter.  You're using a court that the large companies go to routinely.  Who's business do you think the private arbitration companies care more about?  Yours or the big company?

You own a token of value.  That's it.  It's like at a casino; what exactly do you OWN when you have chips?  Small plastic discs?  Those are worthless.  Too small to be a coaster.  Maybe they could prop up a wobbly table?  The value in the poker chips is not based on their *intrinsic* properties (small, lightweight, round, ridged edges), but their *representative* properties.  The poker chips have value because you have a reasonable expectation that the casino will give you dollars in return for them.  
Dollars work the same way.  The paper isn't valuable because of it's *intrinsic* properties, but because you have a reasonable expectation that other people will take them.  So when you own a dollar all you *really* own is a bit of colored paper, which, without the expectation of exchange, is worthless.  
Bitcoin takes this one step further, and recognizes that in this digital age, we don't need a *physical* token to represent value.  If we can assure that a digital token can't be endlessly copied, then we can use that in place of a physical token.  So that's bitcoins; digital tokens that represent value.
Now, the dollar admittedly has an advantage over bitcoin in that a large powerful entity requires their use to pay taxes, which generates demand.  Bitcoin is a voluntary system, and as such has no artificial demand built in.  This makes it amazing to me that bitcoin has achieved what it has, because all the demand for bitcoin is genuine.  There's no coercion involved.
TL;DR bitcoins are tokens that represent value.

$1000 in the box or $1000 (2.6 oz) of gold in the box in 1982:
Cash: $1000
Gold: $3316
No need to adjust for inflation in this scenario.  Either you now have $1000 or now you have $3000.

To me, bitcoin has already "made" it.  Regular front page news articles, large merchants that accept it.  I feel content here, because now we have options.  The value is less important to me than the technology and the freedom of choice bitcoin brings to the world.


Not true; beanie babies are well crafted kids' toys that are still sold today.  The speculative mania surrounding them assumed that the value would go up forever, but that's not "value", that's "speculation" (assumption of a change in value in the future)


It does; I'm reacting to it happening to me specifically.


Is there a problem with that?  Why do dogecoiners get mad when someone sincerely doesn't want to be surrounded by "MUCH WOW" all the time?  Regardless of whether or not the meme makes the currency, the currency is surrounded by the meme and I dislike it.  I also dislike 5% inflation.  I also think it's a passing fad.  Why is that a problem?

Cash is king because it is the most irrevocable way to pay for anything.  Merchants would prefer cash over credit and some even offer incentives to convince you to use cash over plastic.  Your personal experience is anecdotal, but I did mention credit cards because they have a massive infrastructure and the network effect.  They also have fifty years of precedent and public awareness.  They also have built in escrow.  Until bitcoin has these things, cash and plastic will always trump in POS situations.

Let's flip this over. 
Inflation incentivizes asset bubbles and forces people to immediately convert their earnings to some other asset, forcing them to either become specialists in investing or trust third parties.  If your dollars are worth less tomorrow than today, the only way to preserve your wealth is to take risk.  This causes things like real estate or PMs to experience bubbles as people frantically try to convert their dollars into assets that aren't leaking value.
Deflation incentivizes saving.  This allocates capital to the future where it can be best spent for the needs/desires of the holder.  In addition, companies will also have demand for the deflating currency, so they continually have to innovate to convince people to part with their deflating currency.  This forces companies to create more durable goods, as opposed to an inflating currency, which forces companies to make goods that are fragile and require constant replacement.
There are pros and cons for both.  A well-known, small amount of deflation is just as easily accounted for as a well-known, small amount of inflation.  It's *volatility* that really hurts economies, whether it be high amounts of inflation OR deflation.

All these points describe a situation where a *single actor* gains **full** control of 51% of the network, which is indeed a doomsday scenario for bitcoin.  However, many of these attacks take time to execute (6 confirmations still have to be mined at current difficulty levels, which can take longer than an hour in some cases), and require the full 51% for the entire time + reasonable luck.  
Also, a pool executing these attacks wouldn't get very many chances, since miners are long bitcoin and will leave in droves as soon as any kind of attack that threatens bitcoin's image will hurt their bottom line.  The concept that a *pool* can take 51% and turn it into 100% just doesn't hold water.

I don't believe that we should be trying to get people to "switch".  Both can work side by side.


Bitcoin is more than wire transfers.  It's *programmable money*.  It's *artificial scarcity* in a realm (the internet) where scarcity could previously not be created without a central third party.  There are A LOT of ways this can be utilized besides just wire transfers and buying coffee.


Except it has weight in sufficient amounts, is difficult to secure, difficult to move successfully over long distances in large quantities, and can't be moved using an algorithm.


Yes, I personally believe in person transactions are easier and quicker with cash.  I fully advocate using the best tool for the job, and bitcoin isn't always it.


Also true.  I attribute a lot of that to uncertainty in regulation, application and use.  As bitcoin develops more history, deeper markets and hedging tools, we should see some added stability.  Again though, you're right.  If volatility affects its use case, then it may not be the best tool for the job at the moment.

Which varies according to who you buy it from and when.  Hence the distinction.  New mining technology is almost ALWAYS extremely overpriced.  The hardware comes down in price as difficulty goes up, causing the price and ROI to converge.


And if you buy the new stuff, you invariably pay a higher cost in terms of your return, since people are demanding the new stuff.  If you are patient and wait a bit, the hardware's price drops, since manufacturers need to move it to free up space for the new stuff.


Except to people mining.

But the whole concept is to reduce the central authority's authority.  They can't prevent people from transacting in bitcoin.


While I'm not familiar with Operation Barbarossa and the history behind it, a quick read through Wikipedia's entry shows that the Soviet Union was by no means in a "sorry state" when Operation Barbarossa started:


In addition, I think your description is an oversimplification, but I don't have the knowledge or the desire to do any definitive research on the topic.  Suffice it to say, you're making a comparison that doesn't hold up.  Even if what you say is an accurate representation, the difference is one of pure military might vs pure economics.  Big governments have an incentive to fight war, but not individuals.  This is in contrast to mining, when any individual has an incentive to try and grab a piece of the pie.


This is a simple algorithm, with chip specs that have already been given to them.  Simplifying and shrinking is a straightforward (if expensive and time consuming) process.  It's not "rocket science".


One core developer isn't everyone.  This core developer may be good at c code, but that doesn't make him an economist.


IMO the bitcoin foundation is a joke.


A real 51% attack would indeed be a problem.  A pool having 51% is much different from a risk analysis perspective, because an attack would instantly cause the price to plummet, which directly incentivizes miners to police their pool.


Big talk from a guy who admittedly just started researching the topic.


I guess I'll have to take your word for it. 


Uh... ok.
Look, I'll bullet why I think bitcoin is a good investment, and you can take it or leave it.  My weekend is too valuable to me to do this the whole time, so I'll resume on Monday if you're still here.
* No central authority
That's it.  It doesn't allow people to control who can or cannot transact (barring a **true** 51% attack), it doesn't open/close, it doesn't care about national boundaries, or political whims, or any of those things.
I believe a 51% attack isn't feasible at this point because of the amount of power required to take it over and the amount of political turmoil attacking it would cause for the countries that may be interested in controlling it.  Banks can manipulate the market, so there's no need to control the protocol at the base level.  If they were interested in controlling the underlying commodity, they'd be heavily invested in gold mining, and not just controlling the market through derivatives.  
So I think bitcoin's future is bright (although not yet assured).  I feel like a true 51% attack isn't feasible at this point; not because it's impossible for a large entity to take it over, but because it's not beneficial to do so.  Much better to just control the market and let the protocol move forward as designed.

Who we?  Banks aren't even involved yet.  That's a problem for them to figure out if they wish to leverage BTC for credit.  But saying it's impossible is silly.  Also, postulating that BTC is a replacement for fiat is equally silly.  No need for credit in BTC when fiat's credit is still available.  Plus, BTC is pretty volatile right now, and anyone loaning in BTC is taking a bigger risk than loaning in fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:10:49
described it in great detail just below.  Maybe I can make it clearer.
Transactions get permanently written to the network by being included in a block.  When you "mine", you are trying to create a block, because every block creator gets 25btc and the fees for any transactions they put in the block (because mining is hard, so they get paid for it).
So.  You mine a coin (by making a block).  You trade the coin to Bob.  That transaction (from you to Bob) gets put in *another* block that someone else made.  They get the fee you included.  Bob sends the coin to Cindy.  That transaction (Bob to Cindy) gets put into a *third* block.  Whoever made the *third* block gets the fee Bob paid to send money to Cindy.
So when you pay a fee, you're paying a fee to the miner to put your transaction in his block.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:59:06
That's exactly right; but when they do that they are adding risk into the equation.  Over time, assuming the network stayed at the same speed, the attacker *should* see higher results overall than direct mining.  But it raises the risk for an individual block, and for an industry where risk is everywhere, adding more risk is, well, risky.

The trustless part of bitcoin is only trustless insofar as the record of the transaction is concerned.  You still need to trust that the merchant will send you their goods.  


It seems to me that this feature has been way oversold.  I don't regularly do business with people I don't trust, and so don't regularly need a chargeback feature.  T-Mobile, Walmart, Lowes, Kroger, Sonic, Burger King, McDonalds, Amazon, Newegg, Dominos, Shell, Dairy Queen, General Dollar, Whole Foods, Target, Cinemark, Chick-Fil-A, et all are legitimate and I've never had to get a third party involved to handle any dispute with any of these businesses, and I've had disputes with every single one (order was wrong, product was broken, never received, etc). 


This could be said of cash as well, yet it's used widely every day.  So?  


And about time there was this option.  "Hey, we'll take the payment risk, or you can for x%".  Now that's viable.




I disagree.  It adds the ability to easily transact over long distances peer to peer, which before bitcoin required paypal or western union, who took a much larger chunk than the tiny transaction fee that bitcoin costs.  It transcends borders, removing friction from international trade, and it *can* be safely stored outside of a bank if you take the proper precautions.

Digital cash; before bitcoin, someone could say they were issuing digital currency, but either users could ctrl+c/ctrl+v the digital currency (making it useless), or you had to rely on a company or trusted third party to verify transactions (like credit card companies or paypal).  You don't need someone to verify a cash purchase; just you and the seller.  Bitcoin enables that kind of transaction (buyer and seller, with no middleman) in the digital space.

Bitcoin is supposed to be about not trusting people.  If we have to trust that people will bend to social pressure, then that kind of eliminates the "trustless" aspect of it.  If it all boils down to social pressure then bitcoin's future is probably not too bright.


I'm holding out hope that other pool operators will see the potential profits from copying ghash's methods of operation and we'll see competition level things out before ghash goes rogue (taken over by a government or purchased outright by a bank).  It's kind of a wait and see situation.

Debit and credit cards are complicated escrow features built on top of cash.  These services can be mimicked with bitcoin.  But, until bitcoin, there was no digital "cash" option.  Now there is.  That's pretty cool.  It doesn't mean that people suddenly stop wanting complicated escrow that provides them with chargebacks.  


Cards are third parties that facilitate value transfer.  Sometimes that's good, sometimes it's not.  Bitcoin is not a good comparison to CC's.  Bitcoin is the internet equivalent of cash.

Yes, point to those observations please.


Depends on who's presenting the argument and in what context.


Look at your sources.  That's another important lesson to learn.  Because the internet gives anyone the ability to speak, you need to examine who is saying these things.  
The studies you linked to *have been refuted* by new studies.  Again, welcome to the "learning" process (otherwise known as "science").


The statistics?  Why yes, I have viewed them.


Of course not; I rely on my doctor for that.  *Gasp*.  As I said before, I have no problem with belief dictating action.  I have *faith* in my doctor.  However, the difference here is that he has *evidence* to back it up.  He doesn't hand waive and say "No one can know the mind of God".  I'm still waiting for your evidence that indicates the presence of a magical, all knowing, immortal being that doesn't rely on an assumption based on nothing whatsoever.


I believe some alternate medicine is viable, although since there haven't been extensive scientific studies on many of them I'm hesitant to try them unless under supervision of a *trusted* doctor.


You'd be surprised how much truth there is to conspiracy theories out there.


Nope, don't have any reason to believe that this is a thing.  I've seen "scientific" studies on these and they're bogus.  The real scientific studies have been completely inconclusive, since we can't actually study what happens after we die.  Also, I have no real concern about the validity of paranormal activity either way, so I don't feel the need to research it.


I'm willing to do this; that's not a problem.  The difference between what you are suggesting and what I am saying is you seem to think I'm "incapable" of accepting things I don't know for 100% fact or that I can't personally prove.  I never said that.  All I said was that there is no formal evidence for the existence of God, and that attempting to use logic to deduce his existence is an exercise in futility that will eventually lead you to an assumption with no basis or no evidence to back it up.
Vaccines are a valid discussion, and not one that I take lightly.  I've spoken with my doctor about it, and done some preliminary research, and every bit of "proof" I've discovered that vaccines cause autism has been refuted.  
Honestly, I think your inflating this discussion much further than it has to go.
If you have a solid piece of evidence that conclusively points to the presence of God, then present it.
Otherwise, you have to accept that a belief in God cannot rest on logical thought.  There comes a time in the process by which you determine your beliefs that you have to say "I accept this knowing there is no way to prove its validity".  This requires you to suspend the logical (the formal definition, not your "air quotes" version) process and simply accept at face value.  If you can't admit this to me, then just respond with "I am done" and let's be done.  You're not proving anything and you're making yourself look silly.

It's a tool, true.  But using the tool increases its value, and the tool was built with a primary purpose; to take freedom of banking back from the bankers.  That's why the genesis block has references to the 2009 bank bailouts.
One of the main arguments against bitcoin is that anyone can participate (aka terrorists, drug salesmen and child-porn distributors).  Libertarians believe in voluntary association.  Bitcoin does not coerce you to use it, nor does it prevent anyone from using it.  That's an idea that is fundamental to the libertarian political perspective.  
Bitcoin has no opinion, but by using it, you are adding value to the network, and thus are furthering the libertarian cause regardless of whether or not you agree with it.

But, unlike the 1930's, these are *exchanges* and not banks.  Most of them *should* be operating with 100% of their funds.  Banks *legally* take the risk of operating on fractional reserve.  AFAIK exchanges are not legally allowed to do so.  


Why does MtGox closing imply that they don't have the private keys to their coins?  Or that scammers didn't get the coins before MtGox found out?


Trades pay fees.  Guaranteed that exchanges aren't holding their assets completely in bitcoin, in part because half of their fees are a percentage of the government currencies being traded for btc.
I don't see other exchanges being taken down by this.  As soon as MtGox closes up shop or re-opens, we should see trading volume accelerate elsewhere.  Yea, shit happens, but shit's happened before, and that didn't stop the rise to $1200.  We're still $350 higher than the peak of the last bubble.

I don't disagree, and didn't mean to imply that it was easy...


I think you underestimate how much some people want other people to do things.  Force is used quite often, and most of the people leveraging it have no real interest in bettering society.  That's where I think the disconnect happens; assuming the people with a monopoly on force are genuinely trying to make society a better place, and not simply in it for their own monetary gain.


Bitcoin is a real alternative to banking, so it's a start, and yes I am saying "it'd be nicer if we had better systems".  I'm also saying "our current system is immoral" in the hopes that if enough people agree with me, we can make changes that don't require an entirely new system.  We can also work in the current one to push it in the right direction.  My reddit posts are not the total sum of my efforts.


Let me spell it out clearly, because you seem to be making a few assumptions here.  1) It is ideologically better to move away from public provisions because our current methodology uses immoral tactics to implement them , but 2) it's also best, because public provisions generally suffer from a host of inefficiencies.  Many of the resources that exist in the public domain suffer from the tragedy of the commons, and with more private ownership and fewer social programs, it's easier to account for externalities that plague our current system.

Yes, but every loss on head to head is an immediate loss.  Those immediate losses are erased in the long run, but that risk is real.
Additionally, they have to *maintain* 34% for a period of time.  Also, the rest of the network must also not be selfish mining.
I agree that it's more profitable overall, but every head to head is an immediate loss, which is risk.  


Sure, but how many blocks can they afford to go with straight 1-block leads being lost?  What if they hit a bad streak?  How long can 34% of the network go without a reward?
A concerted attacker who individually owned 34% of the network can rationalize and pull this attack.  But a *pool operator*, especially with *getblocktemplate* but even without, risks losing his miners as they go looking for another miner with a hot streak.
Individual miners are short-sighted.  They go where the immediate profit is.  There is a risk in hitting a bad streak and losing miners.
Again, let me re-iterate.  I'm not attempting to say the statistics are wrong.  I'm simply saying that the risk of losing a large streak is real, which discourages individual miners from participating in the pool, and is a disincentive for pool operators to try and selfish mine.

Ask the people in Africa where China is now exporting labor whether or not they prefer 20 years ago where no one gave a flying fuck about them to now where people are actively trying to figure out how to give them money to do menial labor.

Cash has an unlimited supply, so holding really does nobody any good (except the guy holding,  he keeps value for when he needs it).  But holding commodities with known quantities helps all others who hold that commodity, because it sends a signal to the market that the holder feels that the price is too low. 
If the value begins to drop, many people liquidate to avoid more losses.  If the value rises, people hold in anticipation of higher values.

You can build reversible payments on top of a non-reversible system.  You can't build a non-reversible payment on top of a reversible system.
Bitcoin is the cash of the internet.  The realization of this concept is truly unprecedented.  Comparing the two is fair enough, but only as long as bitcoin's youth as a system is taken into consideration.  So in hindsight, I guess your question is a fair one.  Once bitcoin starts demonstrating services that mimic this safety net, adoption should increase.

Without a threshold the word "evidence" is meaningless.  Literally any claim about *anything* is evidence by your definition.  Which means there is evidence for Cthulu, Terminator, Spiderman and any other characters from fictional lore.  That's a preposterous definition to use when discussing evidence.  Watch this:
I am God.
Now there is Bayesian evidence that i am God.  


And when we get to the question "How do you *know* God exists", they have no choice but to say "We don't" or "I just do".  I've done it with more than a few priests.  Every apologist starts from an assumption that cannot be tested.




This question has a lot of answers, but generally the behavior of society is a good indicator of consensus.


It's not "only believe in things that can be proven".  It's "only accept things that are independently verifiable, that have people who have independently verified it".  There's a difference here.  Verifiable test results may *still* be wrong, since things could have influenced the tests in a way you aren't aware of.  So an addendum would be "Also, be open to the idea that the evidence is wrong."  I accept things based on evidence.  If new evidence discredits things I have previously accepted, I will amend my belief system to incorporate new evidence.


You are correct; previous statement regarding vagueness retracted.


Meaning they have doubt.  Having doubt is against the doctrine.
James 1:6


Mark 16:16


Hebrew 11:1


John 20:27 


It's *in their rule book*.


I did not say that I reserve judgment.  I simply said if YOU said that, then you would be using logic, since there is no way to prove it, so it is wise to reserve judgment.
I have *not* reserved judgment.  I operate on the assumption (as I believe I have made abundantly clear) that if verifiable tests have shown something to be true, and those verifiable tests have been independently verified and shown to be correct, I accept that data.  If there is *no way to test* a position, then I reject the position as a baseless assumption.
How else can I explain this to you?  If there exists no test that can prove/disprove an axiom (regardless of whether this axiom *has been proven* or not), then I automatically assume it is false.  If there *does* exist a test that can prove/disprove an axiom, then I rely on a number of methods to determine where my belief system lies.
My sole point, this entire time, is that if you accept an axiom that is unprovable, you are not using logic or evidence to form your opinion.  Further, believing in God (not just being open to the fact that he lives, but being *convicted* of this belief) requires that you accept an axiom that is unprovable.  Therefore, those who are convinced that God exists are not using logic or evidence to arrive at this conclusion, because evidence does not exist (and not your bullshit Beyesian definition of evidence, which basically encompasses any claim ever about anything), and logic requires that an axiom be provable.

There's no reason to increase the cap.  The need to print more money comes (in part) from a finitely divisible currency.  You can only split a dollar into so many pieces.  So eventually, when there's not enough to go around, you need more to keep the economy going.  This isn't the case with bitcoin.  Since it's basically infinitely divisible, when we need more, we just alter the protocol to accept smaller divisions.  Scarcity is bitcoin's biggest feature.  It's an amazing achievement to have a digital good that can only have a finite supply.  What other digital good has this feature without a central third party certifying it is so?  Removing this feature takes away the thing that IMO makes bitcoin so amazing as a technology.

Due to an arbitrarily set block size limit that can and probably will change (with debatable ramifications to fee size).


And you're greatly overestimating how impatient people are to buy their car right away.  Most car purchase transactions take hours over time.  That's more than enough time to be confident of a transaction.  My car dealer even took a check, which could have bounced.  They evidently weren't too concerned I was going to abscond with the car, considering they had my social security number, credit history, proof of address, proof of employment, and a copy of my driver's license.


Only if you don't take precautions, and only while this space is maturing.  I agree that safety issues are still a major concern, but don't act like these issues are insurmountable.  Once hardware wallets start competing for business, you'll see security go way up very quickly.


Lite clients exist for bitcoin, so bitcoin isn't asking users to download and maintain gigs of data if they don't want to.  Additionally this is another problem with a solution, when it becomes a problem.

If gox lost the keys gox lost the coins.  Balances are not coins.  Additionally, those funds are Gox funds, not customer funds.  Customers bought gox bux and gox coins when they deposited.  Gox promised to pay them back, and now they can't.  
Edit also, we are both neglecting that this technically isn't feasible.  The coins can't be transferred because no one has the private keys to generate the transaction.  Plus, the last transaction can only be reversed by rolling back to when it took place three years ago.  How do you imagine this is even technically possible?

Two possibilities.  One; money now is worth more than money later.
Two; there are business models built on selling a product, and there are business models built on running the product.  It's kind of like why hard drive companies don't just sell datacenter cloud storage.  Western Digital doesn't want to make money guaranteeing uptime and dealing with cooling and security and all that jazz.  Same thing here.  Admittedly, there ARE companies that mine until the products aren't profitable for them, at which point they sell.  But there is a scenario where people will sell products that themselves will eventually make money.

The booms and busts are inherent in nature.  Humans aren't perfect, and so can over/under predict market demands.  Nature can destroy crops, or withhold water.

If the block size gets bigger than the network can handle (even in a linear fashion), then what happens in your scenario?
Linear does not mean equal.  If the slope of one line increases faster than the slope of another line, the delta between the two lines increases.  That's a problem for block size vs network growth, regardless of the complexity of that growth.

Honestly, if a portion of your market has a commodity with value they wish to pay with, and it is legal to do so, and accepting it is frictionless, and payment processors (coinbase and bitpay) will convert it instantly into your preferred currency, then what's the down side?  Using bitcoin as a payment network is a no-brainer.
Obviously, it depends on your business model.  I don't think bitcoin is a very brick-and-mortar friendly currency at the moment.  But anything online would benefit from bitcoin because it A) reduces fraud to almost nil B) opens up new markets where people may not be able to easily obtain your local currency and C) costs less to accept than Visa/Mastercard.

That's how it works now in regular mining, but I thought the whole problem with the selfish mining was that they would be invalidating work more often.  If people are also invalidating their work *sometimes* using selfish mining (which I assume would happen with the same statistical probability as mining honestly), they would invalidate some of the highest hashpower miner's work, which would offset the gains they get from selfish mining.
The way I understand it is that selfish mining doesn't give the miner an advantage *per se* (since there's still a likelihood they won't find a longer chain faster due to statistics), but instead hurts other miners by invalidating their work.  If other people were doing it back, wouldn't that offset the selfish miners' advantage by hurting them too?  So everyone is hurting each other with the same statistical probability as honest mining, thereby cancelling out the perceived benefit.

Network effect.  Not a property of the dollar itself, but rather how many people use it.  If bitcoin were used more widely, it would have this same effect.  This effect is not unique to the dollar.


That is a good point; but given that the USD has represented the world's largest economy for centuries, its not surprising.  Additionally, it has human beings pulling at the levers to keep its value stable.  Some people are distrustful of those humans and would rather the value fluctuate honestly.  This is probably the biggest difference that affects adoption IMO.


Insurance can be provided on any asset; this isn't unique to the dollar.  This and escrow for any asset protect the consumer and the seller.  Disagreements happen and shit goes down.  Most want these assurances for any asset.


Again, not unique to the dollar.  This is an effect of  above, so I would consider it the same point.


This is definitely a good point.  Of course, this is again not because of some property of the dollar, but the government's decree.  They could decree tomorrow that you have to pay your taxes in dog shit, and the demand for dog shit would rise exponentially.  


Another government decree.  Dog shit, as above.


Network effect, above.


Network effect, above.


Insurance/escrow, above.
So we can really boil your nine points down to 
* Network effect
* Volatility
* Lack of Insurance/Escrow
* Government Decree
Bitcoin's network effect is growing.   Lack of insurance/Escrow is indeed *currently* a problem, and your point is valid.  This shows to me a glaring hole in the bitcoin market just asking to be filled by VC and entrepreneurs.  It's not a protocol issue.  I'm confident based on the increasing amount of investment that this is on the horizon.  Once that issue is remedied by enterprising individuals, adoption will increase, which will increase the network effect.  
That leaves us with volatility and government decree.  Volatility will always be a little bit of a problem, but as adoption increases and shorts are available, this can be mitigated, which will leave us with only government decree.  Obviously, bitcoin will never have government decree, which is why I don't foresee USD being *replaced* by bitcoin.  But the rest of your points seem on track to be addressed in the very near future, and when that happens, I foresee an incredible rise in the value of bitcoin.
I liked your post though, it highlighted a lot of people's concerns.  The whole "get rich scheme" comment seemed a little snarky, but I'll overlook it.  Here's $.25 for significantly adding to the discussion. @_date: 2014-09-26 11:30:07

I'm not sure it works that way, as the malleability issue showed.  I think if you broadcast multiple transactions using the same input, the miners choose which to include and it's basically a toss up.  I'm actually unclear on how this is handled.  Is it the first that a node sees?  Is it the timestamp?  How are these race conditions handled?
@_date: 2014-10-21 02:43:51
A 51% attack means that one actor holds the majority of mining power.  If he decides to mine transactions that fit the criteria he determines to be best, he **gets to**.  A 51% actor becomes a 100% actor because his chain wins.


... never said that.  It's just that not all miners maintain the same black lists.  Only when one miner takes over **all** transactions is a black list bad.  Hence why it's a concern of a **51%** attack.

For everyone reading these comments, you'll probably see my rebuttals a number of times, so here's the synopsis of my response for clarity.
1) Remember that doublespending is the exact problem that internet cash has had since the internet started.  Until bitcoin, there was no way to prevent a double spend, ever.  The blockchain and mining (and by extension, confirmations) IS the answer to the doublespend problem.  The only draw back to the mining process is the length of time it takes to solidify a given transaction.  This problem is the **fundamental** reason the blockchain and mining exists to begin with, so saying that the possibility of a doublespend kills bitcoin is to show exactly how little you understand about the subject.
2) There are already ways to mitigate this problem as a merchant.  The first way is to realize that most people don't actually intend to defraud a merchant, and many brick and mortar places already understand this.  How many sit down restaurants have you ever been to that require payment up front?  How do they handle the dine-and-dash problem?  They recognize that most people are willing to pay their bill for their food.  Secondly, most institutions recognize that credit cards have a 90 day chargeback window.  10 minutes is WAY lower than this.  And finally, for those that want zero confirmation transactions without the risk, there are services, like Bitpay and Coinbase, that already offer to assume this risk for a 1% processing fee (and also offer a host of other services besides).
Everyone please calm down.

It's not designed to be "trustless".  It's designed to move trust from a single third party to a consensus mechanism.  That's a misnomer that's been perpetuated.  You still have trust, it's just trust that the majority of actors will behave.


Obviously the goal is for consensus to be reached with multiple parties.  That's why the incentives are designed to have multiple people participate.  Indeed, the 51% "threat" we recently faced wasn't really a threat at all, because GHASH is a loose consortium of individual miners acting in their own self interest.
If 51% becomes a problem, there's no solution; bitcoin is *dead* and a different mechanism will need to be devised to eliminate the "central third party" problem.

I never said it's value was "innate".  


The value is not innate.  It's value only occurs when the information is *applied*. 


I use them interchangeably because the protocol uses nomenclature (that we refer to as bitcoin) to denote balances in the ledger.


It does...


No it's not, it's a representation of a mark on a ledger.  It becomes up to us to determine what it *actually* represents. 


Nothing has "innate value".  


Because it solves a problem that people value being solved.


Dogecoin is not bitcoin.  The protocol can be reproduced, but the tokens within the protocol cannot.  I can photocopy a dollar bill.  That doesn't mean the dollar bill is reproducible or that people will value it as if it were a dollar bill.


Again, nothing has "innate" value.  Value is subjective.

Miners by definition take a long period of time to recoup their costs.  This has nothing to do with short-term profit over long term profit.


Of course it happens a lot, but the inverse happens often too.  That's why retirement accounts even exist.


You seem to be a little confused as to how mining works.  You don't "get rich now", you have to mine for a period of time to get your money, variance or not.  The variance alone will not greatly affect how long you have to mine in order to recoup your costs.

Bitcoin inverts with relation to USD all the time.  That's not the case with dogecoin


Exchanges will trade anything they can take a percentage of.  I don't see dogecoin growing independently of bitcoin.


But that's from people who didn't understand it's utility.  I understand dogecoin's utility; it's functionally almost identical to bitcoin.  So it brings nothing new to the table (at least as far as I am concerned).


The same can be said for bitcoin.  It's just that once it starts to feel like real money, people start to treat it that way.  Doge is not being treated like real money right now.


That would put another nail in dogecoin's coffin because that's one of the three large arguments; that no one wants to deal in fractions of a coin.


If dogecoin is all of a sudden worth $1 a coin, you'll definitely see tipping slow down in absolute terms and in relative terms.

Almost this entire thread has been about personal opinion, which are all arguing points.  


Well, so COULD any number of other coins on exchanges.  It's the likelihood that I thought we were talking about.


Both of these things that it brings ring hollow for me.  Scale is irrelevant in a system where the units of account can be divided infinitely, and the difficulty of bitcoin is part of what makes it better.  Therefore dogecoin doesn't bring anything new to the table *for me*.


First of all, you can stick a hot poker right up your ass if you are going to be a fucking douche.  If you back away from throwing baseless insults, I'll continue, but if you are going to be an asshole, then you fit RIGHT into the demographic of dogebags I'm talking about in this post and I'll ignore you.
Second of all, do you speak for all or even most dogecoin users?  You are saying that they truly won't change their behavior or size of tips if dogecoin goes up in value?  You're delusional.


Again, you are perfectly fitting the mold of the assholes I'm referring to in my OP.  Thanks for proving my point.


There's already precedent with bitcoin.  So yea, I have plenty of idea.


Oh I see, when I surmise people's reasons for their behavior, I'm a smart ass, but when you do it it's just fact huh?  No, people tip fractions of bitcoin because they want to tip a small amount of value.

While I don't really want to get into this argument *again*, I'll say this anyway.  GHASH is the representative of a loose consortium of miners.  Those miners are all voting with their hashpower.  If GHASH steps over the line, those miners will point their hashpower elsewhere.
This is not the same thing as a single entity physically owning 51% of the hardware.  Decentralized mining still exists, even if a large portion of those decentralized miners decide to let someone else have the reigns for a bit.  Only when one entity gains 51% of the hashpower under their physical control is there a real danger.  And if one entity were to do that, do you think they'd broadcast their IPs so we could track their progress?  Probably not.

I'm making the point here that A, you are assuming it will gain in value (which there is no guarantee of) and B, if you DO owe taxes, it'll be because you gained value, so your taxes don't make bitcoin purchases more expensive, they just lower the rate of discount against the dollar.  If I buy a bitcoin for $100, then bitcoin appreciates 10%, and I buy something worth $110, that means I realized a gain of $10 for nothing.  Giving the government $3 doesn't mean that I spent $113 for something that costs $110, it means I spent $103 for something that costs $110.  So instead of realizing a gain of $10, I *only* realized a gain of $7.
Your point that it makes bitcoin a more expensive option is false.  It means that the discount you would have normally enjoyed is decreased a small amount, so in effect in your scenario the bitcoin purchase is a better option, *even with the tax*.


Right.  But that's what we're trying to do when gaining adoption, is convince people in the US to use another currency besides USD as a currency in the US.  This should tell you all you need to know right there. 


While this may change the percentage of tax, how would this change the burden of accounting?  You'd still have to keep the same books so you can calculate your tax liability.  This tax code you linked just changes the percentages you'd use in your final calculation.  So how would it be effectively different?  That is, how would it change your arguments?
@_date: 2014-06-25 11:33:07
Exactly.  Except over a protocol that isn't controlled by Coinbase, and thus gives you 100% choice over whether you want to have the convenience (and possibly the protection) of a system like master card, or the security and full control (albeit with slower transaction times) of the bitcoin protocol.

Not necessarily.  Maybe *at the moment* you are decreasing demand, but over time those people may abandon said new coins.
Here's a good example; our government burns wheat to increase price.  They personally may not have been hungry, and so wouldn't have consumed it anyway.  It still increases price because it reduces ~~demand~~^edit supply.  If they had instead sold that bitcoin and used the proceeds to purchase the new coins, it would have put downward pressure on the bitcoin market.

I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not, but the truth is, basic necessities don't a successful economy make.  So no, people won't forego basic necessities, but many won't buy more than that.

It's not a company, it's not a stock, it's not something that needs an advertising campaign.  It's a fundamental shift in how people do business.

Well, gold IS a paradigm, but I'm just pointing out the parallels.  Gold has a floor that is much lower than its price.  It experiences boom/bust cycles.  There's a similarity there with bitcoin.


Absolutely it holds up a floor.  Where that floor is, I'm not sure.  But Nasdaq definitely has an "industrial" use for bitcoin.


You're speculating numbers; not all miners have the same cost of electricity.  Electricity is MUCH cheaper in some parts of the world than others.  So yes, a large drop will necessitate that *some* miners leave the playing field, but that doesn't necessarily indicate that they ALL will.  And many will mine through a temporary drop with the expectation of quick rebounds.  The point is that miners will not simultaneously shut off their mining rigs in lock step.


Again, miners who mine professionally will not necessarily shut off immediately following a crash in price.  The hashrate will adjust, but not immediately and not simultaneously.


False analogy.  Your "fuel" is constantly replenishing and dropping out worldwide on a regular basis.  Hashing power is not derived from a single source.  People have LOTS of different incentives and plans for their mining rigs and are not coordinated.  
Additionally, a 90% drop is something that'll most likely rebound as people see opportunity to grab cheap coins.  Whether it's a dead cat bounce or not is irrelevant, because as long as the descent is slower than *immediate*, the difficulty levels will have a chance to adjust.
The truth is, we've seen when mining rewards dropped by *half* at the first reward halving and mining didn't slow down to the degree you're surmising.  We didn't have a four week window, even though the miners' rewards were cut by 50%.  So we've already been through this and the sky didn't fall.

It *should* until it reaches equilibrium, but shocks to the market (governments banning it, large bitcoin based companies getting hit with regulations, etc) can cause swings.


No, I don't think many people will.  But the appreciation we are seeing is not due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin; indeed bitcoin is currently highly *inflationary* with a block reward of ~ 25btc/10 minutes being released.  This is a result of an increase in adoption, and has its own pitfalls.  But people are still selling it on exchanges, which goes against the idea that no one will sell when prices are soaring.


And if value begins to drop, people will decide to sell to capture the current value in dollars, as you pointed out above.  It's self-correcting.  If the liquidity starts to cause the value to drop, people will sell, increasing liquidity.

Bitcoin is *not* safe.  Not in the manner that bank deposits are.  Banks "insure" their deposits.  Unless a catastrophic meltdown happens, (which is possible, even probable at some point, but will affect far more than just your holdings anyway) banks will refund you if they lose your money.
Without a central third party, you are taking on the responsibility for yourself.  It's like opting out of your phone's protection plan and trying to convince people that not paying that protection premium is *safer*.  Of course it's not *safer*.  Bitcoin is better for other reasons, but it's definitely not because its *safe* (at least not in the way Joe Everyman expects).

I disagree.  For longer term transactions, having a sem-stable market cap is what they need.  For short term transactions, volatility isn't a big issue.
In any event, we're not seeing a whole lot of volatility now anyway, so your argument is moot.  Additionally, any commodity (USD included) experiences small fluctuations.  If the market cap isn't moving significantly, this is "stability", regardless of small fluctuations.

Very true.  But if there are more sellers than buyers, then some sellers will end up with no trades, and some will compete to be the next seller to match a buyer.  This creates downward pressure.

In reality, if all roads required tolls, almost everyone would have a car identifier so they could be billed for their usage.  The reason those bottlenecks are so burdensome now is because people don't pay tolls for most of their roads, and so have no need of the SunPass except in rare circumstances.  If tolls proliferated everywhere, I can't see many people *NOT* having them.


My internet traffic jumps through sources not owned by my ISP.  My ISP works out those payments with other companies.  Another example is cell phone towers.  You would most likely have a single billing plan with one company, and would pay "roaming" charges when you switched companies.

No, it comes from people trusting banks.  Fractional reserve isn't a problem.  The problem is banks over-leveraging and then calling on government funds to bail them out when they go belly up.  Without government interference, this system would work as it should.  Banks "create money" out of thin air, as you say, but they take a risk that they won't be paid back by the person who they loaned to.  If that happens, then they have to repossess the house (and usually sell it on the market as a loss in a foreclosure event).  Banks would much rather get paid in dollars than in empty houses.
They create money out of thin fucking air, but it's up to them to reconcile, and if they don't get paid back, that money doesn't magically appear.  At least, that's how it's SUPPOSED to work.  It's only when the government gets involved with bailouts that there's an issue.

Emphasis mine.
Bitcoin was used as a medium of exchange for dollars.  In that sense, it is very much a currency.  The current system can't transmit dollars so quickly and easily and securely.  Exchanging into a faster currency and then exchanging out is better than waiting 2 days for an ACH to clear.  Other options exist (like Paypal and Dwolla), but they have their own drawbacks.
Bitcoin can also be used to directly trade for goods and services.  Just because *this situation* wasn't a perfect example of a currency in action doesn't disqualify bitcoin from being a currency in *all situations*.  That's not a correct extrapolation.

If I could limit the amount of bandwidth that the core could use, without fancy packet shaping or OS level controls, that'd make my node usage go up.  As it is I have to shut it down near the end of the month if I've been using Netflix at all during the month.

No it doesnt.  Fractional reserve is possible with bitcoin too.  All they need is bitcoin certificates (redeemable for bitcoin) and voila.

Capitalism is already doing that.  Individual trade isn't nearly as powerful as global trade in relieving poverty.


Lol people will still be poor, and people will still steal stuff.  This is quite ludicrous to believe *bitcoin* can solve this in any way.


The blockchain doesn't record fraud, only transactions.   And addresses aren't tied to identity.  Plys, there's always another sucker.


You still need an oracle, and as such an oracle and one of the parties can collude.  You can't honestly believe that bitcoin is some kind of magic pill that makes fraud just vanish.


No, you just offer discounts for direct trade.  Tada, smart contracts nullified for gullible users.  Reputation systems are frequently gamed, and since there's no id involved,  new fronts can be used when the current one's reputation is tarnished.

Does anyone else notice the inherent contradiction here?  They say that currency only is used *nationally* because of government, and internationally because they are used in a large economic area.  This implies that bitcoin cannot be used internationally because it is not accepted in a large economic area.  However, if a currency is used *internationally* already, then we skip the need for a government to declare it legal tender.  Bitcoin is already used in a large economic area (the internet), so it has no need to be "bootstrapped" into international use by a superpower.

Baseless claims are baseless.  There is no objective evidence that indicates the presence of God.  If there is, please show me.


I make a claim that cannot be corroborated.  Therefore it must be true.  This is not a *strawman*, this is an *analogy*.  There is a difference.


Yea, and there are a lot of people who spend that time and effort to do so.


Or you could reserve judgment in the absence of evidence, no?  Before Edward Snowden, a lot of people were *convinced* that our government would never collect so much personal data in a manner clearly against the intent of the constitution.  But here we are, right?


What if they provided concrete studies that showed that vaccines WERE dangerous, and that the doctors were missing something?  Now obviously, that hasn't happened, but if it did, would you change your tune?  If not, then you are mired in dogma.


And its your right to do so.  But you can't objectively claim that something is fact unless you've got evidence to back it up.  There *is* evidence to back up the claim that vaccines are far more helpful than hurtful, in the statistics. 
These are *reproducible* studies.  In fact, studies are invalidated all the time.  That's also called *learning*.

It says that the only requirement to be saved is faith.  Well, how do you have faith if you have proof?  Faith can only exist in the absence of proof.  If God provided proof, faith would not be necessary to believe. 


If it can be logically deduced (read; proven), then faith becomes unnecessary.  So yes, I do say that you have to reject logic at some fundamental level to have faith in something that has no proof.


You can't accept the Christian doctrine without accepting that faith is required.  It's in the fucking rule book man.  Do you need me to cite my sources again?


What?  No.  I can say Christianity means something, and reject its truthfulness.  


That's exactly what I'm doing...


They are *not* using logic all the way down.  Somewhere, their logic relies on an assumption that cannot be proven.  I thought we made that clear.  Therefore, in order for their belief system to continue to exist, it requires an unprovable assumption.  Assumptions are the antithesis of proof.  Therefore you can't use *their* logic to prove anything.  Therefore it requires a belief without proof, which is... drum roll... faith.


It doesn't matter *how they interpret it*.  Regardless of their *claims* to logic, they have fundamental gaps that require *faith*.  What is it that you don't get about that statement?

But that's a semantic argument that doesn't really serve anyone well in a debate of this nature.


No; government provides a regulatory structure to protect businesses.  Businesses by and large *want* this regulatory structure, as it provides them with protections that the government affords them.  While we can discuss/debate whether the government protections are the *most efficient* or serve the *best outcome*, no informed person denies that the government actually provides something.  My stance is that they don't do it as well as private industry, but they most definitely create lots of things.

It may not be applicable to all innovation, but considering that most of the foundries for making chips are located there, I'd be willing to bet that their copycat abilities as far as chip manufacturing are at least good enough to provide some pretty powerful hashing power to interested buyers.


Ghash is a pool.  Most of their cloud hashing clientele are stupid people who can't do math, and they'll be shaken out as they don't make back their investment.  The rest are independent miners, who (I'm assuming) will leave the pool if they begin to actually do immediate damage to the network, and hence it's not as much a concern as if a single actor actually had complete control of 51% of the hashpower.

I'd like to believe that's possible, but I think justice is one of the few human concepts that shouldn't be influenced by money.  
Either way, the original point was that you were arguing that we'll have less and less for people to do and more and more unemployed over time.  That original thesis IMO is wrong and only focuses on first world countries and their issues with the labor force.  If we look at third world countries, wages are rising and standards of living are improving all over the place.  I'd argue that the hollowing out of the lower class in the US is a direct result of globalization.  We're competing on a world stage where people will work for pennies a day.  How can our bottom rungs compete with that @ $10 an hour?  It just doesn't seem possible.  But that doesn't mean we're "running out" of jobs, just that they are being displaced.

There are ways to detect selfish mining with a reasonable degree of success.  If pressed, I'll go look for the source, but back when selfish mining was first analyzed, someone actually went and did the analysis.
I think it looks for multiple blocks submitted very close to each other, and then uses some kind of statistical analysis to determine if the close time proximity is random or if there are clusters.  Something like that.

Seriously though, it's a *pool*.  The pool is made of *miners*.  If you don't trust that the majority of miners want bitcoin to operate as intended, then you're already fucked.  
Remember, bitcoin isn't *trustless* like some would have you believe.  It's decentralized consensus.  If you don't trust that the majority of actors in the network will behave, then you shouldn't use or invest in bitcoin's network.  If you DO trust the majority of actors to behave, you have to understand that GHASH is primarily composed of those actors, because it is a pool.

Or the cost analysis shows that they prevent more in fraud than they lose in privacy-minded customers.


Insurance doesn't always incorporate personal risk.  Look at group health insurance or extended warranty type insurance.  Insurance works by taking a little money from everyone to pay the few claimants.  It doesn't HAVE to be modeled on actuarial science.


That doesn't make it *not* insurance.


Ok, and they gain customers by utilizing the payment network.  If the fraudulent payments they paid out were more than the $ of clients they brought in, they wouldn't participate.


So the banks actually provide fraud protection.  I didn't think we were ever talking about Visa anyway.  


Ultimately it's all paid for by the consumer, or banks wouldn't participate and Visa would be out of business.
This is how *free markets* work.  If you don't like the services or believe it's costing you too much, then you aren't required to participate.

Yes it is.  It may not be the best, but it's still damn good.
Also, it doesn't oxidize like silver and copper do, so it's used to plate connections that expect to be exposed to oxygen.  Since it's a great conductor and doesn't oxidize, it's uniquely suited to plate connectors, which is why we see them in so many electronic applications.


I'd say it's valuable because it's used for jewelry and it's used for jewelry because it's valuable.  It's a loop.  People use it for jewelry because of it's unique properties (high malleability and lack of oxidation), which makes more people want it, which drives up it's value, which makes it a symbol of wealth, so people wear it as jewelry.
All that being said, gold still derives most of its value from speculation.

Big O notation eliminates the constants, but that doesn't make them irrelevant.  If the block size grows in a line at a linear rate that diverges from network growth, you still end up with blocks that are too big for the network.   How does that magically not become true just because they're both growing at a linear rate?  The rate if divergence may be linear, but that doesn't make it not happen.
You are upset with me because you don't understand my question or you don't have an answer.
My point us that even if you algorithmically change the block size, if you do it in a way that makes blocks too big (even in a linear fashion!) you strain node capacity.   If you do it with a coefficient that's too small (again, even if the equation is linear), then you run out of space in the blocks. 
You are kind of difficult to talk to, but it's interesting to see how mad you're getting because you don't understand.  Calm down.  Look at the problem and see if either

This is a legal thing.  The protocol is simply about possession.  Whether or not that possession is legal is beyond the scope of any protocol.  TCP/IP isn't being criticized because it doesn't stop child porn...


This is a false dichotomy.  You are proposing that we modify the protocol to enforce a property right, not that we use the law to enforce it.  If you know the hacker, they can be sued and the funds recovered (or jail time sentenced).  Property rights have not been lost.  Hard forking to undo the loss is like saying that after a large bank robbery, we change all bills to blue and refuse to accept green bills.  Modifying the entire system to enforce one claim to property rights (that hasn't even been verified in court) is ludicrous.


Exactly.  The property rights have to come from courts and human beings, not by modifying the protocol.

This can only happen if you have the majority of the network.  Once you have the majority of the network, the selfish mining attack becomes the 51% attack because you "always" get the best chain in the long run.  If you have less than 51%, you still get better odds by "selfish mining".

Effectively it does, through intentional double-spends (even after 6 confirmations).


And thus intentionally double spend a confirmed transaction, effectively (although not technically, you are correct) doubling their coins, and *actually* doubling their spending power.  They only need to do a couple of really large double spends very quickly to make it *incredibly* profitable, especially at higher fiat valuations.


They could wait until after the withdrawal goes through, and then 51% the network as soon as it does.  Would take longer, but with 51% you can afford to be patient making your competing chain in secret until you surpass the main chain.

No, but a double spend detected by a node won't be forwarded on.  So for a miner to see it, you have to connect to them directly.  But to be included in the block first, you have to get the double spend transaction to all the miners directly in order to have a good shot at being included.  Being connected to any one miner means they see it, but the other ones won't unless you also send to them, since normal nodes won't be forwarding it on.  It has nothing to do with connectivity between miners.

No because ben lawsky hasn't done anything to change the landscape of the entire world.  Satoshi fucking Nakamoto did indeed do something that is single-handedly changing the entire fucking world.  Like if reddit existed during the 40's, I might have asked for an AMA from "Albert Fucking Einstein".
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:26:21
Truth is, GHash isn't such an issue.  There was a lot of bleating here in Reddit, but a pool can't do much with a temporary 51%, because A) they can't be assured they'll keep it, and failed 51% attacks are COSTLY, and B) should they be caught using it, they'd lose their mining base.
Nothing is preventing miners now from colluding and forking the block chain to, say, remove reward halvings.  It's been that way since the beginning.  Satoshi himself noted that a miner having 51% of the hash power (or group colluding to have 51%) could take over the network.
You have to remember, the pool operator would have to CONSISTANTLY have 51% for the duration of his attack, or else he faces catastrophic (to the tune of multiples of the block reward, which is right now $15k a piece) losses.  If he tries to 51% attack the network and fails, his chain, and thus all the potential mining rewards (again, **fifteen thousand dollars** per block times the length of his failed chain) are forfeited.  On top of this, if his miners catch him trying, they aren't going to take kindly to it, as he is putting their long term investment goals at risk, and they will leave en masse.
The real danger IMO is a true 51% attack by a government or large bank (the only actors with the incentive and the economic capacity to own enough hardware to attempt an attack), and there is currently no indication that this is a threat.

No; that's my point.  It *does* add utility.  These objects can be physically traded, so it allows a physical transaction of a digital token.

If you come up with an algorithm, there exists a person on earth in possession of the know how and contacts to make a chip that is more energy efficient and faster than a GPU can do it.
GPU's are made to do a wide variety of graphics-based calculations.  It just happened that the SHA256 algorithm required a bunch of right shifts that the GPU does much better than a CPU.  GPU's don't have some magical power over anything, they just happened to be the best tool on hand for a casual miner.  FPGA's overtook GPU's before people started designing hardware specifically for the SHA256 algorithm.

Can we try to have a productive conversation?  Why do reddit discussions always devolve into teenage facebook-esque drama?  First you tell me I claim to have all the answers, then I'm arguing with myself, and then you call me cocky and arrogant.  I'm trying to discuss *your* proposals.  Can't we just stay on topic without getting all pissy at each other?


And I responded to that; there's no way to filter which blocks are made by the attacker based on anything.  So that solution is already out the window.


Have you already forgotten parts of our conversation?




Maybe I interpreted that wrong, but it sounded like a snarky, sarcastic, arrogant remark that implied that hard forking to a new algorithm wasn't a big deal.
Damn dude, looking back you really are kind of an asshole.  I'm just trying to point out that the issues you seem to think are trivial are actually core problems that thus far *no one* has come up with an answer for.  
If an attacker gains 51%, he *owns* the network.  The ways to take the network back include
A) Forking to a new chain with the same algorithm.  This preserves miner investment, but the attacker can just hop to the new chain, and begin again.  So this isn't a good long term solution
B) Forking to a new chain with *a new algorithm*.  This prevents the attacker from hopping to the new chain, but destroys the rest of the mining world's investment.
There is literally no way to tell programmatically that a block is from an honest miner or from a malicious 51% attacker.  Of course, you could maintain white lists but then you're centralizing, and good luck getting the bitcoin community behind that one.
Do you have any other concrete ideas on how to recover from a 51% attack?  Because if you do, I bet the community is very interested to hear. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 00:44:07


Seriously?  You think this is a bigger reason than rent-seeking?  Bigger than being the world's middle man?  Seriously?  That shit is a drop in the bucket compared to the money they rake in just facilitating (and selectively monitoring/reporting) transactions worldwide.


What financial assets?  Shares in a company producing real value for the economy?  Houses?  Those are built, utilize utilities, add value to the surrounding land and generate tax revenue for the municipality.  


You've got it backwards.  Those things go up faster because people are seeking to get rid of their inflating dollars.  This is by design, so people use their money for productive things (like shares in a company that produces value) or real estate (that provides shelter and generally increases land value).


You aren't prevented from buying those assets *too*.


And how does that stop them from spending more money on selected commodities?  It's no different than gold.  Does gold make poor people wealthier?  Does gold prevent the wealth gap?  If not, how come you think bitcoin would be any different?

True, but the merchant bears the risk that you will claim the card was used fraudulently.  So it's not zero risk for the merchant as you are implying.
With bitcoin, you can't broadcast a transaction for funds you don't control, so there's no need for ANYONE to take the risk that you won't pay.  The only risk is that you doublespend, which is very difficult to do and most likely not worth it for the cost of a bartab (unless the bar is pricey and you are buying for everyone in the building).

If inflation makes money worth less over time, why do people trade durable goods (i.e. precious metals, land, etc) that don't erode over time for money?  Why not just hold those things in perpetuity as they are gaining value against the dollar?


That's a gross oversimplification.  I don't even know where to begin rebutting this.


Why should ALL currencies be this way?  Seems to me like we NEED a place to park value where it gives a small expected return without having to trust fund managers to manage it properly.  And why can't bitcoin exist alongside an inflationary currency?  Why does it have to be either/or?

Where did they pay to?  Those are on-chain.


You had to deposit them to the exchange right?  That's an on-chain transaction.  You had to withdraw them at some point, right?  That's an on-chain transaction.  Get a record of all your trades from the various exchanges.  Exchanges don't exist?  Estimate; the IRS allows you to accurately estimate if the data doesn't exist any more.


All on-chain transactions that are traceable.  If the exchange doesn't have record, again, estimate.

I don't think anyone would commit to buy later at a higher price than now for something like bitcoin, since you can obtain it now and there are no real barriers to entry like there are with grain.  I think the main motive for a buyer is to lock in today's price, while the main motive for a seller is the belief that bitcoin is going to drop in value.

So yea, it isn't an easy sell to brick and mortar businesses, but for online porn, drugs, gambling, and just about any other "high risk" business, it's a potential godsend.  And for people who are privacy minded, it's potentially a very valuable tool for online commerce as well.

Bitcoin rewards are most definitely a common resource.  It takes work to get them, but anyone with hashing abilities *can* take advantage of them.  If everyone in the world just left hashrate as it is, then everyone would continue to reap the same benefit for the foreseeable future (barring halvings, which affect everyone equally).  However, some people want *more* than they are currently making.  When they increase their hashrate, they take more resources from other people.  The other people, in response, must increase their hashrate or accept less of the common resource.  So they, in turn, up their hashrate.
This cycle, in a situation like, say, fishing, causes everyone to eventually lose out because they destroy the population.  However, with bitcoin, its only effect (besides forcing upgrades on miners) is increased security.
Why do you say this is not taking advantage of the tragedy of the commons?

There's a whole section in the whitepaper about it:


parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending
an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is
similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of
individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them
from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input
transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk
is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.
Additionally, it depends on your threat model.  If your threat model includes the NSA, then you're going to have a hard time regardless of what method you use.  If it's your competitor in business, they're not going to have a clue.  


Bullshit; you have to disclose your name, billing address and zip code to every person you want to submit a payment to.  How is that more privacy than bitcoin?  Pshaw.

An attack takes time, because you have to generate an alternate chain.  Once its obvious that an attack is occurring (valid blocks are being withheld from publication, working on an alternate block besides the publically published last block), most miners of any consequence will bail.

Proof of Stake doesn't reliably achieve consensus because there are scenarios where you can use your stake on multiple chains without losing anything.  The "proof" in a blockchain mechanism must be something that can only be used once.  Work can't be "taken back", because the electricity has already been used.  Stake *can* be taken back by forking and going a different way.  Then all the people who spent stake on the old fork get their stake back in the new fork for all coins that have been abandoned by the new fork.


It wouldn't counter a 51%, it would create two separate consensus chains.  Nothing is stopping the 51% attacker from jumping to the new chain.

Edited to add that I find it comical that people want doge to grow in value, while being inflationary and "something you tip".

I just thought you were trying to differentiate between bitcoin's representation of value and things whose intrinsic properties make them valuable beyond their representation.
The paper in your stock doesn't have an intrinsic property that makes it valuable, it's the representation.  As long as people recognize the representation, the value exists.  Should people no longer recognize the representation, then the value would disappear.  This contrasts with say, real estate, where regardless of other people's perception, you can still use real estate to live in.
In this way, stocks and currency are a lot like bitcoin, since they all derive their value solely from other people's perception.


Of course, and I'm not arguing that stocks don't have value.  I'm just saying the map's value is not derived from the paper its printed on, but the information it represents.


It doesn't, but this value is not derived from the intrinsic properties of the representation, whereas gold and real estate derive their value from their intrinsic properties.

Nope.  My claim is solid; Velocity of Money does not have a direct effect on its value.  It's the other way around.  I haven't waivered from that statement, and I've shorn it up with your own sources.

Think about it in terms of a libertarian trying to masquerade as a Republican though.  He can't say outright that he's for gay marriage or abortion, because he'd alienate his base.  But, if he says "States Rights", his base loves him for it.  Meanwhile, SCOTUS has already made it impossible for states to outlaw abortion, and are set to rule on gay marriage this summer (with precedent already being set that banning gay marriage is unconstitutional).
So basically I'm saying that by "returning the power to the states" he avoids having to take a Republican stance on either issue, while effectively taking a Libertarian stance on the issues.

I gave you like four verses in the book that they base their religion off of to dispute this very sentence.  Do you have a single source that contradicts John 3:16 while still claiming to be Christian?


First, what is X?  That faith is not required to get to heaven?  Again, please refute this point.
Second, I must believe it to be well versed in it?  I was raised in the Baptist faith, took MANY camps/summer retreats focused on God and even spent time in multiple college level courses studying religion.  Why am I not allowed to have a concrete opinion about what the religion says, just because I believe it to be wrong?


Yes it is.


First of all, yes.  We know where his body is buried (Hint: Mt Vernon).  If it were ever in doubt, we could exhume his body and compare it to historical records to prove he existed.  But even if we didn't have proof, we're comparing some guy to a being that is not human, is extra-terrestrial, has magical powers and is immortal.  I'd say that someone's claim that "some guy" existed requires a lot less validation than claiming the existence of an extra-terrestrial magical immortal being.

Any exchange implementing any kind of restriction is not "nanny-state".  Private exchanges are doing what private exchanges wish.

True, but only for unconfirmed transactions.  For confirmed transactions (even one confirmation), they'd have to mine the previous block again.  With 51% of the network, you're still competing with the other 49% unless you are maliciously withholding blocks, in which case my previous point would stand.  So unless you are maliciously withholding blocks, you can only mine a double spend 51% of the time.  Then, if you have 1 confirmation, it drops to 26% (since you have to mine the last block again).  With 2 confirmations, it's 13%.  With 3, it's 6.7%; 4, 3.4%; 5, 1.7% and 6, .89% (less than 1% chance).  So again, unless you are maliciously withholding blocks, more confirmations greatly reduce the odds that this will happen.
And with unconfirmed transactions, any miner could do that, and wouldn't need 51% to accomplish it with any regularity.  Even with 20% of the hashing power, there's a 20% chance you will mine the next block.  So while technically you are correct, in practice it's not a large threat, especially if you generally follow the OP's guidelines to how many confirmations to wait for based on amount.  
51% is not a very big threat, even with a single miner owning it all (as opposed to a pool), unless they were malicious and wanted to break bitcoin.  In every other scenario, bitcoin remains trustworthy due to economic incentives.  Also, competitors don't like to lose, so it will be difficult for any entity to retain a 51% majority for long.

Ok, so if the selfish miner doesn't immediately relay it to the network, someone else could relay a block as you say.  Then the selfish miner releases the block and races the competitor.  This is where the most risk for this attack comes into play and why I think we haven't seen it yet (the risk vs reward is too low, especially since there's already so much risk in bitcoin mining).
However, if the miner can get a SECOND block before someone gets a first, they have a HUGE advantage at that point.

My theory;
Bitstamp hack and subsequent shutdown bottled up sell pressure that already existed, as bitcoin was in a gentle slide caused by no new buyers and mining coins increasing supply.  Once Bitstamp got online, people were hesitant to sell because MtGox burned a lot of people after their "Hack".  When withdrawals were seen to work properly, that built up sell pressure began to dump.  Previous buyers were skittish, chose to wait as price began to slump.  Slumping price triggered automatic sell orders, slipping price further, people get scared, start dumping coins, ends up pushing downward even harder.
TL;DR Bitstamp hack scared everyone.

When you move the goalposts every time I prove you wrong, it becomes difficult to know exactly what it is we are arguing *about*.


You're moving the goalpost, again.  People interested in internet money are going to encounter BTC before any other crypto.  That's the network effect I'm speaking of.  


No, that's not true.  BTC is not interchangeable with any other crypto.  There would be a good deal of work and effort under the hood to convert to a crypto with different hashing algorithms for address generation and different clients and different commands for generation of addresses.  But *why*?  Bitcoin already has the lion's share of the crypto space.  *Why* would people switch to another, *less known* crypto currency absent a catastrophic failure of bitcoin?  Your argument doesn't make sense.


That's a bad analogy, since it's all the same protocol.  It's like Bitcoin 1.0 vs 2.0 vs 3.0.  Let's compare IP to a completely different protocol, say [SCTP](  It may be a better technology, but everyone and their mother uses IP.  So the vast majority of software will use IP instead of SCTP, since it will reach a *wider* audience (again, network effect).
On top of that, once you have any holdings in Bitcoin, you have a vested interest in Bitcoin being used in more places, so you have little incentive to switch to a different crypto.
I'm not sure exactly what your *point* is here; no one already into Bitcoin is going to go through the effort of switching without a GOOD reason, because despite your ramblings, it IS effort, and without an incentive to switch, people just *won't*.

I can foresee reasons to use it; for instance parents could give bitcoin instead of authorizing the use of a credit card.  But that's beside the point, because this is all a strawman argument.  My whole point was that Microsoft taking it is a tacit "Stamp of Approval", which clears up for many the questions of bitcoin's status as a serious method of payment (vs a Ponzi scheme or some other type of internet money scam).  It lends legitimacy.  That was the point I've been trying to make all along.


Maybe the options or futures, but how about the ETFs themselves?  Those exist because it is significantly more difficult to hold the commodity than the ETF, which is not the case for bitcoin.


Or was overwhelmed by it.  And I did say that I "expected" the good news to bolster the price.


I just had my credit card denied, *for the third time*, **at the same location** because of the Target/Home Depot hacks.  There are DEFINITE use cases where bitcoin is better.  Bitcoin doesn't win in all cases, but sometimes, it most definitely does.


I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous.  Bitcoin was invented and thrives as it has because it serves a valid purpose; internet enabled cash-equivalent.  Just because you *personally* don't have a use for it, doesn't mean *no one* does.  Your assumption is arrogant and self-centered.


Agreed, which is why the "market cap" is so small.  But it's growing.


If it didn't exist, a company like Microsoft wouldn't take the time to implement it, which *is my point*.

I guess what I meant was that it wasn't created JUST to be a currency;it was created as proof of concept of digital scarcity, that could be APPLIED to currency.  Satoshi also talked about a lot of properties of bitcoin that are very much NOT currency, like contracts and such.  It was really more about the concept of preventing duplication in the digital world in a way that creates scarcity where none exists (you know, because of the ability for computers to copy shit).

As the manufacturers stream line this process (and they will, because they want money), we should see drastic improvements in these areas.


Maybe.  But if company ABC delays to mine or create scarcity and company XYZ is shipping, then XYZ is making money sellig hardware where ABC is A) not making money selling hardware and B) having their investment devalued by XYZ's shipping.  
It's a fantastic practical experiment in game theory.  We'll see what happens.  It may be that the mining hardware manufacturers collude, but as soon as one breaks rank the competition begins again.  Exciting times.

But once they've been combined with other inputs and then split into different outputs, which output has the "stolen" coins?  Or do all the outputs have a "bit" of the stolen coins?  How do you accurately calculate what portion is stolen and what's not?  Using regular oil vs stolen oil; if someone mixes 1 barrel of stolen oil with 9 barrels of honest oil, is that now 10 barrels of 10% stolen oil?  
Also, you kind of side stepped my point.  Just because people can follow them doesn't mean they don't have the same utility as other coins; they can still be transferred just as any other coin.  The only difference is perception.  The underlying technological system works the same regardless of the emotions we attach to certain bits.

Gods are man's way of explaining things he doesn't comprehend.  The bible is as likely in our world as in a world with a God, because humans need something by which they can explain the unexplainable.  Does your theorem also insist that Zeus is real (or at least allude to it) because stories about Zeus are more likely to exist in a world with Zeus than one without him?


Because when asked "How can I know?" the priest says you must have faith whereas the doctor says "We know the effects of the chemical properties through extensive trial and error, and you can reproduce the results by doing this series of tests" which people do, and verify or disprove.


If I approached it the way I do now, I wouldn't.  However, I would *be able* to test their hypothesis by reproducing their tests and independently verifying their results.  You can't do that with God, because a test has not been devised that can definitively prove or disprove God.  So, I base my judgment on the *availability* of testable conditions.  I largely accept that people will go to great lengths to disprove the results of others, and expect that this process will eventually discern the right answer.  This *is not possible* with religion, again, because there does not exist such a 
test that can be reproduced.  
I feel like you're trying to get me to admit that I use faith and belief in my every day life.  I have no problem admitting that.  But it's a faith based on the presence of verifiable data.


I reserve judgment about precognition and things of that nature, because I don't know.  I believe in the possibility, and am not excluding it.


Interesting: 


full database is approximately 109 in favor of the psi hypothesis (Table 1), which implies that our
meta-analysis should lower their posterior odds against the psi hypothesis to 1011
I'll definitely be researching this further.


Well, it's hard to follow when you are intentionally vague.  Paranormal is an adjective that is used in vernacular to refer to ghosts and spirits.  True, it applies to these kinds of things as well, but you are fully aware (or should have been aware) of how a vague word like "paranormal" would be interpreted.


I never said there was.  I said that you necessarily have to make an assumption to believe in God, and that there is *no way* to do otherwise.  I then stated that it was a pre-requisite of the religion, after which you presented "apologists" as a counter-argument (who themselves must start from a single assumption).  The whole time I've been trying to say that you *can't* believe in God without making an assumption.  You *can*, however believe in vaccines without making an assumption.  You don't *have* to go and do all the research if you don't want, but it's *available*.  That's the point I've been trying to make throughout this whole discussion.


No, I never implied that.  I stated "not having conclusive evidence means your belief requires faith."  Those who are convicted without conclusive evidence are not using logic.
If, however, you say "There may be a God, but I reserve judgment because of a lack of evidence", then you are using logic (and are not following the Christian doctrine).  If you say "I know there is a God, even though there's no conclusive evidence" (which, by the way, is a pre-requisite for the damn religion, which is what I've been saying *the whole time*), then you are not using logic, and you are not using evidence.  


You're vagueness and improper analogies are not proving anything.  You seem to be a smug individual who thinks he's found someone who is wrong on the internet, and seem to delight in arguing around the point.  I think you are arguing something I never implied, nor did I intend to imply.


We're approaching that point.  I was almost done with this one until you mentioned precognition, which is not what is implied by paranormal.  Your link intrigued me, and spurred this response.

Love the lack of content.  I clearly articulated that neither monetary inflation nor price inflation are caused by an increase in divisibility.  This directly contradicts your assertion that increased divisibility *does* do one of these two things.  See, inflation is defined as either an increase in the monetary supply of a currency (monetary inflation) or an increase in the cost of goods relative to a currency (price inflation).  Making a currency more divisible does neither of these things, and therefore does not constitute, nor cause inflation.  Q.E. Fucking D.

They are a moneyed elite, but the idea is that the elites have less power than before.  Most likely, should bitcoin succeed long term, the current system's elites will become the new system's elites using their current resources.  The point is, those elites' power will have been reduced.

A 51% attack is about spending on a block, and then orphaning that block with a longer chain.  How do you implement a checkpoint on the last few blocks?  This is why 6 confirmations is the "safety limit", because after 6 it becomes prohibitively difficult from a computational standpoint to replace with a longer chain (7 or more).  However, with 51%, you can always over time outmine the rest of the network.

But you aren't paying an additional 15-30% for the laptop.  You would be paying 15-30% of the price increase in bitcoin.
So, when you bought a bitcoin at $5, then bitcoin went to $1200 and you bought a laptop for $1200 (or 1 bitcoin), you realized a gain of $1195 because of bitcon's appreciation, and so would have to pay tax on that appreciation.

There are reasons; making tracks more difficult to follow after a hack, splitting up large transactions for tumbling, testing, I don't know.
I was just saying transactions don't *necessarily* imply economic activity.  For the purpose of analysis, transaction volume should only be *loosely* correlated to real usage, because there are a lot of reasons to have multiple transactions among your own wallets (like the ones I mentioned above, plus transferring to cold storage, or a new wallet, or consolidation of old addresses, etc).

Ok, maybe THIS is where you are getting confused.

What signs?  The price?  That's not a sign of impending doom at all.  MtGox froze withdrawels for months, and deposits kept pouring in.  Once fiat withdrawels were frozen, anyone who didn't transfer out was taking a VERY large risk.


Which was a HUGE red flag.  Banks don't do business?  Well then there's probably something going on I don't want to be a part of.


No it's not.  You chose to do business with MtGox.  That was a voluntary transaction.  Cancer is not.


Yes, telling the victim they are at fault doesn't erase the fault of the perpetrator for *actually committing the crime*.  I'll concede that.


That's not true; there was a six month period where they were trading at significantly higher prices than other exchanges.  Sorry bud, I watched.  I still have my MtGox YubiKey, I was there.  But when they started trading funny, I took my coins and left.


So you took a risk **EVEN WHEN PEOPLE TOLD YOU NOT TO**.  That makes you culpable for your own loss.


How can you keep all coins in cold storage on an exchange?  Puh-lease.  When did he prove ownership of those coins?  2011!?  Come on man.


I watched it implode in real time.  I knew it was going bad long before deposits froze.  2 week delay for a fiat withdrawal?  Come on, how is that not fishy?  US Government freezing assets?

21 million bitcoin = 1 orange.
Tada, analogy fits.


No it's not.  If you make 1 bitcoin more divisible, you are not reducing the purchasing power of 1 bitcoin.  If 1 bitcoin was worth $300, then one bitcoin will still be worth $300 after the change in programming.  Inflation *affects the price of goods*, either through an increase in the money supply or a decrease in the value of the unit of account relative to goods.  Making the unit of account more divisible has no effect on the size of the money supply, nor does it change the value of the unit of account relative to goods.
You are misunderstanding what inflation actually is.  Please do some more reading before you continue with this obviously ridiculous assertion.

How does this have anything to do with anything?  You earn bitcoins like you earn anything else; offer a good or service in return for them.

I fail to understand your point.  Can you try again?


It *is* legal tender, just not for *all debts*.  There'd be no reason to specify that, and I'd argue that isn't under the scope of understanding bitcoin from a technical point of view; the legality of bitcoin is beyond the scope of this specific specialist.

A global currency doesn't prevent sovereign currencies from existing.  No sane government body with any modicum of power will ever give up sovereignty of their money.  The countries in Europe basically became states to the EU.  A lot of people were mystified by these countries' desire to give up their sovereignty in exchange for cohesion.  
The world does, however, need a single unit by which to settle debts in different currencies, usually referred to as the "reserve" currency.  Right now that's definitively the USD which gives the US a ridiculous advantage worldwide.  We need a reserve currency that doesn't facilitate any single entity's political agendas.

Just an aside; the presidency is *one* office you can vote for.  Every state has two seats in the senate, and [34]( of them are up for re-election next year.  The House of Congress also has [elections]( next year.  Then there are 12 states with [gubernatorial]( elections in 2016, as well as multiple state and local elections throughout 2015 and 2016.
Why does everyone focus solely on the president?  Let's not forget that those in the running for this *one* election have to get selected through the primary process as well.  So they have to go through two separate elections to be selected.
I understand the hopelessness people feel when it comes to the large scale national presidential election.  But that's the *pinnacle* of entertainment politics.
Work your way up; pay attention to the elections occurring in your town or city, then your state, and then at the federal level.  All these levels make an impact.


But that's not how it's interpreted by the majority.  It's interpreted as laziness/apathy.

Not particularly, especially for a basic user.  Once you give it to the recipient, you can't pull it back.  It doesn't require a third party to authorize the transaction, and both have ways in which they can be tracked and ways in which they can be laundered.
The only *real* differences are that bitcoin requires the internet, bitcoin has a hard cap on production and dollars are legal tender.  Otherwise the concepts are pretty much the same for basic bitcoin-as-currency usage vs cash usage.

Yes, that's why a 51% attack is so potentially devastating.  Otherwise, another block will probably pick it up.


They *could*, if they could compute the block, but remember that the block is difficult to compute, otherwise there wouldn't only be one every 10 minutes.  However, forks do happen when two people compute a block at around the same time.  The solution is that you can mine on whichever block you want.  The first person to mine the *next* block determines which tied block wins by having built on one of the two tied blocks. Now *that* block is in the longest chain, and the other block is a dead end.  


Nothing; that's technically possible.  But why pass up the fees associated with transactions?  This is why you hear that 0 fee transactions take longer; not every miner will include them.


It's generally negligible, and would only make a difference if two blocks were found at almost exactly the same time.  There's also proposed (implemented?) solutions for this where only pointers to txns are transmitted and then filled in later.

In the bank's scenario, they are being trusted to create a digital asset from a physical one, which until bitcoin was impossible without a third party and a central ledger.
Similarly, Cascascius created a physical asset from a digital one.  That's valuable to some people and worth the risk of trusting a third party.
Not everyone in bitcoin is about removing the trust or the third party.  Some people are in it for how much less friction it requires to interact with trusted third parties.

You can game the transaction number, which is why it should only be used as a general idea of the health of the network.  I could send billions of infinitesimal transactions back and forth to the same set of HD wallets, but that's not *real* economic activity.  Transaction count is only a loose guestimate at the real economic activity, just like block generation speed is only a loose guestimate at real hashrate.

The reason that he was able to make so many was that they were using an unsigned integer variable somewhere, and the exploiter put a negative number there.  The way negative numbers work in signed variables is that the first bit is a 1 to indicate negative, or a 0 to indicate positive.  In an unsigned variable, this first bit is part of the value (no sign; more room).  So a negative number in an unsigned integer turns into a really really big positive number.
Thus, he couldn't just make them in whatever amount he wanted, he necessarily had to make A LOT, since the sign bit is the first bit.  So it was either A LOT, or use the variable as intended, which means don't create ANY.

Sure, but you could say the same about IPV6 (which is a NECESSARY conversion) and look how long that's taking to become dominant over IPv4.  


You are saying that A) Bitcoin has no network effect (which is fucking retarded, because it is by far the best known crypto coin, and thus has the *largest* network effect of all of them) and B) People *could potentially, maybe, possibly* switch, and therefore bitcoin's fundamentals are bad?

A technology invented to simulate cash on the internet (explain cash as compared to debit/credit, which requires a central clearinghouse).


A network of computers transmit a copy of every transaction to each other.  Every few minutes, transactions are bundled together and "locked" by the miners, meaning they can't be modified and the network can assume they're now a part of history and that the balances of all "accounts" are accurate.


A collection of addresses, each of which is a little bit like a bank account number.  


If this was a scam then ~~defendants~~ victims were tricked.  If it was a hack then the security of their bitcoin account "password" (private key) was compromised.

I'd be interested in getting additional supplies so I could have extra in a SHTF scenario.

Atheism is another extreme.  To this point I've been specific to mention the Christian ideology because that's the one whose doctrine is generally followed in the US (where the story originates that spawned this discussion).
If you want to know what percentage I'd approximate that *no diety exists*, I'd probably put that at 50/50 (depending on your definition of diety).  I see no evidence either way to confirm or deny it.  Now, as to whether Christianity in specific is correct, I'd make a wild ass guess that there's a 2% chance that it's factual.  The mechanisms described in the Bible for the creation of the world don't match what we see in the fossil records.  It states the world was made in 7 days which we know based on uranium dating to be incorrect.  There are also several historical inaccuracies and internal inconsistencies.  Then, there are philosophical inconsistencies that, while don't necessarily contribute to the body of evidence, nevertheless give me a hard time in accepting.

Miners aren't a single organism.  Do you have any reason to believe that all miners will shut their rigs off the second the price tanks?  That's ridiculous to assume.


Not likely, unless the 90% drop in price is exactly mirrored by 90% of miners dropping off, AND all those miners drop off simultaneously AND this price crash happens at the very beginning of a difficulty change.

Except most people still look to the establishment for their cues on how the world works, and the establishment is only now processing bitcoin.  For years, bitcoin was under most people's radar.  Additionally, the internet has taught us to be much more wary of trading with unknown people without the presence of a trusted third party.  How many Nigerian Princes have promised you money in exchange for receiving money?  Bitcoin, to me, first came off as a scam, because people wanted *real money* for it.  Well, once you learn, you realize it's not a scam; it's a technological revolution.


Yep; third party (trusted).  Means you don't have to trust anyone else, only M-Pesa.
Third parties have their place.  Online markets ~~need~~ create a market for an arbiter and an escrow provider.  Until now, these functions were filled by an entity who was also the only way to trade money online (banks).  But now we've separated that task from the money itself.  People are wary, and necessarily so.  
But that will change.

•Why would Microsoft accepting Bitcoin make someone want to use it when they already have money that Microsoft accepts?
See, you misunderstand how this whole thread got started.  Here's the [permalink](  said


I said


That's how it got started.  You chimed in later with a strawman (why would people use it with Microsoft), which I probably shouldn't have argued against, but whatever. 


Define *enough*.  Obviously these "huge" companies increased legitimacy.  Of COURSE they did.  What do you think the price would be if none of these companies were accepting it?  Probably lower, don't you think?


And yet they command a large share of daily trading.  Your opinion isn't really relevant here.


No, this instance demonstrates why push payment methods are better than pull payment methods.  


Source please?


Thanks for your opinion.  Why are you here then?


They just demonstrate usage and demand.  


It's possible, yes.  But that does nothing to detract from my original point that you keep trying to strawman, and that's that Microsoft's acceptance sends a big message that bitcoin is not a scam, is not magic internet money, and has worth, evidenced by the fact that a large established company is willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services.  Maybe there's not a large market for Microsoft products in the bitcoin economy, but Microsoft's acceptance adds *legitimacy*.


For a lot of reasons; international remittance is easier with a global currency, billions of people are unbanked, countries desire a reserve currency free of a single dominating power, there are other applications besides currency, I could go on if you want.  But I suspect you don't want to acknowledge potential use cases, because you're simply here to argue for the lolz.

We *could* be talking about investing, right?  Why is there a distinction?  Increased investment would equal increased price.


You assume that everyone already has money Microsoft accepts.  I think that's a stretch.  Why would Microsoft implement it if they didn't perceive some demand for its use?


Two things; one, people invest in currencies all the time (google forex), so I don't get why labeling it as such would *prevent* people from wanting to invest in it.  Second, bitcoin can also be treated as a commodity since people want it and there's a limited supply of it, so it's not necessarily *just* a currency.

The daily grind of constant prudence and pure necessity can be soul numbing.  It's nice to have a good time together.  There are cheap and free options to have fun with your family, but honestly, you can have dinner at a steak house for $45; waters all around, $3.99 a kid for 3 = $12, plus $12.99 a piece per parent = $20, that's $32.  Tax + 10% Tip is $45, max.  That's for good food prepared well plus an hour and a half of entertaining family time.  That's not an exorbitant expense


Going out to eat three-five times a week is a bad idea.  But once a month isn't a terrible expense.  I mean, you factor in that it still costs $2-$2.50 a person to cook dinner at home most of the time, and your only spending $27 over what you would spend anyway


Me too.  But OP never mentions how he normally lives his life.  He said they would have gone to Burger King instead; which can be done for $15.  Family night, anyone?


Prudence is good most of the time.  It doesn't have to be 100% though.  Little treats now and then really do help.

The effects of inflation *as it is currently implemented* are that those who decide the inflation rate get the benefit of pre-inflated new dollars (equated with theft by many).  The *intent* of inflation is to discourage money's use as a store of value, in an effort to get people to invest in other things.  This increases the velocity of money which is thought to increase the value of an economy.  It actually works well when implemented correctly.
In my opinion, if the newly printed money was used to fund social programs instead of profit the banks that issue the currency, a lot of people would be a lot less upset with inflation as a policy.

Well, right now precedent dictates that .0001 is an acceptable fee for most.  I'd say current valuations indicate that fees less than $.01 USD appears to be easily dismissed by most, and that you'd probably not encounter much real resistance until you were in $.05 or $.10 territory.
However, this includes the block reward as a subsidy.  I'd estimate that miners will mine transactions at a price point that's just high of the cost of mining, that is, as long as miners can make *some* profit, mining will continue.
It's cool how there's an automatic adjustment though; if mining becomes unprofitable, many drop out and difficulty adjusts until it's profitable for some again.

Marginally.  


My point *exactly*.  Bitcoin can't prevent people from getting burned, because people will override their judgment in the pursuit of profit.  Thank you for agreeing with my original point.

And when it happens, shout it from the rooftop.


Ahh, ok.  So only *smart* people matter here.  Protection for dumb fucks?  Fuck 'em.  Very humanitarian outlook you have there.


There you go again.  Using the word "potentially" doesn't change the fact that this is basically empty rhetoric.


See, you're doing it wrong.  Bitcoin *factors in* human greed.  You seem to be dismissing it.  Second, by what metric are you measuring just, peaceful or prosperous?  Third, to what degree will that change based on bitcoin?  If the effect is marginal at best, you're *technically* correct, but by most interpretations you'd be wrong.

I disagree.  Fractional reserves allow banks to make more money lending, which means they can offer higher interest rates to those who invest in the bank.  There will always be demand for higher interest rates on investments.  That's not going to go away.


By far the biggest contributor to the elimination of poverty is industry.  People shopping on Etsy aren't nearly as effective as companies building factories in the area to take advantage of cheap labor.  


Yea, that's extremely optimistic.  Lots of people do it for the challenge.  Lots of people do it because its easy.  Bitcoin is not a magic pill that makes everything better.  Again, your glasses are too rosy.


There's lots of ways to be scammed.  


Agreed.  That doesn't stop it from happening though, especially if trust is essential to the transaction.

Of course not, because no one ever gets duped with the promise of cheaper business for "early finalization" (or whatever they used in the Silk Road to avoid escrow).

For instance, if your linear slope is too low, your solution won't work if we see a sudden jump in network speed (through government initiatives or technology advancements) but if the linear slope is too high, then the blocks get too big too quickly, and nodes are forced off the network.

The reason receiving from an address is not dangerous from a technical standpoint is that receiving doesn't require your signature, only the sender's.   Sending can actually be technically dangerous, because if your RNG is weak, you can potentially reveal information with your signature that would allow am attacker to glean your private key using similarities in the signatures of your multiple transactions.

There's overhead when you write non-sequentially.  Since operating systems allow gaps (ever heard of "defragging your hard drive"?  That's removing those gaps) allocation of space is more complicated than you think.  When you sequentially write, you can get one large chunk of space at a time and write all at once.  When you non-sequentially write, you have to allocate that space over and over and over and modify your indexing over and over and over.  This overhead can be drastic, depending on the fragmentation on your drive (which is why defragging can vastly improve response time).  So it makes sense that one big write would see much faster times than many small writes.
TL;DR *Overhead*

* Public sector is greatly influenced by politics, and I despise most of what the political landscape has to offer
* Taxes pay the public sector salaries, which I am against ideologically; we should all be responsible for ourselves.


I've not seen a lot of documentation on private police forces being awful; considering we still use them now.  See other comments to my response, plus look at things like banks, money delivery services, etc.  They already pay private protection forces.

First, you have to have old coins.  So you'll need to buy them Now.
Second, .1 btc is *per block*.  That's 14.4 btc per day.  So if we're re-adjusting the block size every two weeks, you'll need to spend $48,384 just to get one block adjustment changed.  Then, let's say it re-adjusts to 1.5x its size.  Now you need 1500 transactions.  That's .15 btc per block, or 21.6 btc per day, for $72,576 for the next adjustment.  Now you are at .2 per block, or $96,768.  So you've spent  $217,728 to go from 1mb to 2.25 mb.
To get it to 200 mb blocks, you'll have to spend over a million dollars in transaction fees alone.  This is assuming you can create a zero value transaction (fee only) and that your coins are sufficiently aged (prevents you from recycling coins).  This would also take you 9 re-adjustment periods, or 18 weeks.
Also, remember this money is going to the miners, so they have a financial incentive to mine this.
Now, if we change the multiplier to 1.25 instead of 1.5, you spend a million dollars to get to 20mb block size.  To get to 200mb, you'd have to spend over 6 million dollars, and it'd take you 19 re-adjustments, or 38 weeks.  
That's not a trivial amount of money, especially when you recall that pruning is available, so people can chop off a lot of the crap they don't want to store.

Also, are these the only two issues you deem important?  OP had a LONG LONG LONG list of ways Rand Paul is a proponent of less government and more freedom, and your response is "BUT GAY MARRIAGE AND ABORTION!"?  
It's two issues that are unlikely to be decided by the POTUS and the executive branch anyway.

But with 51% of the hash power, theoretically the evil actor could mine whatever length chain you pick for a check point.  So if you pick six blocks as the checkpoint, they just mine seven privately and then release them all.  Pick seven, they mine eight.  Because they have more hash power than the entire rest of the network, the odds are in their favor they'll mine a block of length n faster than the rest of the network.

And [those are easily explained]( by the fact that our brain has a spot that generates these things.


No, illogical; when you constrain it to the bounds of the religion, you must necessarily accept that those bounds are logical to begin with.  That's not how it works.  In addition, all of these apologists make logical assumptions or posit philosophical truths in order to make their "proofs" work.  It's all mental gymnastics.  For instance, Thomas Acquinas assumes that all events must have a cause, except, there must be something that doesn't have a first cause, because it's impossible that we could trace time back forever.  There's the first assumption with no basis.  So, then, if there must be something that doesn't have a cause, that thing must be god.  Assumption two.
None of these apologists can submit a concrete proof that proves the existence of God.
Indeed, if they *could*, then they'd invalidate one of the core aspects of the religion; faith is the only way to heaven.


And they are free to do so.  That's fine; they can start from a point of faith and build logical conclusions *based on their faith*.  But without starting from that point of faith, there's no way to either 
A) Build faith (since faith requires no proof, hence the definition)
B) Prove God (since there is no proof, at least from a scientific standpoint, and the Christian religion at least *requires* that there be no proof).

And you said this:


While a single block may take a long time, the difficulty round is an average of 2016 blocks.  If a block has a 90% chance of occurring at or before 10 minutes, then you'd have a .9^2016 = 5.66*10^-93 or
.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000566% chance that all the blocks would take longer than 10 minutes.  While this is a simplification (since one block could technically go for three or four days and skew the average, while all other blocks occurred on time), it demonstrates how improbable this scenario is.
Let me ask you, how low must your odds be for you to consider it impossible?

Well then it seems you have your answer right there.  Preventing *another* federal law for abortion seems like a good thing, when we already have a perfectly apt ruling from SCOTUS that already protects it.
As for gay marriage; look what's already happening.  A Federal Judge has already [overturned state amendments that tried to restrict it](
So if the issue is returned to the states, then the SCOTUS makes federal rulings, the issue is effectively killed without the executive branch's involvement.
Seems like a good way to avoid unintended consequences.

Can you please explain concretely how *they* are defining faith in a way that is contrary to my posited definition?


No, but it is a dichotomy between *unproven* and *proven*.  It has not been proven, and no experiment can be devised to prove it.  If you can devise a concrete experiment to prove or disprove God, I'll bet you win an award.  However, what happens here is that the onus of proof is being shifted.  I can claim that there's an invisible fire truck in your back yard that you can't see or hear or touch or taste, and I can claim I've felt it before.  Well, since you can't prove me wrong, it must be there right?  Welcome to religious logic.


Who's in disagreement with the church?  Me or them?  If its them, please, again, frame their stance.


No, of course not.  But if any of the things I accept is directly challenged, and fails to use "logic" (why the quotes?) to prove itself, then I have the wherewithal to amend my belief system to incorporate this new data.  If someone challenges an assumption I make, and I have no reasonable, logical way to disprove them, then I necessarily have to change my assumption.  This is called "learning".

Because government intervention forced it down, and its release is sudden and unaccounted for.  The governments removing their controls caused a much quicker correction than would have happened if they had left it alone.  The frustration is that if they hadn't created the peg *in the first place*, the free market would have sorted it out.  Instead, the situation now is what it would have been, except the country now has a large exposure to EURO risk they didn't have before.
So the appreciating value alone isn't what people are upset about (although that does affect exports, as stated), but the fact that the government's pegging and subsequent release of said peg did nothing but delay the inevitable and expose them to risk they wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to.

They are relatively safe.  Once a transaction is in a node's mempool,  new transactions that spend the same output are discarded.   You have to be very quick to have two competing transactions in the network, and even then there's a chance the wrong one will get picked up.  If you have a well connected node that has geographically diverse connections, 5 or 6 seconds should be enough to be confident that a double spend hasn't been attempted.
And if this kind of risk is so scary, why are paper checks still still a thing after how many years?  Those things take days to confirm.

Edit: I don't mean to sound aggressive, but I read my posts again and I see that it could come off that way.  I believe your solution is inelegant because it either relies on hard coded constants or external data.  If hard coded constants, then we must examine what happens when those constants no longer represent reality, should that happen.  If the constants reflect a network growth rate that is higher than reality, then it puts undue burden on the network.  If it's too slow to reflect real network growth, it won't scale fast enough and would bottleneck the network.  that's why I ask these questions, not to be argumentative.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:14:31
I think they're more referring to competition of fees being referenced by block size change, with users *bidding* for constrained block space.  I'd agree that that is not viable.  However, if enough users are paying a pittance in fees, the reward (if the block size is large enough) would still incentivize miners.  If you have a limited block size, and people have to vie for transaction space, then people will seek out other options.  I agree with this whole-heartedly.

Wrong, the bitcoin public address is a product of hashing the public key using RIPEMD160 and SHA256 ("crypto tech 1" and "crypto tech 2").  The private key/public key is an  ECDSA key/pair ("crypto tech 3").  Finally, the mining algorithm uses SHA256 hash algorithm multiple times ("crypto tech 2" again).
Hashing algorithms play an integral part in encryption, and I don't feel like there's a need to make a strong distinction, especially to CNN readers.

But bitcoin is only really useful *if your goal is decentralization*.  If you are utilizing a central authority, then the blockchain is slow, cumbersome and inefficient.
Not everyone attacking the idea of "bankchain" is an ancap looking to tear down the entire mechanism of government.  Some of us realize that you use the right tools for the job.  "Bankchain" is like using a wrench to hammer nails because "wrench" is a new buzzword.  Hammers work *way* better, even if a wrench could get you there.

That's true too.  But there's precedent to believe that it will work as I say.  [Elacoin]( went through a hard fork, but even though the miners switched, the exchange didn't, so the miners were forced back onto the exchanges' chain.  Now I concede there are a lot of differences to account for here, but it is interesting to note that if miners can't get real $$$ for their coins, they won't mine for long.

Assume, not *should have assumed*.  There was a time when Satoshi was active on bitcointalk, and we can assume that most of those were legitimate without PGP signatures.
Going forward, because of the extended blackout in communication, any communication from someone claiming to be Satoshi should be treated with skepticism, and requiring a signature to validate that the actual Satoshi is breaking his silence would be required to persuade the majority that it was actually Satoshi.

If the wallets, exchanges, ATMs etc choose a fork, that fork will eventually end up with the most POW.
Miners want to be able to sell their coins on the exchanges.  If the exchanges won't accept their mined coins, then the miners are powerless, and most will quickly convert (or convert back) to the exchanges' coin of choice.
This definition is actually pulled from Satoshi's white paper:

The connotation is pretty strong in general here.  Altcoins are generally viewed as scams or pump and dump schemes that aren't really bringing anything new to the table.

This implies that fee pressure has been building during the process of garnering more users.  But if the fee is building, it will discourage new users precisely when it needs to not discourage users.  
@_date: 2015-08-11 10:03:42
I'd say it's *neither*.
Both chains would be "Bitcoin", but the one with the longest POW would be the official chain, and the other would be an orphaned chain.
We already have terminology for this.  It's not "forkCoin", it's "orphaned chain". 
Here's a relevant quote from the white paper:


making. [...] The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. 
And another:


extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof of-work
is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.
It's pretty plain to see that, even though a fork may be on purpose rather than just a result of timing, the longest chain will be Bitcoin, and any other, smaller chains that contain the genesis block are simply "orphaned", even if someone is still building on them.

*Potentially*.  Reusing addresses increases this likelihood.

Two things;
First, when you use a single address, it allows others to see where that money goes and whose money is coming in.  That can be a good thing (like charity or supporting projects) or a bad thing (employers watch your spending habits, for instance).  
Second, when you *send* bitcoin, you are signing a message.  This provides an attacker with the equation 
    SIGN(SOME KEY, MESSAGE) = SIGNED_MESSAGE 
If you took high school level algebra, you've probably come across
    
    2x + 3y = 5z
    4x + 5y + z = 10
    4x + 2y - z = 5
And you're asked to solve for x, y and z.  Remember those?  Well, every time you broadcast
    SIGN(KEY, NEW_MESSAGE) = NEW_SIGNED_MESSAGE 
and you're using the same value for KEY every time, you're telling attackers that KEY is the same for each one.  This gives an attacker a clue who could, if your RNG is compromised (read more [here]( compute your private key like the algebra above and make off with your bitcoins.
So if you want to be open, you can have a single address.  But you probably shouldn't spend from it very often if you do, because every spend is another potential chink in the armor of your wallet.

By compromised I meant either by an attacker, by shitty code or some other glich.  If it's shitty code, only that code base is affected.  So if you use a new address every time, they can only get one signature, which isn't enough to break the code.  So not necessarily.

What's the alternative?  Bail-outs?  See, if a bank's gonna fail, it very well SHOULD be the people who invested in that bank who lose money.  Even the depositors.  It shouldn't be the government (and by extension, the taxpayers) who bail them out; a lot of people don't trust banks and shouldn't be punished for others' mistakes.  The good banks, the ones who maintain proper reserves and don't make crazy derivative bets or astoundingly bad loans, should remain in business and garner trust with the community, while the bad banks, the ones who are unable to maintain solvent through their own decisions, those banks collapse under their own weight and burn the people who trust them.

See, there's this thing called "supply", and "demand".  When someone demands a good or service, it creates an incentive for people to "supply" it at a certain "cost".  If this good or service comes in different flavors, those flavors may appeal more, or less to different people.  For instance, a co-worker of mine just spent $250 on a keyboard.  A *fucking keyboard*.  That's a mark up of over 1000% to me, because I normally wouldn't pay more than $20 for a new keyboard.  But it has features that he likes, so he paid for it.
Similarly to bitcoin or silver coins.  Silver coins are pretty and take time and effort to mint.  Certain silver coins are more awesome than others, so people demand them more than others, even though the underlying metal is the same.  Similarly with bitcoin, some people don't have access to the same exchanges or brokerage services, and therefore are willing to pay more to someone so they can obtain these bitcoin.  Since the "supply" of bitcoin is more difficult to get for them, the price has to go up in order to convince people to meet the "demand".
It's all pretty complicated, but you get the idea.

Generally, big O notation means "how many computer instructions are necessary for a computer to find the answer to a given problem", where n is the number of inputs.  It's commonly used to show how fast a computer can sort a list (if I give you 100 numbers, how many times do you have to loop through the list to sort them?  One loop is O (n), one loop with one loop inside is O (n^2 ), one loop with one loop inside with one loop inside *that* is O(n^3 ), etc).  Basically, the bigger the number, the harder a problem is.  In the case of network growth, it's not really an appropriate metric, but usually people mean to show how fast the network is growing.  Bigger n, faster growth.

That may be true.  But when you see that an exchange company showed warning signs *months* before the collapse that were hard to ignore (first, seizure of millions by US government from Dwolla, then the price decoupling, and finally the withdrawal delays), you have to wonder why so many people kept playing the game.

I'm pretty sure a "transaction" has indeed occurred.  "Transaction" is Trans (between) action (to do something).  So trading the check for goods/services is indeed a transaction.

I use Bitcoin Spinner for android.  Takes a minute or two to register on the network - registers that "Coins are on their way" as soon as it sees the transaction, and incorporates into total when it gets 6 transactions.  Has QR Code capabilities and an address book.  Only downside is that it can't generate multiple addresses.  But for doing business, you just accept to that address and then transfer to another address offline.

So if you can take something from someone without them knowing, is that ethical?  It seems to me that if you see someone drop something and you don't alert them to it, you would be doing no wrong.  But by not alerting them AND picking up the pennies, you are admitting that those pennies have value and are essentially taking that value because *he doesn't notice* that he's losing them.
GPU cycles aren't free.  They cost money.  Those people have to pay for those cycles and you are using them to generate revenue for yourself.  They do not realize the profit from their cost, and therefore you are stealing.  This is unethical and in my opinion, it's also immoral.  While ethics is a logical determination of a given actions right/wrong status, to me (personal opinion) morals are what you do when no one is looking.  It's whether or not you would commit an act you believe to be wrong if you knew you could get away with it.  This is a personal thing.  You have to answer it for yourself.

I find that to be true more for common, highly desired objects.

Intersango charges a flat .65% fee.  MtGox's highest fee is .60% and it goes downward the more you trade.  How is that cheaper?  CampBX is .55% with "discounts for bulk volume", which is .05% cheaper than Mt Gox, but Mt Gox has the Yubi Key, and I like that.  Plus, Mt Gox has shown that it stands behind its service when it got hacked in 2011.  The trust I have in MtGox is enough to pay the .05% fee.  And don't forget Yubi Key.  Mt Gox has Yubi Key.

With Pyramining, you can't.  You give them bitcoins, they purchase mining machines with them, and then mine your bitcoins back to you (plus interest).  A much cheaper alternative to buying my own equipment, plus a referral bonus.  Catch is, you have to let them hold on to your bitcoins until they mine more.  Obviously I'm taking a risk.  Obviously the safest thing to do is keep my bitcoins in my own wallet (and I know some of the ways to keep that safe too).  I was just saying I get worried when the site that has bitcoins of mine (that I volunteered in hopes of a return) goes down with no notice.  This is not a statement about bitcoin, or the safety of the network.  This was just me getting sketched out that a site that has my coins went down with no notice.  Everything is fine now.

But wouldn't you then have to compete with other people who are "shutting down" and starting up when the fees exceed the cost of finding a block?  Wouldn't then the mining stabilize because those with cheaper electricity costs could start up first, and be more likely to cash in?  Wouldn't that create an equilibrium where those with the cheapest electricity push out those with more expensive electricity, reducing competition and increasing the probability of mining the next block, which encourages more people to get back in, which then pushes out those with high electricity costs, ad infinitum, maybe bouncing back and forth in the short term but over the long term providing a stable production rate?  
Or do I understand this wrong?

I'd say if you don't have knowledge that they are for a fact stolen coins, then what's the problem?  I'd say, if you know that the last transaction on those coins was a thief stealing them, then taking them should be a moral decision.  But even if the coins had been stolen two or more transactions ago, you can't really be responsible for that.  That's part of the idea of fungibility in bitcoins.  The cash in your wallet may have been stolen, but if you aren't sure, then the onus isn't on you.

They've already overcome two of the biggest hurdles that cash faced.
1) You don't have to carry cumbersome physical objects around.  
2) You can transmit them to anyone, anywhere, with minimal effort.
These two reasons are why so many people use credit cards.  Since bitcoin by design already overcomes these hurdles, they have the potential to far surpass the USD and its associated transaction platforms because they have additional benefits, like not being printed with impunity by big government.

It's *your*.


It's *you're*.
Ok, for the sake of anyone else whose followed this rabbit hole down, I'm going to try one more time.  don't feel obligated to admit that you are wrong, just internalize it and understand it.  
You are operating on the assumption that value stems directly from the object itself, as if there is a "value-emenating" orb inside every tangible good that spews value out of things.
That's not how it works.  Value is a highly subjective matter.  An individuals' circumstances dictate what they value and by how much.  This is the basis for an economy; people providing goods and services that other people value, and therefore trade for.  There is no intrinsic value to any good; all value is derived from an individuals' need or desire to obtain said good.  This value is approximated by the term "price". 
Let's take an example.  If you are dying of thirst, is a bottle of water not "worth" more to you (has more value) than if you aren't thirsty?  If this bottle of water went up for auction between a person dying of thirst and someone who is not, I think we can agree the person dying of thirst would offer a larger portion of their material wealth to obtain that bottle (it would fetch a higher price).  To the person dying of thirst, that water's intrinsic properties make it MUCH MORE valuable than it would normally be.
And the converse is also true.  Except in circumstances where pure air is needed for special applications, air is *free*.  That's right, *free*.  But air is of immense value, because it is essential for life.  So the valuation is based on the fact that everyone has access to it, and so no one is willing to pay for it (the price is zero).  Does that mean it has no intrinsic value?  I mean, if it did, then obviously people would pay for it (as price is our measuring stick for value, no?).
See why saying a thing has intrinsic value makes little sense when discussing economic matters?  It doesn't accurately portray reality, because in reality, value is *all* subjective *all the time*.
I hope this made it through to you.  Maybe you misunderstood what I wrote, or I used words you aren't familiar with.
If you need additional information, feel free to respond.  Try not to get too upset; I know that learning new things can be frustrating, so if you get a little antsy, I'll understand.  But try, really try, to see things from a different point of view and you may just see what I'm talking about.

It *should* be.  See, it's *usually* pretty simple to tell in a situation when someone's rights are violated.  But in the case of abortion, it's two people sharing the same body.  At what point does one person's rights trump the others?
Viability of the fetus is accepted to be around 21 weeks (the gestation period of the most premature baby to survive on record).  At that point, the fetus *could* potentially be removed surgically and maintain its own life without a physical connection to another person.
Like I said, I'm pro-choice, prior to 22 weeks, but it shouldn't be: 
A) so cut and dry - after 22 weeks I think a fetus' rights should kick in.  That's plenty of time to discover you are pregnant, and past time where the baby actually has a shot at life physically independent of the biological mother.
B) the only issue you use to vet a candidate.

Similarly, when the state denies marriage licenses to homosexual couples, they're increasingly being shut down too.  These aren't *real* issues.  They're issues designed to polarize the public.

The problem with this is that governments are made up of *people*, many of which have agendas other than the agendas of the people who have elected them.  Our governments are increasingly opaque and more and more show that their interests are veering away from the interests of the people.  Add in that the largest economy in the world (the US) has ruled that money is speech, and now you have a "democratically" elected government that is effectively a for sale government.
In this type of environment, you can be relatively certain that *some* of the elected leaders will do things that are contrary to the best interests of those they represent.  They will use tools they are given for purposes besides those for which they are intended.
I don't trust the government with the power to completely prevent trade of *any* commodity.  


Absolutely.  The problem is when they start deeming people "criminals" because they disagree.  We've already seen inklings of this possibility when Tea Party activist associations were targeted by the IRS unfairly.  When the government's power begins to slip, any dissident will be labeled a "criminal", and now the government has one more tool in its arsenal to oppress its citizens.
The US was founded on the idea that government should not hold an inordinate amount of power over the people.  As a people, we have to make sure that this idea remains intact, or we'll end up sliding into the very situation we fought to free ourselves from; being governed by a group of people who don't allow us any input in how we are governed.

Not entirely; gold is highly malleable and chemically inert.  It doesn't rust, tarnish or turn your skin green.  It's an ideal metal for jewelry making for these reasons.
There are other alloys that work similarly, so it's not entirely about the physics of gold that make it good jewelry, but it helps.

I'd like to see some non-bitcoin related sites covering this story.  For me, anyone who is bullish on bitcoin is not an objective observer.
I googled it, and found no reference to this site on *any* non-bitcoin site; not even **ZeroHedge** or **Infowars**.  That's right; the news sites commonly touted as conspiracy nuts or extreme right wingers haven't run anything on it.
If true, this is some super fucked up shit.  However, the last few years of bitcoin have taught me to be skeptical of all sides.

That's true; especially of adult conversations.  But a 13 year old who tells a teacher that he is *full of shit* should be reprimanded regardless of how you approach the response.  This is not the way for a child to address an authoritative figure.  Responding this way to a cop or a judge as an adult can have catastrophic consequences.  Better for a 13 year old to get ISS or whatnot, even if you decide to use charm, wit and humility to respond.  
Something like 
"Charming, witty and humble response.  Oh, and I'm going to have to write you up for using the word 'shit' in class.  That's never an appropriate way to address a figure in authority, regardless of your opinion, so I hope you understand"

Remember, bitcoin isn't just a payment system.  It's also a value storage mechanism.  It's pretty volatile, but its scarcity makes it very appealing to people who believe the US dollar is approaching its last legs.
Also, people have lost a lot of faith in banks, so they want ways to store value and transact without giving banks the edge.  
People also disagree philosophically with the level of fractional reserve banking that occurs, and wish to remove their support of it.
Censorship resistance is a valuable mechanism, but not the only value add.
Also, expensive?  That it is not, since it doesn't have built in fraud/theft protection.  If you need that, you can pay for it, but many people don't need that, especially with trusted vendors like Overstock or Newegg.

No, there's a specific reason, and that's that objects don't come with value spilling out of their orifices.  It's up to humans to attribute value, and that's subjective.  Hence "subjective theory", and it's not "bullshit", it's the most widely accepted theory for valuation.

However, if you come to me and I say "I want my lawn mowed and I'll pay you with a couch", you can't call the police and be all like "He won't offer to pay me dollars for mowing his lawn".

Yep; and you're doing it right now because you believe you have the moral high ground.  This is a very prevalent theme throughout human society.  This concept of "I'm better than you" isn't something you can just legislate away.


Better not be public resources, because they *should not* be allowed to discriminate.  They are paid for by all the public, and therefore all the public should have access.


There are a number of reasons for this, including broken family structures that *are* a result of multiple generations of slavery splitting families apart because they were just thought of as commodities.  This is wrong.


Yes, because they were *enslaved*.  That is *wrong* because it takes away their right to freedom.  I don't disagree with that sentiment.


No.  It began with the belief that "You are property".  That is wrong.  Simply believing you are better than someone is *ok*.  It's snotty and rude and not very nice, but it doesn't inherently take away rights.


But if I make up other reasons to refuse service, then it's ok.

They froze my account at the grocery store where I have been shopping every week for over a year.  Twice.  The second time I didn't have any alternate modes of payment and had to spend time on the phone with customer support to re-activate my card while keeping a 3 year old entertained.
The problems are more than just "unauthorized charges or no refund".
*Of course* there are no recourse with Bitcoin.  It's literally digital cash.  That's *the idea*.  Bitcoin isn't a company.  It's not a business.  Visa is a for-profit business with a business model that includes providing the service of safeguarding the average user at a price.  The price is collected through merchant charges.  That's why there are a good deal of businesses that are cash only, or at least businesses who offer discounts for cash.  It's because they can accept the currency directly instead of having to pay a middle man.  
You're comparing bitcoin (a technology that provides true digital ownership capabilities) to a for-profit company.  
A better comparison would be bitcoin to cash.  Neither one has any recourse, so that specific argument doesn't make sense as an *argument against bitcoin*.  It does make sense as an *advertisement for Visa* though.

Except that's the only example of banning alternative implementations that utilize the existing blockchain.
Just keep dancing around it.  Do you believe that Gavin's promotion of XT was an attempt to encourage destabilization?  If yes, then you'll need to provide evidence of that.  If no, then your entire line of reasoning is irrelevant, and you are just trying not to answer the question.

All industry besides Jewelry, Coins/Bars and ETFs make up around 10% of the demand for gold.
Realistically, if all "investment" uses for gold disappeared overnight, we'd expect an industry valuation of around [$120 an ounce]( at current prices.
Gold does have some characteristics that make it well suited to use as jewelry, but anyone buying jewelry with gold in it is doing it because gold is more valuable, and not because of any intrinsic properties, since alloys can mimic jewelry-related properties (color, resistance to corrosion, being inert, etc) almost precisely.

Exactly; and why does a larger block size prevent miners from keeping it smaller and just not including transactions that have a fee below what they want to include?
I used to be of the mindset that you had to keep the blockchain scarce to enforce fees.  I had my mind changed when someone explained to me that miners will keep the resource that generates them money as scarce as they need to in order to turn a profit.  Too scarce; no one pays because it's too expensive.  Not scarce enough; everyone uses it and the miners lose potential revenue.
In the end, the miners will price it how they need to in order to stay in business.

"True" Keynesian economics states that governments should do the inverse of their populous with respect to spending.  Economy doing super awesome?  Govt should save some money.  Economy in the shitter?  Govt should buy some stuff.  If properly implemented, governments create a surplus during times of plenty that can be used to buy critical infrastructure when labor is low because the economy is slumping.  This props up the economy when needed and gives the government a break on prices.  It's supposed to help mitigate the boom/bust cycle to a degree.
Somehow current legislators and most economists have forgotten the part where the government *saves*.  They don't want to mitigate the upswings, and therefore never have the resources to mitigate the downswings.

What happens is there comes a block where an old version of the code says "That block is invalid" whereas the new version says "That block is valid".
Miners on the old version build a separate chain, while miners on the new version build on the existing chain.
If your client says the contentious block is valid, you follow fork A.  If it says it's not valid, you follow fork B.
  Transactions in fork A aren't visible in fork B and vice versa after the fork.

Sure, there is a small bit of inflation.  But that six bucks is spread over all coins.  That means each transaction is (25/1000)/14000000 of a bitcoin dilution per transaction.

1) It doesn't *oppose* natural cycles in business.  It just opposes some of the *consequences*.  Businesses still fail, investments still consolidate.

It's just if they save a good portion of it for when people are down and out, they can mitigate the *consequences*.  If you want to see the actual cycles themselves opposed, see TARP.

No, because the "change" is really the left over from an input.  So your "change" is now a new output that's not valid on the other chain, because the transaction that created it isn't on the other chain.


Hence all the hemming and hawing.  If the majority of the users/miners don't agree, you're going to have a bad time.  Before a potential hard fork, we should all be *relatively* certain that the majority of users will update.


You *can* have both, but when you do one or the other may suffer, so overall I agree with your assessment.  And truly, I don't like the idea of giving my bitcoin to someone I don't trust.  Just like I don't like paying in cash with someone I don't trust or isn't in front of me.

Yea, there are similarities between Europe and the US.  As an example, culturally there's less emphasis on family and a higher emphasis on individuality.  For instance; "Eastern" cultures are more likely to house their elders, whereas "Western" cultures are more likely to pay an external company to do so (nursing homes, etc).  "Eastern" cultures place a much higher emphasis on parental decision making; like who you marry.  "Western" cultures promote child's choice.
Moving to the business world; Eastern companies rely much more heavily on interpersonal networking.  Bribery is an common/expected business practice.  
Even language; there's a focus in "Western" worlds on forthrightness, while in "Eastern" worlds connotation is much more important and more highly pronounced.
Whether or not *you* see the similarities has no effect on their existence.  My definition is perfectly broad, and you probably need to take another look.

So instead of "non-perishable products", use the word "labor", and instead of "I", use "The government".  The government gets additional incentives here on top of the $$$ savings in that the purchasing of labor when it's cheap supports the labor market and gives its citizens jobs.

Nope; government decided slavery was tolerable before there was open racism.  Black people sold black people.
The concept of "owning people" transcends race; Jews were slaves in Egypt.  


Yea, sure.  We can both agree that removing people's right to freedom is wrong.  That doesn't mean that people hating based on race necessarily leads to that, nor does it mean that allowing people to be bigoted means we must also allow them to take away others' rights to freedom.


Yes; it is based on that belief.  But that doesn't mean we have to allow the end game just because we allow the belief.


That's a garbage assessment of the situation.  Pervasive racism exists now; black people routinely deride white people, but that's ok because it used to be reversed.  I don't see any black people owning whites, but I do see black people hating whites because "white".  So your premise is fucking flawed.


That's exactly my point; there ARE other ways to fix the issue.  One way is through education and public pressure. When society as a whole stands up and says "hey; we won't shop at your store if they can't too", then you get change without government involvement.
You seem to think I advocate open racism.  I don't.  I just don't think we have to bring the law into it.  I believe that bringing the law into it breeds resentment and reinforces the "Us vs Them" mentality, except now "Them" has big daddy law on their side.

I don't think the paper you linked exactly supports your conclusion.


The way I read this is if we don't force *some* constraint on the block size, *and* we allow the fee to float, then the network security will collapse to zero.  However, if we force a fee through the protocol *or* constrain the block size to a size small enough to cause *some* restriction, security is maintained.

No it's not.  Regardless of what the government does with the currency once it collects it, you need to have it to pay taxes.
Here's a [source]( ^warning ^pdf : 


by Knapp (1924), which was also accepted by Keynes (1930). Chartalist theory maintains government issued fiat money has value because governments demand taxes be paid in sovereign money, thereby creating public demand it. 
This idea that the demand for sovereign money is in part due to the obligation to use it to pay taxes is uncontroversial.
Here's [another]( 




So lets address this next part:


No; you can't say it would *necessarily* increase because you haven't justified where the demand *comes from in the first place*. 


But if the Vikings didn't demand seashells for taxes, then why would anyone accept their seashells for payment?  You haven't addressed what drives the demand for these seashells if no one needs them for trade.

You are not considering the fact that the total that will be mined is known, and therefore priced in.  You could look at it this way; when coins are mined they aren't being "created", but "discovered".  Looking at it that way, there is no inflation at all.  If you assume that 1 bitcoin is 1/21000000 of the total economy, then you experience no inflation whatsoever.


You aren't factoring in the fact that more transactions means 
each person needs to contribute less per transaction.  The idea is that if we're at the final mining stages, either bitcoin will be used a *lot*, or not very much at all.  At that point we'll have had to increase the block size (it's coming, prepare yourselves) and tons of transactions will be jammed into a single block, so you won't need as much per transaction (as we do now with the subsidy).


Maybe, maybe not.  But that's purely conjecture at this point.

It is indeed what he had in mind.  [Look](


So it's right there; pretty plain and simple.


Yea, gentle up and down cycles would be great.  The problem is, booms and busts are usually anything but gentle.  Look at natural systems; a bust could be compared to a forest fire.  Is that gentle?  Fuck no.  But it burns out the bullshit and allows the strong to re-emerege.
The reasoning here is not to *eliminate* booms and busts, but to help ease the pain and level things out *to a degree*.


That's garbage; governments who save surpluses to fund economic downturns would be in a great position, and if central planners could truly implement something of this nature, it would work rather well.
The problem IMO is the pesky thing we call democracy.  Since politicians have to pander to their constituents, they promise spending, spending, spending.  Most people only pay cursory attention to politics and government spending, and only notice when *their* benefits are getting cut or *their* services are being stopped.  Well, guess who these people don't vote for when the government starts saving?  The incumbent.  So politicians have to continue promising and spending for these votes in order to remain in power.
If you could truly save surpluses for economic downturns, it'd go a long way to helping economies stabilize.  But it's a politically infeasible maneuver to cut spending, ever.

Still doesn't require the block chain.  Since one federated entity is the source, you just get it from them.  If you want to use a torrent style distribution mechanism, you can; no block chain necessary.  If you don't trust it, poll the federated server.  


Again, no need to use block chains; these five entities are all trusted, because otherwise 3 could collude to take control.  


Never?  Then I'm not really trusting the server, but the nodes.  That makes it *de*-centralized.


A chain made up of blocks who use cryptographic hashes to refer to the block before it to show linear progression.
If you don't need decentralized, you can just use cryptographic hashes and a database.  There is literally no reason to use a chain of blocks for a centralized store of data.

So reddit provides this useful tool that I don't think many people know about.  They call it the "downvote" and it's represented by a small arrow pointing in the downward direction.  There's a mirror opposite arrow that represents the "upvote".
So what happens is, when you press the down vote, the comment you are downvoting gets a -1.  Similarly, if you press the up vote, the comment you are upvoting gets a +1.  The aggregate score for a comment determines its "point value", shown to the right of the poster's name (before the comment post time).  This is a bit simplified (reddit "fuzzes" the votes to prevent gaming), but you get the picture.
If enough people down vote a comment, it gets hidden.  It's a surprisingly effective system.

Banks provide the service of holding your money safely (which costs some non-negative amount).  If they can loan it out quickly and collect high interest rates on it, they offer some to you to entice you to do business with them.  When they *can't* loan it out quickly, they don't make money on it, so keeping it safe costs them.  
Economy = Good; banks pay you for the privilege of holding your money.
Economy gets bad enough, holding cash is costly, because the banks can invest in less places, and no one else wants to invest either, meaning they store their money with banks.   High demand for bank services means bank service prices go up (from below zero) and are just now reaching the point where banks need to charge for their services because they aren't making money any more.

No.  Fungibility means an intrinsic quality of the input makes it unspendable (like a blacklist).  Just creating a transaction that breaks the rules is not an example of fungibility, because you could create other transactions to recombine the coins in a way that makes them spendable again.

Well, if we look biologically, a fetus is *kind* of a person, and more so the longer they are carried.
IMO, if a fetus can be surgically removed and exist without a physical link to another human being, that's when it should be considered a person.  This is called the point of viability and is generally accepted to be around 21 weeks.  So I say, split the difference.
Before 20 weeks; if you want, remove the growth.
After 20 weeks; don't kill the baby.
Seems like a pretty reasonable compromise, especially when outreach and educational programs can do a lot to help young potential parents understand that adoption is an option, and that giving someone a child to raise can create so much joy in a couple's life who otherwise couldn't have children.

The most recent executive order I'm aware of on the topic allows the US executive branch to put someone on a list (without due process or oversight) and then, if any US citizen is caught doing business with anyone on that list, they have their assets seized (again, no due process, no oversight).
With a perfect, infallible government, I may have a different stance.  But I don't trust *people* enough to agree that *anyone* should have that kind of power.


How about how we basically equipped ISIS with military weaponry to attempt to kill and maim the Syrian government?  Or how we basically created Osama Bin Laden to fight the Russians?  Or Operation Fast and Furious arming Mexican drug cartels?  Or how about CIA funding drug trafficking in Latin America during the Contra Wars which ended in the Iran-Contra affair?

Someone doesn't understand the [subjective theory of value](
Nothing has "inherent" value.  Value is a human generated trait that we project onto things.  It has intrinsic "properties" and that gives it "value", but value is not intrinsic to an object.  I may value gold way less than you do, because I have no need for it.  So I never buy it at these prices, since my valuation is lower than the person whose willing to buy it at today's prices.

But if it relies on trust, then you've defeated the "open" part, which is initially why I thought you said a central blockchain is better than a central database server.
That's my point.  If you need trust, then just use tools that are robust, scalable and lightning quick.  Who wants to wait for something to clear *just for the fun of it*?


Why would I as a user want to use nodes instead of direct hits to the server?  What's my incentive to trust them over the server itself?


Of course, I understand it's a thought experiment.  But as a thought experiment, I don't see the viability of a central party using block chains at all.  It makes no sense to use a tool designed to establish trust in a decentralized manner if you *aren't decentralized*.

Of course, if people are using bitcoin as a back-end, then its value must necessarily climb (aka more demand).

No, arbitrage is taking advantage of multiple markets' difference in price only.  To use a large accumulated position to modify a single market's value by selling large positions *with the intent of changing the perceived price for further gain* is more than just arbitrage.  That's manipulation.  To be clear, I don't have a problem with it,  but let's call a spade a spade.  When you buy or sell large positions on major exchanges, you are communicating supply and demand to other actors.  If you buy or sell with the intent to convince those other actors to act in a way that is contrary to how they would otherwise act absent your actions, you are trying to manipulate them.

1.  Not personally experiencing a situation where a technology would help you is not the same as "It doesn't solve any problem."  It very much solves a problem; it creates distributed, decentralized consensus.  This has never before been achieved autonomously.

Whether or not *you* personally need this is irrelevant to the fact that *some* people need and/or can use this feature.

Ok, since I'm lazy and don't wish to work out either post at the moment, let's throw it out and assume that the two would be similarly secure at similar hashrates.
When accepting Litecoin, you are less likely to be the victim of a double spend.  Since a transaction in a block will take precedence over any transactions not in a block, Litecoin is less likely to experience any sort of double-spend, since it's first confirmation happens more quickly.
After a single confirmation, the only true attack vector is to be a miner and find a replacement block.  Litecoin thus eliminates an attack vector that can be performed by *any* spender.
Don't misunderstand, Bitcoin is magnitudes more secure than Litecoin because of its hashrate.  This is an academic comparison of apples to apples, were Litecoin to acheive hashrate parity.

Not quite.  While it may not be currently causing any economic action up or down, it is not economically pointless to the holder.  
When you provide more value to society than you receive from it, you end up with excess.  Some people decide to use that excess on consumables, other choose to hold on to that excess and accumulate it so they can use it later to purchase large items that cost more than is economically feasible for them to buy with a single paycheck.
Yes, getting them to spend that money now makes now's economy grow faster.  However, saving that money makes tomorrow's economy grow faster, when its spent.  


Au contraire.  By "hoarding", you are making an implicit declaration that bitcoins have more value to you than the current price point.  This is an economic signal that others use to make their decisions. 
If no one desired bitcoin, then no one would accept it.  By hoarding, you are saying "their value is more to me than what people are offering to pay".
It's like saying "Well, since everyone just wants to use aluminum and no one wants to hoard it, it must have more value than gold, because people are hoarding gold like crazy, and most aren't really using it".

Doesn't seem strange; the betters could both agree on the source for the final score ahead of time.  What's strange about that?  You say it needs an "oracle", but only insofar as a specific contract needs input.  The system doesn't require one built into the core...


How so?  The oracle can be different for every contract; how does that require a level of centralization?  All it requires is consensus between the two parties about the nature of the contract.


But that's not the goal, right?  The goal is smart contracts.  The currency is just the mechanism for preventing abuse.

Alright, admitted.  I mixed that up.  Exchanges are not market makers.  However, market makers DO create markets by holding assets and are ready to buy and sell.  This doesn't change the fact that a market is a subset of the entire economy.  


The reason I mentioned flea markets and supermarkets is that they are "markets" in that they provide a place to buy/sell (or one or the other) goods.  They don't encompass the *entire* economy of buying and selling, but are a specific subset which represents a "market".


It doesn't; I meant in a single market with longs/shorts being different positions in said market.
The bottom line is, you can manipulate a market if you hold a large position in the commodity traded on said market.  Saying otherwise is just being argumentative for no apparent reason.

True, the minimum is set by the merchant who doesn't want to eat the large fees for the small transaction.  But if I'm in a game, and I have a one off purchase (for instance, if Farmville took bitcoin, I could pay $.0005 to remove a tree.  Normally I'd just work around it, but today I need this specific tree removed.  Instead of $.0005, I may have to pay $.0035.  But I *really* need to remove this tree, so it's worth $.03), I may be inclined.
Currently I have to buy a large block of divisible credits for $1.00.  Fuck that.  That gives me one removed tree and 900 credits I didn't want.
Just saying, I could see situations where it'd be nice if I the consumer could choose whether or not I wanted to execute that microtransaction.
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:54:34


Only if the buyer doesn't sign (i.e. there's a dispute) AND the arbiter disappears.  Only then is the transaction invalid.
So while this is an issue, it is MASSIVELY less risk to take than to deposit funds under the control of the arbiter directly, which means that the scenario above is *still possible*, but now there is much less reward for the arbiter to just bounce because he can't actually steal the funds.

Ok but you understand that if you can intentionally change the price, you can use that to your advantage to make additional profit, no?
Selling lots of bitcoin *quickly* moves the price down *quickly*.  When you eat into large amounts of bids, you drastically swing the exchange value, especially in smaller markets like bitcoin.  Doing so can enable you to quickly lower the price to cover shorts, and then slowly rebuild your position at the lower price without swinging it back upward.
Are you seriously suggesting that taking advantage of slower movers isn't possible?  Do you honestly believe that there's no way to take advantage of knowing in advance what the price is about to do?
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:46:08
If you steal, it's not victimless.  Victimless crimes are crimes where *risk* of damage is high (like driving recklessly, or doing drugs).  Stealing has a clearly defined victim, and is almost always referred to as "the victim".
Also, property rights are what makes free markets possible.  Without them your market isn't free.

Well, right.  The more depth you have to your order books, the more difficult it ends up being to move the price.  More people means more competition for the buys/sells, which can narrow the gap between bids or between asks, and require more volume to move the prices.  That makes it more stable.


Sure.  People try to detect and punish people for it, but in today's market it is difficult to detect motive when it's bots trading with bots.

Well, correlation doesn't imply causation.  Maybe they vested their interest because of what they're saying.
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:29:48


No.  There's a reason that they call exchanges [Market Makers](  They make markets.  Think about it this way.  A "flea market" is a single group of people buying and selling stuff in a large (usually) outdoor area.  A "super market" is a market that sells lots of stuff, including groceries.  You are misinterpreting *market* for *economy*.


[Manipulation]( 2(b) to control or play upon by artful, unfair, or insidious means *especially to one's own advantage*
Obviously its unfair if you have lots of a commodity and other people don't, and this kind of manipulation plays on investor psychology so I'd say it requires a certain amount of artfulness (swing too hard and the market may not recover.  Swing too softly and no one notices), therefore the scenario we're discussing fits the definition.  If we're arguing definitions, dumping a large supply of a commodity to eat into the bids so as to *give the impression* that a commodity's price is lower so you can cover your shorts before the market adjusts is indeed manipulation.


I agree that it's a form of arbitrage to buy from someone and sell elsewhere.  But you're not taking into account intent, which changes the game.  Also, arbitrage is the act of buying from one and selling to another to take advantage of differences in price.  If you're intentionally trying to depress one market so you can strengthen your position in another market *of the same commodity*, then you are manipulating people to get the price you want.  Again, I'm not arguing whether or not manipulation is a bad thing for the economy in general, or even for the health of a specific investment.  I believe that manipulation introduces volatility.  The more that manipulation can create volatility, the thinner the markets, and therefore the riskier the investment.  Larger volumes lead to harder manipulation and more stability, which can lead to safer investments.


You're oversimplifying (I think on purpose).  


Oh yes, I agree that manipulation is part of the game.  I'm aware of market manipulators and make my investments accordingly, as should everyone.

Except they can't refuse transactions.  Bitcoin is a push mechanism.  All they can do is *not honor* the transactions you send.  But they can't stop you from sending bitcoins to their address.
That's why it sucks to try to track coins.  If an attacker just deposits a portion (say 10%) in known legitimate addresses (like charities or exchanges), those legitimate addresses now have a portion of their balance as "tainted coins".  After two or three transactions, how do you tell who was complicit and who unwittingly received coins to their address?

Well, your point is that a hedge is a stock that is *known* to move in the opposite direction of another stock for logical, real-world or market-driven reasons.
I'm saying that you are being too specific, and that a hedge could also be (and more often *is*),  a stock (or commodity) that is *expected* to move in the opposite direction for logical, real-world or market-driven reasons.
You can't know if a stock is going to move up or down, even in relationship to the hedges.  Hedges all carry risk of not perfectly correlating, or other market forces interfering, so they can't be *known* to move in any specific direction.  They can *only* be *expected* to move in any specific direction.  Hence, your point is a little off the mark, and requires a small adjustment.
Bitcoin is not a *perfect* hedge, but it is a *decent* one.

I've been over this with other Calvinists, and while predestination may be part of it (God is *all-knowing*), free will still plays in.  God knowing what we will do is not the same as God doing it.  God doesn't *make* us do anything.  He put us here knowing full well what we will choose, but deigns not to interfere with those choices.  That's one of the big reasons I rejected God in the first place; he knows the suffering that is occurring on Earth and chose to create us anyway.  That seems illogical.  If I knew with certainty that my own child would suffer for his whole life, I'd probably choose just not to have him instead.

What constitutes "too tainted"?  What if the coins aren't actually stolen, but just claimed to be?  How do you make this so that users who have done nothing wrong aren't punished?  Where's the tradeoff point between "stop the bad guys" and "don't do any business"?


What does that have to do with your moral obligation?  If you are talking *legal* obligation, I'm not an expert and I don't believe there is precedent for accepting bitcoins that have been stolen.  If you are speaking of legal obligation, why would BTC-E have any here?  There has been no report filed of stolen funds AFAIK, so I would assume there's no legal obligation here.  Therefore this central authority you are appealing to doesn't apply here.

It's not difficult to utilize HD Wallets, which generate a new transaction for every incoming payment.  If bitcoin becomes more widely adopted by large scale companies, I have no problem envisioning wallets that are specifically designed to minimize input mixing.  
Also, if you get payments you don't expect, you leave them alone or turn them over to the government as an escheatment.

No no no.  Not forwarding transactions was what was causing problems.  Simply pretending to be many nodes was NOT the cause of the problems.

Well, in order to hoard you have to buy (or earn), and buying does set the value, at least according to the order books, and earning implies economic activity.
See, that's the other side of the coin.  In order to save, you have to earn more than you need.  Haven't you *already* done your part for the economy?  You have increased the economic output more than you've consumed.

There are many incentives to run a node that aren't altruistic in nature.  
1) Trust.  Large exchanges and large merchants will most likely always wish to maintain an up-to-date copy for their own records.
2) Speed.  Querying a local block-chain or parsing a local block-chain into a local db increases speed by many numbers of times.
3) Development.  Having a local copy makes development much easier.

You keep saying "trustless networks", but not everyone is shooting for that.  The Hawala network was insanely successful and relied *solely* on trust.

Bitcoin *could* provide a viable alternative should it reach critical mass, it just can't now because of volatility concerns.

You can just use a swap file if you don't want to mess with re-partitioning.  The first thing you should do is determine if you have swap set up.  Using
    top
You can determine how much swap space you have and whether or not that's your issue.
Of course, your *first* step should be to read the debug.log in your /.bitcoind folder (or wherever you installed it) to see if there's anything else causing your problem (like permissions issues).  Did you install bitcoin as root?  Are you trying to run as root?  My advice would be *not* to install as root, but install as a special "bitcoin" user.  Then run it as that bitcoin user.  Or just use your own user.  I try to only reserve root for system related stuff.

I don't believe there is (or should be) a reasonable expectation that I should know the bitcoin I receive are stolen either.  Why should the pawn shop bear the burden of making sure that some party A didn't do something to party B before A transacted with the pawn shop?  Why should anyone?  Should I make sure my checkout lady isn't cheating on her husband, or beating her kids before I shop at my grocery store too?  Obviously if I saw her doing these things, or had reason to believe she was, then my moral obligation changes.  
Here, look at it this way.  If your friend gives you something, like a video game, do you have a moral obligation to determine if it is stolen before you accept it?  What about a coworker, or someone you've only met a few times?
Or put another way; should I have to research every part maker for every product I buy to make sure they are not engaging in forced child labor?  What happens when I see a report that says the company that manufactures it engages in forced child labor?

Sure, but that doesn't mean it'll get confirmed either.  See, nodes look for transactions whose outputs are spent elsewhere.  If it finds them, it ignores the transaction.  So nodes only keep the "first" (as in, first to them) transaction.  If you send the second one quick enough, you may subvert the first one for  some nodes, and split the network.  Also, miners can optionally choose the transaction with the bigger fee instead of the "first" transaction.  It's really a tossup as to whether the first or second gets included, but usually an unconfirmed transaction can be "knocked out" of the network by sending a new transaction with a bigger fee.

Well, our abstraction serves us well, and helps us to keep records of similar things.  It's EXTREMELY useful.
Also, once you make the jump to abstraction in any form, converting to other forms is very simple.  Since humans have the capability of advanced abstraction, it makes sense that they would develop similar modes.  
Remember also, language is an abstraction too.  "That thing" is not *actually* the thing, but a reference to it.  So math is like the language of logical groupings.

It is decidedly *not* made explicit in Romans 9.  Read it.  Romans 9 is a set of rhetorical questions.  Those questions are answered in Romans 10.  Look at verse 9:


Romans 9 spoke of a Pharoah who *did not have faith*.  He's fully capable of utilizing anyone for his own ends.  And Pharoah was raised up so that God could use him, even though he didn't have faith.  
How is faith being used as an excuse to torture?  He tortured Job *even though he did have faith*.  
It says explicitly at the end of chapter 9 that God put a stumbling block at Zion that those who assume they can discover through their own works how to be righteous will be cast down, and only those who have faith that only God can determine righteousness will be saved.  Using faith is not a method for choosing a scapegoat so God can do what he wants, it's to weed out those who arrogantly think they can do it themselves.

Have you seen 2013's media coverage of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:59:12
No.  Remember in high school where you had to solve systems of equations?  Like
    x + y + z = 19
    2x + 3y - z = 17
    3x - 4y + 2z = 6
Well, when you reuse your address, you are basically churning out additional equations to fit with a much more complex version of this.  Now, if your RNG (Random Number Generator) is good, then you most likely won't encounter a problem, as it will make this system ridiculously difficult to solve.  However, if your computer has a broken RNG (as we saw with Android last year), repeated signing of transactions using the same address could potentially reveal a solvable system of equations, and make it possible for someone to discover your private key.  
That's why they say always use a new address.  Now, when you *receive* bitcoin, your private key is not involved, so you can receive as much as you want if you have no concerns about privacy.  But repeatedly *sending* from that same address exposes the potential I mentioned above, and since using the same address for receiving implies using that address for sending, you'll have a difficult time keeping them separate.
I don't know how Trezor implements their RNG so I can't comment specifically on them, but as they use a deterministic wallet (right?), I don't see a reason to re-use the same address, unless you're posting it on an ad or something.

So if the token is pegged to a dollar,  and the token is worth less than a dollar,  why would you use it as anything but the pegged value?  I get that if it's worth less than a dollar,  using it as a dollar gives you the benefit of the crypto currency,  but to use it *as crypto* would not make any sense.

I'd argue it most certainly does, because Man is fallible, and therefore anything written must also be fallible.  Also, the Bible, *in Greek* is not the original, and thus is susceptible to man's fallibility.  There are books that were removed, and edits made to the current books.
And he said in no uncertain terms that they were chosen, true.  But he does not say that their own decisions (known to God ahead of time) did not affect God's judgment on the matter.  So *even if this passage is accurate*, it still doesn't imply that we've no say in the matter.

Violent crimes directly threaten another's liberty.  Operating an exchange without a license does no such thing.  I'm not advocating taking away laws against *fraud*.

How do you figure?  Source that comment please.  Now, assuming this comment is correct, that only applies to *current* users.  Those are people who see value in bitcoin for a myriad of reasons, *one* of which is low cost transactions.  Now, how about *new* users?  If they see higher fees off the bat, why would they switch?  Bitcoin must also contend with the demand inelasticity for current payment models.  


How do you arrive at that number?  I would most definitely not use bitcoin the same way if this were the actual fee.  Right now the fee is less than a penny.  It's negligible.  As soon as bitcoin's cost per transaction is non-negligible, it's going to massively affect bitcoin's utility.  
At $1 per transaction, all transactions under $33.33 cost more on the bitcoin network than the Visa network (and that's assuming **3%** transaction costs, which is a pretty high estimate), and the bitcoin network pushes that cost to the consumer, instead of allowing merchants to hide and obfuscate it.  That eliminates a *big* selling point of bitcoin. 


For people looking for those properties.  Not everyone is using bitcoin for its proof-of-existence or m-of-n transactions.  They use it to make internet commerce more closely reflect in person commerce.

No, the fault isn't with the currency, it's with the storage mechanism.


Then they shouldn't store their money in a place where access to their e-mail account gives them access to their money (like, banks, credit cards, or any other existing online banking system).  If you keep money anywhere you can click "Forgot Password?" and gain access through e-mail, you need to be eternally vigilant.  You can't always recover losses from a bank, regardless of what people tell you.  It can also be really damaging to lose your identity, even if it's eventually reversible.


Really?  So the multiple billions of dollars every year that disappear due to fraud is not real?  A scare tactic?

Except most businesses aren't being rejected by banks for accounts.


But converting large piles of cash to bitcoin allows them to create a much more robust storage mechanism.  Also, if other parts of the industry also begin using bitcoin, they could pay their suppliers and vendors in it too.


True, but it's one alternative that gives them the ability to store value securely.

I agree to an extent, but would be extremely open to a situation where people who were interested in a specific bill had some sort of direct representation.  Like maybe there was one extra seat per state in the Senate and Congress that would vote on bills based on the direct vote of anyone in the state who wished to vote on that bill directly.  That probably wouldn't work as it stands but you get the idea.
I'd also like a place on my 1040 where I could specify a bit of where my taxes go.  Not all, mind you, the powers that be would never go for that.  But if I could delegate where 5% of my tax money went, I'd feel like my personal opinion was valued higher than I currently feel it to be valued.

One thing I haven't seen mentioned here yet is how this will add legitimacy to bitcoin by implying backing from a higher moral authority (God).  Since these private housing providers are sanctioned by Brigham Young, which I assume to mean they conform to Brigham Young requirements for students, which I further assume are pretty strict and closely aligned with religious rights and rituals, this can be seen as tacit acceptance by Brigham Young of bitcoin.  
To me this means Brigham Young allows the use of bitcoin, which means that bitcoin doesn't somehow conflict with their belief system, which means that God Loves bitcoin.

Virtually free money transfers.  Cashlike transactions in a digital world.  Freedom from clearing houses that can freeze your assets.  These things have *worth*.  Deflation is only awful in a situation where you create money by issuing debt.  When people stop spending, they pay back debt and destroy money, lowering the money supply.  Bitcoins money supply won't *shrink* (except when people lose it), it will stay basically constant.  This is why the deflation of bitcoin can't really be compared to the deflation of USD.

If mining isn't profitable the system collapses or becomes susceptible to attack.  That's bad.  In addition, when the hard cap is hit, companies will be incentivized to minimize transactions, doing things off-chain whenever possible, and possibly contracting out transaction bundling companies, which keeps the size of the blockchain in check and keeps the cost of running a full node down.  If the block chain doesn't become a scarce resource (if we keep increasing the hard cap), these things won't happen.

To say a statement is wrong is not immediately a red herring.  I wasn't attempting to discredit your point, but rather to poke fun at you for saying words have "distinct" meanings, when obviously they do not always, since homonyms exist.  I did not state that "distinct" was a homonym, but rather that your statement is faulty because of their existence.  You were snarky about something that was wrong.  I just called you on it.  
Indeed, this whole discussion is a red herring to my original point; that bitcoin has *clearly identifiable (or distinct)* libertarian properties.  By attacking (incorrectly) my usage of the word distinct, you are attempting to discredit my point that bitcoin was designed to be free from government control and to exist as a *voluntary* currency which is very in line with libertarian ideals.


In the context of two opposing teams, only one can have a disadvantage.  The qualifier "distinct" is not meant to imply that they have the unique quality of being at a disadvantage, because that would be redundant.

The more bitcoins that are stolen, the more value there is in cleaning them, because there is more srutiny regarding their whereabouts.  People won't care about 1btc here or there, but if an exchange loses 10,000 btc people will care, and people will be willing to steal and clean 10,000 btc.

Remember, in a deterministic wallet, a key is derived kinda like this:

SHA512 is a one way hash, so there's no going back.  Therefore you can't gain the parent from a child.  In addition, since the chain code is *not* public, you can't derive it's *children* either.

Personally, if you are mining at a loss, you'd probably better contribute to society running a folding rig (that could also run a full btc node).  You can still fiddle with settings and monitor uptime, which is basically what mining is, and you'd be benefiting humanity in a way that bitcoin can never match.

If by "in your hand" you mean "in your MtGox account" then sure.  But the trouble is that USD is very difficult to get out of MtGox if you can even accomplish the feat.  
The price of Bitcoin is ~$100 on campbx and coinbase.  Why would you go to MtGox to BUY?  That's silly.  The only reason it's not is if you already have USD in MtGox and can't seem to get it out.  This is putting pressure on the buy side of things, because getting MtGox-dollars isn't the same as getting actual dollars or bitcoins.  Since the "actual dollars" option is not currently operational, you either leave your money in MtGox or cash out in bitcoin and transfer it somewhere else.

It was.  Any address can send and receive to any other address.  The rest is politics.  How did anyone not see that a fully traceable technology would not have programmatic tracing applied to it?  But the beauty is, a tainted address can send and receive bitcoin too.  No central agency can dictate "bad" addresses because as soon as they do the user can send to a new address that is "unknown".  They may say this new address is "bad" because it received bad coins, but then how do you distinguish a willing recipient vs an unwilling recipient?  You can't.  Central agencies can only dictate "good" addresses with enough certainty for people to trust it.
All that does is give us the option of signing up with the government for an "approved" account.  How is this any different from being able to keep your money in cash or in the bank?  You voluntarily hand over personal info to the bank, but that doesn't prevent another from conducting business purely in cash.  And so it is with these lists and bitcoin.

This isn't "psuedo-legal science", it's logic.


So you ARE beginning to understand my point.  Think real hard about what the government wants here.  Is it to stop people from making things and calling them money?  No, not at all.  The government's goal is to catch money launderers.  Since trying to have the miners do it is bound to backfire (show someone you can't enforce the rules and all of a sudden they aren't rules anymore), and once they associate an address with an identity they can track transactions, they target the exchanges.  
The miners aren't really in control.  The "minter" of a currency has to be in control of the currency.  Miners are not in control, and therefore are not minters of currency.


I don't think they are called "mining machines" either.  **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuits (ASIC) is an acronym to describe any chip that is designed for a specific algorithm.  They aren't called "premined bitcoin distribution systems" any more than they are called "bitcoin minting systems".

You aren't making sense.  If they wanted to overwhelm the system, why are they waiting on their competitors to release their products?  If they are trying to overwhelm the system, they should become &gt; 50% now, and not wait until later.  


As long as they don't use more electricity than the btc they produce, they won't die.  And since they only use like 2.5 W, it'll be a LONG time before these things start to lose money.


Avalon is releasing their chips in the next couple of weeks; this will GREATLY expand the network and make it MUCH more difficult for AsicMiner to overwhelm anything.

@_date: 2013-06-11 11:26:39


There are lots of plans in the works for more infrastructure for buying and selling bitcoin.  This should continue to become less of a problem.


This is why Avalon has been so integral in this entire process.  They are releasing hundreds of thousands of chips with insane processing power for very little money.  This is allowing lots of DIY ASIC modules to be developed.  Companies are starting up to manufacture and deliver ASIC modules to anyone with $200 or so.  This will GREATLY decentralize large amounts of hashing power.  And Avalon will continue selling chips, which means there will be MANY companies providing this service.
The switch to GPUs didn't centralize power, even though a $250 GPU is excessive for many who have a computer and just use the onboard video.  This is a similar step.  There will be people looking to profit off of selling small USB miners that can compete with video cards in hashing power but only use ~3 watts of power.  
This is an exciting time and I'm pretty sure many naysayers of ASIC technology will be proven wrong in the near future.

That's like saying that the costs of air go up as more people are born.  If the resource isn't scarce, what drives up transaction fees?  Good will?


Right now the average fee collected per block is less than 1 bitcoin.  That is 4% of the current block reward.  The scale may be different than what you are envisioning.

A bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places.  Gold is divisible down to grains (420 per ounce).  A grain is VERY difficult to transact with; it's difficult to store because it's so small, hard to manipulate even with moderately sized hands, and require lots of energy to recombine into a larger chunk of gold.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is just as easy to store in large amounts as it is small amounts.  Recombining them is a simple calculation, and even the fattest of fingers can manipulate a single satoshi.

The awesome thing about bitcoin is that it is fluid.  It only appears "central" right now because MtGox is at the center of obtaining bitcoins.  It doesn't **have** to be that way.  More people using different exchanges make it more difficult to manipulate all exchanges.  Diversity is security.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:14:02
We'll see how things play out.  As services come in on top of bitcoin, it gets safer and easier for laymen to own and use it.  But we need large scale adoption to fuel innovation in the bitcoin service arena.  Already we have coinbase and bitpay, which makes buying and accepting bitcoins super easy.  Once we have hardware wallets being offered in the market, it'll make storing bitcoins much easier.
Your view is extremely pessimistic.  The internet used to be dangerous as hell because you had to expose yourself to the rest of the world.  How many millions of dollars have been stolen due to hacked passwords?  How many identities?  
Just because there is risk doesn't mean people won't play.  And the risk can be mitigated with tools.

Not true.  If you can't transfer cash OUT of MtGox, then the price is because there are less sellers than buyers, which is pushing the price upwards.  People don't want to SELL on MtGox because they can't actually get to their cash once they've sold.

That's a lot easier said than done when the results can dictate whether you live or die.


In theory I agree, but there are situations where the consumer's desires don't necessarily mesh well with society's long-term goals, and we as individuals tend to be kind of bad at long-term planning, which is one of the reasons I think Social Security came into being.  People were tired of watching generations of people get old and not have enough to provide for themselves.  So as a collective we decided to try a different method.  I think we did it wrong, in a big way.  
I do agree in theory for the most part.  I think I'm kind of internally at war; free markets provide the most choice, but governments taper our short term goals for our long term ones.  I feel like our government got it very very wrong, but I'm still unsure of whether this means *all* government is bad or just *our* government is bad.

Basically yes.  Once the novelty wears off there's not a lot of reason to mine except as a hobby.


Not true.  If I'm using mined bitcoin for purchases then I'm not speculating, I'm participating in the economy.


Which is great if you are mining as a hobby, but if you expect or desire an ROI then you should look at buying/holding vs mining.


This is a viable option "now".  But it won't be forever.  Kudos for taking advantage, but this possibility won't last as more people understand mining in general.


But there's a lot of additional risk in mining; that you don't get screwed (there are a lot of scammers out there; terrahash, Avalon, BFL, the list goes on), that the product you get works as expected and that the resale value will meet or exceed your purchase price.
Risk analysis is an important part of investing.
Again, if you are a hobby miner, then kudos and have at it.  But many people are only trying to make money and in their head, they hedge the purchase with the possibility of bitcoin prices rising, which I'm saying shouldn't factor in when analyzing mining for profit.

I agree that it's not a store of value yet, but that's one of its intended purposes and when the price valuation phase is over and millions of people are participating and exchanges work fluidly to allow respectable arbitrage, we'll see it take on that role in a big way.

The infrastructure isn't here yet because demand rose SHARPLY.  If demand had paced itself, infrastructure would keep up.  As it is, infrastructure necessarily lags behind demand.

Incorrect.  Intrinsic value is defined as value outside of a medium of exchange.  Bitcoin, for instance has 0 intrinsic value.  Dollars have almost no intrinsic value, but they do burn, which means they can be used for fuel, and they can be chopped up and used as a medium for paper.  Seashells have some intrinsic value, because there are people who enjoy them as jewelry.
Value is subjective, but it's a collective subjectivity.  If you can find people who subjectively value an item for more than how much it's worth as a medium of exchange, it can be said to have intrinsic value.
These value arguments get old; if something is valued for it's basic physical properties, it has "intrinsic value".  Bitcoin's basic physical properties are small bits of electric information.  Since there is an exact copy of bitcoin called testnet, where the coins have zero value, you can very easily demonstrate that there is nothing in bitcoin that gives it its value except community consensus.  Therefore no intrinsic value.
Stocks don't have any intrinsic value, they REPRESENT something else.
Silver has intrinsic value, because it is a malleable metal with high conductivity, properties that make it antimicrobial and is the shiniest of the metals.
Everyone have it straight yet?

Then bitcoin wasn't good enough to last.  If transaction fees don't cover miners in the future, then the protocol isn't worth maintaining.
The point at which the reward halves is known to all parties.  Investing heavily in something should mean you've already taken that reward halving into account.  Miners know the coin generation won't last forever.  I still don't see why you think transaction fees won't cover mining rewards long before coins stop being generated.

That's incorrect.  Here's a link to the [litecoin wiki](  It discusses that to achieve approximately the same security, you need to wait 4x as long.


No it isn't.  There are people who are in a position to centralize, but it's economically not viable to do so (one 51% attack kills bitcoin, and the value plummets.  No miner worth his salt would want this to happen, so they intentionally avoid it); so instead they are selling massive amounts of chips.  These chips will GREATLY decentralize bitcoin.  And it's not as centralized as you make it out to be.  There are a few **POOLS** in the major players arena, but those pools are comprised of a LARGE amount of individual players.

One of the useful properties of these metals is that they are malleable, which makes them relatively easy to make into discrete, easily carried units that are readily identifiable (minted coins being the best example).  Diamonds and cows are less so.


But bitcoin's secondary factors are it's only factors; so they aren't secondary.  Bitcoin was designed from the ground up to have factors that make it easy to use as money.  What are it's "primary" factors if these are the secondary?


Sure, but once a certain number of individuals believe something *would make* a good medium of exchange, and then those individuals actually begin *exchanging* it, how is that not the line that something crosses to become money?


Ok, for this discussion I can conclude that fiat is currency that the government forces you to use to settle debts.  Not sure how relevent that is to anything, but if it serves a purpose to make the distinction, then I'll accept it.


Do you have any literature or links that discuss this distinction?  I fail to see how it is relevant to anything.  


Doesn't this kind of present a chicken and egg problem?  In addition, how come something isn't defined as money when it's already being used as a medium of exchange?


I still fail to see how an economic analysis is much different when something is "merely" a medium of exchange or money.  In your original post that I responded to, you said this:


How does it cross that line?  Once it crosses that line, how does the "economic analysis" fundamentally change?  Without defining your definition of the line for me, I fail to see how the economic analysis can fundamentally change.

Yes they can.  Your account can represent whatever their code tells it to.  This is in effect how they maintain "cold storage" wallets.  They lock a computer offline, and only hold enough in the hot wallets to meet demand.  Generally, the hot wallet will cancel out buys and sells, so they don't have to reach into the cold wallet to retreive your bitcoins.
Theoretically, they could just not have the cold wallet and hope that no one notices.

And I disagree.  You have yet to show me how making light of someone's accent causes REAL HARM.  


So you don't hear how people polarize issues like the Treyvon Martin case over race when it wasn't necessarily racially charged to begin with?  Or how people assume that race is involved in decisions where it isn't?  Or people being accused of racism when it isn't present?  If a black man breaks into my house, and I shoot him, I will be extremely fearful of some kind of racial backlash.  But a group of black men can beat an 80 year old war veteran to death for the cash in his pocket and no one throws the race card.  It's not whining about reconsidering how we treat others, it's pointing out that race plays a smaller part than activists like you make it out to play.


So how do you think our race relations fare between now and 1980?  Better?  I'd disagree.  I'd say we're more polarized now than we've been since Jim Crowe laws.

Not true.  If you can broadcast another transaction using the same coins only with a higher fee faster than the first transaction is broadcast to the whole network, you can invalidate the first transaction even after a given node "sees it", as long as the second transaction beats the first one to MOST nodes.
It's easy to mitigate this risk though.  Add a few well regarded nodes from around the world to your listener, and accept 0-confirmation spends once those nodes rebroadcast.  At THAT point, there's literally no way to double spend once all the nodes have accepted the first transaction other than a 51% attack.

You are right.  In this kind of scenario, bitcoin and USD will be pretty bad.  That's why if you believe this kind of scenario is possible, you should also have some gold/silver along with a few weeks of dry goods and some water purification supplies, and maybe a few extra bullets.
I don't believe an economic downturn will necessarily cause this level of chaos.  I think a much more likely scenario is a large scale US inflation, which will beggar millions of people worldwide, but not necessarily trigger the apocalypse or Mad Max scenario.  In THIS scenario, bitcoin will definitely have an edge over USD.
The way I see it, every situation that makes bitcoin no good also makes USD no good.  And there are situations that make Bitcoin good and USD no good.  These reasons make it attractive to diversify some into Bitcoin.  However, there are situations that make USD good and Bitcoin no good (like a fatal flaw in the protocol or some such), so it's a risk.  But hey, everything in life carries SOME risk.  Diversification helps mitigate that risk.

Bitcoin is still here, and stronger than I think its ever been.  This bubble has given me a chance to explain bitcoin to a number of people.  Maybe the bubble scares away some amateur day traders.  But the publicity gives bitcoin a chance to explain itself to a whole new user base.

For all those who say going from bank -&gt; coinbase -&gt; honey -&gt; Amazon is cumbersome and unwieldy, consider this.  Think about people who are holding coin long term.  With gold, you first have to go bank -&gt; gold.  Then, once you decide that it's time to realize the gains that gold has had, and you want purchasing power, you need to go through the process of selling your gold first.  So to realize the gains in gold, you have to go:
gold -&gt; exchange (or gold buyer) -&gt; bank -&gt; Amazon.  
 
So the whole chain for gold is:
 Bank -&gt; Buy gold -&gt; exchange gold for fiat -&gt; bank -&gt; Amazon.
Now, run that with bitcoin.  The first step is still:
Bank -&gt; Buy Bitcoin (Coinbase)
But now lets look at the cash out:
Bitcoin -&gt; Honey -&gt; Amazon
Bitcoin -&gt; exchange -&gt; bank -&gt; Amazon.
Looks like people using bitcoin to preserve wealth long term may be served well by tools that allow them to spend bitcoin directly.  May not be such a great tool right this second, since many are speculators, but Honey would increase bitcoin's utility over gold that much further.

The article you quote talks about specific situations that economists attribute to deflation, but none of those talks about why gold is no longer used, which I claimed to be a tangent.  Gold's use as a currency is limited in today's technological age for reasons other than it's deflationary tendencies.
But to address the article's historical examples, each and every one of those had multiple attributing factors.  None of those examples occurred because of a controlled, known deflation.  That's like saying inflation is bad because Zimbabwe.  Sure, runaway inflation is bad, as is runaway deflation.  You could say that *high volatility* is bad,  which I would agree with.  But to say that deflation is categorically bad because of some extreme examples is ludicrous, just like saying that inflation is categorically bad because of some extreme examples.


You could phrase it that way, or you could phrase it like this:
Deflation encourages savers, and slightly de-incentivizes frivolous spending, which may encourage proper appropriations of capital, as opposed to inflation, which encourages asset bubbles since people are constantly scrambling to put their earnings in a vehicle that doesn't lose value every year.  But again, tomato tomato right?


But this is only a negative if you view constant debt as a positive, which I believe to be incorrect.  Cheap debt further stimulates asset bubbles, because cheap debt can be purchased and leveraged against assets whose value is going up.  If debt were more expensive to obtain, people would use less of it, and there would be less defaults, which is good for an economy in more ways than just a constant increase in GDP.


Well, since you know all the business owners who accept BTC personally, and can vouch for their intentions, I guess I should just shut up now.

99 men are guilty of assault and 1 man (the last man to strike the victim) is guilty of assault and murder.  Or 100 men are guilty of conspiracy to murder.  But this doesn't call into question the definition of "murder".


It is not naïve; it is a serious point of contention.  If you are creating bitcoins, then you may fall under the rule of FinCEN.  I don't think you ARE creating bitcoins.  If anything, the protocol is "creating" bitcoins.  But who would be responsible for that?  Satoshi?  Then he's the culprit.  Miners?  Then, as you say, mob theory applies.  Do you stop all non-registered miners?  What about 15 year old Jon Smith with his 40 MH/s video card mining in his parent's basement?  Or maybe just the pool operators?  What about solo miners?
Your assertion that miners create bitcoin is not fact; it is a highly debated point of contention, one that will probably eventually need legal precedence to settle.

Huh?  Gold and silver are the most common forms of currency in the history of the world.

Bitcoin solves all of these problems and more.  
Also, this is a tangent, and has nothing to do with the fact that deflation doesn't stifle growth like the traditional economics textbooks tout.  *Especially* if it's a small amount of controlled deflation.


And as more people speculate, more business owners desire to own it and are willing to trade goods and services for it, and then it gains value, so more business owners desire to own it and are willing to trade goods and services for it, and then it gains more value in a deliciously vicious cycle.

@_date: 2013-07-26 00:13:07


That doesn't prove anything.  If no one mines, no bitcoins are distributed.  In both my and your scenarios, no one gets anything.


No they aren't.  Bitcoins were minted in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and are merely **distributed** to the miners for securing the protocol.


It's NOT elementary.  It's a **new technology**.  It doesn't fit current definitions.  Don't you get that?  Miners are not responsible for how many coins are distributed and can not specify who gets what.  The protocol dictates distribution because the protocol OWNS THE COINS.


The spirit of the law is to prevent centralized entities from issuing currency without registration, so that these entities would collect identifiable information so the government could track users if necessary.  The idea of a decentralized issuing authority is *brand new*.    The idea of a *fully public* ledger is *brand new*.  It *doesn't fit*.  Don't you get it? Since there is no central authority to the **distribution** of the coins, no one can be controlled, and therefore trying to make every miner register would make the US look silly; they can't get every miner in every country to register.  It's like the record industry trying to stop torrents through legal action.  It **doesn't work**.  And since there is a fully public ledger, all addresses have a complete record, so the government only needs information about 1 address, and they can watch your money flow everywhere you send it.  Therefore they regulate the exchanges, and get their data that way.  So the spirit of the law is already fulfilled.  Applying the technical definition of the law is a fallacy.  Claiming that miners fall under this definition means either the US must try to regulate every single miner (and fail miserably), or claim that miners don't fall under the definition, in which case the US is off the hook.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if gold is worthless for everything except gold plated connectors and jewelry, why would gold be a better choice than brass for jewelry?  Gold is easier to scratch and more rare than brass, yet they are both the same color.  If the dull luster is desired, why would jewelry not simply be plated a .1 micron thick layer of gold?
Seems to me that if gold weren't valuable as anything else, it wouldn't be very desired for jewelry.  It's almost as if gold is used for jewelry because it is both pretty AND a store of value at the same time.  *Gasp*.

Maybe there's a distinction that makes us both happy:

The prevailing idea is that "Commodity Money" is money that is backed by the commodity being used; gold, silver, even cigarettes have been used this way. 
"Representative Money" or "Fiat", on the other hand, is a medium of exchange that gets its value from the belief that it has value.   Since bitcoin is a medium of exchange, and it's value comes from the belief that it has value.
Maybe the Austrians define it more narrowly, but the general consensus is that bitcoin is money.  In fact, the recent ruling by the federal circuit court in reference to pirateat40's scam sets legal precedent for bitcoin being money, so the courts agree.

Correct.  So my tiny bit extra goes to incentivizing people not to dump.  Much less violent (assuming I agree to pay my taxes, as long as they are reasonable) than hunting down and prosecuting dumpers.


Agreed, but some things (especially city level stuff) actually operate better when the entire community pays in, and uses what they need.  Not all things, not many things, but some things, some times.  


This is not true.  There are case studies that I will google for you if you insist that show that when you charge the true cost of eliminating garbage, dumping rises.  It's economics 101; when the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down.  And when we are talking about landfills, demand goes down by people doing it themselves, in less savory ways than landfills.

Another thing to remember is that for many transactions (Amazon, eBay, etc), there really isn't a need for a new payment system.  But I tried to buy Minecraft about two months ago and my payment got stopped because the software company was in another country.  I had to call my bank to let the payment go through, but it was after hours.  I ended up having to use paypal and paying an extra 3 or 4% for the exchange.  Doing international business can be tricky.  Remitting money means you have to pay the middle man.  Bitcoin removes the middle man.  Not only does that mean you no longer have to pay the middle man, but the middle man can't decide that your transaction is not in line with their belief system.  I can tip pirate bay with bitcoin.

Yep, you got it.


Wealth isn't like mass in that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, while wealth can do both.  Someone having lots of money doesn't inherently hinder your ability to make money.  It DOES however allow them to buy regulations and laws (and to break those if it's profitable enough).  The little guy can't buy regulations and laws because they can't afford it.  


Not necessarily.  Digital goods don't have any economies of scale.  I can sell 4 billion copies of something just as easily as 4, so it doesn't apply to any digital goods.  Plus, not all physical goods are about quantity.  Many products rely on craftsmanship.  But yes, a lot of times that is the case, which is why regulation hurts the little guys so much more.  Big companies have liquidity and can handle a changing regulatory landscape.  Little companies can't do so.  Big companies have friends on Capital Hill convincing elected officials to pass laws that benefit them, little companies can't afford "friends" like that.

This is mostly an effect of a single exchange being so dominant.  Once other exchanges are established, this will be less of an issue because more exchanges means opportunity for arbitrage.  Without effective arbitrage the true price cannot be discovered.


This only does harm if you operate under the premise that someone *has* to participate in a bitcoin exchange at any given moment.  That's not the case.  If I don't like the current exchange rate, I withhold my bitcoin or refuse to purchase more.  Thus, I'm truly in control, not the bots.  And if a bot triggers another bot, tough shit.  It's a bot eat bot world out there.  If your bot can't hang, maybe you shouldn't be putting up real money?


The books are open to all right?  We can watch these things happen real time.  That's pretty transparent to me.  If you are saying that when volume gets so high that the number one exchange can't hang, then ok.  But that's not because of bots, that's the responsibility of the exchange.  


I still fail to see how this relates.  The housing crisis was a clusterfuck of **federally** influenced interest rates giving banks access to unprecedented amounts of money to loan at rock bottom prices, coupled with a **government** backed initiative to lend based on race and geography as opposed to credit worthiness.  Bitcoin has none of this.  Bitcoin just "IS".  It literally cannot be controlled politically.

I'm not an economist but why are you so hung up on definitions?  How you categorize it is less important than how you can use it.  Definitions get even harder when you try to differentiate *currency* and *money*.  Gold and silver used to be currency because they were a medium of exchange.

Good luck pinning down the exact difference of currency, commodity and money though; there are as many definitions as there are assholes.

I had a much more wordy response but my computer crashed so I'll repost in a more succinct manner.


It's sad how derisive you are being in this sentence, and then go on to show exactly how little you understand economics in general.


It's hard for either one of us to have evidence to support our claims in this thought exercise, since it hasn't happened, but if you look at hyperinflation events, you'll see when the currency drops in value, all commodities' prices in that currency skyrocket.  Bitcoin would be no different.


Not with those who are familiar with economic concepts.  Bitcoin is a currency.  A currency is a special kind of commodity generally accepted as a facilitator in trade, otherwise referred to as a "medium of exchange".  Forex trading should make it obvious that all currencies on earth are treated as commodities in some circles, precisely because currencies ARE commodities.


Except stocks are a representation of stake in a company.  Bitcoin doesn't represent a stake in anything.  A stock IS a commodity, so they have that in common.  And they are both representative of something, so they have THAT in common.  But otherwise they aren't the same.  Just because speculators and investors exist for both doesn't make them the same.  Speculators and investors exist for all currencies too.


You have it mixed up here.  Even on the gold standard, dollars didn't have *inherent* value, they had *representative* value.  Those dollars WEREN'T gold, they REPRESENTED gold.  They had no inherent value then and they have no inherent value now.


If we only had barter systems, we wouldn't have ANY currencies.  You are saying that we need a currency to represent another currency's value.  You aren't making any sense here and I hope after a re-read you can see that.


It comes from community consensus, just like any other REPRESENTATIVE value.  A stock is a piece of paper.  When both the company and I agree that the piece of paper represents a stake in their company, then we can treat it like a stock.  Dollars are forced by law to be used to pay taxes, and to settle debt disputes, but otherwise we as a people decide through supply and demand what the dollar bills are worth.


No, for now and since inception and until the end of time it will always be a currency.  I'll reiterate one more time, a currency is a commodity used as a medium of exchange.  When you value goods and services in another commodity, and others in the community value *their* goods and services in that same commodity, it facilitates trade and we refer to that common commodity as a *currency*.
Are we on the same page yet?

Men are inherently built to be the hunters, and women are inherently built to care for young.  Men only need to participate in creating a child for 30 seconds.

Currency exchanges will always be the most vulnerable part of the equation because they are the only part that MUST interact with government issued funds.  Therefore they are vulnerable to government oversight and government seizure.

Um... no.  Protocols are rules that outline how to send and receive information.  The protocol does not specify a size or a fee that MUST be attached.  That is all client-based.  The protocol can be used with other clients that can allow these micro-transactions.  That's why we have two words for the different things; because they are different.  The client may be widely adopted, but that doesn't stop me from making my own client that submits 1 satoshi payments to the network.  And that doesn't stop me from including those transactions in a block I find if I so choose.  If this were a change to the **protocol**, those things wouldn't be possible.

If bitcoin is worth $100 right now, and I loan out 100 btc (worth $10,000) at 5% simple annual interest, then in one year I'll have 105 btc.  Since bitcoin is deflationary (let's say it rises 10% in value), that 105 btc is now worth (105 * $110) = $11550.  I've made $1550 which is 15.5% return.

I hear this more from skeptics than from adopters.  It's natural for people who put time and effort into something before it becomes popular to receive some benefit for having predicted correctly that the technology will gain in value.  First mover advantage does not always imply Ponzi or Pyramid Scheme.
A pyramid scheme only works as long as people continue to be recruited.  People make money by getting referral bonuses.  Once the pool of potential recruits dries up, the whole thing falls apart.  If the current pool of bitcoiners was all that ever showed up to the game, we could still use them to conduct business and they'd still have worth; so it's definitely not a pyramid scheme.
The hoarding is only a response to the rapid price increase.  Eventually that has to stop, and when it does, hoarding will decrease.  Once bitcoin is shown to be a valid form of transacting business, more places will accept them, both for the hip factor and because it has specific, legitimate advantages over credit card/wire transfer/cash.

But you neglect a very important metric; effort.
The consideration is highest quality at lowest cost for least effort.
The first scenario in your list produces some goods and services for less effort than if you had to think about them yourself, or (gasp!) plan ahead for them.  Think fire service, police force, parks and recreation and even trash pickup.
In addition, there are some services that no one will profit from short term, but that lube the gears of society long term.  The socialization of interstates comes to mind.  Sure, companies may have seen profit in it and eventually made massive interstates, but that would have been slow, waiting for competition to root out inefficiencies and generate a set of standards organically.  I think the best route would have been for the government to install the infrastructure, get people used to its availability, and then auction it off to private enterprise.  But optimal solutions aren't always politically correct.  Either way, it would have taken business longer to institute an efficient interstate system than it took the government.  While I agree that business could run it better *now*, the initial push would have been less efficient if left to grow in an organic manner.  There are probably a dozen different things I could come up with in a half hour that are better started by an overreaching body whose primary goal isn't profit, but I think the interstate example gives you an idea of where I'm going.
Honestly, I think you are right *given enough time*.  But some things are more expedient when done for reasons other than pure profit.

Let's say that the current price of Bitcoin is $125 and it costs me $5 a day to operate a miner.  In this scenario, for $5, I can buy .04 bitcoin on MtGox.
Scenario 1:
    My mining rig mines .05 bitcoin per day
    Since .05 btc &gt; .04 btc, I keep mining
Scenario 2:
    My mining rig mines .02 bitcoin per day
    Since .02 btc &lt; .04 btc, I stop mining and just buy .04 btc every day
See?  It's rational to operate your miner while the cost of electricity is less than the cost to outright buy the same amount of btc.  It's rational to turn off the miner when the cost of electricity to run the miner is more than it takes to buy the btc outright.
The end goal is to acquire bitcoin.  You should always *try* to acquire the most btc you can for a given price.  If mining makes more, then mine.  If it makes less, than just buy.

I'm specifically referring to the tax used to pay for disposal of waste.  Each line of tax is a different discussion.


Recycling is actually usually used as a way to subsidize landfill dumping.  Most forms of recycling actually cost more than they return.  The exceptions are the items that companies will pay you for (like scrap metal and aluminum).  Glass and plastic take more resources (in the form of transporting them, melting them and re-fabricating them) than you save by recycling.
I do agree that charging for trash would cause many to reduce their usage, but I think the damage prevented by encouraging the few who would otherwise dump illegally to dispose properly is worth the tradeoff.

How do you determine it's REALLY stolen?  If someone steals bitcoins, then the first address is the address the thief owns.  After that, how do you CONFIRM that the address is the thief's and not some other user who inadvertently just received stolen coins?  Couldn't the thief just create 1000 addresses to split the stolen coins into, and then spend from those addresses?  Or maybe splits into 1000 addresses, keeps MOST of it, and then doles out a couple of bitcents each to another hundred addresses scraped from bitcointalk forums for obfuscation.  Then what?
I haven't seen an acceptable solution except not to let people steal your coins.

Right, but a bank is adept at gauging risk (unless you tell them not to worry about risk, because they're "insured", in which case they will just take the most risk possible).  Part of that risk is how likely everyone is to take their money out at the same time.  The higher the risk, the higher the potential reward.  So banks actually have to do real risk analysis and weigh the possibility of a bank run against the money they are making.  Those who do well prosper and those who don't fail.

Still requires a mobo, cpu, ram, psu, keyboard/video/mouse (or kvm).  PSU has to be high end, that's $100 right there.  Mobo $60, CPU $60, ram $30.  That's $250 before the video cards.  So if this setup can run 4 video cards, you gotta add $82.50 per card to the price.  For 200 MH/S I recently paid $70 online.  That's $150 for 200 mh/s.  $200 for 300 mh/s doesn't seem that bad.

Well, yes 186% is incredible, so ATM it's probably not the BEST idea.  But I'm seeing a lot of investments pop up denominated solely in bitcoin.  Many mining hardware sales are denominated ONLY in bitcoin.  As more and more merchants only accept bitcoin, fluctuation should start to settle down some.  As more and more micro economies spring up that don't resort to any kind of fiat, those economies are going to become more and more insulated from fiat/BTC fluctuations.
There's already a demand for loans denominated in bitcoin that offer returns in bitcoin.  Look on bitfunder and you'll find people taking loans in bitcoin to purchase mining equipment or pursue other ventures.  Like I said, it may not be a good idea to BORROW, but it seems VERY lucrative to LEND (assuming credit risk and things like that are factored in).

At the moment.  Google "Trezor"; hardware wallets are coming that will make it much more secure to hold your own bitcoins


Well, yea.  Just like if you were to try using Gold or Silver; you could only use it where it is accepted.  Since it's difficult to accept gold and silver, not many people do.  It's very easy from a technical standpoint to accept bitcoin, so more and more businesses are doing so.

Everyone keeps talking about how their price is too high and they should modify it, and I agree.  I spent a bitcoin on it in June, but in June I could replace a bitcoin for $100.  So to me, I traded $100 worth of value (1 btc) for a Trezor.  Well, now $100 in value is .13 btc.  You aren't screwing your customers by pegging the price to a more stable representation of value.  Anyone whose into bitcoins knows that the potential for a massive increase exists.  Factor that in when trying to purchase something in btc, and replenish your wallet when you spend.

I honestly haven't given a lot of scrutiny to the profits of chips vs mining, so you may be right.  I've heard this question more than once and gave you the answer I've received.
If Avalon has plans to take down bitcoin they probably could.  Bitcoin is still in a relatively vulnerable stage right now (though far and away stronger than it was two years ago).  I think once the chips are released to the public, bitcoin will be on its way to invincibility (or near enough as makes no difference).  
I did find an article where Avalon discusses mining directly with their batch three asic miners [here](  They specifically talk about ending up as the very centralization they are trying to prevent based on the lackluster performance of their competitors.  So your fears are well founded it seems, and bitcoin remains vulnerable until Avalon's competitors pick up the pace.
Either way, Avalon has delivered on its promises, and the chips that its selling have already been ordered.  We'll see how this plays out.
@_date: 2013-06-15 19:30:44
Gold is malleable, which makes it easy to work with, shiny, which makes it pretty, and conductive which gives it industrial value.  Electricity is energy that can be harnessed to do work.  These are intrinsic properties of the commodities you mentioned.  Bitcoin has none of that.  
Also, I never said bitcoin doesn't have value, only that the value it has is only because we as a collective agree that it does.

You can make up crazy assertions all you want, but a corporation couldn't even buy **all** the reservoirs, because once someone noticed they were doing it, they'd up the price for their reservoirs, and would ship bottled water around to compete. 
In a free market, competition removes most monopolistic behavior.  Even collusion in a free market is short lived.


It's the threat of moving that causes companies to cater to their customers.  If they can't keep their customers happy (provide water at a reasonable price), their customers will move to where they can find water at a reasonable price, or someone will notice a potential profit by shipping in water for cheaper than the inflated price of the monopolizer.


Sounds like you have no clue what I'm talking about.  Dismiss it out of hand if you wish, but it is possible to have a civilized society without a government monopolizing the use of force.

Additionally, banks don't even have the power to do shit without colluding with the government.  If banking were more free market and national capital controls nonexistent, Cyprus' problem would either never have happened, or resulted in banks closing.  If banks get to operate under the assumption there's a government backed safety net under them, it changes their risk analysis.  It's like the government telling the banks to go to Vegas, and if they bet it all on black and win, then yay banks.  But if they bet it all on black and lose, the government will replace it.  Who the hell wouldn't gamble if you were guaranteed 0 loss?

To an extent.  When paper market and physical market diverge, there's profit to be made. :)  As long as I can take physical control of a commodity, I care not how other people choose to trade it.  And when their paper market plunges the price, I take that opportunity to buy physical.  When the paper market goes way up, I sell some physical.  Buy low, sell high.  Commodity fundamentals IMHO are easier to understand than fundamentals of company stocks.

I understand the sentiment, but the problem is that they are going to do it either way.  It's a problem that was foreseen from the outset.  The thing is, they can't actually enforce regulations on *the protocol*, since it's worldwide and distributed.  The only thing they can do is enforce regulation *in their jurisdiction*.  In addition, you don't need to conform to regulation to participate in the blockchain.  Anyone can do it.  So compliance at this point is **completely voluntary**.  They can't force compliance on bitcoin at all.  Regulation is just for businesses that seek to operate with the government's blessing.  Look at the Silk Road.  It's a booming business built off of an illegal product being shipped through the mail.
TL;DR Regulation is just so government sanctioned businesses can expand into bitcoin-space.  Bitcoin user not affected.

With the idea that the subsidy was a kickstarter.  If we have to subsidize mining in perpetuity, then the whole system is broken.


Which is 1/2 as bad as it was last time, and will be half as bad next time.


At this moment, it is centralized.  But it's not increasingly centralized.  In fact, decentralization is occurring right now.  ASICs are available to anyone with money.  Just because friedcat is awesome doesn't mean that centralization is occurring.  People develop better technology, and then other people develop competing technology, and then people buy that technology, and all of a sudden friedcat is no longer on top.  The nature of mining is that it will never stay decentralized for long; there is no barrier of entry to mining other than owning the hardware.  And what do you mean by "mining is becoming rationalized"?  What?


Correlation does not imply causation.  In fact, it could be argued that the block halving caused the run-up.  Decreasing supply = increased price.

Why use btc when USD will be almost the same tomorrow as it is today?  This is a discovery phase.  Eventually a price will be reached that will discourage people from buying, and an equilibrium will be reached.  Once that happens, bitcoin becomes dominant because it's intrinsically better than any other currency.

I skimmed most of your post, but this part here can easily be handled by an escrow service, so that "all sales are *not* final" until the buyer "finalizes" or "completes" the sale.  
And why not have bitcoin credit?  Seems to me that it's possible, even if it's not here yet.  Trusted establishment loans bitcoin, you pay back with interest over time.

Right now the biggest market IMHO is mining hardware.  Which is cool because I pay btc for mining hardware, which generates btc, which I then invest in more hardware.  Getting a chip manufacturer to accept bitcoin would be phenomenal for bitcoin, but I don't see it happening in the near future.  Paying for electricity would also be a good way to go. Getting those two things to accept bitcoin would be HUGE for bitcoin.

Your original post made a snide remark about how easy bitcoin was, followed by an article that said it was hard for some dude to sell them.  I countered with "There are other exchanges besides Mt Gox", and then you sneered back "Did you read the article" where you linked it again.  I replied that I had, and asked if you had too, then showed that he only mentioned Mt Gox and localbitcoins as options already tried, and bitstamp as a possible next step, and then I listed three exchanges not mentioned in your article about how hard bitcoin really is.


I was speaking to the fact that your article wasn't very accurate, because it didn't mention additional exchanges.  Additionally, it didn't speak to how easy it would be to set up a POS for a business, but rather some Canadian guy who tried localbitcoin a few times.  I never disagreed that small businesses probably won't see a large benefit at the moment, unless they are speculating.


I disagree; he may not see a lot of benefits from using bitcoin over other payment sources *at the moment*, but he'll definitely get some good publicity and it won't cost him much.


I don't think he's "damaging bitcoin".  I think he's increasing its utility.  It's not a bad business choice because it won't take a lot to set up and it won't detract from current business.  It's just not going to make the guy rich.

Bitcoin will always remain "unregulated".  The government can place their regulations on the concepts if they wish, but the protocol doesn't care.  Look at torrents.

Except those who go to private school still are required to pay for the public school they don't attend, private roads are generally not available because the government has a monopoly, and even if there were, those who use private roads would still pay taxes for public ones, and corn exists in just about every product in the US (either as an ingredient, an ingredient that is a derivative of corn or as food of an ingredient) which is one of the most heavily subsidized crops in the US.  It's impossible to avoid "government help".  There is no choice in the matter.  That is the problem most "anti-statists" have, is that they are forced to participate, and are given no option to opt out except to move to a country with little government, but little infrastructure because they lack an abundance of natural resources.  The countries laden with resources are locked down by governments.  Saying "go to Somalia" ignores the fact that Somalia has little natural resources with which to sustain a living, when compared to somewhere like the US.
It would be nice if I could opt out of the social contract.  Like above, you mention going to a restaurant.  I don't recall ever being FORCED into a restaurant.  If I don't want to abide by that social contract, I cook at home.  Further, this quote:

These three problems are simply addressed by a central agency.  That's what a lot of people seem to miss is that bitcoin doesn't HAVE to be decentralized, it just can't be FORCED to.  There WILL eventually be banks that figure out how to offer a safe alternative to storing your bitcoin on your computer.  They WILL eventually figure out how to offer CDs in exchange for interest, and things will get going.  
The main problem is that bitcoin is in its infancy.  Infrastructure is exploding, but it is still on shaky ground.  I'm 100% confident that people smarter than me will figure out how to safely operate a central location worth storing your bitcoin.  How it is implemented is not something I'm capable of explaining, because I don't know how.  But the first step is to show the utility of bitcoin to the masses.  Once the utility is understood and the protocol is shown to be sound, demand for simplification will come and people will be willing to pay for the privilege.

The point of bitcoin's difficulty adjustments was to make it so blocks are found every 10 minutes regardless of how fast the network is.  Obviously Satoshi foresaw that mining would increase.
What people don't mention when they talk about the "evils of ASIC" is that anyone can own an ASIC.  This is in contrast to the current banking structure where it's "who you know".  With ASICs, anyone can mine; it's just now you have to actually invest a little time and money instead of utilizing existing hardware.  The ASIC chips Avalon is selling will cost around $10 a chip.  With assembly, we're looking at potentially $50-$60 miners that mine 300 MH/s @ 2.5 w.  Contrast that to most video cards who get 300-500 MH/s @ 100 watts that cost $200.  It's a drastic improvement if you are at all serious about mining.

Innocent people shouldn't have been bankrupt, because they shouldn't have invested their lifesavings in a fledgeling technology, and they DAMN SURE shouldn't have doubled down on the risk by investing with "some internet guy".


"Right" is where there is a net gain for the most people?  That's ridiculously subjective and borders on communism.  "Right" is subjective.  There is no such thing as God, and no such thing as "absolute morality".


If you believe in God, then yes, this would make it moral to kill people.  This is why it's silly to derive your morals from an imaginary being.  In addition, I'm not debating that what PirateAt40 did was moral; I truly believe he was immoral.  I just don't want governments deciding who is and is not moral.  I don't trust them to make that decision.  I will decide that for myself and act accordingly.  


I'm blaming PirateAt40.  Everyone involved participated voluntarily, and got jacked by a scammer.  Lesson learned.  PirateAt40 is to blame, but bringing in governments to arbitrate creates a central authority on "morality", which I detest.  No central authority should decide morality.  
My desire is to experiment with a truly unregulated space.  Businesses survive on reputation.  People SHOULD BE WARY of new businesses.

If you bought it online, return shipping may end up being as much or more as the item, making it pointless to return.  We **NEED** to take responsibility for ourselves again.

Very true statement.  However, it's generally accepted that the majority is ok with something if it works *generally* how they expect it to.  Bicycles with cement blocks don't actually go anywhere, so *most of the world* has chosen bicycles with tires, because it's the better option.  Taxation shifts the burden of budgeting and paying attention from the individual to the state.  As long as the state keeps their abuses down, many people are OK with this scenario, because it streamlines their life.  The taxes may not be fair, but for most people, as long as it's not *too* unfair, they'll never complain.  That's pragmatism.

Sure, but on the flip side, since cleanup is happening on a regular basis, dumpers don't even see the consequences of their actions.  In addition, if I had a big stretch of land, it might be in my best interest as a landowner to just put out dumps wherever people are dumping.  So now the landowner pays instead of everyone.  That's way better.


No, I stated earlier that the cost of an action (A - illegal dumping) must net a person more than the probability of getting caught (B) multiplied by the cost of getting caught (C).  Taking someone to court is an option currently, and even with 0 fee dump locations, dumping still happens regularly, and on private property.


So with the fact that even with a free/nearly free solution, dumping still occurs on public and private property, you believe that removing the free/nearly free solution and putting all of the onus on private property owners to solve the problem will have a BETTER outcome?  The only thing you are changing is that the solution no longer appears free.  How does that make anything better?

Here's a synopsis.
Many economists worry about "deflationary" currencies encouraging people not to spend their money.  The idea goes that if you know your money will be worth more tomorrow than today, then you will not spend your money today, but will hold it as long as you can.  The economists go on to say that if this happens on a large scale, it can cause a spiral where the value of the currency goes up, and then more people *hoard*, and then the currency goes up more, and then more people *hoard*, ad infinitum until no one is buying and the economy grinds to a halt.
These economists argue that an *inflationary* currency, like the US Dollar, encourages people to spend because their value is slowly "leaking" out of the currency, so if you want to preserve your wealth you either spend it for goods and services (thereby receiving things whose value remains more or less static), or you invest it in things that are gaining value faster than the currency is losing it.  These economists posit that if people are encouraged to spend, then the economy grows.
So those criticizing hoarders fall into this group of people that criticize deflationary currencies on the belief that they shrink the economy as opposed to growing it.
Of course, there is a flip side to all of this.  When a currency is deflationary in the way that bitcoin is (not now, right now it is inflating faster than the USD percentage wise), the other camp believes that this encourages people to save, and spend when goods and services entice them to do so.  This could lead to companies competing to offer better quality products, instead of cheaper products, leading to increased sustainability.  It also allows individuals who are not investors to just hold on to their money, instead of chasing percentage points on assets that are expected to appreciate faster than the USD is depreciating, like real estate.  Those in the "deflation can be good" camp believe that when your money loses value, it encourages you to participate in asset bubbles like the recent housing market bubble, or the dot-com bubble before that, while currency that gains value encourages you to only invest if you actually *desire* risk, instead of *having* to invest in risk in order to keep your money.
There are pros and cons for both; but be careful not to get sucked in when they start talking about the Great Depression or other examples of deflation.  These examples speak to "runaway deflation", which usually have multiple causes and are not simply the result of an appreciating currency.  Always remember that there are just as many examples of economic woe resulting from runaway inflation, and that most likely the best way to categorize both is that *large volatility* is not good for an economy, to which many would agree.  And bitcoin has that problem right now.  Hopefully as the markets deepen and more people participate in bitcoin, the volatility will decline, but for now it's a major problem to bitcoin's utility.

Second sentence:


You are implying that this is a difficult proposition that isn't common, which again is not true.  Additionally, who cares what the person writing the check has stated for their tax purposes.  Yes, the government knows you received that value, but once you convert it to cash the trail is cold until you deposit it or buy something large enough to require documentation.
Third sentence:


Not if you cash your check and don't deposit it in a bank account.

Wow.  You wrote a lot of text, so you must be very smart.  I'll do my best to try to understand all of your really intelligent rebuttals.


So I don't use Monsanto seeds.  Are you implying that I can't source my seeds from anyone but Monsanto?  Because, although I may be wrong, I believe I remember hearing something about people obtaining seeds from other places besides Monsanto.


Good luck with that.  I'm sure you won't have any competition.  I'm positive you can control an army that big and I'm certain that no one will leave your controlled area.  You are making it hard to be right here.


And my argument is that it won't; that only when one group has a monopoly on force does wealth accumulate at the top to the detriment of others.  In a free market, wealth accumulates at the top, but not at the expense of the bottom.  


To what gain?  Without government, I'm free to move somewhere where you don't exert control.  You'll find very quickly that you control a large expanse of nothing.  In addition, you assume that because you have money people will sell you all of the roads.  In a free market, nothing is forcing them to sell, and having roads that aren't monopolized is worth a LOT.


Apologies, I misspoke.  I meant true "markets" require balance.  I mixed up the two; economics is the STUDY of markets.  You totally nailed me there.


Exactly, and yet you are trying to tell me that Austrian economics won't work, and then in the same breath tell me that modern economists are still undecided.  Make up your mind man!


Nope, and it doesn't sound like capitalism either.  Companies are socializing many costs associated with doing business, like polluting the air, water and land.  In a truly free market society, these costs would be shifted to the business and away from the public at large.  Polluting is property damage, and property rights reign in a free market economy.  


Man, you are SO SMART!  You are right, of course.  Nature isn't a closed system, because of the sun.  But, since the sun's energy requires a very specific chemical reaction to harness, only plants can benefit from that, and there is only a certain amount of area the sun touches.  Plants compete for space (look into some of the awesome ass plants in the rainforest and how they interact in competition for sunlight).  Yes, the sun provides a specific type of energy, but everything else on earth is a scarce resource.  However, since we can also harness the sun's energy (albeit not as efficiently yet as some plants), the comparison is pretty apt.  


An argument that another system worked (for whatever reason) has no bearing on which is the BEST system.  Lots of systems work for a time.  My argument is that they aren't the best, and that Laissez-faire economics indeed ARE the best, and would work better even than The Inka of Peru's command economy.
TL;DR I am wrong about all the things, and you, in your infinite wisdom (and zero citations) are right about all the things.

Yes, the resale value is a factor.  I agree.  But what I meant was that at $250 a piece, some big players made HUGE rigs out of GPUs and provided a much larger section of network hashing power than the average gamer/miner could hope to acheive.  My point is that just because something costs a little more doesn't automatically centralize it.  
The only TRUE thing that could cause widespread centralization is regulation, but the protocol doesn't care about regulation and allows all players, so it's not a big concern.

Buying currency with currency isn't (in my mind) using them; it's exchanging them for other mediums of exchange.  Eventually you change one of those currencies (whichever it may be) for goods and services.  I'd say trade bitcoin directly for goods and services instead of buying fiat with them.

The first part is true; I believe they are trying to protect their citizens from volatility by requiring companies to keep their prices denominated in RMB.  The second part is NOT true AFAIK. The only restriction besides the pricing I believe is that financial institutions can't offer direct BTC services, but rather BTC services have to be separate businesses not affiliated with traditional financial institutions.  I read that as "Banks can't also be exchanges or payment processors.  Payment processors can't process bitcoin".

I don't think Friedcat wants more than 30% of the network.  This is why hardware is being sold in addition to mining.  If he amasses too much hashpower, people start to lose faith in bitcoin and prices drop.

In which case there would be EVEN LESS incentive to dump in an appropriate location.  And I usually don't decide which roads to drive on based on the amount of trash on the side of the road.

I understand that; but if someone is a transmitter, they are transmitting from A to B.  If A requests their money back, wouldn't it be on the transmitter to give to them?
For instance, Visa refunds the money, and then eats the cost or investigates.  A transmitter would be required to do the same, right?
I think the issue here is context.  Visa is a transmitter, but the blockchain isn't a transmitter, it's a protocol for transmission.  I *guess* you might be able to say that miners are the transmitters, but that wouldn't quite be accurate.  I thought this article was in reference to actual transmitters, I.E. exchanges.

Hard cap is a highly desired place to be.  Once we hit the hard cap, it adds incentive to pay a bigger fee to get included on the next block, which further incentivizes mining.  We have to ramp up fees if we're ever going to replace the block reward as it dwindles.

You forget that higher fees speed up your transaction because more miners are willing to include them.  As bitcoin becomes more popular there will be incredible demand for fast transactions, resulting in people including higher and higher fees.
@_date: 2013-08-22 14:17:14


Well of course; as long as the network hashrate grows.  But it's not the long run we worry about, it's the short run.  If people can't make money mining, they'll stop.  If they make money when the reward is 25 but start losing money when the reward is 12.5, mining will stop the second the reward drops.


What?  How do you figure?


False dichotomy.  Those transactions won't necessarily STOP if the fee goes up.


And he also never envisioned a scenario where specialized hardware would be created.  Satoshi is not a saint, he is a person.  His views aren't perfect.  The hard cap creates a scarce resource.  It may be prudent to increase the hard cap when we start having transactions drop off due to high fees being required to even be included, but we must always keep in mind that if this resource is not kept scarce, it will be detrimental to the network.


Agreed; it has to be both the market AND the miners though.  The hard cap is a definite benefit to miners, so it should be expected that they'll want to keep it as small as possible to make as much as possible.
@_date: 2013-07-23 10:34:56
If mining equipment doesn't make back the BTC it cost, it wasn't worth the investment, whatever the price of BTC is, because if BTC goes up, you would have been better off holding BTC and if the price goes down, you still would have been better off holding BTC than buying the miner.

And the majority of those papers are about the effects of climate change on something else, which I don't disagree with.  But you can't deny that there is a large body of scientific discussion that denies humans are majorly to blame for climate change.
I'm not going to champion it to one or two adamant redditors.  I've stated my piece and linked it repeatedly.  I understand that there is a large group of people claiming humanity is the major reason for climate change.  But I'm also aware that things like this aren't as cut and dry as the media would have you believe.  I believe there are agendas at play that make it beneficial for the powers that be to blame humans for climate change, and I refuse to just eat the bullshit that's fed to me.

Difficulty is a ratio using "target".  To solve a block you have to find a hash value underneath this target.  What happens as this target approaches zero?  There is a non-zero possibility that target can be so close to zero that you can't find a hash below it.  What happens then?

I am referring to the security of the blockchain, not the security of their individual bitcoins.  


The puzzle takes time to solve, which shows you have done work.  It's not a "magical computer force", it's just computing power.  And average Joes have a way of being taken advantage of.  And if the only miners are average Joes, then they are at higher risk of being hijacked for nefarious purposes.  
I think you've got some terms mixed up.  I'm saying I feel like its a good thing long term to have large companies invested in mining because they have more resources to protect the blockchain from being abused.

Correct, 1 confirmation means its included in a block.  After that, subsequent confirmations just means the chain has been extended and put work on top of your transaction.  After 1 confirmation the fee is no longer influencing anything.  This was an error on bitpay's part.

CPU can excel over GPU in certain scenarios.  But you have to understand the word ASIC simply means "A chip designed to be VERY good at one specific algorithm".  So any algorithm you use can have a chip designed to do it better than a CPU AND better than a GPU.  GPUs just HAPPENED to be better at the SHA256 algorithm, so they were the next step.  ASICs are better than them because they are designed *from the ground up* to do nothing but hash values based on the SHA256 algorithm.

But it does encourage asset bubbles because people need to store their wealth outside of an inflating currency to preserve it.  
Both deflation and inflation (in low, targeted quantities) have positives and negatives.  
Inflation Positives:
* Loans are easier to pay off over time.
* Encourages an increase in money velocity
Inflation Negatives:
* Redistributes wealth to the receivers of newly issued currency
* Everyone has to be an investor to preserve their wealth.
Deflation Positives:
* Allows people to save without fear of depreciation
* Does not redistribute wealth
Deflation Negatives:
* Slows the money velocity
* Makes loans more difficult to pay back over time.
This is why we need both bitcoin and fiat.  They both have their place.  Bitcoin is great for savings, while fiat is great for loans.

McDonald's gives a free meal to employees during their shift, but otherwise strongly discourages eating food of any kind in-store by employees.  I'm sure liability for eating old food is a serious issue, but the bigger issue is that stingy workers will overproduce in order to skim the leftovers for themselves, or purposefully mis-make an order for their own private gain.

Depreciation means everyone's money gets to make a little more money over time; so controlled depreciation means that those whose specialty is not money or who doesn't understand finance can just hold their money and earn a little.  This is better than social security.  Those who just don't spend everything they earn eventually have the ability to live off what they've earned.  They don't have to risk it in the markets, understand annuities or mutual funds or any of these things.  This is a benefit to the individual.  
People still desire to replace things that go bad or go out of style, so a little depreciation only makes them do so a little less frivolously, which has the benefit of incentivizing the conservation of resources by purchasing higher quality goods and reusing.  
Those who WANT to invest and earn returns are protected to a small degree.  The investor gets a cushion where even if all they do is make back exactly what they put in (0% real interest), the depreciation goes ahead and rewards them a little for losing nothing.  And I think the idea that people won't invest it because it is slowly increasing in value is crap.  You can't wish away greed.  People who make 6% still desire to make 7% or 8% or 10%.  Those who *can* risk it will risk it.  Those who understand markets will still participate.

How come you get to say that with such conviction, but someone like me can't say "Ignoring market forces on transaction fees WILL eventually gut the incentive to mine, causing a downward spiral where bitcoin eventually becomes worth nothing?"  Neither one of us can see the future.


Yea; I would rather use something useful for free than pay for something useful.  Are you relying on altruism with this statement?


Because you say so?  I disagree.  I believe that it is both a scaling problem AND an economic incentive problem.  You can't throw one out just because *you say so*.  You have no evidence that either side is right or wrong except that you keep restating your point with conviction.  That's not enough in a discussion like this.  How can you prove that there is no basis for the idea that without a block size limit, fees will never adjust to the level that keeps miners mining?  You keep saying there is an "unfounded fear" and that it is "bullshit", but all you have is conjecture; the same as anyone else here.  I'm not buying it simply because you say so.

No, it means they are *relayed* faster.  Confirmations occur by mining.  Relaying transactions are key though; the more nodes there are and the faster a transaction can be relayed throughout the network, the less of a chance for a double spend.  The more people running honest nodes, the less likely double spend transactions occur.  Plus you help seed the blockchain, making others' downloads of the blockchain faster.

True, if only a few have more than 50% of the hashes, then they can control the chain.  I'll concede this.


What is actually important is that there are A LOT of hashes **AND** the majority of hashes are in the hands of honest individuals who decide NOT to hack the network.  This is assured if it's decentralized enough.  You are claiming that ASIC chips are centralizing bitcoin.  That's not true. 


Correct.  And general purpose devices can't compete with ASICs when given a task the ASIC is designed for.


First, let's replace democracy with security, and then tack on that Joe's purchase will earn him money.  Now we have a clearer picture.


Where did you get these calculations?  Looks like some napkin algebra to me.


Ordering a CPU is a high entry barrier for most of the world.  Why don't we make a chain based on mobile phone ARM processors?  Then entry will be very low (and so will hashing power, aka security).


Requires a pretty big stretch.  Anything you can execute on a CPU can be designed into an ASIC.  ASIC stands for **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit.  It's not specific to bitcoin.  As soon as you design an algorithm that can't be run on the current ASIC, a new type of ASIC will be developed.  CPUs are general purpose.  They'll never be able to compete with specialized chips in this arena.


That's EXTREMELY pessimistic.  We're looking at hundreds of thousands of chips flooding the market.  Each group buy is 10,000 chips, and there are multiple group buys.  Many people have purchased orders on their own.  Companies are springing up to develop these miners for people.  You are thinking that these ASIC products will be prohibitively expensive.  They won't.


There is no such function.  Once you create the function, an ASIC can be developed to execute it.


At first.  Until people develop ASICs or even FPGAs for the same purpose


Fuck armchair activists


It still is.


How so?  If you are using CPUs, then a 51% attack just requires one or two really powerful computers, or a very large bank of CPUs.  In this scenario, Pixar by themselves could execute a 51% attack.


It's not more secure than the second solution.  But both solutions are factually inaccurate and therefore shouldn't be considered.
What you need is a VERY LARGE amount of hashing power RELATIVELY distributed.  A small amount of hashing power greatly distributed is extremely vulnerable.  A large amount of hashing power greatly centralized is extremely corruptible.  You need a balance, and the best way to achieve this balance is to make the best hardware available to the most people.  That's what's happening now.
Please do some more reading on this subject; you are spreading misinformation.

This points out your lack of knowledge on the subject.  51% attacks are because there are more bad players than good players.  So the ONLY thing that matters is there are more good players than bad players, and that is the ONLY thing that keeps the network from being vulnerable and the ONLY thing that prevents a 51% attack.

At the moment.  But gold can be pretty volatile too, and it's considered a store of value.  It was $1700 at the beginning of this year, and it's at $1200 now.  How come one of the oldest, most trusted stores of value can be so volatile and still be considered a store of value?

I'm not trying to be obnoxious.  
Drug cartels and organized crime get under the radar all the time, so it's not impossible.  Consumption tax would make it MUCH more difficult to avoid paying taxes.  


Auditors cost money and take time.  They don't audit the majority of tax filers in this country.  Plus, if you are intentionally trying to avoid taxes, your tax return won't contain anything to flag the automatic auditing system.


The entire country grew more after than before, because the income tax was implemented for WW2 and WW2 was one of the main causes of the economic explosion at the time.  The income tax is not the sole reason the government grew, and there's no telling how it would have benefited/hindered the government without the economic boom of the war.  Correlation does not imply causation.  That's not obnoxious, that's pointing out how you tried to boil down a complicated subject into a "simple fact", which is ludicrous.

Well, it wasn't coerced through force.  And I believe it was pretty common knowledge that it was a Ponzi, so I feel like anyone investing hoped to get in, get a return and get out before it collapsed.  Some people did and made lots of money.  Others didn't and got burned.  Everyone was operating with the same information and some chose to believe and others chose not to.  I think you could make the argument that when he closed up shop and didn't return investments, he stole through force.  I can concede that.  But I think that due to the extensive evaluation of this particular investment, if you didn't know it was a Ponzi, you didn't do your research.  To me that makes it voluntary.

I personally think your solution is in search of a problem.  Regardless of the CPU miners bleating about centralization, there are quite a few power house miners out there; I don't think we'll lose as much as 50% hashingpower at once, since no one even has 50% to themselves.

No hostility here; I own 30 LTC myself.  I just won't invest capital or labor hours mining it because I believe my time is better spent on BTC.


ASIC's are about $11 a chip.  Plus assembly you are looking at $50 or so for a fully functional USB miner.  This is less than 2 months away.  Is that REALLY that difficult to obtain?  $50?  Really?


To me, this makes it a toy, a fledgeling idea.  Real hardware with real capital involved makes it a big boy.  Bitcoin provides a valuable service, and I don't want to trust the security of one of the biggest general ledgers ever to kids in their basements with CPUs.
ASICs add security to the network.  All Scrypt does for Litecoin is keep it available to casual miners for longer.  If you want it to go mainstream, people WILL eventually create dedicated hardware to outperform CPUs.

I agree that anarchy probably won't work.  I think we need a government for national defense and impartial courts.  I don't agree that regulations are organic though; I don't think they pop up naturally in the way you are suggesting.  I think there are many regulations that are common sense and would occur based on consumer demand.  Underwriter's Laboratories and Better Business Bureau are two examples of private regulation.  Not forcing companies to do anything, but making their practices transparent.  I think that's the most powerful regulation; transparency.  And I think if we didn't have the FDA, something would pop up to give its stamp of approval to food and medicine, and that stamp would become a trusted symbol (or many competing "regulatory" type businesses would pop up).
Honestly; look around.  Things aren't going good.  Government needs to play an increasingly SMALLER role in people's lives as we continue into the 21st century.  We've tried the top down approach, and it leads to corrupt power hungry individuals competing for the top.  We need to try a bottom up approach, where the power truly starts with the individual.

Unrealized loss/gain vs realized loss/gain.  You are right, if the price goes to zero, and Bitcoin becomes worthless, he'll never be able to recoup those losses and the loss becomes realized.

Fair enough.  I don't really interpret that as "self-absorbed", but more "self-confident".  I don't intentionally inflict harm on people.  I disagree that this causes harm in and of itself and argue that the harm comes from the reception and improper interpretation of the intent.  But I'm ok with you referring to me as self absorbed if you wish.


There is something separating me from them.  That's the definition of "cultural difference".  Why is it not ok to point that out?  I'm not implying there's anything wrong with it.  It doesn't imply inferiority necessarily and that's the point I'm trying to make.  Should I be offended that there are an inordinate number of black athletes getting paid millions of dollars?  How is that somehow different?  How come there aren't more minorities rallying to have the white race properly represented in sports?  Hmm?  


But this is the problem; if there's no malicious intent, and that's obvious, then why would it hurt someone?  Why would someone be offended because their speech sounds different?  Are we unable in this day in age to recognize our differences without taking that as a slight?  Must we pretend that we are homogenous so that no one has their feelings hurt?

Well you mentioned an encrypted wallet while we were discussing mining; security in the sense of mining means preventing attacks on the blockchain.

In my thought exercise, if the average Joe was the only type of participant in mining, they'd be "relatively" easy to take over and control the blockchain.  Giant mega datacenters with security professionals make that avenue of attack much less likely and more costly.


Well, that remains to be seen.  The idea is that eventually transaction fees will replace the block reward and mining will reach an equilibrium.

Agreed, and until recently that's how credit cards worked based on their TOS.  Recently a class action lawsuit was won that allows companies to charge differently for different payment methods, and you'll be seeing more and more companies passing on the cost to their customers, since companies don't really have a big benefit to credit cards, and fraudulent chargebacks can increase the cost to accept them significantly.  Visa only takes on the risk of the customer.  The merchant is the one who loses out in the case of a chargeback.
Here's a link to the case:

PP almost never sides with the seller.  That's why so many people are scared to sell bitcoins for paypal; chargebacks are rampant.

You don't get economics do you?  If someone convinces me to trade something of value for their good or service, that's the free market.  What they do with the bitcoin afterward means naught to me.  The more people who accept bitcoin, the less people will have to cash out.  Right now, many merchants are cashing out because their supply side doesn't accept bitcoin.  As more and more accept bitcoin, cashing out becomes less of a concern.  This is a way to close the gap.  Get it?


You keep referring to it as a "problem".  If it's a problem for you, bitcoin solves it.  If it's NOT a problem for you, bitcoin introduces one; being transparent to the government that controls whether or not you do business.  Payment services make this easy.  How is that difficult to understand?


A registered, trusted business introduces accountability.  There's someone that can be sued in the event of an issue.  


Do you understand how baby steps work?  If you try to turn everything on its head all at once, many people will reject the idea.  Slow, small, incremental steps.  How fucking dense are you?


Yea, good job increasing adoption which means less people have to sell on exchanges to utilize bitcoin's value.  What stupid fucks; increasing visibility and making it easier to obtain goods and services for bitcoin.


Owning bitcoin does not equate to understanding economics.  If I can't use bitcoin to purchase goods and services, what the fuck good is it?  Right now, many merchants can't buy their supplies in bitcoin.  So how the fuck are they supposed to use the revenue generated by their business to keep the business running?  You think you understand bitcon, but you only understand it from a technical standpoint.  In the wider arena of economics, you have to be able to sustain your business.  Bitpay and Coinbase reduce friction between businesses who operate in a primarily fiat-based economy and consumers who are trying to operate in an increasingly bitcoin-based economy.  If bitcoin can't interface with fiat, it will never be a major tool of business.  
Get it through your skull.  Fiat still reigns in the arena of business, regardless of your childish tantrums.

Well then they kind of hold all the cards then huh?  Because once it's illegal bitcoin is dead, right?


IT'S OPTIONAL!  Don't you GET IT?  Freedom means adhering to social constructs IF YOU CHOOSE, and not IF YOU DON'T.  Also, it's not "dollar tokens", it's "money tokens".


How so?  Bitcoin can be used traceably as a remittance tool.  Do you think Western Union doesn't report their money movements to the government?  I think they do.  These "leeches" you describe (bitpay, coinbase) are undercutting the remittance market like a mother fucker with bitcoin.  They are using it as a *tool* to make money *legally* and that's *ok*.
@_date: 2013-08-05 14:41:06


Well, since there are approximately 53000 blocks mined in a year, your chances of mining a block *in a year* based on your calculations is better than 1 in 2 (53000/90000).  If there was a lottery where a $260 ticket had a better than 1 in 2 chance of winning $2500 I bet a lot of people would play.
Plus, with pooled mining you aren't even gambling to the same degree.  Small steady payouts are much better than large occasional payouts for most.  On slush's pool I get about .027 btc per day mining with 1.8 gh/s.  So 4.5 would be about 2.5 times that, or .0675 btc per day, which works out to 24.64 btc in a year, or about $2,500.  Of course, that's assuming difficulty stays the same, which it won't.


If everyone was making purely rational decisions than many people will probably stop mining at a certain point and let big dogs do it.  But you have to factor in all of the free USB sticks people get as gifts, or buy second hand, that will mine into the foreseeable future as a way to get anonymous bitcoin or just to support the network or as a fun way to participate.  In addition, there are a lot of techno-savvy individuals who can keep up with the times and do the calculations and are willing to risk a little money on the chance of making a good percentage back, all while supporting the btc network.

Bitcoin is **stupid** easy to use.  It's the conversion that's difficult.  


Being on the bleeding edge of technology, catering to a geeky crowd, etc.  Right now it's not great for small business owners, particularly b&amp;m, since adoption is still so small.  But for larger businesses who regularly process international remittances, it could be a game changer once regulations are in place for them to use it legally.  Small businesses will see the real benefits when it is an actual competitor to Visa/MasterCard.  Not so much right now.
But the article you linked talked about an individual having a hard time *selling* bitcoin.  If you are a business owner, bitpay does that for you seamlessly.

It's possible, but remember that there are a lot of costs associated with hosting and running mining hardware; it may make more sense from a business standpoint for many hardware manufacturers to just sell the miners.  Plus the whole "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush thing", it can take a while for miners to recoup their cost.
That being said, most companies have at least been *accused* of pre-mining with their customer's hardware.

Racism is hatred that stems from being afraid of things that are different.  Laughing at differences is not hating people because of them.  There's a difference and the fact that you don't see that is what makes me so angry.  If you are disallowed from shopping at a store because of your race, that is racism and it is silly from a business standpoint.  Intelligent individuals don't participate in racism.  But *joking* about racial differences is nowhere near what you are speaking of.  How can you not see that?


Nowhere have I seen in any rulebook that I'm only free to make a joke on a public forum if I'm sure everyone reading it won't be offended.  Nowhere have I seen it be illegal to publically post things I think are funny.  Call me an asshole if you want, but I'm free to be an asshole.  I don't think I'm being an asshole, but your opinion is beyond the reach of my control.  Similarly, my opinion is beyond the reach of your control.  


That's not why it's stupid.  It's stupid because it shows that anonymous opinions on the internet shouldn't be a source of anxiety for you.  Just skip it and move on.

You can use BOTH.

There is no such thing as "true value".  The market value IS the true value, because that's at what price people are valuing it.  If you value it more than the sale price, buy.  If you value it less, sell.  That's how markets work.

Sure, by increasing supply.  Which is then reflected in the price at the forex markets because people are aware of it.  But this is only "influence", they can't dictate that someone exchange their currency for another. 


That's what I was implying.  Buying and selling for FIAT is no different than exchanging for goods and services.  That's the IDEA.  
My whole point is that if people are willing to buy and sell for dollars or Euro, there will be those who will exchange it for other goods too if they are presented the opportunity at the right price.  Speculators don't detract from this.  The idea that people buying and selling for fiat is somehow less "real" than people exchanging for goods/services is a farce.

Maybe not, but I might laugh if they said something funny.  Remember, I didn't publish the joke, I just thought it was funny.  But regardless, who gives a fuck?


I disagree that it's racist, and I disagree that it isn't a question about how far is too far.  I believe that teaching our society to be "too sensitive" has negative ramifications for our society as a whole.  I've already said that I believe racism is wrong (although I think making it illegal is dangerously close to "thought crime"), but I don't think in this situation it's racist or harmful.


Yea, that's free speech.  The good with the bad.


Because of the backlash from hypersensitive people who can't take a joke, or because it made the serious news organization appear a little childish.  If the joke had been about titty sprinkles, they'd probably get fired too, but titty sprinkles isn't racist.  It's delicious.


So ignoring them makes the gap smaller?  I call bullshit.


I don't think there is a real issue until you and other hyper-sensitive individuals make one.


There's a difference.  The first "racist" joke didn't accuse anyone of wrongdoing.  The first joke just made light of a cultural difference.  No one was even targeted; Sum Ting Wong isn't even a real person.  The second joke leads people to believe a crime has been committed, which requires action.  Falsely leading people to action that causes harm is different than hurting someone's feelings with an insult.  It's not a good analogy; you're reaching.


Close, I'm 30.


Nope, that's off.


I do have a beard; and I've been referred to as a "neckbeard" before, but I didn't go on a crusade to stop people from using such offensive terms and I'll continue to not give a fuck what you choose to call me.  


Lol.  My girlfriend is delicious and you'd be jealous as hell (unless you're gay, in which case you'd be jealous of my girlfriend. Wink Wink).
See what I did there?  I assumed you didn't know me and made light of an improper assumption by making a joke about gay people (without implying that they are inferior).  I didn't go nuts and I didn't accuse you of hating.  In fact, many on this forum don't have girlfriends.  Maybe they'd be a little hurt by being made fun of for not having a girlfriend, but that wouldn't give them license to take up arms and convince the world that the "girlfriend-less" are persecuted because someone made a funny at their expense.

A highly distributed ledger system is not what I'd call "pure bubble".  There is value in information; regardless of whether you want to accede the point or not.  A worldwide, distributed, cryptographically sound ledger system that keeps balances in perpetuity that can be accessed from anywhere on earth?  For free?  And can be utilized for fractions of a cent?  That has value my friend.  Creating a limited space in this ledger system is what makes it's value go UP.  When more people want to use a finite amount of bitcoins (aka entries in the ledger), demand goes up.  Since supply is finite, price must go up to compensate.  
So we fundamentally disagree, because I believe this freely accessible, highly mobile, decentralized, robust, thus far impermeable ledger has fundamental value as a system.

Agreed.  But the dead cat bounce is the idea that even a dead cat can come back to a certain height before falling down.  This phrase is used for a business with "shaky financials" or a security that "it is doubtful that it will recover".  These concepts (shaky fundamentals and a doubt as to its recovery) are what makes a small jump a dead cat bounce.  I would argue that these concepts don't apply in this situation, even if much of this is fueled by speculation.

Here I would disagree.  Mining is only the distribution process.  All the coins already "exist" because we all know about them and how fast they are being released.  The FED just makes new dollars, because there is no preset limit to how many they can print.
This distinction means miners aren't printing money, they are being rewarded it as a way to distribute money that was already printed.  This way miners aren't considered "money creators" and FinCEN's rules aren't applicable.
In saying that miners are printing money, they then are currency creators and all must register as a money transmitter.  Do you believe that to be true?

Back when bitcoin was just a hobby, and worth less than $1 each, mining didn't require much involvement.  But you are talking about real money with real investors and real companies now.  The competition has entered mainstream.  This is no longer just a cute little past-time.  It's a legitimate revenue stream.  Hosting large scale hardware solutions is a full time job, and deserves compensation.  Arm chair activists started bitcoin, but real life capital and labor are making it big time.  If you want to be an armchair activist, buy and use bitcoin.  You don't have to mine to forward the idea.


It may shrink, but it doesn't have to centralize.  Once you get into mining, you can roll profits into newer technology.  It's an arms race and was always designed to be such.


Correct; if you can code it with software, it can be represented with hardware.  If a CPU can do it, an ASIC can be designed for it that operates much faster with less power requirements.


I still don't see why you are trying to lower the hashing power.  I promise you, these ASICs will be very available to the average miner.  Look up the Erupters on eBay; they are currently selling for $500 or so because the market is thin.  Once the chips are delivered en masse, you'll have an opportunity to get in at a low cost.  Just keep an eye out for it.

In addition, Avalon chips are trickling into the economy.  There are hundreds of thousands of 300 MH/s chips coming in soon.  Do you expect this to affect the difficulty?

If I destroy gold (through some chemical process or something, use your imagination) then all gold on earth becomes a little more valuable.  I still destroyed the value that the gold represented, and they are destroying the value those bitcoins represented.  Because it increases scarcity doesn't mean they didn't throw it down the toilet.  In fact, the act of throwing it down the toilet **is** what increases scarcity.  So we are both right.

Option a) I argue is because of taxing of citizens to make the cost of properly disposing of waste almost zero, which I believe is a worthwhile reason to tax me.

For some situations this is a desirable way to go.  IMHO most federal programs could be eliminated with great benefit to society.  Local programs are different though.  They more closely relate to the people they affect and are much easier to influence.


I'm positing that this is a BAD thing.  Hiding the true cost of landfill dumping means that people do it MORE.  Showing people how much it costs means people will do it LESS and instead are more likely to improperly dispose of their waste in a harmful manner.

I'd argue that it doesn't facilitate even distribution, but even *control*.  Right now your fiat dollars have value stolen from them by government inflation.  That value lines the pockets of the big bankers because they get first crack and newly minted money.  By the time that money makes it to us, the additional supply of money has had time to affect the value of all money, and we eat the 2-3% inflation that they suck from us.  They can freeze your assets for crimes they can't even prove you've done and force you to pay taxes by forcefully taking the money directly from your account.  And then when you see things like Cyprus, where they take it to save private institutions, you can see why even *control* is so important.  I should have ultimate say in the value I obtain.  I shouldn't be forced to do anything.  In truth, bitcoin boils down to financial freedom, not financial fairness.

Deflation is only bad for a currency created by credit.  Our fractional reserve lending allows money to be created *out of thin air* to loan out.  When you pay back this loan, you destroy the money that was created.  For this system to work, spending needs to continue.  Bitcoin is not based on this system, and is not susceptible to the same pitfalls.  
Also, because money is not very divisible (only down to 100 parts), deflation eventually hits a physical limitation of how do I represent value smaller than 1 penny.  Bitcoin's limitation in this regard is 10^7 times smaller.  This makes it much less likely to succumb to deflation.

Most transactions are broadcast throughout the network much more quickly than you are indicating.  


No, it means that there is an issue that can be addressed through software.  It's not the protocol that's messed up, it's the speed of broadcast.  That can be made higher in a number of ways.  The first that comes to mind is trusted nodes that maintain hundreds of connections.  Pick a few in your region and broadcast to them.  This would greatly speed up transaction propagation.

It also says there is a man in the sky who knows when natural disasters are going to happen (because he knows everything) but he can't warn us because otherwise it's predetermination.  But he CAN speak to some people sometimes, but never in a way that other people can hear or validate.  Also, he's aware that there are child molesters, but he can't do anything about it.
Has science validated any of that yet?  Yea, didn't think so.  Also, the Bible says that God's word created all the animals in their final form; yet science refuted that.  It says man was created separately from animals, which was also refuted.  It says the earth is thousands of years old; refuted.  Science has been pretty handily proving the bible and the church wrong for hundreds of years.  Of course, one of the beautiful things about most religions is that they are vague enough to be reinterpreted when they are wrong.

Nope; I never said it made it *easier*.  I just said it didn't stop them.


Again, you took that wrong.  I said I'd rather they be out in the open about their manipulation than have to hide behind smoke screens and mirrors.  It's a lot easier to see an enormous amount of low volume trading and deduce market manipulation than it is to detect some of the ways they manipulate regulated markets (of which I'm not extremely well versed).  When you see this stuff, you can reasonably deduce that someone is manipulating the market and take advantage of it.


My original reply was that the protocol doesn't care about manipulation.  Therefore regulation won't ever really be able to prevent market manipulation since anyone can access the protocol and therefore trade however they like.  Then I clarified that my stance isn't that manipulation is somehow a laudable act or that I condone it, just that regulation is silly because the regulators don't control the central authority on bitcoin; since there is none.  Hence "protocol don't care".

It's very relevant.  If he had taken that money at the time and invested directly in bitcoins, and just held it, he'd have made more money.  You have to see whether it would be a better investment just to hold bitcoins, or to buy mining hardware and then mine bitcoins.  At the end, whichever investment ends up with you holding more bitcoins would be the better investment.  In this scenario, he would have been better off just holding bitcoins.  $250 each when bitcoins were $5 would have bought (250 / 5) * 4 = 200 bitcoins, which would now be worth around $20,000.

Since value is a subjective thing, yes, nothing has "inherent" value.  But we use the word "intrinsic" to separate the commonly perceived value of an object as a whole vs the value of the sum of its parts.  
A silver quarter has a face value of $.25, but an *intrinsic* value of ~$4, because that's what people will pay you for the silver inside.  Intrinsic is usually only used when the subjective value for a good's material is disjointed from it's intended value.  For instance, a broken car has little true value as a car, but when you take the metals out and melt them down, you have something people are willing to pay for.  Therefore, a car's intrinsic value is the value of the metals inside, which may be different then the value of the car in good working order.  
Everything boils down to the communication of ideas, and "intrinsic value" conveys the idea of the value of the sum of an object's parts.

Agreed, but since bitcoin is only used as money, those things contribute to the fundamental usage of bitcoin, which is money.


Which is, like, the definition of money and stuff.


It's a return on speculation.  I covered this earlier; a return is what you get back from a venture.  Speculation is a venture that offers a return.  Everything you do is a venture and everything you do offers some kind of return.


Which makes it money...


Therefore bitcoin is money, QED, right?


Which by your previous definition makes it money... right?


You just gave like 4 reasons to qualify bitcoin as money, and then state that it is not yet money?
The context of this thread is that claimed that there are no market fundamentals here.  The point is that market fundamentals are the basis for how value is determined.  If I'm wrong, please correct me, but fundamentals are the value of something outside of speculation.  For the housing market, the fundamentals are how many people need to have a house.  If there are more houses than people who need them, and the value of houses are climbing, then it's easy to say we are in a housing bubble.  When the fundamentals and the price split, it's a good time to make a move.  My point is that market fundamentals for bitcoin exist.  More people accepting bitcoin increases their value.  More tools being developed to utilize bitcoin increases their value.  This value is not necessarily reflected in the spot price, because spot is also influenced by speculation.

When new money is printed, it is released into a "pre-inflated" market.  The problem is those who get the new money get to spend it **before** it's worth less.  This effectively allows them to transfer value from me to them.  I wouldn't have a problem with inflation occurring naturally because of market forces, but that's not the case in the USA.

Centralized implies an overseer with control.  Specialized means that not everyone will be able to just throw their system up there to compete.  Centralized has connotations of government intervention and one (or a few) control points. 
Bitcoin's network is comprised of miners and nodes.  This is an important distinction.  If ever the majority of miners try to steer bitcoin in a way node operators don't agree with, they'll be unable to do so.  Nodes have to accept a block as legitimate for the blockchain to continue. 
Using the word "centralized" has a very specific political and business context.  It's not exactly what is happening.  What is happening is that mining no longer occurs on general computation devices, but must be done on "specialized" hardware.  To participate, you increasingly have to "specialize".  But that doesn't necessarily imply "centralization" as the entire article implies.  There's a difference.

A libertarian didn't have to make it for it to be founded on ideals that are distinctly libertarian.  The *ideals* of bitcoin *parallel* the *ideals* of libertarianism.  Hence it's libertarian (i.e. proscribing to libertarian ideals).

Sure, if that's been the long standing rule and everyone has already accepted the rules as they stand, then fine.  Coming into an existing community and trying to go against the rules is probably a losing battle.  But when the rules are being changed in a community, that is a different story.  The rules are being CHANGED here and people who have already come to expect a certain level of freedom are being told that they shouldn't expect it and to find somewhere else to go.  That's a lot worse than "Hey, respect the rules as they stand".

Paypal and Western Union have a LOT more to worry about right now than the big banks.  Bitcoin can exist along side our traditional money system with ease.  But Paypal and Western Union may see large profits lost because it's just cheaper with bitcoin (many times even WITH the exchange fees calculated on both sides to convert from fiat and back).
At the moment, big banks control the biggest investments many people have ever made (their houses).  They own other companies, own debt from the biggest nations on earth, and their influence is HUGE.  An online public transaction system doesn't negate any of that; even in the near future.

Nodes accept blocks.  If the majority of nodes don't accept a block, it doesn't get mined.  Miners can submit blocks all day long, but if the majority of nodes decide that a miner has "gone rogue", they can just patch the code and ignore the rogue miner's blocks, rendering them useless.
It's a two part check.  Miners do the mathematical legwork, and nodes acknowledge their blocks.  Even if a miner got 51%, if he tried to attack the network, nodes could just say "Meh, we'll just ignore your blocks".

It's not the exchange that makes the cost high, it's the bank wire fee.  That flat fee ($35 at my bank for international wire) is a LOT for trading less than 10 btc.

@_date: 2013-07-27 01:50:29


Completely agree.  As you break things down further and further to their constituent simplest parts, you come to a base minimum of what something is worth.  If the constituent parts are worth more than the thing as a whole, it's value is (value of constituent parts).  If the whole is more than the sum of it's parts, then it's value is (value of constituent parts + utility as a whole).  I picture it like this:
        MarketValue = ValueOfParts + Utility;
If Utility is zero, then market value is simply ValueOfParts.  The value of the parts is the "floor", so to speak.  That I identify as "intrinsic" value.
With bitcoin, ValueOfParts is zero, so the only value is Utility.  This means bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

Just explain it like this:
In accounting, businesses have "books".  These "books" (or ledgers) show money leaving the business and going to suppliers, or coming into the business from customers.  This ledger allows the business to keep track of its finances.  If someone could modify these books, they could steal a lot of money from the business, so businesses have to keep the books safe from evildoers.
Bitcoin is a public ledger for the *entire world* that doesn't need to be kept safe.  Quite the opposite, it is available for anyone to view because it is secured with complicated math.  So now I can add an entry into the global ledger showing that I transferred money to you, and you can be sure that the balance in the ledger is correct because it is *mathematically impossible* to change it.
Edit: Also, there are third party systems out there that already do this, but they require you to surrender your personal info to them to participate.  Bitcoin doesn't require that either.

It won't stall the way you think it will.  Some people pay nothing for electricity.  They may be the only ones mining, so it will take a while, but the chain won't stop.  Additionally, new ASICs operate at very low wattages, so even @ 12.5 btc per block, mining is still profitable.  And by this time, if bitcoin continues to increase in popularity, we should see an increase in transactions, which mean an increase in fees.


It's only 100.


How then are you proposing smooth the reward?  I don't see many people donating money to miners.  That seems a little ridiculous.
Edited to add; your proposal to subsidize miners may gain more traction *after* EVERY miner shuts their hardware off. When many who have a stake in bitcoin have an interest in continuing the chain, it may be worth it for them to pay people to mine until the next difficulty block.  But smoothing the entire thing seems silly at this point.

Only against itself.  Currencies don't exist in a vacuum.  Plus, this only happens because of purposeful inflationary practices.


Right, because our current economy is based on debt.


Not true.  As long as **someone somewhere** uses it, it will retain value.  You don't have to necessarily use it.  As long as SR and SatoshiDice exist, people will continue to use bitcoin.


Both are caused by a third factor; a lack of trust in the backing of the USD.  Bitcoin's backing is cryptography.  


Every "BUY" order also has a "SELL" order.  You can't buy if no one is selling.  As long as buyers and sellers exist, it will continue.  Obviously, those who hoard are demanding them (you can't hoard if you don't own, you can't own if you don't buy).  As long as there is demand there will be supply.  
You are right; if *everyone* stopped using them they would lose value, but at this point I don't think that's a big worry.

Just upvoted to cancel out people who downvote simply for disagreeing.  These are valid concerns.
I think this:


is highly simplistic.  There are XBT users who hoard until the price is right, and then sell.  There are XBT users who spend some and save some.  There are XBT users who have an unexpected emergency who have to sell off what they were hoarding.  There are LOTS of circumstances in a human's existence that encourage saving or spending.  To try and boil it down to two discrete scenarios ignores the variance in life.
Hoarding (or as I refer to it; "saving") has never been the reason for declining economies.  The biggest depression in the US history was caused by people overleveraging margin and then subsequent mishandling by the FED and the government.  
Just because one economic school says that inflation is good and deflation is awful doesn't mean that's the only school of thought in existence.

There is no limitation in the protocol.  If it stops being economically feasible to include a transaction, miners will stop including it.  This is as designed.  Right now the 25 btc reward means that miners don't really care how many transactions are included, but it won't be this way forever.

Technology is moving at an incredible pace.  Right now there are group buys for usb miners that mine as good as a video card @ 1/20th or less of the power.  This allows anyone to get into the game.  It's a little overpriced now, but it won't stay that way if every other technology is any example.  More and more cheap options will pop up that allow small time miners to add hashing to the network.
Plus, if anyone grows too big, it threatens the security of the network, which (IMO) will cause drops in price, which make mining less profitable.  It's in a miner's best interest to mine instead of try to double spend.

You make a lot of assumptions


So FAR.  


How do you get away with paying no fee?  Because miners pick up those transactions.  There is no cost to a miner to picking up an extra transaction.  The cost is to the full nodes storing the blockchain.  Miners are motivated by profit.  Full nodes not so much.  If every block always has enough room for every transaction, there is no financial incentive not to include every transaction.  It's just not there.  When the reward is gone, if the block size can handle EVERY transaction, fees will be less.  How can you possibly refute that?  
I agree that if transaction volume increases to a significant quantity, then the block size will need to be increased; but there has to be a balance.  If the block size is too low then miners' incentives will decrease.  That's affecting the security of the chain.  If the block size is too high then normal people will be discouraged from using the blockchain ever, which is bad for bitcoin.  But right now, the block size is already too large.  But that's ok at the moment because the reward is subsidizing miners.  As that shifts, we need to *strike a balance*.


No more than forcing bitcoin scarcity is bullshit reasoning.  Economic forces.  It's not unfounded fears, it's establishing equilibrium in a free market.

I'm unwilling to agree to that assertion, true.  I believe that to fit bitcoin into current terminology, with all of its unique features never before seen in a currency, that "creation" occurred when the protocol was founded, and distribution happens by miners.  If the protocol was changed to increase the amount of bitcoins deigned to be distributed, that change in protocol would effectively mint more coins (even though they haven't been DISTRIBUTED yet).  Similarly, a change in protocol that decreases the amount of bitcoins would effectively destroy coins.
My assertion is that the protocol created 21 million coins in 2009, and distributes them with each new block to encourage adoption.  The distribution method was put in place to disappear over time, and have people paying transaction fees to be included in the mining block.  The block was never intended to *create new coins*, but rather to house transactions securely.  The method of distribution is simply a way to distribute coins to those who facilitate their use.  If all coins had been pre-mined, miners would still be paid in transaction fees.

This is only happening right now because of inept hardware companies.  I for one expect to use my Gen1 Avalon chips (if they ever come) and any GPUs as a source of heat in the winter, even if they aren't making the big bucks.  I think heaters that also mine is an incredible idea; if you are already using electricity to heat your house, running it through a mining rig will help save on heating costs, basically making the electricity free.  ALL miners are profitable if electricity is free.
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:31:19

@_date: 2013-07-20 01:09:32
Right.  In reality, since a certain number of coins are mined per day no matter what (with some fluctuation), low end miners are being replaced by high end miners, which means no net loss of bitcoin supply.  So the only thing that's happening is that low end miners who have had to, for quite a while, find ways to use their bitcoin, be it exchanges, investments, or goods and services, find themselves now without a source.  Demand for bitcoin will remain for many.  When supply stays constant but demand goes up, so too does price.
We have to remember that miners who are shutting down are doing so because electricity is more expensive than the bitcoins mined.  So previously they were paying for electricity to mine bitcoins, they now don't have to pay for that electricity any longer and can now spend that money on bitcoin.
I'm just thinking that many miners who are deep enough into mining to know when it is and isn't profitable will probably continue to participate in the bitcoin economy, but now will have to pay to play.

It's not harmful in and of itself.  Your problem is with how electricity is generated, not what bitcoin is doing.  If electricity is derived from renewable resources (which would give you an edge in mining b/c the cost per kWh would be lower) then it's not damaging to the environment.

How many people will control the cpus?  You said that everyone has on average two CPUs.  That means some people have MANY more than 2, because a ton of people in 3rd world countries have 0 cpus.


Less than how many people have CPUs.  So? Decentralization is only *one* side of the coin.  You need hashing power on the other side.  You can have 10,000,000 cpus with a total hashing power of 1 TH/s.  But if a gov.t wanted to 51% it, they could secretly develop an ASIC to perform your hashing function and wipe out the network with 50 TH/s.  You need LOTS of hashing power DISTRIBUTED amongst a wide variety of players.  You MUST have both for a truly secure chain.  Having lots of centralized hashing power is easily corruptible.  Having a low amount of extremely distributed power is easily attacked.

I think you are exaggerating how much it costs to enter the market here.  The USB sticks are currently $250 or so, which is less than many GPU miners, and the USB sticks consume MUCH less power, lowering the barrier of entry for many in locations where electricity is uber expensive.


I disagree.


Except its impossible to print more money, and thus steal from us by way of inflation.


5 to 10 major players?  Honestly that's not a realistic concern.  There are people all of the world all over this shit.


I should; I wish I had more capital right now, because big things are peaking over the horizon.


No, I'm referring specifically to mining and/or production and sale of miners.  Not the products on top (although that contributes value).  


It has everything to do with mining.  There are real investors and real companies ramping up production of miners both to mine with and to sell to other miners.

That's not what people say; they say that open source is a *better* alternative because it's *more difficult* for bugs to hide.  Very few people say it's "secure"; most say it's "**more** secure".  


Closed source vulnerabilities can be patched too, but only by the owner of the source.  Open source can be patched by anyone, and therefore more likely to actually be patched by someone who needs it now, as opposed to the entire community waiting around until the owner gets around to it.  That puts the customer at the mercy of the owner's priority list.

Why would anyone loan an inflating currency?  Their dollars are coming back less valuable than they left.  Oh yea, because the interest takes the inflation into account, just like interest in a BTC denominated asset would take the scheduled deflation into account, unless you are referring to the current rise in value, which is more price discovery than economic deflation.  As it becomes more widely adopted, the price will settle.  Since supply can receive no shocks, the price should eventually be more stable than gold and silver.


The deflation is introduced slowly, and in a calculated fashion.  Interest can be adjusted to account for it.  It might not be good to denominate debt *at the moment*, but this first phase is going to spike higher as it is initially adopted.


Oh you!  Hoarding is another word for saving, which means not spending money on shit you don't need.  Inflationary currencies spur asset bubbles as people scramble to divest their wealth out of a vehicle that loses value and into a vehicle that gains value.  That's ultimately bad for an economy too as we're currently experiencing.

I agree.  The "guaranteed" value is $.25, the "intrinsic" value is ~$4.  Since the "intrinsic" value is more, that's what anyone who knows that the quarter is made of uses.

$9k right now = 72 btc @ $125 each.  Lets say the miner mines 65 btc before it is more expensive to run than it makes.  That's a net loss of 7 btc.  
"But, if the value of btc goes up to $140 each, then the investor made ((65 * 140) - 9000) = $100."  That is a true statement; however, if the investor had just used the $9k to buy 72 btc, he'd have made ((72 * 140) - 9000) = $1,080.  
So yes, if BTC goes up and the miner underperforms, you could still make money.  But if your calculations prophesy that you will make less BTC in the end than you can buy with your investment NOW, then you should just buy and hold BTC.  Not doing so means to fall trap to the "Miner's Fallacy".

It's more complicated than that and you know it, deep down.  Continuing to parrot "property rights" doesn't make it true.  
For all things illegal, you get the following equation
A = B * C
where 
* A = (Benefit of commiting X) 
* B = (% Likelihood of getting caught) 
* C = (Cost of getting caught)
So for this equation,
* A = Gains from not paying for dumping
* B = How hard you police your property
* C = Penalty for dumping on someone else's property
With property rights, you only have control of B and C.  You can monitor your property more for potential dumpers, and/or make the penalties C more harsh.  These are the only ways to encourage legal dumping.  With subsidies (taxes), you also can control A, in addition to B and C.

That's one type of return.  It is by far not the only type.  A return on investment is the amount of money "returned" to you, hence the name.  There are many ways to make a "return" (aka positive return) on investments.  Speculation is one way, if you are good.


Currency is a specific kind of commodity.  Look up a true definition of money.  It is a facilitator of trade; nothing more.  It is a commodity that the community agrees has value.  


See here's where you are getting mixed up.  Gold is not *increasing* in value.  It's value is *static*.  There are speculators that cause the price to rise and fall, but gold's draw is as a *hedge*.  Gold today is worth about the same as gold was worth 1000 years ago.  The ratio of how many dollars an ounce of gold can buy you has gone up, but that's a result of the dollar becoming worth *less*, not gold becoming worth *more*.




That's not necessarily true.  Bitcoin COULD be a replacement for SOME specific fiat.  It is not *intrinsically* reliant on it as you say.  It doesn't *need* fiat to function on it's own.  I don't think *intrinsically* means what you think it means.

Of course the BTC wouldn't be $100 if a soda costs 0.1 BTC, that was my exact point.
You are saying that people won't buy bitcoin if a soda costs X.  That's not how economics works.  The price of the soda will decrease to what people are willing to pay for it...  


Sure.  But hoarders don't *stop* people from trading.  So the trade will continue as if the hoarder wasn't participating, except the hoarder removes some quantity x from trade, which makes all the trades a tad more valuable.  And don't forget that the hoarder *bought* the coins to begin with and has a price point at which they'll sell.


I agree.  That doesn't speak to whether or not hoarders should hoard, only that you need transactions to occur.  Hoarding is truly just buying low and selling high, long game.

There are other goods, like tools and cables and plastics that don't devalue over time, at least not at any kind of rate you see with the dollar.  It is not a carte blanch statement for every good, and you'll notice I didn't mention services either.  I'm just saying, there are lots of situations where the good itself is not depreciating by sitting on a shelf, which effectively means they are earning around 2% annual yield.  Right?

As more rational investors come in, we'll hopefully see less volatility.

Liquidity is how easily a commodity can transact hands.  Traditionally, liquidity is how much of a commodity is being traded, since commodities traditionally cannot be split.  Since bitcoin can be split, liquidity is much less of a problem.  The remaining bitcoins in play are valued higher and split smaller.


But the 20oz soda won't cost .1 BTC if BTC costs $100.  You are getting value and price mixed up.


Maybe, maybe not.  Who can say the mind of a miner?  
In the end, Bitcoin is what it is.  Hoarding doesn't hurt bitcoin.  Bitcoin just is.  Hoarding may change the value up or down, but whether that helps or hurts is a matter of perspective.  It would help me if the value went down, because I'd like to buy more.  That means I want more being traded.

These are two different things.  You can create an obligation in bitcoin too, it just doesn't actually *create* bitcoin.  This obligation also would create the need to seek out BTC that only BTC can meet.  If they don't, they lose their collateral and trust.  Credit rating is just a private market trust rating which is not directly created because of the USD.
Your first point is the only point that matters.  Currencies are forms of transactions.  Government backed currencies win because the government creates a demand for them.  Debt can be created with any currency.  I currently owe my coworker 14 seashells.  He loaned me 12 seashells, and I agreed to pay him back + interest equivalent to two seashells.   Isn't that debt? 
Also, bitcoin doesn't necessarily need to be anything more than a vehicle for fiat to be successful.  There is a demand for an inexpensive, reliable method to send value across the globe.  Bitcoin is an attempt to supply that demand.  If it is worth $1.00 or $5000; as long as it has **some** value it fills a need.

Valid reasons or not, some people want to do business without having to plan for chargebacks.  A reputable business still offers refunds if there's a valid problem.


Capital controls is the first thing that comes to mind.


I do too.  I am not one of the fervent "replace ALL THE THINGS" people.  Bitcoin has it's place, cash has its place, escrow services like Visa and MasterCard have their place.  In addition, with an escrow service for bitcoin there's likely not much difference.  But people still use cash for specific reasons, which is why bitcoin is nice to have as a digital cash option.


Well, your analogy used the supermarket.  Have you or anyone you know ever had to get the credit card involved in a supermarket purchase dispute?  Me either.  Large retail chains have policies in place (90 day refund, store credit for special circumstances, etc).  Smaller mom and pop stores handle disputes so as not to lose customers.  Escrow is not as important here.  Using your card at a supermarket is more about accessing cash held securely at the bank and less about protecting yourself from the supermarket scamming you.


My point is that, assuming everything else is exactly the same, and the US comes out with some digital cash equivalent (without needing to rely on third party clearing houses), bitcoin is STILL a viable option because it's apolitical.   The major advantage of bitcoin over visa/paypal is that visa/paypal are built on top of cash.  Cash is political.  Bitcoin is not.  So escrow services built on bitcoin would be similar to visa/paypal, but with the additional benefit of being separated from government control.  And this doesn't relate to consumer legislation per se, but at the base level, all else being equal, this is the answer to "what value does this method offer over Visa or Paypal et al?"

Investment usually implies return on your money.  If you don't get a return, then it's not an investment.  If you are investing in these, then you are making a bad investment.
I bought one, but it's not an "investment".  I just wanted one because they were cool and scarce and I liked them.  I never once expected an ROI.  Buying multiple Erupters appears to be an attempt to make ROI, which won't happen.  Also, the future of bitcoin is irrelevant here.  Prices skyrocket, still a better deal to just buy.

bitcoin-qt is built on the SHA256 protocol.  A scrypt block wouldn't be compatible with current versions of bitcoin-qt.  To be on the scrypt chain, you'd have to use a "scrypt" version of bitcoin-qt for the new fork.  That'd be what forks the chain, when people start using a modified node.  All the modified nodes would be the new chain network, and current nodes would continue the same chain network.

Agreed.  This can cause people to get burned.  But it's nice to finally see people being forced to take responsibility for their own action.  Instead of creating a consumerist market, where people just throw money at whoever makes the most promises, and the government sorts it out, people have to be careful with their money.  It's a breath of fucking fresh air, that's what it is.  You should be doing business with known vendors with a track record or using a known escrow service with a track record if you intend to lower your risk in a transaction.  Trust is big, and by protecting consumers from themselves, we've eroded the value in trust and as a by product have destroyed personal responsibility.

But the flaw I see here is that technically there IS no insider trading on bitcoin, since it's distributed and public.  The article you linked describes how to take advantage of some future upswing known only to the manipulator.
And if you are aware of these trends, do they not then become easy to spot?  If investors are properly informed (which they should be before investing) then they know these tactics and should be betting appropriately.  If you don't know enough to follow the manipulators, then this probably isn't the game for you.  
This is why I don't trade bitcoin.  I don't know enough about manipulation, trends, etc.  I use bitcoin but don't keep a sizable exposure to it.  Manipulation doesn't affect me at all.  IMHO anyone who invests without knowing what they are getting into deserves to have the rug pulled out from under them.  Caveat Emptor, right?

By that logic then the dollar isn't backed by anything either.  Except faith that the government issuing it continues to honor it.  Like the faith that gold's properties won't change or that bitcoin's algorithm won't change.  In the end all value is subjective, so I don't understand how this statement actually conveys any meaning in this context.


Just like anything.


Sure, why not?


No, but that's because taxes are collected from the same entity that issues the dollars.  Of course they aren't going to take anything but their own money in payment.  It's the primary way they create demand for their otherwise worthless notes.


You could if people were willing to trade for them; Why not?


A currency is a commodity traded to facilitate exchange.  In jail cigarettes are a commodity.  What is your definition of a currency if not a unit of measurement used to facilitate trade?


It's a currency now because people accept it for trade for goods and services.  That's what a currency is.  Regulations are government controls over an otherwise free economy.  You seem a bit confused.  Regulations alone do not a currency create.

Since none of your first points were correct, this one is by inference wrong as well.


Ok, then how can you declare something "a currency" or "not a currency" if you don't know what a currency is?

First off.  Holy shit dude, you are fucking nuts.
If I wasn't a stubborn asshole like you, I'd have ignored you long ago.  But since you persist...


The reason that the example fits BOTH of our definitions is because they are closely intertwined.  Distinct can mean either A) differing from other things or B) plain, unmistakable, easily identified, notable.


I never "changed" positions since both definitions fit my original intent.


The original topic was about tying bitcoin to libertarian ideals.  This inane discussion about the word "distinct" is the discussion that is off topic; I've simply been trying to put us back ON topic (notice what sub we are in, please).


Ok, my apologies.  I was not aware that you felt so strongly about the definition of the word "distinct", and instead thought you were trying to prove a more subject-appropriate point that bitcoin wasn't libertarian in nature.  


No, it highlights my desire to stay on topic.  Others responded to me that it wasn't libertarian.  I didn't want the conversation to devolve into an argument about the meaning of A SINGLE WORD.  That's why I used the word "pedantic" in my last post.  I hope you've looked it up by now.


1) No, I do not agree with this statement.  Republicans believe in central control about many things, including sexuality, abortion and military spending, which makes for larger government, more central planning and control, and less free markets.
2) Because they are basically THE SAME.
3) Because I couldn't believe that your sole purpose in writing **paragraph after paragraph** was to dispute my usage of a *single word*.  
4) I admit, to this point I was wrong.  I assumed you had a larger agenda than to simply dispute the use of a single word, since you spent so much time arguing the point.  I underestimated the seriousness with which you take the word "distinct" and to what lengths you will go to assure it's proper usage in all the written word.  Do you troll many other subs looking for grammatical errors?  Because you failed in this instance, since you still haven't shown that the word "distinctly" is not synonymous (and therefore appropriately substituted) for "plainly, notably, or obviously".

I disagree.  Miners don't "create" coins any more than people finding gold "create" gold.  This distinction is made because otherwise it could be argued that miners are the issuers of bitcoin, which of course they are not.  The protocol specifies how to obtain bitcoin.  A creator would have control, miners don't have control.  They have to get lucky, like a miner in the real world. 
Edit: PS The "protocol" dictates how many coins exist.  We could change the protocol, but a single miner can't do so, and therefore he doesn't create the coins.  The coins exist AND have value solely due to social construct.  The math just keeps the ledger from being manipulated; it doesn't create coins either.  The coins are created by social agreement to a protocol and adherence to its rules.

True, but there must be a distinction between things that have value as a money AND something else, and things that only have value as a money, right?  Gold and silver are precious metals because they have usefulness as a metal.  That is the REASON they were used as money for so long, because they were recognized for their value as metals.


You say this but Bitcoin doesn't have value as anything OTHER than a medium of exchange.  It may be that in your list of definitions there is nothing that quite quantifies bitcoin.  I think saying that the definition of fiat must require government sanction is silly; fiat means "let it be done" and shouldn't imply GOVERNMENT, but only AUTHORITY.  Bitcoin has an AUTHORITY, the protocol.  


This conversation is displaying more and more that the "distinction" you speak of is purely academic, and I'm curious why you find the distinction important.


But what does it imply?  Were you only discussing this with Mr. Tucker or were you making a point for a wider audience?  Because I don't see a point to the distinction.

But wouldn't selling the chips be much less work?  The blades have to be assembled, which takes time and money.  Selling tons of chips means you get a return, and you don't threaten bitcoin, which is another revenue stream.
Even if it is better to mine than to sell chips, you also have to remember that if you as an individual approach 51%, you threaten the bitcoin network and people will be scared away.  Then you can mine all the coin you want and it's worthless.  It seems to me that selling the chips guarantees an ROI while decentralizing the network, which in turn adds value to your other revenue stream, mining.  Win-win.

Universal healthcare is very effective in small homogenous nations where most of the people are the same and the majority of people are ok with 50% of their income being taken for taxes.

I'm just tired of the narrative that saving is bad.  Spending money on things you don't need send the wrong signals to the market.  By spending the majority of your money on things you need, and not spending if you don't need anything shows producers what to focus their capital on producing more of.  When you spend with the idea that your helping the economy, the market misappropriates production to the frivolous things.  Then, when crunch time comes, three are a ton of resources tied up in stupid widgets and not enough in things people really want or need.
Spend when necessary, don't if you don't really want to or need to.

If a currency can't survive people hoarding it, especially an inherently deflationary one, then it's doomed to fail already.  One of the draws of bitcoin is that it can't be tampered with by government, so a lot of people are using it to park value while Europe gets its shit figured out (or dies trying).  It's gonna happen.  If bitcoin can't survive it, it wasn't meant to be.

I agree, and prefer investment to speculation.


That is just the removal of anything of tangible value from the commodity used as money.  This is a recent phenomenon.  It's only in the last 40 years that money hasn't been backed by a "hard commodity".


I can walk you through the calculations if you need, but in roman times, soldiers were paid in denarii.  Each denarii contained (at first) around 8 grams of gold.  I highly paid soldier would get approximately 225 denarii per year (  That equates to around 58oz of gold per year, or at today's prices, about $70k (assuming $1200 per ounce).  That's the same as a medium rank officer gets paid now.  Erego, gold is worth about the same now as it was a hundred years ago.  Seems pretty stable to me.


Indeed you could not.  You have to take into account that eggs and bread are now created using industrialized agriculture, which greatly reduced the value of each egg or grain of wheat, because more can be produced now for less cost.  Bronze or iron ore may be more on point.  Otherwise, yes, to me an egg is worth approx. 1/3 the cost of breakfast.


I don't know how you can assert that.  Bitcoin can be expanded to a nearly infinite number of decimal places, making them effectively limitless in their quantity.


Only because the market for bitcoins is currently so thin.  As more people accept it, less people have to exchange fiat for them.  If my landlord, my grocer and my electric company accepted bitcoins, then any bitcoin I earned could be converted directly into things I use on a regular basis, instead of having to convert into fiat first.


I'm ok with fractional reserve banking.  It greases wheels.  The problem is governments not allowing banks that take high risks to suffer the consequences.  By bailing out banks we socialize losses while allowing them to keep their gains.  THIS is the problem; there's no risk to their risky behavior.  I don't see it as a problem of fractional reserve lending, but a problem with allowing the government to take so much from me in the form of taxes and using it to keep banks that make poor fiscal decisions in business.

The startup capital I'm referring to is being poured into third party applications for bitcoin.

How is it a huge assumption that there are many people who don't pay for their electricity or have it subsidized somehow?  That's a bigger assumption than "In the future there will be only a few GIANT MEGAMINERS and they will be attacked by DDOS because they don't know how to secure themselves, even though they have the technical knowhow to create GIANT MEGAMINING operations."?  Seriously, WTF?


And you still fear with 500 mining operations that a significant number of them (who have the technical wherewithal to setup and operate huge datacenters full of mining hardware) will be vulnerable to attacks?  How are these schmucks operating a successful mining operation if they can't defend themselves against attacks?  


Whose mining at zero profit?  I said "zero electrical cost".  That translates to PURE PROFIT.  Those mining at zero profit are silly.  The network doesn't need them; it needs those who are actually securing the network, and those people are being compensated.

I'm not "adamantly" against it, although I feel that some people are secretly hoping for profit, and just telling people they are doing it for fun to avoid the inevitable "YOU WILL NEVER SUCCEED" comments.  Mining to me seems kind of tedious if no profit is to be gained, and if you like that tedium (which I kind of do, sort of, sometimes, until cgminer freezes AGAIN! argh!) then I believe a better use of your time would be folding at home, which simulates a similar tedium and ends up with a greater social profit IMHO.  I really don't care either way though.


Individuals are still trying to make a profit.  Profit motive should be king here.  If you know you will lose money, there are other ways to benefit the bitcoin community without losing money, and there are other ways to spend money that benefits humanity in other ways.  My suspicion is people preemptively say "I know I know, no profit right?" while secretly believing that everyone else is dead wrong.  Take from it what you will.


I DO have an issue with this statement.  The sunk cost of a miner has to be calculated into the investment, and if you are expecting the btc price to save you, why not just buy btc instead?  The answer goes back to the previous paragraph, which I've already addressed, so I'll not do it again.  But if profit motive brings you to mining, and you have a good idea mining will lose you money, you are being silly investing in a miner and not in btc directly.  


Well, not EVERYTHING is related to the bitcoin community.  Mining and owning bitcoin are very tightly linked.  You could throw some wild ass investment idea into the mix if you wanted, but it's not really relevant.


So you wouldn't have to fund BFL and Avalon and all the other scumbag companies that are flopping around sucking funds from people.  You could use a GPU (like the mining days of yore) and go that route instead.  ASICs are very specialized machines.  And part of the reason I'm saying to stay away from mining if it's unprofitable is so that people won't buy ASICs that will cost more than they make the owner back.

It's not a *requirement*, it just helps protect you from bitcoin volatility.


No, once you have 6 or 7 bitcoins in your possession, you then treat that as "zero".  Whenever you need to purchase something in BTC, then you pay in BTC and immediately execute a purchase order.  


No one is forcing you to.  I am not one of the people who think bitcoin will replace USD or any government issued currency.  It fills a niche; easy to transport, finite supply, fungible and transactions that are impossible to reverse.


What truly hurts bitcoin is how difficult it is to get from fiat to bitcoin and back.  It's a direct effect of governments exerting so much control over fiat money.  Don't be mad at bitcoin, it's trying to help revert this control back to you, the user.  The fault for this specific issue lies squarely on the shoulders of government controls.  Were you able to convert to and from fiat easily, volatility wouldn't make a big difference because you could convert and spend relatively quickly.

It may be predicted to be a problem in the future, but your last post insinuated that it's already an issue, and it's not.  I maintain several full nodes at the moment.  Disk space is less than $1 a gig; and many predict that Moore's law will continue to outpace blockchain growth for the foreseeable future.


A) Lite clients aren't the only option; there are many who run full nodes.  B) I'm pretty sure having a central chain and trusting that chain is straightforward; what's your problem with lite clients?


All that shows is that there are balances that have remained stagnant for a long period of time, not that the keys are lost or that they've been abandoned.


Pointless endeavor.  I (and many like me) disagree with moving those coins or subsidizing miners any more than they are already being subsidized. 


Hot block size limit refers to how many transactions a second can be processed.  I disagree that the fee restructuring conversation is happening everywhere.  Point me at these conversations; I'd love to follow and participate in these discussions.


And there is always a bit of "The sky is falling" about everything, all the time.  There are thousands out there with tinfoil hats on thinking the government is out to get them all the time.  That doesn't mean their concerns are legitimate.


No fee restructuring has taken place.  If you are referring to the 5430 satoshi size limit, that's a CLIENT change, not a PROTOCOL change.

At some point, but production now is at 110 nm, which is WAY higher than Intel is working with at 28 nm.  So electrical consumption is dropping even as difficulty is going up.
I'm still not convinced that a halving event will have the catastrophic consequences you propose.


Why do they have to be zero-output?  Just play a bunch of satoshi dice.  


If the difficulty is so high that ASIC miners aren't paying for their electric usage, it has to be EXTREMELY high.  At that point even a 51% attack becomes prohibitively expensive.  I don't think we have to worry about that.


I disagree.  I think that the contractions you speak of will be much less catastrophic and I don't see any evidence other than your conjecture that it will play out the way you assume.

401ks and stuff are managed by investors.  The idea is you turn over control of your money to a trusted investor, who charges a small fee to invest your money wisely.  That investor is the one who should be aware of these kinds of issues.

That was my point.  The article was inaccurate.


The thing with using "centralized" in this context is that it usually implies some kind of "central planning", as in governmental oversight.

From my quick research, it sounds like competitors used anti-monopoly laws agains Standard Oil because they couldn't compete by providing a superior product at a better price.  It even says here that their market share was being eroded before the first anti-trust law was even brought to court and continued to erode before the company was even ordered to break up.  So basically the government jumped in and took the credit for breaking up a monopoly that was A) created based on innovation and B) was already starting to lose ground to others who had learned from their techniques.  It appears that Standard Oil reinforces my point.

That's not what I'm saying at all.  I'm saying that their value comes from their utility, and their price (which is different than their value) reflects that.  As more people utilize them and understand their true value, the price will go up.  That's supply and demand.  It may be that we're in a temporary bubble, I'm not going to say that I am sure we are not, but long term $1000 a bitcoin is not an unreasonable value.

But the fiat withdrawel shutdown was a direct result of too many wires.  Which was a direct result of the dwolla seizure.  The dwolla seizure set in motion a domino effect that caused MtGox to shut down all trade with the US.  This was a chain of events (or *effects*) caused by Homeland Security's seizure.  It can be said that Homeland Security's seizure effectively cut off all trade from US to MtGox.  For all intents and purposes, Homeland Security's actions caused all trade to cease from the US to MtGox.  Without Homeland Security's intervention, US based transactions would still be occurring.  Because of their intervention, transactions are not occurring.  
Saying that Homeland Security effectively shut down MtGox may not represent the entire chain of events, but it's close enough to reality as to not deserve scrutiny and/or ridicule for being stated in a publication.  Why give the publisher a hard time about something that is virtually identical to the actual chain of events to most people?

I don't feel like credit cards are a painful process for the most part.  There is consumer safety (read: they charge a percentage over their costs + profit to "insure" you), easy payment processors (from a consumer standpoint), and direct connection to a bank account where a paycheck is generally directly deposited.
The drawbacks are more merchant-side than customer side.  Look at BFL's ongoing debacle.  Those that paid with Paypal were for the most part able to recover their funds.  Those that paid in BTC were shit out of luck.  That's a win for Paypal.  Consumer protection is very sparse in the bitcoin world.


And you'd be cutting out a giant consumer base that doesn't have BTC.  
The point is, I like bitcoin because it solves some specific problems.  Large transactions aren't bound by national laws and accounts can't be frozen from central checkpoints.  Bitcoin is apolitical, meaning no one government controls it.  These are huge selling points.  But sending $10 across the country?  If you have a few days, either option is good.  If you need to do it NOW, neither option is good and currently only Western Union *really* solves this problem in an easy way.  The potential is there for bitcoin, and I've invested in [Moneero]( because they are working on platforms built off of bitcoin to solve this problem for the laymen, but we're not there yet.  If the average person wants to send their local currency to a friend over a long distance, bitcoin is not the easiest, nor is it generally the fastest, since obtaining bitcoin can be a bit of a hassle the first time or two that you try.

Well, part one is true; I wouldn't want to take out a loan in BTC, they appreciate relatively quickly and become more and more difficult to pay off over time.  But part two, the "earning points or something of value" part, the credit cards are making that money back and more, you just don't see it on your receipt.  They charge the merchant, who passes the charge to you.
If bitcoin becomes widely adopted, I expect that many will see a discount if you buy in bitcoin.

I'm not fully aware of how it works but the possibility is there.  At 9 gigs, though, it's not a pressing issue.  The more pressing issue is instituting a dynamic fee structure (or facsimile thereof) to keep people from abusing the network without at least paying for the privilege.

We started out discussing Paypal policy, which is based on not having their business shut down by US laws.  So we are clearly discussing the application of laws to bitcoin.  I can't attest to what you are discussing, but this thread is about Paypal policies, which are designed to keep them from getting shut down, and this enters us into the realm of legal discussion.


Re-asserting your position in the debate does nothing to further your side of the debate.  I disagree.  Mining only *distributes* the coins.  No one can "make" them, because they are already made.  Digital goods like this have a much more ambiguous definition of "creation".  


Inhaling smoke is the definition of smoking, so this specific analogy is incorrect.  There is a sharp distinction in our discussion because the legal ramifications are large.  The legal ramifications are large because there is a distinction, and it is not purely pedantic.


I don't recall requesting your advice, and I don't intend to follow it.


This comment almost made me ignore you.  I feel other readers should see that there is a discourse that requires exploring here, so I chose to respond any way.  But anyone who asserts that bitcoin is not a currency doesn't have a true understanding of what a currency is and shouldn't be asserting their opinion as fact.  *ANYTHING* can be a currency.  A currency is just a commodity that a community agrees has value (whether or not it actually does), and is used by that community to facilitate trade and avoid situation of The Double Coincidence of Wants.  Cigarettes become a currency in jail.  Seashells have been used as a currency.  [Rai Stones]( are giant round stones used as currency.  Currency is just a medium of exchange, and since people assert that bitcoin has value and use it to facilitate the exchange of goods and services, it is **clearly** a currency.

That's what I've been thinking since the Greenlist stuff started popping up.  Anyone who knows anything about bitcoin knew this was coming a long time ago (assuming bitcoin gained traction).  This is not a reflection on bitcoin, because the protocol will never care, ever.  
I feel like this will mostly be for large transactions, the way cash is now.  Lunch at Taco Bell for $10?  No documentation necessary.  $20k in cash for a new car?  Be prepared to fill out a bunch of paperwork.
The real point is, the blockchain could care less.  So they can't "freeze" accounts, only "freeze them out".  And that's a lot harder to do as a government, since jurisdiction is only so large.

We're not talking about the same deflation then.  I'm referring to the built in deflation caused by limiting the supply of bitcoin.  The *current* deflation is pretty incredible, and more than likely a bubble at the moment, but on a log scale the increase is more increased adoption and awareness.  Yes, the current rate of deflation is not suitable for long term economics.  I'm in complete agreement.  


How is a small amount of deflation going to affect B2B or financial markets in ways significantly different than consumer spending?  All groups have necessities they must purchase, and controlled deflation doesn't change this; but it may alter the motivation to spend.  


I'm not sure what you mean... I never meant to imply that bitcoin would change this.  Only that people, instead of an inflationary economy where an investor has to beat -2% rate of return (which is pretty easy in most asset classes, since they tend to have a 0% rate of return, normalizing for political and natural change), in a deflationary economy they have to beat +2%, which gives business an incentive to show real value to encourage investment.  I'm just saying that small, controlled levels of deflation have positives that the textbooks generally don't proclaim.


What does bitcoin "need to be used" for?  As long as there are buyers and sellers of it (which implies merchants and customers), then it is accomplishing its goal.  Bitcoin doesn't *need* to be anything, except bitcoin.  As long as people assert that it has value, then it does.

I don't think it's a bank killer, I think its more of a power grab by individuals.  It allows money to flow freely all over the globe without any government intervention.  Bitcoin (once you own it) bypasses all regulations.  That means you can transfer money to and from countries that the US has sanctioned, or you can bring more than $10,000 worth of value out of the US without declaring it, or a host of other things.  So while it might not bring down the banks like many people claim, it does give a lot of power back to the people to decide how and when and where they use their accumulated value.

No, I'm saying that people won't "voluntarily not work" or "delay investment decisions" if the currency is deflating at a small rate.  There are deflationary markets right now that people still invest in, like technology.  Why don't people wait to buy the next iPhone instead of the current version?  Because purchasing is not solely based on what the value of your purchase will be tomorrow.

I hear a lot of different spins on the same idea "Money doesn't buy you happiness", "Money is only a thing", "Money doesn't matter".
These things only hold true once a certain minimum threshold is reached, and then they are only loosely applicable some of the time.  That threshold varies from country to country, locale to locale and more granularly, person to person.  But if you aren't at this minimum (whatever that minimum ends up being for you), you know that money in fact matters very much.  Additionally; food, clothing, and shelter make people very happy if they have previously gone without, and these things aren't free.

If you would lose btc by buying a miner, you can maximize your profit by buying btc which helps btc in general because you remove some btc from the available pool, driving prices a little higher.  In addition, if you want to help the network just run a full node.  There is no profit to be made running a full node, so it's purely altruistic and since mining has a profit motive your expenditure is unnecessary.

As another poster mentioned, buying and holding is better than mining if you are betting on btc going up.  When you consider mining equipment, ROI should be calculated only in BTC.  Look at it this way.  If an ASIC costs 75 btc, and mines 70 btc before it starts losing money, then you've lost 5 btc.  Just keeping that 75 btc would have made you MORE money on the exchange rate.

Another way to look at the inflation vs deflation argument:
If a currency is inflating, the goods it can buy are becoming worth more and more every day.  Why would anyone have any incentive to trade goods that are going UP in value for fiat which is going DOWN in value?  On the flip side, if a currency is deflating, there is strong incentive to trade goods for it in order to obtain and hold it.  So businesses would be wise to move their inventory and hold their earnings.

Bitcoin-qt downloads the blockchain in its entirety... Maybe you are thinking of lite clients like Electrum or blockchain.info.  This is not the norm by any means.


I see you have begun talking out of your ass at this point.  Most nodes have the blockchain stored in its entirety.  9gb is far from extensive.  Even lite clients rely on a server that stores the blockchain in its complete, unabridged form.  There is MUCH more discussion around how to prune the blockchain for eventual storage issues than anything to do with either block halving "doomsday" or high coin-age addresses.  


And what makes you the authority on what these bitcoins are sitting there for and why no one has touched them?


Considering this is the first I've heard of it in any kind of intelligent discussion with someone who obviously is familiar with bitcoin, I'm going to say yes, it is your hobby horse.  Point me to some serious discussion regarding it and I'll take a look, but this is far from mainstream.


Two things; One: when does bitcoin exit the "beta stage"?  People keep saying this but when does bitcoin graduate?  What are the prerequisites?  You can't forever claim bitcoin is in "beta" just so you can change things you don't like.
Two: you still have to convince people that a flaw indeed exists.  You haven't convinced me and since this idea hasn't really gained any traction in any serious bitcoin circles, I'd say that you have yet to be successful in that endeavor.

Blockchain stalls only last at most 2016 blocks.  That may be an argument for more frequent difficulty adjustments, but not a change in the mining reward.


But they COST bitcoin to purchase, and the EARN bitcoin as revenue.


Who gives a flying fuck about psychological pegs?  Mining is an individual decision, and it should be based on math, not psychological pegs.


This causes fees to increase, since slower blocks means more competition to be included in the next block.  This is a feature, not a bug.


I never implied that they promptly feed their mined coins into exchanges.  Hoarding them would increase the price of bitcoin, spending them puts them in the hands of others who may put them into exchanges.  It's supply; that's a general thing.  And the presences is not as important as perception.  People KNOW more coins are in existance, which can affect price.


But miners are watching these things, and will prepare accordingly.  This adjusts difficulty and encourages miners to come back.  It's a known event.


What?  Why 33 hours?  Where did you get that number?
I feel like you are all over the place.
Why aren't miners intelligent enough to make decisions based on known events?  If the smoothing out of rewards still goes to zero, those points where mining is at a loss will still be hit.  So the argument that at 12.5 btc miners will be operating at a loss is moot, because smoothing the curve only makes the approach a little more gradual.  The argument can't be "at 12.5 mining is done at a loss" because both the current paradigm and your proposed paradigm take us to the same place.
Smoothing the curve doesn't really do much for anyone and I for one am against changing the protocol since it reduces confidence in the network.  If things are just changed willy nilly how can we make decisions about future outcomes when the whole entire thing can be changed at will?

The housing crisis was caused by government intervention.  All the other nasty behavior and price manipulation happens in ALL commodities.  The housing crises was a particular situation where government involvement distorted markets.  This is not true for bitcoin and doesn't apply.


True.  But that's not what caused the housing crash and that's not what we're talking about here. 


How is it deception to execute trades?  I'm sorry, but that doesn't pass the sniff test.  Executing trades is what it is.  It's up to you how you interpret it.


If you are saying that something is unethical and agree that it should be illegal, you are very decidedly agreeing that regulation is needed to curtail this process because it should be curtailed.  


This whole conversation started because you claimed it was immoral for "bot attacks" where bots run by the same person buy and sell to each other to "paint the tape".  Are you lost little boy? 


I do see that.  So?  They aren't lying, slandering or libeling.  They are convincing other investors that the markets are going one way or another using tiny trades.  Simply sourcing prices from multiple exchanges and including volume in calculations very handily mitigates these attempts at deception.  If you are a day trader, it better be part of your skill set to detect these things.  Otherwise it has much less effect than you claim.


You phrase this like your opinion is "fact" and I simply don't understand.  I understand your point of view and vehemently disagree.  Why do you insist on presenting your argument as if you are trying to learn me something?

If you get involved in the legal system in the US, the only currency that can be used when a debt is forced on one side or the other is USD.  Hence the phrase "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private".  Once the court makes a ruling, they will price damages in USD, since it is the only legal tender for debts in the US.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and everything to do with pursuing legal action in the US jurisdiction.

You are pretty mixed up my friend. If bitcoin's dollar value dropped to zero, it'd be because people didn't value bitcoin anymore. So it's not the dollar value that makes bitcoin valuable, it's because bitcoin has value that there's an exchange rate at all. So the comparison is not a fallacy; in fact it's perfectly apt.  If the dollar lost its value overnight, bitcoin wouldn't lose its value.  In fact, the dollar exchange rate would skyrocket.

You HAVE to look at it in terms of bitcoin ROI.  Look:
Let's say you buy a product for 2 btc that (with difficulty increases) will mine back 1.5 btc.  That's a loss of .5 btc.
If btc goes up, you may break even or even profit from bitcoin's rise in value, but you would have been better off buying bitcoin directly.
If btc goes down, buying bitcoin and buying the miner would both cause a net loss, and you would have been better off keeping your dollars.
In neither scenario is it a good idea to buy a miner that won't generate the number of coins back that it cost to buy.

How is forcing scarcity preventing a free market?  Bitcoins are forcibly scarce, more than 21 million could be created if the protocol were tweaked.  So why is it bad for blocksize but good for total bitcoin?  It can't be good in one scenario and bad in another just because you say so; I believe scarcity encourages competition, which creates an efficient system.  You are saying this isn't true.  Well then either it isn't true ALL the time or you are wrong.

I may have mixed up EU and Euro zone (my bad), but you knew what I was referring to, and the financial sector is suffering in Europe.  Banks all over Europe are requesting bailouts, and discussions about full blown central banking are on the table.  Couple that with the recent Libor scandal and I'm sorry, but things just don't seem very favorable to opening new banks in the European *area*.

Here.  Let me try.
Godofal's point is that USD doesn't have INHERENT value in the paper itself.  It's the consensus that gives it value.  There is a common perception that because bitcoin has no physical representation, it most not have value.  Godofal is trying to point out that USD doesn't have any value ON ITS OWN.  The government has to back it in order for the value to exist.  
The argument that bitcoin doesn't have *intrinsic value* so it can't have *any value* is not valid.  The USD has no *intrinsic value* but it still has *value* for all the reasons you are have listed (namely government backing).

I think a small amount of deflation would actually force people to re-evaluate how we utilize our resources.  If you don't need it, don't buy it.
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:58:18


Yes; as a borrower it's not a great idea to borrow a deflationary currency.  But as a lender it's a great idea to loan a deflationary currency.


First, average interest is at that rate because banks don't have incentive to give a higher interest rate right now because ~~they are cash flush~~ lots of reasons.  This is a direct result of the FED's actions, and not true market fluctuation.  Second, borrowers expect the loaner to make a profit.  If the profit for loaning is less than the profit for holding, no one will do it.  Therefore, if there is a demand for borrowing, the interest offered will have to be above 0% to entice a loaner to loan.  


Less, but not none.  If you can only buy/invest in something with bitcoin, you either have to A) take a fiat loan, buy bitcoins (pay the exchange fees) and then when it comes time to pay back, you sell your bitcoins (pay the exchange fees again) and return the loan in fiat or you could B) take a bitcoin loan, pay a lower interest rate (which is a bit higher in real terms considering deflation) and not bother with exchanges.
The thing is, if all players are aware of inflation/deflation, the percentage is less relevant.

Except that as human beings we need a way to quickly, easily, universally communicate value with each other.  Bitcoin does that in a way that is secure (at the protocol level) and globally available.  This public ledger contributes something to humanity that banks have never been able to accomplish.  As long as SOMEONE attributes value to bitcoin, it will be able to serve this purpose amazingly well.

Technically, you can't destroy bitcoin's fungibility.  The blockchain is indiscriminate.  Just because someone creates an arbitrary list doesn't force everyone to use it, and bitcon's nature makes it very easy for people to create and maintain both "whitelists" and "blacklists", for both coins and addresses.  It's the same as the serial numbers on dollar bills.  The serial number themselves doesn't destroy fungibility; it's the banks checking those serials against government databases that changes the fungibility.

By sending money to the public key generated, you register it with the blockchain.  The blockchain is unaware of your freshly created address until a transaction that utilizes that address takes place.


I believe that the fundamental difference is that a "paper wallet" is really a "paper key", which is to say that it is one private/public key pair, printed on paper and then not stored on a computer.  A "regular wallet" is a software object that contains a number of private keys.  Regular wallets generate change addresses when creating a transactions.  The only way to spend a paper wallet is to import the private key to a wallet.  This wallet, once it sends money from the paper wallet, generates a change address that is not related to the paper wallet.


It's functionally no different, except the offline wallet will contain 100 public/private key pairs (bitcoin-qt, at least), while a paper wallet is simply one public/private key pair.

First off, your quote is wrong.  The exact quote was:


But in *context* of the paper, Satoshi refers to "CPU" power when he is actually talking about "Computing" power.  Since bitcoin was originally developed to mine on CPUs, it's understandable he may interchange the two.  But he meant that as long as more honest people control computing power dedicated to mining than malignant people, bitcoin would be safe.  This is just as true now as then.


Nope.  Sure doesn't.  As long as more people are playing by the rules than trying to break them, Satoshi's vision is 100% fulfilled.  The only way Satoshi's vision is not fulfilled is for the bitcoin network to be successfully, directly attacked.


Pools are dynamic.  Hashing power doesn't disappear when a pool goes down, it just routes to a different pool.

You could argue, as others have, that there is no such thing as intrinsic value, but what I'm insinuating is that there is no intrinsic value to bitcoin like there is gold or any other physical commodity that has more than trivial value.  These physical objects have properties that make them uniquely suited to a task.  Bitcoin has no attributes that uniquely suit it to any task.  This is easily demonstrated by the increasing number of alt coins.  Bitcoin is just numbers arranged in a certain order.  You can't do a single thing with bitcoin that you can't do with something else equally well.  Hence, no intrinsic value.  It does have value though, but it is solely based on community consensus.  If people didn't accept it as money, it would have zero value.  Other things, like gold, have value other than for exchange.  This is what I define as intrinsic, and what you'll find most people define as intrinsic as well; value derived from some property other than being accepted for payment.

Ok, so it seems we are in agreement.  I just feel it necessary to make the distinction since some legislative bodies may feel the need to enact legislation upon the "creator" or "issuer" of digital currency.  It helps for people to understand that miners by themselves are neither, and should not be held to the same standards as say, SecondLife for their Linden Dollars, or Amazon should they issue "Amazon Bucks".

When more people have more hashing power, the network is stronger.  Centralization is not happening the way you think it is happening.  Lots of companies are springing up just to mine.  It's an arms race and someone will always be there to compete.  Centralization is not increasing like you say it is.  It is merely specializing.  Look at it this way.  Assuming you ended up in a position that would make you a target (became President, or a drug lord, or some fancy scenario where you need protection), would you rather have a ton of people protecting you that have no idea what they are doing, or a good size team of people specialized in personal security?  CPU miners were like a bunch of autistic people protecting the president.  The sheer number make it hard to brute force the system, but coordinated, targeted attacks would be easy.  With an entire secret service, he is much more intelligently protected.

Wrong.  Bitcoin doesn't have a problem with liquidity *because of hoarding* since bitcoin is essentially infinitely divisible.  Hoarding keeps coins out of circulation, increasing each coin's value.  What's left can be divided up further and liquidity is not diminished.


Sure, some people must spend the money.  


True, but that won't happen because the market will change when people change their behavior.  Someone hoarding @ $100/btc may be convinced to spend (or sell, same thing) their hoard @ $4786/btc.

Mine!  Get an extra video card and stick it in your computer.  Mine away.  People talk about electricity costs and mining profitability, but if you use an older video card you might get 30 MH/S.  Currently, [this calculator]( says you'd lost about $.36 cents a day and would mine about .069 bitcoins in a month.  That would cost you $10.80 in electrical costs.  If bitcoins shoot to $1000 or more as some people claim, and you only mined for a month, you'd make $50 on your electrical investment.
Plus, a better video card = better mining.  Plus, the ASICS and stuff aren't really online in a massive way yet, so there's still time to do some mining and make some btc.

No, it's value lies in what the US Government is willing to TRADE for this $1.  We used to be pegged to a gold standard, where the government was willing to trade X amount of gold for this $1.  Now it's obfuscated and more difficult to determine, but the value isn't what's printed on the dollar.  That's just an aid to accounting.  The value is what you can obtain with it.


But without purchasing power what is your dollar worth?  Your point is without merit.  While factually accurate, it provides no information.  If I say "My fingernail clippings are worth my fingernail clippings", I'm technically accurate.  But I've provided no information as to their value.  Only when I tell you what I am willing to trade in return for those fingernail clippings do you have any information that is of any use to you.

That's true.  If SecureRandom returns a small set of values for "k", then an attacker can just try that small set against all of the signatures to see what shakes out.

Bitcoin isn't going to replace all banking.  Taxes will always be collected in dollars and despite the sentiment you see here, most people accept that taxes are part of the social contract and pay them willingly.  You'll never see the US Government take bitcoin as payment for taxes; it won't happen.  Therefore as long as the US government exists, USD will have a place.  That means people will need to acquire USD, if only to pay their taxes.  This gives banks continued relevance, despite what many here want to believe.
My personal opinion is that Bitcoin is situated to dominate the *remittance* market; where the underlying protocol is bitcoin, transmitting value, and it's converted into the target currency seamlessly and silently.

Agreed; I'm just saying that more and more sectors are becoming increasingly bitcoin-centric.  For instance I recently heard that a hydroponic supplies company now accepts bitcoin.  That's big news for silk road vendors, since they can use a portion of their profits to purchase grow supplies, without converting to fiat.  As bitcoin matures, we'll see more of this and bitcoin lending will become increasingly desired.


Also agreed; I was really speaking to the fact that someone claimed bitcoin lending is a bad business in a deflationary currency, and that seems backward to me.  Seems like lending is worse as a business model in inflationary currencies, because people are paying you back with dollars that are worth less than when you loaned them out.

I like the idea of a transaction bundler.  Charge a much lower fee than the network, bundle a bunch of transactions together, and submit at once in a multi transaction.  Take a small cut of the fee charged for the user.

Formatting doesn't always erase.  Many times it just "reallocates" the data as no longer in use.  I'm not sure on the specifics but there is software out there to recover data from formatted hard drives.  If it wasn't a low level format (set all the bits to zero), you may still be able to recover it.

Bitcoin has no objective.  It just "is".  It's a proof of ownership protocol in a secure ledger.  That makes it a good candidate for value transfer.  But that doesn't mean everyone will like it (especially other businesses built to facilitate value transfers, like banks or payment processors).

Because people wanted to earn 60 hours worth of wages; not 40.  They can't work over 40 now because companies don't want to pay overtime, so they have to get a second job or collect assistance from the state, which raises our taxes.  In addition, salaried jobs regularly force their employees to work 60 hour workweeks.  You think regulation will stop that?


Breathing in poisonous dust was usually a case of ignorance.  People didn't know a lot of things were poisonous back then.  I believe the government's job in this situation is to make people aware of the risks, and then LET THEM TAKE THOSE RISKS IF THEY WANT.


Ever been to a junk yard?  You think regulation eliminates risk in the workforce?  WTF?


That was a fictitious book.  I agree that the government should be policing companies to require them to provide information to their customers and their workers, but that's where the government's responsibility should end.  Ideally, private companies would spring up to handle these kinds of things.  Think Underwriter's Laboratories for Working Conditions.


I'd like to see some sources for these claims.  Pharmaceutical industry kills thousands of people each year.  Things are rushed to market before being fully tested.  A private regulatory body could do the FDA's job just as well, and if they made money there would be competition for the best regulatory body, benefiting us all.


Except that businesses used to spring up all the time before regulation.  And honestly, if your health isn't great, starting a business is a bad idea.  In addition, most of what prevents people from starting a business is the regulations you have to comply with before you can even start.


Yea, this has nothing to do with regulation preventing any honest players from getting into the market.  It has nothing to do with subsidizing banks when they go bankrupt.  No, it's because of weakened regulations.  Yea, not crony capitalism where our politicians are for sale, we just need more rules on the books.  This also has no affect on people trying to start businesses; no they can't start businesses because of health care. /s


I'm not asking for a **world** like that.  I just want one place where unfettered free markets can play out.  You already have your regulated-to-death society, can't us mincap/ancap types have ONE PLACE where your regulations can't go?
Get your head out of your ass and realize that regulations are put in place by people with agendas.

No, but some diversify banks because of possibility of bank failure, which would be the same thing.  How is that ridiculous?  It makes sense, especially in a fledgling economy like this, to hedge against vulnerabilities.

But that is not changing based on one or two difficulty changes.  That's been pretty constant for quite some time.

I think you mean that just because someone DOES have a right to something DOESN'T mean it's OK to act certain ways and say certain things.  But truthfully, the only person I answer to is myself.  I frankly don't give a fuck if someone finds my humor offensive.  has about 4 billion sites he could go to and be truly offended.  There are sites out there where they post images of children being sexually assaulted, or sites that spread REAL racism (the kind where people get killed for their race).  Yet, feels the need to take a stance on a play on words that makes fun of Asian accents.  I guess it's all about priorities, right?


Is this a shitstorm?  I thought it had devolved into a debate between me and Seems to me that it's just a long running comment section on a relatively obscure post in a relatively obscure forum.  


I found the joke to be amusing and delightful.  I didn't find it racist because it didn't specify that speaking with a thick Asian accent is *wrong*, just that it *sounds funny*.  Why are we not allowed to make light of a funny sounding phrase because it happens to be prevalent in the Asian community?  That's fucking ridiculous.  
My whole point is that I don't want this country to devolve into a bunch of pussy ass bitches who whine and complain every time someone says something they don't like.  It's a trend I feel is worth fighting, which is why I've participated in this thread as long as I have.

The network effect works just as well when bitcoin is viewed as a commodity.  More people exchange it as a commodity, more people want to exchange it as a commodity.  Remember that fiat is a good too, just like every other commodity.  It's just a specific kind of good.  So when people buy as a "commodity", they are trading goods (fiat) for bitcoin.  And when they realize their gains on the commodity, they are trading bitcoin for goods (fiat).  Is that not how a currency works?  Trading it for goods/services?

The housing crisis wasn't a consequence of painting the tape.  That's why this doesn't correlate.  


Yes.  Just... Yes.  The stated price is stated by private actors.  If you agree with the stated price (on either side), you participate.  If you don't, you don't.  And the stated price is one of many.


No, what is childish is implying that we as human beings need to be protected from ourselves.  I find it ridiculously condescending to imply that humans need policing in a voluntary market.  You have heavily implied that we need some kind of "bot regulation".  You are trying to fix something that I don't agree is even a problem.

There's the issue of holding vs mining though that many of us miners have come to refer to as the "mining fallacy".  If you buy a miner for 1 btc that cost at the time $100, and then mine back .5 btc, but btc gains in value so that 1 btc is worth $200, then you've broken even right?  Except if you had just held that btc, you'd now be up $100.
The point is, if a miner doesn't make back, in bitcoin, the amount of bitcoin that it costs at the moment (do the conversion if it's only available in fiat), then it was a bad investment compared to just buying and holding.

Hell yea.  I stopped spending too.  If bitcoins stabilize, even if it's just a relative stabilization, I'll resume using them.  But when the value is skyrocketing, you'd be crazy not to use USD or your local currency to buy online and hold your bitcoins for a later date.
The missing piece of a lot of the soap box rants is that bitcoin has advantages over USD **when it's value is relatively stable**.  I used a ton of bitcoins back when they were chilling at $5 a piece for months.  But when one currency's value is careening all over the track, the stable currency is better for transacting.

Which the business voluntarily charged you and voluntarily documented that you voluntarily paid.  They could easily have said "$3 only" and then pocketed the entire thing without recording the transaction.  That's called "voluntary".   You could also find someone willing to sell you something for cash, without charging tax.  But you didn't; you voluntarily complied.  
Obviously a lack of compliance that is discovered is punished, but with an electronic transaction, there's visibility, so they have little choice.  But with cash, there's no visibility, especially for small transactions.  So every transaction recorded in cash and reported to the government is a voluntary compliance, because the government wouldn't have known about it otherwise.

Understood that this advice won't help you for the current situation, but my general rule of thumb is to keep a couple of bitcoins on hand for spending, and then immediately replace them as I use them.

But this doesn't make sense.  The price of bitcoin has nothing to do with the cost of a soda.  It's the other way around; price of soda is based on price of bitcoin.  This analogy doesn't make sense.


At the moment, and that makes sense.  As more people enter the market, this will change.  As more exchanges open, this will change.  As more companies can buy their supplies in bitcoin, this will change.  Still doesn't talk to hoarding vs spending.


I disagree, and there is an entire school of thought that agrees with me.  This is far from an open/shut fact.


No, they assume that what is available for trade is what is available for trade.


No, you can perform as many transactions as you want, because bitcoin is divisible.  


Not true; hoarding increases the value because it decreases the bitcoin *on the market*.  Convincing someone who was *previously a hoarder* to spend will make the value go down, as a whale dumping can flood the markets, or at least spook them.  But someone being convinced to hoard long term actually increases the value.  
You have it twisted.  Traditional economic theory surmises that hoarding causes a commodity to raise in value, causing people to not spend and hoard more, since the value is rising.  This creates a self fulfilling spiral and causes the value to go through the roof.  There are valid arguments for and against this, but you seem to think that hoarding will cause the value to plummet, which is silly.

*  Don't have a nice phone.  Someone may target and follow you home, make friends with your friends and then trick them into stealing from you.
*  Don't wear nice clothes.  Someone may follow you home, case your house and break in while you aren't home.
*  Don't EVER wear a wedding ring or nice watch; it's just ASKING for trouble.

Most of this has already happened.  Just about every GPU on earth was made unprofitable by the last two increases.  The only reason these would still be running now was because the owner doesn't pay their electric bill.

Yea, that was my point exactly.


Which is actually not as "common knowledge" as people would have you believe.  If deflation was such a discouragement to purchasing, people wouldn't buy technology "since it'll be worth less next year".  This is a fallacy perpetuated by modern Keynesian textbooks that provides no counter-argument.  Which is "If people have a small incentive to save, instead of a small incentive to spend, they're more likely to allocate resources efficiently, since it must be worth more than the small amount of depreciation".  Most evidence of destructive deflation is hyper-deflation, which is just as bad as hyperinflation.  There is no use-case for a tiny amount of controlled, expected deflation.  There's no historical precedent, so how can anyone say with any certainty that it will be horrible for the economy?

This is the key here.  Yes, if EVERYONE hoarded FOREVER, it would basically grind the bitcoin economy to a halt.  But that is such an extreme case that I find no reason to believe that anyone hoarding now would have any appreciable affect on the market.


Why not?  Bitcoin is very much like a twinkie in that there is demand for it and therefore someone willing to supply it.  As long as there is demand for bitcoin, hoarding won't affect it.  By that token, hoarders actually create demand by desiring to hold it.


How oversimplified.  The super-rich in America are sitting on their cash reserves because they are worried about economic stability.  The FED has a lot to do with this, and cannot be used as an example of free markets because it is not one.


This isn't even a coherent argument.  The price of your good dictates how many you can sell in a day, not the other way around.  Liquidity is how much of a commodity or good is available for sale.  Since bitcoin is infinitely divisible, liquidity is not an issue.  There is no singular "item".


I'm not even sure where to begin here.  Me hoarding has no affect on your desire to purchase products.  Me hoarding has no affect on a seller's desire to make money.  Sellers find a price point the market can bear, and if they profit at that price point, they stay in business.

@_date: 2013-11-20 18:33:07


That's true; usually investing in a commodity.  The problem happens when that commodity is overhyped, like real estate.  Or if that commodity is subject to supply forces, like gold or oil.  But you also have to take into account that most people are not investors by trade, and many people are not even good with money.  This gives investment advisors a massive amount of control and can lead to things like selling people mortgages they can't afford because of bonuses.


The difference is those other things are difficult to trade directly for goods or services.  Those other commodities are not as liquid as bitcoin.  Gold and silver's value is different based on shape (some coins are worth more than their metal) so you usually consult an appraiser for this.  You could use ETFs instead, but that requires a broker and all of that nonsense.  Bitcoins can be saved as if they were gold, but then spent as if they were cash.  This makes bitcoin unique among the different commodities that usually serve as investment vehicles.

Your logic is flawed.  I pointed out that your statement was incorrect, and that homonyms exist, but did not state that distinct and distinct were homonyms.

is incorrect.  Thank you for proving my point.


You fail to understand, *again*.  Distinct can mean multiple things.  For instance:


...doesn't mean that they are the only people on earth who are currently at a disadvantage, but rather that the disadvantage is stark and readily apparent.  That was the way I used *distinct* in my original statement and it was proper usage.

You misinterpret many people's ideology.  It's not "no taxes", it's "voluntary taxes".  There is a giant chasm between the two.  I'm forced to pay for things I never use.  If the government switched to a more consumption based taxation system (where the things the government pays for are taxed for their usage), and revenue streams were separated, you'd see a lot less "nutjobs" arguing against you.  
Additionally, if I could "appropriate" my fair share of taxes to the causes I deem relevant to me, I'd have a lot less to say about the taxes in this country.  I dream of a 1040 that has an entire section devoted to appropriating my taxes, where I can check "Allow the government to appropriate all my taxes" or I can check "I'd like to appropriate a portion of my taxes", and then have a numerically coded list of things my tax dollars can go to.  It'd be a very interesting set of data to see what the people in this country REALLY want their money to pay for.

But if bitcoin is *truly* worth $10k a coin (which I don't think it is, but for the sake of argument, let's pretend), how can it get there without rising in value? 


Correct, "IF".  I'll give you that.  But I see no hurdles to adoption in the near future; the US government, German government, Canadian government, Chinese government and many others have given the green light and VCs are jumping in with both feet.  That's why I'm still bullish.

I particularly like how worried people get about pools controlling a portion of the network.  If pools start stepping out of bounds, they lose a good portion of their base.

And if you had purchased bitcoin directly you would have made a loss too.  Of course that's only if you sell and lock in your losses.  If you had mined less than 2btc you'd be even worse off.  But that's beside the point.  You have to look at it in terms of bitcoin only.  If you take that two btc and turn it into five that's better than holding that two btc.  If you take that two btc and turn it into 1.5 btc, that's bad no matter the exchange rate.

Because wire transfers are insanely expensive for small amounts of BTC, and other more reasonable options exist.  Look at trade volume on MtGox after the Dwolla shutdown.  Not even close to what it was before.
And now because wire transfers were inundating their bank, they can't even process those.  ALL incoming fiat transfers to MtGox from the US have been shutdown, and I'm not sure, but I believe outgoing fiat transfers as well.
So the Dwolla shutdown facilitated massive wires, which overloaded the bank and caused MtGox to shutdown all operations for US Dollar -&gt; MtGox transactions.

Having a funny accent does not imply inferiority.  You choose to interpret it that way.  If I am drunk and I slur my words, it may come out in a comical way.

Your interpretation is what makes it racist, and I'm saying your interpretation jumps the gun and is hypersensitive.

Fiat currency at the base level provides the same "extinguishability".  When I trade dollar bills for something, there is no way to reverse that transaction forcibly, except by extortion (legal or otherwise).  It's the escrow services that make it difficult.
Bitcoin gives us choice.  Prior to bitcoin online merchants had *no choice* but to accept reversible transactions mediated by third parties.  Bitcoin offers them a *choice*.

I think people who expect full information from a reddit post may be a group of people who need to be burned a time or two by their own inadequate research, but otherwise I agree.  I just think there's a difference between someone getting sound advice like "Don't invest your retirement money in bitcoin" when they ask, and getting a bunch of ALL CAPS POSTS about how to invest when someone says "Ooh, I hope I don't lose all my play money".


Agreed, although I still believe in the point above; if people got burned once or twice by their own inadequate vetting of an investment, maybe they'd be more careful with their money.  I think too many people have grown complacent because of the big daddy gov.t protecting us from ourselves.  But either way, the point I was really making was that as long as someone states they won't go broke if they lost it all, then they are A) acknowledging that losing it all is a possibility and B) are acknowledging that they aren't risking their entire life for it.  I just want to differentiate between "Not wanting to lose value" and "Not wanting to lose value because you need it for next month's rent".

Here's why I'm belaboring this point.  
A) If Bitcoin-Qt is the protocol, then Gavin Andreson is the mastermind.  This leads people to think that Gavin is in control of the bitcoin money supply.  It also paints a target on his forehead much like the one that recently shut down Liberty Reserve.  Additionally, it gives the recent California cease and desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation some merit.
B) If bitcoin-qt is the protocol, then changes like the recent change in fee structure and the limitation on transactions at 5430 Satoshis would be much more catastrophic.  Bitcoin is popular in part because of it's lack of central control.  This limit made a lot of people angry, but they were comforted by the fact that this is only a limit in the client implementation, and that they are free to create an implementation without this limit, while still participating in the same blockchain.
C) Bitcoin-QT is not the only implementation.  Multibit, Electrum and Armory ~~sprint~~ spring to mind as alternative wallets.  Changes to Bitcoin-QT don't affect these implementations.
You can't just assert that Bitcoin-QT *is* the protocol.  It's factually incorrect and leads to misunderstandings.

What?  What business are you referring to?  Most small businesses have one cash register.  Therefore one tablet.


$10 a sign for 'bitcoin accepted here'?  And you need 20 of them?


It's a QR code and a confirmation that it went through.  That's a wallet program and takes literally 10 minutes to show someone how to use it. 


What kind of business uses 20 cash registers, requires 20 signs and has an average sale of $7?
Your assumptions are ridiculous.  Here's a rundown of the Subway that takes bitcoin:
1 $100 Android tablet = $100
1 hour of training per employee x (assumption) 10 employees = 10 hours = $500 ($50/hr)
1 "Bitcoin accepted here" sign = $1.50
1 reddit post proclaiming he accepts bitcoin = free advertisement
That's a startup cost of $651.50
Additionally, Coinbase has no charges for the first $1m in transactions.


The main problems I see with bitcoin are as follows
* Not many people accept it so it's hard to use it for business expenses (as you mentioned).  This problem will be mitigates as more people accept bitcoin
* It can handle 7 transactions per second (as you mentioned).  This is a topic of much discussion in the developer circles.  It's being handled.
* It is volatile.  This can be dealt with using a bitcoin payment processor, whose fees are 1/3 to 1/5 that of a traditional credit card processor, with no chance of a chargeback.
It looks like the three main problems in my book are in the process of being dealt with now.  So while yes, bitcoin has some issues, they aren't insurmountable, and solutions are coming.


There is a group of fervent fanatics who only want to see their holdings increase in value.  They don't represent the entire bitcoin community, and a couple of downvotes on the comment section of a reddit post don't either.

The only definitive thing we can say about it is that it doesn't quite fit standard rules.  The standard rules require that someone who "mints their own currency" register as a money transmitter.  My interpretation of this rule is that people who create an in-game or vendor-specific currency (Facebook dollars, Linden dollars, WOW gold, etc), and offer to exchange that currency for USD or other recognized currency must register as a money transmitter.  This is because those central issuers of the currency facilitate money laundering activities, in addition to being able to inflate/deflate their currency at will.  In addition to trying to stop money laundering, the US Government is trying to protect us lowly peons from putting real money into a company and then having that company disappear.  Think if Facebook just declared that your Facebook dollars no longer work.  I believe **these** are the scenarios for which the rules are meant to apply.
Since you can't, as a miner, control how many bitcoins will be mined and when, then you aren't the central issuer.  The central issuer is a distributed algorithm.  The best way to *actually* represent this in a way that best fits a round peg in a square hole is to assert that those coins are already "minted" (minted here meaning that the quantity is known and no one can create additional coins, as opposed to Amazon bucks, of which more can be created at Amazon's whim), as opposed to saying any miner who participates is "minting" those coins, which implies that the miner has some control or say in how many coins are minted and when.
Is that a sufficient response to convince you that I disagree?
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:32:33


Still true?  Of course not!  IPOs create value by being valuable companies.  That attracts investment.  Bitcoin is similar.  If it has value, the investors will come.  Pyramid/ponzi schemes generally have no value beyond potential investors.  Bitcoin has value at any price because it can be used to conduct online transactions with almost no friction.  Also you don't make money off of referrals.

I'm not sure that its realistic to think bitcoin will *replace* all currency.  I honestly think bitcoin's biggest play is to replace USD as the reserve currency, since it isn't politically motivated or controlled, can be transferred instantly, and requires no physical storage space to use.
I'm just saying that bitcoin and USD derive their value from the same source; people.  Gold has value in its metal's properties, which is why it has been used for so long.  USD is in use now simply because there is no efficient and convenient way to do business over multiple currencies.  Bitcoin fills that niche quite nicely.  Once we see governments using it to bypass sanctions, bitcoin will gain adoption very quickly.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:15:36
Ok.  Since this is getting repetitive, this will be my last response to your posts.  Feel free to have the last word.


Meh.  I believe in the currency, but it's far from "religious".  


I think there was one other instance where I used a word wrong, and admitted it and then changed it.  It was a word that was commonly used as I did, but technically was incorrect.  I did admit that I was wrong in that situation.


I was trying to stay on topic, but you pulled me off.  I'm not wandering.  WTF are you even talking about?


I gave you multiple links where the word "distinct" can be used to imply that something is obvious, or plain to see, or explicit, or easily identifiable.  I'm not sure how else to show you that while your definition is correct, mine works as well.  Are all the dictionaries I pointed you to incorrect as well?  Come on man.


Except that you are wrong.  It does not imply that others don't have those ideals.  It is not the end of story, because I showed you that it can be interpreted another way.  It's like you are stuck in a loop.


I answered your question.  It's true.  But those same principles are *also* "distinctly" anarcho-capitalist.  Turns out anarcho-capitalism and libertarianism are similar, and yet both are "distinctly" (or apparantly, or obviously, or notably) anti-government.


I wasn't speaking to you originally.  This topic devolved from another topic where I was speaking about bitcoin.  I missed it the first time you posted it, tis true.  Once I realized, I admitted that I was wrong (see, I'm not afraid to do so when it's warranted, despite your mockery to the contrary) and attempted to move past it.  Yet you continue to bring it up.  You are right, I misread your intent.


One other person said that it wasn't Libertarian.  Didn't even comment on the wording, but (unlike you), actually rebutted my original point.


Do you often continue to play along so long just to prevent admitting that you improperly called me out?


But I don't believe it was a poor choice.  I defended my actions against someone accusing me of making a mistake.  My *original* goal was to discuss the relation between Libertarianism and Bitcoin's founding principles, but you de-railed that, and then I began having a "separate" discussion with you (which I admit, I mistakenly thought was a subset of my original goal, which is why I participated to the length that I did).  


Not even remotely close.  I just get rubbed the wrong way by smug assholes like yourself and refuse to concede a point I don't agree with.


So then this is a troll at my expense.  Congratulations, your troll was successful.  Now kindly fuck off.

I was being a bit condescending, I know.  It's just that so many people come in and post things that make no sense.  Your first two points may have merit, but your first post was that mining difficulty will put downward pressure on price.  I think that's completely untrue.  Your third point is in relation to difficulty, but I'm pretty sure the opposite is true.  Mining tends to lag significantly behind interest.  People find out about bitcoin, get interested, do research, start mining.  
As for the other things; SR is a small portion of the market now.  Also, regulation may be seen by some as "impending doom", but many businesses are not being started because of the regulator gray area we exist in.  While I'm worried about what regulation will do long term, short term any guidance from the powers that be will allow companies to start up or expand without fear of being shut down.  I'm bullish as hell right now.

I just gave you two good arguments; if you increase the size of the block, then transactions don't have to increase fees to compete for a slot in the block.  In addition, there is little financial incentive to move transactions offchain without a cap on block size.  


Agreed.  But this will be done by miners not adopting the new protocol with increased block size.


What makes it a good idea to increase the hard cap?  Why would you want to expand the block size?  The limit now can be subverted by bundling transactions and doing many things offchain.  Why do we need to alter the protocol when the market/miners can make the protocol work as it is, with the added benefit of increasing over time the incentive to mine as the reward halves?

And I was playing devil's advocate to begin this conversation.  The idea of a virtual commodity has to overcome the concept of replication.  If it doesn't, then most people will not understand and will refrain from "investing" (using) the currency.  The only reason people tolerate the replication of US money is that the government throws its weight behind it.  Bitcoin doesn't have that.


I'm not arguing your definition, I'm arguing your deduction.  Just because people earn value in dollars doesn't mean they are researching the fundamentals behind the dollar.  That's a fallacy.  Your quote here:


assumes that people who are invested in bitcoin are researching the fundamentals of bitcoin.  If we replace "bitcoin" with "dollar", no one in their right mind would agree with you that anyone who uses dollars is also a decent investor.  My whole point is that one of the big barriers to widespread adoption is that bitcoin *appears* easily reproducible, and therefore not trustworthy.

Well, when you said "let's dance", I figured you'd be someone who'd take it too far like me.  I just have a tendency to not back down on principle.  I actually appreciate how far you've taken it.  


Correlation doesn't imply causation; they found a statistic and argued the reason, but have no evidence that their reason is the only one or even the right one.  




Again, evidence + speculation &lt;&gt; proof.  


I actually like this article.  I think the conclusion that was drawn is the opposite of what it intends though.  Walking through the 3 different aspects of the article:
* Fear: She's afraid of being labeled a racist because she doesn't consider herself one.  It's very difficult to note racial differences in this day and age without being labeled a racist.  Noting differences brings out the hoards.  She was saying there is a difference between black people and "niggers".  Obviously, using that word is wrong; but it's interesting to see how often it's dropped in pop culture.  Black rappers use it on the regular.  How can anyone claim that they don't want the word used if it gets dropped regularly?  So if you are one color, you can use this word, but if you are another color, it's off limits.  How does that not enforce racial divide?  In addition, Jen was "fearful".  Because being perceived to be a racist, when you don't actively believe someone is inferior because of their color, brings stigma and consequences that far outweigh the belief.  It's polarizing and it occurs on both sides of the aisle.
* Unaware-ness: I agree that this is an issue
* Dis-ownership: Saying "they" and "we" is polarizing.  But the truth is there is some level of polarization.  As I said before, making business decisions (hiring/firing, allowing patronization, etc) based on race is not prudent in today's world.  But humans have a natural tendency to gravitate towards those that are like them, and away from those that are different.  Races have far more differences in general than just color, so it makes sense.  This isn't racism in my opinion, it's human nature.  I own that I am more comfortable in groups of people who think as I do.  I'd suspect that you feel the same way.  It would stand to reason that congregating in groups of like-minded people is natural, not *necessarily* racist.


This was basically the same as the second link; it talked about the same study.




Or there's a third option.  There are a lot of communities that are poor and exclusively black.  Maybe that has something to do with a notion of "poor" and "black" going together?  Maybe it's that reality shapes our perceptions.  Why there are exclusively poor black communities is a different question.


This is where I begin to get angry.  Is it racist to be aware that there are an inordinate number of poor black people in this country?  Is it sexist to realize that men tend to be physically stronger than women and make decisions based less on emotion than women?  Is it ageist to think that an elderly person is more likely to be fragile or have a hard time remembering things?  At what point in this country's history did it stop being ok to understand that there are traits that certain demographics share?  Why is it somehow harmful to acknowledge that there are more black people in prison than whites, despite the fact that white people are the dominant race?  There are lots of reasons for this (justice system is racist, which I believe makes up a smaller portion of this reason than the fact that blacks tend to miss out on the nuclear family structure because black fathers are less likely to raise their children, which may be due to slavery splitting up families 5 generations ago), but the reasons don't change that it's true.  I'm personally frustrated that it's been labeled immoral to be aware of these socio-economic, physical and mental characteristics that are shared by people based on their physical traits.  It's OK that black people are better at football.  It's OK that Asians are more likely to be pushed as children into math and science.  It's OK that people speak differently.  It's also OK to recognize it and it's OK to see humor in it.
Yes, progress needs to be made.  But one thing that I think would assist is if we stop being so vigilant about every turn of phrase.  Jewish people have been stigmatized throughout history.  Hell, there was a genocide of Jews just two generations ago, but you don't see Jews with picket signs screaming for equality because by and large equality exists now.  
I'm not saying racism isn't a problem.  I'm saying this specific instance isn't really racism.


I should have no fear, but the truth is that I do.  I'm afraid that defending myself against a black man would result in a slew of hatred and the potential for being charged with a hate crime.  It's a real possibility.


Exactly.  The media portrayed it as this huge racial issue.  People were up in arms because they saw a racial issue where there was none.  That's a major problem in this country.


There was a case right after the Treyvon Martin case where a Washington man was beaten to death by 3 young black men.  There was no racial outcry except from a few facebookers who thought they were clever.


Let me clarify.  I'd say we are more polarized in terms of racial mentality.  As far as racial equality in the workplace we are much further along.  As far as racial movement in socioeconomic status we are much further along.  But as far as personal race relations, we're at an impasse and have been for some time.

I do believe much of our government has grossly overstepped their bounds.

They are saying it's ok to use as a commodity (i.e. you can buy it, sell it, or barter for it), but not as a currency, which they define here:


Therefore it cannot be used as a currency, with all the protections and legal ramifications that come with being labeled a currency.  They specifically labeled it a commodity, and allowed its use as such.

If you buy a miner for 1 btc, and then mine .9 btc before it finally starts costing you money, you've lost .1 btc (1 - .9 = .1).  If you had purchased 1 btc and then just sat on it, you would have 1 btc.  .9 btc &lt; 1 btc so in the end, if a miner can't mine back the bitcoin, a better investment would be just to buy btc.  
Look at it this way;
If the exchange rate goes up to $200/btc, which is better?  1 btc ($200) or .9 btc ($180)?  If the exchange rate drops to $12/btc, which is better?  1 btc ($12) or .9 btc (10.80)?  Notice in both situations having 1 btc is better than having .9 btc.  Does that make sense?

Excuse me for not reading your entire post history; I'm not going to go back through every thread you've posted to see what your complete views are.
The truth is you have brought nothing new to the table except reiteration of what you've already commented on.  We aren't succeeding in producing new content here.  You feel the block size should force *no* competition.  If we do, you believe that we'll see stagnation of transaction volume and centralized control over transactions.  I countered this with evidence that scarcity of blocks (using difficulty) is causing mining to explode in efficiency, and believe the same phenomenon will occur when transaction volume exceeds the block capacity.  I agreed that some scaling problems may occur with the *current* limit, and as such may need to be adjusted, but must be done in such a way to encourage competition and provide *some* scarcity.
Neither of us have any empirical evidence to prove our point, although I think I end up ahead with mining as evidence of my hypothesis that competition encourages increased efficiency.  Unless you have something NEW to add to this argument, instead of 45 different ways to say the same thing, I'd prefer to just part amicably and say "Let's agree to disagree".

Which is potentially different for each miner


For a given miner.  If one miner's threshold is lower, you will get included in that miner's block.  If you have two miners whose threshold you meet, you'll get included in both miner's blocks.  You've now doubled your chances (assuming both miners have the same hashing power) of getting included in the next block.  
There is a spot where your fee meets ALL miner's thresholds, after which time an increased fee won't help you.  But until you hit that, more fees gives you a higher likelihood of being included in the next block.
Theoretically, lots of miners would have lots of different thresholds.  You want a higher likelihood of being next?  Up your fee.

I think people over-estimate the damage of a little centralization.  The only thing that I worry about is *forced* centralization.  As soon as they can make laws preventing people from mining, then there's an issue.  Right now anyone can compete.  Just because someone is better doesn't make it a bad thing.  There always has to be a winner in a race, and mining was always intended to be an arms race.  As long as I can still get my foot in the door for a relatively low price without paying exorbitant regulatory fees, I see this is free market functioning properly.  Friedcat won't affect the blockchain negatively by 51% because it's not in his best interest to do so.  He's trying to make money.  Best course of action is to keep bitcoin value high.  And he'll always have competition until he can figure out a way to get governments to shut down other mining operations, either by banning them outright or requiring expensive compliance to faulty regulation.

It's a lot harder to steal gold than it is bitcoin.  Stealing gold requires physical access.  Stealing bitcoin only requires digital access, which can be accomplished through any number of vulnerabilities or slipups in computer security.  Once hardware wallets become more prevalent, this is less true.  And while paper wallets give you this advantage that gold enjoys, print outs burn easily and fade over time.  One thing I've been considering is getting a paper wallet and having the private key engraved on an otherwise inconspicuous item like a zippo or something.  
Don't take this to mean that it's impossible to steal gold,  but gold *can be* easier to secure since it's purely physical.  Bitcoin is more difficult to do so because it is purely digital.

This premise of yours assumes that bitcoin will be a currency used for paying incomes.  Unless you are transacting business internationally, it makes little sense for a business to pay its employees in bitcoins.
I for one don't assume that bitcoin will replace fiat.  The government's main tool in creating demand for their currency is taxes.  If they won't accept anything but their own currency for tax purposes, you need to obtain it to use it.




Agreed.  But "slapping him with tax evasion" is not the same as reaching into his account and pulling out money.  They can't actually TAKE bitcoin.  All they can do is prosecute.  That's different than fiat, where they can freeze your assets via the clearing houses if you don't pay.


How do you force them to use registered addresses?  Any address they use that's not registered looks the same as an address used by someone in Siberia; there is literally NO way to tell if an address belongs to someone unless they attach personally identifiable information to it somewhere.


You miss the point.  The point isn't that everyone is all of a sudden free from all taxes; I personally would rather just hand over 23% of my earnings so that teams of men with masks and guns don't break into my house and take me hostage.  The point is it's POSSIBLE.

I never said that wide acceptance was a prerequisite for being considered a currency, only that a group of people use them as a medium of exchange.  It has to be accepted SOMEWHERE, but not EVERYWHERE.


I shall try one more time.  
A) We both recognize the USD as a currency, yet it represents nothing tangible; so a currency need not represent some other commodity.  
B) In Brazil, there is a tiny city currency that circulates only in a 60 mile radius called the capivari. In fact, Brazil has over 63 local currencies ([source](  These currencies are most definitively NOT accepted across the globe, and yet they are recognized as a currency because a specific community deems them so.  Therefore, a currency does not have to be **widely** accepted in any global sense, but rather has to be generally accepted in a given community.
So a currency need not represent any other commodity, but rather can represent value directly, and it need not be **widely** accepted, as long as a group of people will accept it in exchange for other goods.  For bitcoin, there is a very large community willing to accept bitcoin for goods and services.
So your definition, "represent something tangible" and be "widely accepted" is in fact the wrong definition.
Please do some reading on the topic of currencies; it's fascinating stuff, and if you are going to advocate for bitcoin you need to be well versed in what makes a currency, and why bitcoin is INDEED a currency, and deserves to be recognized as such.

I'm not playing word games.  I'm trying to avoid labels altogether.


No, it's not a moral judgment.  Yes, anyone should be allowed to send small transactions.  But they should have to pay for it.  This discourages *frivolous* transactions, which is for the good of the network.  The blockchain takes resources to maintain and secure.  If you want to use it, you have to pay an entry fee.  If the fee is too small, *frivolous* transactions will make it more costly to maintain and secure than it needs to be.  If the fee is too large, it will indeed keep small players out.  It needs to be "just right".  I think right now, the fee is too low.  But that's ok, because we haven't reached a point yet where frivolous transactions make a difference in the size and cost of maintaining the block chain.  Once we reach that point, the equation will change.  Having scarcity in the block size helps find that equilibrium.  The block size will eventually have to change.  But it needs to be kept in mind that if the block size is too big, the cost of maintaining and securing the block chain becomes too high for the benefit that it provides.  If the block size is too small, it becomes a chokepoint that big off-chain companies will capitalize on.  There needs to be a happy medium, but it needs to be addressed when the time comes; that time is not now.

It's funny how the entire [article]( talks about how this is usually limited to government, whether it be corruption, bribes or purchasing regulatory environments over improving business practices.
It's also funny how hard people try to demonize true capitalism.  Rent-seeking is much more difficult in free markets, where the regulation is sparse and therefore regulatory involvement is less, meaning there are less points of bureaucracy for rent-seekers to exploit.

If the block subsidy is required, the whole concept is doomed.  I'm under the impression that it's very decidedly NOT required, and that this free market experiment can be left as is (I'm on the fence about block size atm however).  If you have to subsidize miners, then miners will drop off, difficulty will drop, which will incentivize miners.  The block subsidy IS smooth now.  We went through one halving with no issue; in fact I think the halving actually drove prices higher, because less are entering circulation every ten minutes.  If we can go through one halving with no issues, what makes you think we need to do something for the next halvings?  What evidence do you have that this is ever even going to be necessary?

Why is this so important?  The block halving is an event known well ahead of time.  I see no reason why it needs to be modified, and I still haven't seen where you have justified the need.


But ROI on hardware should be calculated in bitcoins.  It's "half as bad" in terms of bitcoin.  Hardware is increasingly sold only in bitcoin.  So the exchange price is of less consequence than the actual bitcoin generation.  Bitcoin is not a stand-in for fiat.  It's a currency on its own.  When you look at ROI in dollars, you don't say "But the Argentinian Peso was worth so many more dollars then, so I'll never see ROI".  That's a fallacy.


I fail to see why this is a bad thing.  Please explain it like I'm five.


I agree.  And the system has a built in regulation for this exact concern; difficulty.  Difficulty changes in response to profitability (indirectly).  If profitability is high enough, miners will continue to come onboard.  If profitability approaches zero, many miners will disconnect.  This is already built into the system so there's no need to make additional adjustments.


There's no immediate supply shock; the supply didn't change.  It simply wasn't increasing quite as fast as before.  It takes time for this to have an effect on price.

Honestly, for any large sum of money, cash is not as anonymous as you think.  For underground transactions, it's the case (if you are buying drugs or stolen merchandise, etc), but trying to conduct any form of legitimate business for amounts over $10k, the govt requires the seller to do due diligence and collect your personally identifiable information.  Plus cash has serial numbers, and can be used to track cash once they decide to do so.

I think the cool thing about bitcoin is that legislation is not *prohibited*.  MtGox can basically make any "legislation" (read rules) they want right now, since they own such a large share of the bitcoin exchange market.  However, if the legislation isn't acceptable to some, they can trade on an unregulated market.  Eventually most will gravitate towards the legislated market IMO, since it will prevent the things like churning and other old school tricks.

That's not what [currency]( means.  Currency is a medium of exchange.  A government controlled currency means you can pay tax in it or you can't, but that's just the government's way of creating demand for their currency, giving them control.  Look up local currencies.  There are a shit ton.

This rise in value is not "depreciation", it's price discovery.  Once the world knows about bitcoin and it's value, and it's repeatedly found to be sound, the price will begin to behave more rationally.  Right now the markets are too thin on exchanges and the speed in getting money into and out of exchanges is slow.  This makes the market susceptible to large crashes when lots of bitcoin are sold at once.  Normally this would correct itself as people saw an opportunity to buy, but because many exchanges are sketchy and some can't handle volume, many hands are skittish right now.  Couple that with stories of exchanges stealing customers' money and you get an environment where volatility should be expected.

Potatoes very well COULD be a currency if we as a society decided it to be so.  They wouldn't be a GOOD currency.  Good currencies are fungible (meaning one unit of currency is the same as another unit of currency), divisible, durable, portable, scarce (sand would make a bad currency, for instance) and uniform.  Potatoes rot, so they aren't durable.  They aren't very uniform; some are large, some are small.  They divide easily, but then rot quicker.  They are portable, and scarce.  They'd make a better currency than seashells, because you can eat them, but in the end they aren't very good.
Just because an individual barters with another doesn't make a commodity a currency.  The "currency" status comes from being a *medium of exchange* as I stated before.  This means that community consensus deems something is acceptable to take in exchange for goods and services.


Yes, precisely.  But Apple stock doesn't appeal to as many people.  There are times when stock is traded for other goods and services.  It's common for people to settle debts in stock, or even pay people in stock.  But they aren't a currency because they aren't fungible.  One stock is not the same as the other.  One stock in a given company may be, but no company has enough shares to fulfill the needs of all 300 million people.  Arguably, a company could create that many shares if they so desired, but it still wouldn't appeal to the masses the same way the dollar does, because the dollar is more vague.  It can represent different things to different people.  Stock is more specific, and therefore doesn't fulfill as many people's definition of value.


Today, maybe not.  But that doesn't actually prove anything.  What's the likelihood that they'll take Icelandic króna in the same situation?  Probably low.  But Iceland most definitely considers their króna a currency.  Similarly, bitcoin is most definitely an internet currency, because there are a plethora of places that DO take bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.

Until recently that's how credit cards worked based on their TOS. Recently a class action lawsuit was won that allows companies to charge differently for different payment methods, and you'll be seeing more and more companies passing on the cost to their customers, since companies don't really have a big benefit to credit cards, and fraudulent chargebacks can increase the cost to accept them significantly. Visa only takes on the risk of the customer. The merchant is the one who loses out in the case of a chargeback.
Here's a link to the case:

That's never gonna happen.  Borrowers are not stupid.  They understand they have to bring something to the table to get a loan.  My point is that if you have an opportunity for an investment *in bitcoin*, you may actually prefer to just take a lower (non-negative) interest rate *in bitcoin* than deal with exchanging in and out of fiat.  
You are the one who posited that it MUST be negative for ANYONE to want to borrow, but I already know of loans that have a POSITIVE return.  So your premise that you must offer a negative return to entice borrowers is false.

There's some contention here; creating implies some form of control.  Since you have to conform to specific rules and everyone has to agree on the reward it's a more apt analogy to say that mining "discovers" bitcoin that is already created.  Saying miners "create" bitcoin implies that they control the speed at which bitcoins are created or under what circumstances, which is untrue.  Saying they "discover" bitcoin fits more with the mining analogy (gold miners don't *create* gold), and it implies that miners are just participants in the network, not controllers of it, which is more accurate.

Illegal and a scam are two very different things.  The premium comes from scarcity of supply.  That's not a scam.  It may be illegal because government tries to wrap us all in bubble wrap, but that doesn't make it a scam.  Is weed a scam?  It's illegal, but it still gets you high.  I think of a scam as a misrepresented transaction.  Selling a sold out ticket (scalping) may be illegal, but if the ticket is legitimate then it's not a scam.
Similarly, selling a miner is not a scam, even if it is overpriced.  That's the free market at work.

My point is that, having currency backed by debt doesn't make it valuable.  Everyone could just stop borrowing and any currency held up solely by debt would fail.
In fact, I'd argue that a lot of the economical woes we are experiencing right now are CAUSED by the fractional reserve creation of debt.  Once people get stretched beyond a certain point, they stop taking debt, even when its free.  Also, I could tomorrow create a currency that is backed only by debt, and it would never gain traction.  The USD's initial claim to value is that it is accepted for taxes.  Without that, it has no value.
But either way, this is beside the point.  The point is that USD's VALUE is derived by community consensus.  We give the government its power, and it uses a portion of that power to collect taxes.  It only accepts USD for the payment of taxes, creating demand for the commodity USD.  It then supplies us with USD to circulate, creating supply.  Demand is increased as people attempt to earn USD from others, but in the end, we all just agree that dollars have value.  
This argument is used to disprove the idea that bitcoin has no value.  It does because we say it does, just like the USD.  The government can create demand with guns.  We as a bitcoin-supporting community can only create demand by espousing bitcoins benefits and helping build infrastructure to use it.  But either way, neither USD nor bitcoin has any value unless we agree that it does.

Tons of reasons why free market anarchy won't work, but I'll give you one that really emphasizes why completely free markets end up with problems.
It costs money to operate landfills.  What happens when we charge the true cost of landfills?  People start dumping.  Or burning.  This is much more costly to everyone in the long run than a subsidy on landfills.  Cities subsidize their garbage collection to obfuscate the cost so that people don't go dumping their trash on the side of the road.
How do we do that in a free market economy?  The landfill operators operate to make money, so charge $X/lb or something like that.  If $X is too expensive, then people start dumping in back woods and creeks.  How would the free market handle this?

I thought about this.  There may eventually be a market for a way to "add a fee" to an already sent transaction.  Some kind of mechanism or company that worked with miners, and if your payment got "stuck", you could pay this company, and they would maintain a list or something that miners could check when they found a block, and if your transaction was on the list, they'd include it in the block they find and collect payment from the company.

I did have a long post that I accidentally cancelled, so I'm a little pissed at myself and don't want to type it all again.
Here's the gist:


I believe this to be false because we have evidence to the contrary.  Many people say the same thing about miners.  They say that ASICs are going to centralize mining and only big companies will be able to participate and they'll control the economy by collectively censoring payments by not including them in blocks, or by ignoring blocks with censored payments in it.  But if you believe this, then you should short bitcoin, because if this happens bitcoin will not be the digital cash it claims to be.  It'll be another copy of the fiat system, where the powerful rich governments control all the mining, and therefore the information that is included in the "public ledger".
So which camp are you in?  That scarcity and economic incentives causes evil monopolies ad government control?  Or that scarcity and economic incentives cause competition to be the most efficient, and therefore gives incentive to perform the best possible service in the cheapest manner?

It's good for the *protocol* since it encourages more adoption and understanding.
Regardless of price, bitcoin is game changing.  It just so happens that the more it changes the game, the higher the price goes.
Any publicity is good publicity, but publicity where Wall Street analysts are saying that it has value and is worth analyzing tells people who haven't heard about it that there is something there.

I'm not sure about the prices on the hydroponic supply store in particular, I'm just pointing out that micro economies are closing loops so that less participants have to exchange bitcoin for fiat to pay their bills.  As this continues we'll begin to see a shift in thinking from terms of USD/BTC or EUR/BTC and instead just start thinking in terms of BTC alone.  This is when lending starts to become more attractive, when the exchange rate stops being as big of a motivating factor.

Next difficulty is based on the blocks from this difficulty.  If the first block in this difficulty takes longer than 10 minutes, the next difficulty estimate will appear to go down.  The further into this difficulty we go, the more accurate the prediction for the next difficulty will be.

And look at all the legislation passed on how we are "allowed" to drive our cars.  Speed limits, mandatory seatbelts, yearly inspections, required insurance; those are pretty hefty government regulations IMO.  


I meant taken as a whole, any given individual is poorly positioned to retire.  


Which is one of the reasons I'm for splitting revenue streams and getting rid of this idea of a shared pot for all government expenditures.


This is an unfortunate side effect.  On the flip side of the coin though, if the production of law and justice includes the producer, isn't that a vested interest?  I mean, I don't know if I'd rather have someone make laws who is above them all, or make laws if he is affected by them.  On the one side, you have someone making laws they don't have to follow, but on the other you have someone making laws that tailor to their own best interests.  


Which is why we as a nation are to blame; we were supposed to keep this in check.  We were supposed to stop this from happening.  We were supposed to reign it in.  But I think it was Thomas Paine who said that eventually, a democratic society will realize it can vote itself gifts from the public coffer, and then shit really hits the fan (I paraphrase).  


I don't think abolishing government will have a *better* outcome than having government.  I think we'll just end up with a different set of problems.    Without an entity that can be held responsible for law and justice, everyone works out their own version.  Which would then conflict with each other.  How is this any better than one single version that conflicts with some?

I already think like this when it comes to mining hardware.  As more and more stuff becomes available for purchase that differentiation of thought will occur on some scale.  And even if not, bitcoin beats other remittance tools in speed and security; so I can definitely see bitcoin being the workhorse for more sophisticated behind-the-scenes type stuff.

That's great and all, but if you count on BTC going up as part of your calculation, you have to see which would be more profitable; buying objects to collect bitcoins or buying bitcoins directly.  If you could buy 2 btc per miner, and the miner makes back 1.5 btc over its lifetime, then you should have bought bitcoins and held them.  You have to look at ROI in terms of bitcoins, because it may be more profitable to just buy the bitcoins outright.

Incorrect.  "This note is legal tender for all *debts*, public and private."  Debts are when you owe someone something.  You owe the store nothing, therefore they do not have to take your money.
The reason this enters the legal system is so courts can determine, when someone defaults on a contract for something other than USD (for instance, if I sign an agreement to mow your lawn in exchange for babysitting, and you babysit my kids, but I don't mow your lawn, and you sue me), the court can assign a US dollar amount and force me on threat of incarceration to pay using dollars and can force you to collect your debt in dollars.

99% of what you had to say comes from a failure to analyze volume.  1000 .01 btc trades shilling the price upwards is apparent if you look at volume.  And 0% of your argument has anywhere in there where you are FORCED to participate.  


It's not unethical IMO.  You choose to label it that way.  Thanks for your opinion, but your opinion doesn't change the way the world is.


All walls can be pulled at any time.  They aren't reliable information.  You can use them to get a general idea of trends, but to trade big money using walls as support is silly.


Then maybe bitcoin isn't for you.


I agree.  But I fail to see how bitcoin relates, unless you have shifted from bots and are now talking about insider trading, which some argue is a way for markets to be properly signaled.  Information is worth money.  Trying to "regulate" that away is an exercise in futility, and not what we were talking about.


Unlike every other commodity right?  Oh wait...


It most certainly cannot be controlled by anyone.  *Investor sentiment* can be controlled, but only to the degree that the investor lets it.  


It's never going to change because that's the way humanity works.  Some people are spooked easily.  Others take advantage of those people.  Knowing your strengths and weaknesses is your personal responsibility.

Why the fuck not?  The news on bitcoin is slim right now.  Some of us don't mind consuming a story written from multiple angles.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:47:48
Here's the issue:
Exchange A has bitcoins for $500
Exchange B has bitcoins for $600
You have $1000 on exchange A.  Buy 2 btc, transfer to exchange B, sell for $1200, make $200 profit.  Now what?  You have to get that $1200 back to Exchange A for a rinse and repeat.  That means pulling that $1200 OUT of Exchange B, and then putting it INTO Exchange A.  If Exchange B takes a week to deposit your money, and Exchange A takes 3 days to accept your deposit, then you have to wait 10 days between iterations.
It's very difficult to automate unless you have WADS and WADS of cash already in both exchanges.
Edit: Mt Gox makes it worse by taking months to withdraw USD out of.  That's why you see such a high price on MtGox related to the other exchanges.

Well then don't store it.  There are options out there like blockchain.info.  IMHO 20gb isn't an exorbitant amount right now.  Plus, people are working on Merkle Tree pruning to make it so a client doesn't NEED the entire blockchain, just a "core" if you will, that can be utilized to verify specific transactions on request.

Yep, sure enough.  But until bitcoins are widely accepted and understood to be currency, the seller is in a stronger position, especially if he can prove that he owned them prior to the transaction.  If the buyer walks, the seller can press charges for stealing headphones.  In OP's situation, he has to prove that he sent bitcoins, AND explain that bitcoins have value to the police.  If the situation is reversed, the police don't need to understand bitcoins to understand that headphones were stolen.

It is CURRENTLY inflationary.  25 new bitcoins are minted approximately every 10 minutes.  Around 2140, after the block reward halves enough times, the number of new bitcoins minted per minute will recede to zero.  At THAT time, it will be a deflationary currency, since no new coins will enter the supply.
The valuation now has less to do with the money supply and more to do with specualation.

I'm pretty sure anarchists are the type who say "do what you will".  If you are referring to a "marriage license" or "marriage certificate" and the tax breaks and legal benefits that entails, then you are absolutely correct.  But when you take government out of marriage, marriage becomes simply a ceremony for celebrating the dedication of your life to another.  Anarchists have to be pro "marriage" since it is a voluntary act and a personal choice.
Also, anarchists are not all atheists.  What makes you think that?  Worshiping the god of your choice is another personal decision, and has nothing to do with the presence or lack of government.

I spent 3 months in Bangalore.  The things you say are absolutely true in some parts of the country.  What I found was that the problems you described are more prevalent in poorer parts of cities and in many villages.  I never experienced a blackout in the 3 months I was there, but of course I was on a compound that had it's own backup generators.  Bangalore proper was very much a metropolitan area.  Swanky restaurants, high class malls, along with poor beggars.  
It is very different than the Western world.  But I've had friends who've lived in some parts, and those parts were very polished and civilized, while still enjoying the benefits of a much lower cost of living.
Either way, it was a fantastic experience spending time there.

For those who cry bubble, remember that when bitcoin was $120, ASICMINER shares were 2 or 3 btc ($240 or $360).  Now that btc is at $90, 5 btc is $450.  So it's not climbing as fast as it appears, but rather btc is also falling in value a little as ASICMINER shares gain value.  Disclaimer:  I don't own any ASICMINER shares.  I just wanted to mention that.

Kind of chicken and egg problem.  Users don't have a lot of places to spend it, so they don't use it, which means merchants don't accept it, so there aren't a lot of places to accept it.
