I have no idea what you mean by "fucked." I bought my first few bitcoins for $0.60. Now if someone "corners the market" and prices rise dramatically from where they are, will I be "fucked"? If someone gets in now at $600 and the prices rise 10x or 100x, will they be "fucked"? As long as you can trade $X for $Y bitcoin and back within a short period of time in order to facilitate commerce, how will any bitcoin user be "fucked"?

The Dogecoiners strike me as about as "fun" as 4channers. Not to say there isn't anything actually fun at 4chan, or that anons don't ever do anything socially responsible. But 4chan is also full of sociopathic trolls who will have "fun" at the expense of anyone they decide to target for their "delicate sensibilities." Dogecoiners have targeted Bitcoin proponents as their juicy targets, hence the votefloods we're seeing. True to the 4chan ethos, it's more "fun" to make fun of people who care about what their doing— it shows how much "fun" nihilism is compared to really working to build something great in the world.

The blockchain only records values of transactions in BTC, not in USD or any other currency. The BTC value recorded will never change, and that's a big part of the purpose of the blockchain: a permanent, indelible record. If you want to know what the value of a transaction is in some other currency, you need to know the date and the (approximate) exchange rate on that date, and then do the conversion yourself.

"We don't live in a democracy, we live in a 'representational republic'," and all that crap. Even if we *did* live in a democracy, it's still the majority bullying the minority. Since we *don't* live in a democracy you get to cast your vote for the Red sociopath or the Blue sociopath, both of whom will gladly take your money at the point of a gun and spend it on whatever they can get away with, and then will print even *more* money up so they can do the stuff they normally *wouldn't* be able to get away with.

"Bitcoin is dead."
How many times have we heard that before? Many.
How many times are we likely to hear it again? Many.
How many times is it likely to be true? This is the question. If you think the answer is likely to be 1, then you should not be in Bitcoin. If you think the answer is likely to be zero, then you should— and still hedge your bets. Know thyself, and behave accordingly.

As the above comment states, you also have reason to spend it, because while its buying power is expected to rise in the long term, in the short term it is simply a more efficient way to transact value (for certain kinds of transactions) whatever its current valuation. Over time the kinds of transactions that Bitcoin is appropriate for will diversify, and this will further stabilize the currency's valuation.

I have bought goods with Bitcoin and will continue to do so regardless of its market valuation with respect to any other currency. During particularly volatile times, I'll simply buy BTC in the value of the fiat I want and immediately send it on to the merchant. They can use Bitpay to get fiat right away. And, no banks, no PayPal, no credit card companies involved. The business infrastructure is making this sort of thing easier and easier over time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:14:19
There has *never* been a currency like Bitcoin before— not even gold. So your comparisons are extremely weak. Furthermore, some people feel that there is value is actually *saving* money should be a good thing, rather than being compelled to spend it as fast as possible due to inflation or other such demurrage. Bitcoin hoarders are doing a service to the rest of the bitcoin economy by making everyone else's bitcoins scarcer and hence more valuable. In the long run, the smart hoarders will drip, rather than dump, their bitcoins back into the market— either by selling coins or buying things with them, because that is simply the way to maximize their value.
What's good for hoarders (savers) is good for the rest of the economy, and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:25:37
Fortunately, there is a strong precedent for "fixing what's wrong with Bitcoin," a precedent I believe will continue. Scalability in terms of transaction volume is one area that needs addressing, and— you know what?— there's time to address it. Bitcoin is both a currency *and* a commodity, so it will be fixed for both uses— there's no reason to think it can't or won't be.

Anyone who bought BTC without realizing they were in for an emotional roller coaster ride was being naive. I bought coins at $0.60 and I've bought coins at $100. Sometimes I wish I'd bought more, but I've always told myself that I'm only going to play with money I can afford to lose. I still think Bitcoin will be a long-term success and my strategy is still buy-and-hold. Anyone with any other strategy had better learn to enjoy adrenaline and insomnia.

The old-timers in this scene remember the $30 bitcoin bubble. They all said Bitcoin was dead when it dropped to $0.01. But the only way to kill bitcoin is to find a security flaw in the protocol itself, and no-one has come close to doing that. Meanwhile, everything else is just growing pains.
Breathe... breathe...
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:40:47
I don't think you need to rely on anyone's philanthropy. A quick cash-out would destroy most of a bitcoin hoarder's value. Better to feed hoarded coins slowly into the market, being careful not to move it too much at one time. So, what's good for hoarders is good for everyone else, and will *not* tank Bitcoin's value. The only thing that actually tanks the value is panic selling, and gosh... that means more cheap bitcoins for me!

There is simply no point at which a group of people can ethically say to an individual, "Give us [all/some/any] of your money on pain of incarceration or death." This is euphemized as "We all should pay our fair share," and sold as our "patriotic duty" but it is, at its root, a taking by force, and it is as wrong as slavery was/is wrong. But both the slavers, and even many of the slaves of a past era would defend the practice on various grounds, just as you defend "taxes" (i.e., robbery) on various grounds. Yeah, slavery can be "good" for lots of things, but it's still wrong.
I do pay my taxes of course... but I know I'm simply paying off armed thugs to get them to go away and leave me alone. You don't realize this yet. Eventually humanity became more enlightened about slavery. One day I hope (and expect) that humanity will come to the same level of reason about the free-range slaves we euphemistically call "taxpayers."

The fact that fiat -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; fiat is actually *more frictionless* and *less expensive* in many cases, than, say, PayPal, wire transfers, or credit cards gives Bitcoin a competitive advantage, and will help it achieve long-term stabilization.

Mt. Gox is a private institution and can set its own rules any way they like. Their goal is to facilitate trade and make money in the process by keeping their customers happy. If they anger their customers, they will lose. Right now, they have many angry customers. Placing limits on the number and amount of transactions, particularly in times of volatility, and as long as Mt. Gox remains as influential as it is, is one way to appease many of those customers. Of course, customers who are not appeased are welcome to use (or start) other exchanges. Nothing I am saying is incompatible with the idea of decentralized, essentially anarchic currency.
Furthermore, to act like a central bank, Mt. Gox would have to print up bitcoin out of thin air... and that can't happen.

If you believe in Bitcoin as a long-term disruptive technology, then even buying at the peak yesterday should not bother you.

What has been happening actually disproves your thesis: in a free, unprotected market, competitors emerge and people take their business elsewhere. Any "monopoly" is simply temporary market dominance. Governments grant true monopolies with violence-backed regulation so onerous that incumbents become entrenched and new players cannot emerge. This limits consumer choice and makes the market less free.
In short: Mt. Gox is not now and has never been a monopoly.

He has a pre-paid debit card I use to give him his allowance (FamZoo.com) For some reason the site wasn't accepting the card, even though the balance was sufficient. I said, "Here, Humble Bundle accepts Bitcoin. You buy $5 of Bitcoin from me and I'll send it directly to HB." Debit his FamZoo account $5, send 0.018175 BTC from my wallet to HB, all done in 2 minutes. He was happy and both my boys and my other friends present were impressed to see how easy it is to use Bitcoin.

The word "tax" is a euphemism for "robbery". It is used to disguise the gun in the room pointed at people who don't agree with you about what you and your cronies say are "good and useful services," or who think they want to prioritize the spending of their life energy (time/money) other ways. We already have a perfectly good word for a non-coercive collection: charity. We also have other words for services used on a quid-pro-quo basis: subscription, membership, contract. Tax is not charity. Tax is not a contract. Tax is... theft.
If everyone agrees that, say, fire services are a good thing, then there will be no problem getting people to pay for it without pointing a gun at them. The reason you feel the need to point a gun is that you know that people don't all want the hyper-expensive and often incompetent "services" that government "provides." And you've been brainwashed into believing that only government (i.e., the coercive thugs in charge) can provide these services.
So, you "gladly" give to what you want, and leave me alone, thanks. You'll be much more persuasive if you put down that gun.

Actually, you know what? Even if you understood all those things, it would still be theft and still be wrong.

You know what works? The public domain. Which, along with trade secrets, would be all that exists in a stateless society. If groups want to have a fork of software that remains free and open source, and other groups want to fork the same software, close it up, and add a bunch of secret sauce and charge for the compiled binaries, I say more power to them both. This provides the market with a clear choice between something that can be easily and inexpensively maintained and improved, and the proprietary secret sauce. Neither option needs "legal enforceability" behind it to have a viable economic niche.

Altruism itself is a false concept. It is possible to do good for oneself and good for others simultaneously. Arbitrage gets attacked as a greedy ploy... and yet it creates cross-market stability in prices.
