So the government should incentivize working class people to just spend their way into prosperity? How exactly does that work? What about saving and building equity? That's what every rich person I know does. Buying useless shit just benefits those who sell useless shit. I'm no economist but it just doesn't sound right to me.
How is demand information measured and who decides how much is enough?
The borrower benefits sure, how does that relate to the overall economy and the average working person?

I know about credit card fees. I'm just saying bitcoin can do better. Stellar is an ICO and 99% of ICOs are scams

Inflation does nothing to benefit people. It serves no one except those in government who use it as a hidden tax. If people want to spend money on something, they will spend it, regardless if its inflationary or not. What a strange thing to try to get people to spend more money on things they don't need by devaluing their money. Also on bitcoin: I used to spend bitcoin all the time, why? 1. As a way to 'opt out' of a system I disagree with and 2. because it was just as easy and as cheap to use (if not more) than dollars. It's deflationary property never concerned me, because I would just buy more everytime I made a transaction with it.
Bitcoin was designed as a peer 2 peer cash system. To be an alternative and perhaps eventually a replacement to fiat. Things that have no use, have no value. I believe bitcoin can be a store of value and also an actual currency because it always has been

You're saying spending drives productivity? Shouldn't productivity drive spending? You have to produce something to extract value from something which you can then exchange for a unit of account, you can then exchange those units for something else (spending). Prove this wrong? It just makes so much more sense to me.
The federal reserve lowered interest rates substantially in the 1920s which created an artificial boom which finally reversed in 1929. It was the federal reserve's fault, not the peoples. Disprove this.
Regardless, any rational person would rather have a currency that goes up in value (and one that is relatively stable, bitcoin unfortunately isn't at the moment. I think we can agree on this) We will see what currency wins in the next 10-100 years.

Exactly. Less people use bitcoin now than back then because of higher TX fees. (including me)

The unfortunate consequence of this more crashes happening. Why do countries like Switzerland seem to be immune from crashes?


That's interesting, this is my first time hearing about 'demand information'. I should probably learn more about it and what can influence it.


That was my point in bringing up saving and building equity, I think people saving more with more cautious investment would be good for the average person and overall economy. If we had a non inflationary currency, people would make ever so slightly more rational decisions with their money because they wouldn't be as pressured to spend it. I think savings rate is at an all time low in America? Anecdotally, the amount of people spending their check on depreciating assets like cars and technology seems to be increasing as well.

Have fun gambling with scamcoins.

Sorry, by usage I mean purchases of things. Not just speculative day trading transactions. Most of the new bitcoiners don't even see it as a currency, they see it as a 'get rich quick' speculative asset.

How is having to work harder for your money, constantly needing a raise good for the average person? Inflation is a complete scam, no one would choose to use an inflationary currency if they weren't forced at gunpoint. Bitcoin competing with the US dollar will ultimately prove that.

Well that's fine as long as you understand unless people use bitcoin, it will have no value long term. Speculators may have driven up the price but there has to be an underlying functionality or it will have no value.

An initial coin offering where you just give out coins to people so they then have incentive to pump them up (almost all of them) are scams. Don't get emotional. I'm not saying stellar in particular is a scam, but you should realise anyone can copy a coin that is actually used like bitcoin and ethereum, make a cool looking website with a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo ""decentralized ledger technology"" and try to pass it off as unique. And I'm sure IBM will make a lot of short term money off it. This is the dot com bubble and bitcoin is Google.

Faucets are completely different. Most ICOs are redundant and dont bring any new technology to the table. They give them out or you buy them directly from the dev team that made it and then shill to your hearts content (basicly a pyramid scheme). Your insinuation about bitcoins dominance could be right, but I doubt it. Only time will tell.

That is still pretty high. One of the major selling points to me on bitcoin back in 2012 was that transactions were less than a penny. I see no reason to actually use it anymore..
