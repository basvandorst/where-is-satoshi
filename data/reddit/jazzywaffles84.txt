In the not so distant future their job will be replaced with smart contracts. They will eventually have to transfer their job skills to searching through people's trash to find waste management violations.
That would be a gold mine and they would be contributing to society via a greener planet.

People will keep selling off for profit until bitcoin overtakes the US dollar (no reason to sell for fiat when it's no longer dominant in the world) at that point we will will be referring to currency in satoshis. The price of bitcoin might have to break a million dollars for it to take over (ballpark guess)  but the next bull run in a couple years will break 100k range and pull back. 10-20 years or so out could break a million, at that point it will have won the war.  Just my guess, but whatever crisis might happen in the world could expedite it. Either that will happen or it will go to zero lol
