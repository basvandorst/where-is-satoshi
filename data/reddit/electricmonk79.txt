If we were best friends or relatives then I might send you 1000 BTC and be confident that you would send it immediately back. That shows a thick bond between two nodes on a network. That's a weighted graph. BTC allows us to put value against the edges between nodes on a social graph. As I understand it, that's where the hashcash concept originated in trust and reputation for email. To me, this is the killer app of blockchain tech because it allows us to build up a reliable reputation and trust network.

Nothing wrong with telling them how you feel. I feel similar. If you've ever read "Revolution in The Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made" then you'll know that early Apple (and early Silicon Valley in general) was a lot like our Bitcoin community today - lots of uber geeks getting really excited about a new technological era and the huge social consequences. You send them an email about it and you get back an automated response from someone in India who hasn't even read your email. Shame on Apple.
The frustration for me is that it's really a choice between Apple and Microsoft in an everyday office environment. Apple makes great hardware. Shame they're such a bunch of twats now. The philosophy died with Steve Jobs. His DNA ran through that company like Bezos' does through Amazon. The company dies with the leader. Just the thermal design of the 27" iMac was a triumph of simplicity and common sense. THey put a radiator straight through the middle of the screen and produced a near silent computer. That sort of simplicity takes genius and Jobs was smart enough to know who the geniuses were in his own organisation.
RIP Apple.

You could only modify one block and then you would have to travel back again. If the cost of travelling is more than one block then bitcoin is time-traveller proof!! Even future tech would mean that you would have 99% hash rate but then you still wouldn't want to do that because it would devalue the currency you're earning!

I didn't get a chance to respond to your thoughtful reply last time and wanted to say thanks. I was actually on holiday in Morocco when I wrote this so I've only just had a chance to read back over it.


You're right. This is the strongest argument against. However, PPC doesn't do a bad job of this at the moment. OK - it's curated and other factors effect ranking but the difference is that the advertisor is paying Google. In this system, the end user is the recipient of the PPC money and so my gut feeling is that less and possibly no curation is needed. 
I'm sure there's a game theory dissertation here somewhere but I consider it like this...
If I'm searching for "golf bags in portugal" and it returns some results like this...
* 1. Florida Golf - (£1.20/min)
* 2. Algarve golf shop (£0.20/min)
* 3. Portugal golf (£0.10/min)
* 4. ....
* 5. ..
Looking at the results I might think that 2 is most relevant but 1 will give me more money. Picking 1 punishes them for a badly placed advert. They have a strong incentive to lower their bid and I'm compensated for the distraction. With Google PPC, I'm not compensated. From this you could start to add other variables (either auto-set by the extension or user settings) to change ranking based upon user reporting of relevance, whether links are clicked disproportionately to their ranking etc etc.
Reductio ad absurdum...
If I'm searching for "paperclips" and then the results come back with...
* 1. Golden Widgets (£832million/min)
* 2. Paperclips (£0.0732/min)
... then I'm not going to be buying paperclips but who cares! Something's going to give. They'll stop bidding so high, run out of money, or I get compensated.
There are some types of search where monetary value makes much less sense. The stuff that you would typically look for on in the organic search results. It's the PPC bit - the bit that makes Google all their money - where I see bitcoin providing a mechanism to run the same auction but without the third party. Before-bitcoin, a third party was needed to store the bids and process payments. No need post-bitcoin: Public decentralised bid-ledger and P2P payments makes Google redundant.
TL;DR - auctions work. Bitcoin facilitates auctions. Let's have more auctions for the most profitable auction on the internet - search.
IMO - other arguments against don't carry. Problems of microtransactions can/will be resolved by Ephereum or some sort of meta-ledger that is periodically pulled into the blockchain.
Privacy and data-mining is a non-issue as I envisage a decentralised P2P auction ledger. Nobody owns it. Install the browser extension of the company you trust. The only money to be made b a 3rd party is to make better tools and GUIs to access the ledger.
It's not competing with Google but making their PPC irrelevant.
Other things to consider would be the possibility of tailoring bid amounts to the rental cost of the eyeball. If you're an oil Sheik searching for holidays then the results and PPC bids might look very different to someone from a country with $6k GPD per capita income.
Maybe this would be a good ephereum project?

Professor Miron
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:09:26


Most don't. That's why economies grow. It's quite simple. If you don't believe in the investments that your bank makes then you need to question whether you should be putting your money in that bank. Bad banks will fail. When I was younger, a savings account had restrictions on the rate you could withdraw money. Savers with deposits in banks need to be aware that a considerable fraction of your USD (or BTC) holding is held as assets and not M0. That awareness was destroyed by implicit, and sometimes explicit, government backed guarantees of deposits and loans. That was wrong. All I'm trying to say here is that FRB itself wasn't the problem. We'll see FRB with Bitcoin whether people here like it or not.


This isn't relevant. It's not what I'm discussing here. I suspect that confusing this with FRB is why it's unpopular within the community and why there's so many downvotes. It's not the same thing. You're not the only person in this thread to confuse the two.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:49:30


My trust is scoped. But I certainly would trust you more than no information at all. I sent you money and you sent it back. You could have run off with it but you didn't. Bayesian priors shrink around the possibility of you not being an arsehole. $3 might not seem like much but if a Nigerian Prince was sending you an email with $3 attached then you might not put it immediately in the spam filter.


I don't know. That was a stretch. I guess you might tip a reviewer on rotten tomatoes and if your friends also tip that reviewer then you may find that you take more notice of their reviews and they keep their job. Buying someone's services, even as a voluntary donation, is testifying the quality and increase their reputation. Others get to see that your appreciation is costly and thus congruous.


Because a non-weighted graph is just that - **arbitrary** - and so each edge is weighted equally. It costs nothing to upvote a reddit comment and yet an upvote from a regular contributor who votes once a year has the same value as an equally regular contributor who votes 100 times a day.
I've had an interest in networked identity long before I discovered bitcoin. It's always seemed peculiar to me that whenever you are asked to verify your identity you then proceed to present documents from big organisations that really don't know you very well; passport offices, utility companies, driving licence authorities, banks etc. In the absence of a weighted graph trust/reputation network, the identification demander has no choice but to request verification using a few documents from an organisation it trusts (e.g your bank) than to ask for 100 verifications from your mum, dad, brother, sister, bloke you drink with in the pub, someone you sent an email to, girl who sold you ebay item etc etc who may be able to vouch for your identity.
It's not been possible before now because there was no currency and no trusted ledger.
In summary, I've been waiting for both these technologies for a long time and I am SO excited about this marriage. This is HUGE!

When it comes to killing my babies, I'm like King Herod. Fail fast. I like to indulge in some imagineering so still think that Google is going to get bitten in the arse by this in 2-3 years time. I can still remember sitting in my bath in 2010 and inventing Facebook in my head. This feels the same. That's why I think people will always be better off investing in Amazon than Google. I can't see PPC lasting more than 3 more years and when that happens Google will lose 90% of their revenue.

What you say is true but in this instance it's very much on topic. If we had a reputation system then he wouldn't need to upload photos like this.

No. The trust metric is more akin to the reciprocal - conductivity (siemens). We even use these terms in everyday conversation e.g. "They have a strong bond between them." or "They're joined at the hip".
In your example:
You --- $5 ---&gt; A --- $3 --&gt; B
has an equivalence of (1/5 + 1/3)^-1 or $1.875
You ---&gt; $1.875 ---&gt; B


Maybe. I'm not a cryptographer.


It does now. It's called Bitcoin.


I've just sent you $3 and you didn't send it back. That conveys information to everyone who can see that. It might say a lot of things:
* Don't trust  with anything valued over $3 in a similar context.
*  trusts to easily and should be factored accordingly.
* Trust of  should be scoped to things valued at less than $3.
If you had sent the $3 back then neither of us would be any the richer or poorer (ignoring transaction fees) but we would have something of value in the form of a bond. More so me because I instigated it.
Taking the idea further you could use [proof-of-burn]( with something like a +$100 to signal distrust. [The Ultimatum Game]( and [The Dictator Game]( show us that we are willing to sacrifice our own economic well being to reinforce societal norms.
Anyway... nevermind all this. Give me my money back, you bastard! :)
Only kiddin' - this conversation has given me a great idea that's worth $3.

Yea. yea. It's a banking conspiracy. *yawn* Now THAT's some grade school shit!
I'm not asking you to agree with some subjective opinion on the matter. FRB facilitates wealth creation. Bitcoin will do this in the future whether you like it or not. It might not even look like a bank as we currently know them but there will be people who collectively believe that their holdings exceed much more than 21 million BTC. And what's more, they'll be right because they will have assets such as houses, businesses and loans that are denominated in BTC. And each 1BTC of their M1 holdings will be worth 1BTC of your M0 stashed in your paper wallet. THe only difference is that their money will be growing in value because it's being put to work building stuff. Just like you can't uninvent blockchain tech, you can't uninvent banking.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:22:30
That's true. I think one of the advantages of Bitcoin in FRB is that any account holder can query the reserves. It makes it much more obvious how much of your bitcoin denominated bank account is held as non M0 assets. I don't know how bitcoin will operate in FRB but it's clear to me that for wealth to be created you need a mechanism to put that money to work. Thanks for engaging. I wish others would.  Bizarre that anyone downgrade an educational resource. Bitcoin will solve many problems. Stupidity isn't one of them.

Thanks for your thoughts.
I think I may have completely miscommunicated the concept. References to "Adverts" and traditional advertisors is completely misleading.
I was hoping for a more positive response from redditors but I think many have misunderstood and assumed it involves a loud and brash advertising scheme.
I really just mean a Bitcoin based keyword auction. The PageRank algorithm solved the problem of assessing keyword worthiness when this wasn't previously possible. Bitcoin's roots in hashcash was what made me think of revisiting the problem. Simply evaluate ranking based upon how much it's worth to the content producer.
Pay-per-click is Google renting out your eyeballs. Bitcoin allows us to rent out our attention directly for the things we're interested in. Biggest bidder gets our attention. WIN-WIN.

Then it's worth $3000 NOW.
Current price already includes future expectation. If I gave you a key and could reliably prove that it would open up a box of $3000 in 6 months time, how much would you be willing to pay for the key?

You have a stake in Bitcoin whether you like it or not because non-action is ALSO choosing a side.

Great. I saw Tim (my uncle) down the pub tonight and he said that an order had come in. My ~91 yr old grandmother has macular degeneration so her eyesight is slowly fading. My uncle was in a rush to get the books out before her eyes failed so there's a lovely back story to the story. My gran has always been a keen adopter of new tech. She has a brilliant poetry blog at  and during WW2 she jumped at the chance to learn to drive cars and trucks.
Here's the back story:
Hope it adds even more magic to the magic of the book.

A figurative one. It seems a shame that all this BTC keeps ending up in the hands of criminals (a.k.a. politicians).  I suppose all money must eventually be earned for it to be useful beyond consumption.
Of course, there's not much point in having a dead man's switch unless you announce it; except vengefulness.

The value of Bitcoin is that it exists at all. I was a reasonably early adopter from 2011 so financially I've done well from it but I honestly think it pales into insignificance compared to the huge utility gains of it simply existing. Would love to be using a decentralised taxi company for example. Don't know how much that would save me over a lifetime. Probably a lot. Might never need to buy a car again? So $30k just for that alone?
TL;DR - Bitcoin has value to you even if you don't own any.

Apple won't bother? or Coloredcoins?
When my computers were stolen the first time they were recovered with Prey and I have a great photo of a man in handcuffs sat in front of my computer. I protected all my computers with Prey and also password protected the Bios so they don't have any choice but to take them into Apple. It frustrates me that Apple will happily fix and maintain stolen equipment. As I understand it, their excuse is the legal implications of flagging equipment as stolen. But from what I understood of a Mike Hearn talk, it's possible to transfer ownership of a device from one person to the next.
Irrespective of whether Apple want to do it, is it not worth doing just as a public ledger? Then grass roots campaign to encourge Apple devs to check for stolen items?

She seems close to tears here. I almost felt sorry for her. It's the nature of the world we live in that you can make a mistake (even a big one) and have that mistake multiplied a thousand times. On the other hand, maybe she has no regrets at all and she's just got a cold.

It's almost like we need some kind of decentralised compounded networked identity and reputation system for trust purposes. You know... like a weighted social graph. Now where could we get one of those...
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:32:31


The trust is weighted so the trust from you to B is similar to resistance networks in electronics. If the trust is in series then it's addition and if it's in parallel then it's the sum of the reciprocals. 


By attaching value to a transaction. You send an email to your friend and attach $100. You have attached value to the edge (the act of email sending).


Yes it does and you've pretty much said so yourself...


It's a way of saying "I really mean this" aka "normal use". That builds trust and reputation. The trust comes from the conveying of genuine intent and the reputation because you're presenting that in a truthful and incorruptible public ledger for all to see forever.


Let me demonstrate by example. I'll send you some money to convey sincerity against this comment. If you send it back then I'll be more inclined to trust you in the future if you claim to be Satoshi Nakomoto's brother. Imagine doing that a hundred times with a 100 different redditors and your "reputation" starts to have real world value. If the tipbot allowed it I could even sacrifice an amount to indicate mistrust. You can then start to look at the ledger and put a trust resistance icon against users based upon their trustworthiness relative to *you*. I've never used the tipbot before so you'll have to bear with me.
