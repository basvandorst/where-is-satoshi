Read my previous coment slowly and quietly, and maybe one day you will understand :)

Maybe to help those people, and contact them saying their wallets are endangered? Do you know for example this site? 
You are only attacking, like you had some btc, it's sad you don't :D
I deleted it because if people like you, that have below average IQ, and want to act like smartest people in the world :))

Okay, I understand, but is there any organization that is controlling there "markets", and forcing them to identify people? Or is it just "initiative" of market owners, to make world better place? (Or not that bad, after cryptocurrencies came)
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:34:09
How? :)

Okay, I understand, but I am sure that we are able to invent algorithm, that will only look for (for example) one btc address, about which we know is full of bitcoins. Just putting all addresses from list  into one page, and look for that exact address. When we are looking on website using CTRL-F, it takes few microseconds, and I know it is huge number, but if I split this job into thousands of PCs, 1st one looking for 1st 0.1% of addresses (or so, just hypothetically), 2nd one for 2nd 0.1%, I am sure that it could be possible in some time... maybe its just about getting biggest effectivity, or smoothest algorithm.
You know, its not hard job, only to look for something, if we already have list and pairs of address and key... its not about solving every address... just looking for excact one in the list...

Sorry, but firstly I have never said I want to take any coins or so, secondly, I don't know what is wrong on the post, its only about educating myself, and thirdly, the chance of really stealing from somebody is close to 0, thanks to way how bitcoin works...
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:57:50
Link I meant, in point 2... so is it list with all private keys, or just leaked or so? What if before I find key with balance there, the owner of this servers notices it, and gets it faster?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:56:26
Thank you all for explanations, it probably took a lot of effort to explain me the principe, and the really big amount of private keys and addresses. Thank you and good luck folks, prepare for next forking on 25/26 january ;)

Colliding means in this context "meet" or "find", and not "steal". Should I put here a link for dictionary, so you can revise your vocabulary? :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:41:23
But the question is, if bitcoin buyer is considered as customer, and if on every market. And also, if there is something like KYC developed in every country...
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:44:05
LMAO :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:24:27
Oh what a coinsidence that I have alts. Are you ready to trade with me? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:36:13
"January dip"
*And then 2nd feb came.*
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:00:44
Have you loosed something, or why are u so upset? :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:30:02
best comment reactions ever on reddit :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:54:04
Wish something, bitcoin is falling...
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:58:35
But over the years, the probability will be raising rapidly, when people  and systems generate more and more addresses... its not (1/all possibilities), but (amount of created privatekeys/all possibilities) ... I know it is small, but we can not rely on that it will never happen
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:41:17
Bitcoin coming back to 19$! Oh sorry, wrong parallel universe (:
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:24:51
I am not asking about finding someone's private key, but the question was, if is it possible to offline generate 2 same keys.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:34:53
That is absolutely true. Well, but not everybody is quiet :):
