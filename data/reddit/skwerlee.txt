This part kinda undermines the rest of your points. Bitcoin is deflationary.

I'm neither a hardcore fanatic or a troll AMA.

at least the chains of puns seem to be slowly abating eh?

I'd like to get into the altcoins but I have a hard enough time keeping up with bitcoin which I actually believe will be successful. I see some mentions of ether, monero but I'm hesitant to buy into something I know nothing about which might be price inflated.
S'pose ill just have to be happy with my bitcoin gains. Everything else just feels like betting roulette to me.

Thanks! This is exactly what I've been looking for. I don't need in-depth analysis or predictions I just needed to know how to collect my free stuff.

yeah but then he totally bounces back and becomes the supreme commander of the imperial forces!

The gambling term fits in this case. someone who has a lot of coin.
also, I think there is a fat joke in there somewhere.

I agree. This is exactly the kind of thing that cements peoples preconceived notions that bitcoin isn't a serious investment. This makes it look like amateur hour.

I thought everyone kept their coins in local wallets. Why would you ever store BTC on a trading platform? You can simply transfer them over when it's time to sell. Sure you might lose a couple minutes doing that but certainly not 12 hours.

How would they be oblivious to it? Wouldn't they have to go through and approve every single bot account? That would be a pretty big tip-off.

just because you can afford to lose it doesn't mean you won't stay up 30-40 extra minutes at night reanalyzing your choices over and over ^and ^over ^^and ^^over ^^^and ^^^over

people who buy drugs regularly are already accustomed to risk being a part of their purchase.
