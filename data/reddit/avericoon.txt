Everything has a degree of manipulation... the more liquidity and adoption the less fiddle faddle by d bags on their yachts

And the US dollar

Replied to the wrong thread-  was stating that all markets have manipulation and function with mal intent...  some were suggesting that btc is only one manipulated.   People forget that the mighty dollar is used for horrible things every minute that passes .

not necessarily \- they system is centralized, but im sure is separated into sectors or regions.  This directly prevents the whole ship from sinking by segregating the problem.  Only part of the ship is damaged but the boat still floats.   regardless, this doesnt look good for their image

you have 2 computers ... both share one network server....  1 computer goes down but the other works..  you are still running on a centralized system \(with one arm failing\)... its common sense.   like i have continuously said \- only thing in todays world thats not centralized is the expanding frontier of crypto, torrent systems, other ventures that the old world just can understand, but cant accept due to its threatening nature of how things have always operated thus far. Human nature says we are resistant to change regardless if the new way improves things

system is most def centralized... but obviously its well established and has fail safes in order for days like this.   Everything to date except for btc and cryptocurrency is run through and by world banking institutional system.... aka \- centralization
