thanks, do you happen to have a link to that text? I searched for it but found a different page that didn't list any supporting wallets, etc. I was trying to pay from blockchain.info... my buddy used that wallet a couple weeks ago.

I was just having the same issue. At least I know why now. Oh well, I guess I'll save my funds.

Oh, okay. I didn't think of that. Thanks for clearing up how it works.

If someone is selling that also means others are buying. If the price drops because of a huge sale, the seller can reinvest their money back into it and gain more. 
I'm new to all this, but I just don't see how that cycle ever ends. At least in the stock market, the value of stocks is tied to how well a company is doing, or might do in the future, which is tied to their products and how they manage said company. With crypto coins it just tied to the difficulty getting them, and speculation on how much they might be worth in the future.

I'd think they go hand in hand. Both ruled by money, and with money, and/or power, comes corruption. I'm not saying overall there is corruption, but there is enough... I live in one of the most corrupt states in the United States - New York. Governor Cuomo should be in prison for corruption, instead he'll likely be a presidential candidate.

all that could be done for a fraction of the cost, and a lot cheaper than the government and states do it for. Lets not forget all the corruption, and theft by our politicians. 
I pay my taxes, but I say fuck the system if you can - they are all cheating liars, and fuck over tax payers any chance they get!
