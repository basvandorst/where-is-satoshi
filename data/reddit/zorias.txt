Cash is recommended because of fraud. A scammer can reverse their bank transfer after you've given them your BTC. Reputable companies like Coinbase are less likely to do so.

Yeah, it sounds like the hashing is done partly as a precaution in case a vulnerability is ever found that would allow an attacker to derive the private key from a public key.

[Here's]( some info on the topic of address reuse privacy.

Security wise it's fine. The only concern of address reuse is privacy.

I liked the automatic sending of digital products (gift codes) upon payment. The ability to choose how many confirmations you'll allow including 0.
I did not like when they started requiring photocopies of sellers government IDs to weed out scammers, but I understand why they did it. 
Multisig would be a nice feature to have. A good API/callback system for third party automation as well, so people can setup Steam bots to auto send games and the like.

I duno about the new versions, but I'm still running the older 0.88.1 offline bundle on 10.04, my offline machine lacks PAE support so it's kinda stuck on 10.04 if I want a purely offline install. Unfortunately running 0.88 means my online machine is stuck on 0.91.2 due to 0.92 being incompatible with 0.88. 
I plan to move to a hardware wallet someday and forgo Armory. It's becoming a hassle having to download and process the blockchain whenever I want to move funds to my online wallet.
