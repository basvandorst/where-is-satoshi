those are likely segwit tx though, looking at [this comment]( it doesn't look like they changed anything what so ever

Ah I see what you mean. Interesting, wonder why some blocks are "normal" and some aren't.

Sounds like a whole lot of work with a substantial amount of fees going to miners. I suppose in the future most criminals will simply ask for monero payments out of the box.

I can tell you from personal experience that I was _very_ angry for a transaction getting pushed without the specific sat/byte value I put in only to then realize that it still got confirmed within 30minutes.
So whatever the ledger folks are doing in regards to segwit, they're doing it right (at least when using custom fees obviously).

That's... one of the most used mempool websites in the last months, and it's HTTPS with a solid certificate.
If you're so scared of websites, just use a VM for browsing. You should not discard potential information just because of unfounded paranoia.

how would that work when there's 80k+ tx ahead of your 0 fee tx?

I was wondering about this: If a "high profile" hack gets public, wouldn't decent exchanges just accept the bitcoins and then freeze them essentially scamming the scammer?
Sure, slippery slope and all that but since there is hardly any regulation on the crypto side I'd not be surprised at all if that's the case sooner rather than later.

I 100% agree and have [voiced my opinion in their subreddit]( in regards to UI/UX and usability (unfortunately without response).
While I really think they have a long way to go until it's as simple and easy to use as I'd like to see, especially to make it usable for noobs, they do correctly work under the hood and that's arguably more important than the interface being perfect.

Of course you can, it's not that hard. Takes quite some time and you still have to trust yourself, but running SHA256 is rather straight forward: [Nice link here](
