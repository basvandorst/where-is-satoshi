You mean a large cost and not even close to instantly?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:42:14
And if it doesn't?
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:01:50
What if keeps going down and you keep buying until you're broke?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:52:22
You don't dislike the current cost of transaction fees and amount of time it takes to complete a transaction?

I planted a tree 19 years ago. You are saying it would have been better for me to plant that tree today instead?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:44:01
What you just said is a much better saying.

If there is a willing buyer for dirt then diet has value. Tell garden centres that dirt is worthless.

Are people willing to spend money to buy mosquitoes?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:43:43
Not true. I have sent multiple transactions to a betting site and have not been banned. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:31:45
Oh well if *you* aren't impressed then it must be bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:01:53
It *literally* has a worth. It can *literally* be exchanged for USD which I'm sure you'll agree is not worthless. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:11
Oh I already know that. I stopped when I found out. You said someone would be instantly banned for doing it though. That just isn't true.

Of course we could use ETH. That's not the point. The point is that it's not practical to use BTC for day to day transactions even though that was one of the intentions behind BTC.

You don't even know the difference between *lose* and *loose* apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:49:53
First off, *lose* and *losing* are the words you want. *loose* is the opposite of tight. 
Why does your entire comment talk about BCH when I mentioned BCH zero times? Instead of addressing anything you just go off on BCH. I was just talking about BTC *not* BCH. You can't just argue against something else and think that somehow makes BTC look better. Try addressing the problems without just bashing other coins.

Stupid people wanting faster transaction times and lower fees. What idiots. I want to wait days for my transactions to go through and pay high fees. That gives me a higher sense of accomplishment and showcases my patience.

They can switch to another alt. Some obviously are. You seemed unclear as to what the commenter was saying and I clarified. 
Having a coin that was intended to be able to be used for day to day transactions not work for said intention is bad. Telling people they should just use an alt until it gets sorted out is ridiculous.

Ban evasion?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:38:58
That makes sense. Saying do certainty that it will be back to 19k is the part that doesn't make sense. You don't know that for certain. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:24:41
You seriously think that's what it causing this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:42
You believe this is the cause of the whole market behaving this way?
