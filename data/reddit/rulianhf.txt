And they changed their taxe policy, before was 60 something % taxe on crypto gain. Now flat taxe of 30% and taxe cut for every year you hodl. So if you hodl your crypto for 22 year in France, it is 0% taxe !!!
First time in my life that I like to be a french citizen for taxe xD.

Since when, we French people use English in a protest ? Even if I think buying bitcoin would be a better way than the crazy protest that appened, unfortunately I can't think of any French that would think that writing this in English would be a good idea to make a point in France. I am pretty sure half of the protester doesn't know the word buy in English.

Bien sûr, mais utiliser l'anglais en France c'est pas le meilleur moyen de promouvoir quoi que ce soit.

English will follow 
Je ne suis pas d'accord, plus de 80% des français on entendu parler de bitcoin mais ils ne savent pas ce que c'est et ce que ça impliquerait si on l'utilisais à la place de l'euro.
Si ils le savaient ils n'y aurai eu aucune violence juste une inflation de l'euro par rapport au bitcoin.
Mais malheureusement, je vois de trop grosse lacune en France en terme d'éducation sur la finance et la monnaie.
I disagree, more than 80% of French heard of bitcoin but don't know what it is and what it would mean if we used it instead of euro.
If they knew they would not have done what they did in Paris with violence and destruction, just inflation of euro compare to bitcoin.
Unfortunately there is a lack of education in finance and currency in our country.
