Don't do this actually. Just paper wallet that sucker.
\&gt;what if huos bruns then wallit brusn too
yeah so will that shitty thing that costs $70 (ON TOP OF YOUR BTC INVESTMENT) as well
paper wallet is THE way to cold storage crypto.

Now, what will the devs do about the ever increasing centralized mining?

Anyone with even two braincells is informed enough before buying things like crypto. This is advice for the mentally retarded and uninvestes.

Seriously. People all over this sub are delusional. Bitcoin is King but not fucking God. I'm waiting till it hits 3-3.5k. I don't need money, idgaf. I'm here just to snipe it out.
Bitcoin is the ultimate coin if you know jackshit about crypto and what it's true purpose and how it can change the world. It's not a thing to hoard... If you do, you re actually shooting your own foot because not using it will make it fade out. It's a CURRENCY. Read the white paper. People trying to make Bitcoin gold 2.0 are actually killing it.
IMO, the 'true crypto' that Bitcoin was meant to be doesn't exist yet. There's still much to develop on crypto. I'm waiting for that coin that will change the world. As long as people think 'crypto = investment' we're not threyet by a LONG shot

Oh no such missed chances! What will I do now? The only thing that bothers me is that I didn't know of Bitcoin in 2010. I had just inherited 30k and could easily drop 1k into BTC back then. These days it doesn't matter. I really don't care about making 5k into 10k. Would change absolutely nothing in my life because there's nothing that I want. I have a new car, my own place, no debts, I like my job have a good pay, no stress, no bs. I really don't give a fuck. So yeah, sniping it out.

You give no reason why I should use that thing and shouldn't use a paper wallet. you ended up sounding like a shill

Increasingly centralized mining is running it.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:14:37
Instead of explaining why you just ended up sounding like a bad shill.
Address, Key. Literallly all you need in a wallet because THAT'S ALL A CRYPTO WALLET IS. 
Guess which two things paper wallets contain? Or do you people just want to think you're all futuristic and tech savy because you're using these machines?

This was the best choice. Your kid will have a great father (instead of that vile worthless excuse for a woman) that dared call herself a mother). He/she's really lucky to have a father like you. Don't mind the retards here, life's not worth not spending time doing what makes you happy, which for you is being with your kid. Don't EVER fret about the choices you made, just go and be a great dad.

That's a 'false' ego premise. You are already All That Is. You never once were not All There Is. However, you Are All That Is experiencing itself through limitation device called the brain, hence why you can have the paradoxical experience of being 'just you' or 'simple me' even tough you are not just you and simple me. You are me. I am you. Everything is us and we are everything.
It is for that purpose alone that we are all here it seems. To experience that which we are not. Which is not being EVERYTHING and NOTHING - which we (and *literally* everything else in existence) actually are/is. Thus in essence we are here to experience what it's like to not be what we really are. All That Is. 'Godhead' or 'God' to put it simple and mundanely.
All That Is is All That Is. How can it not be?
Namaste ;)

This is called controlled opposition and you guys are playing right in their cards. It is not Bitcoin that will be the one coin to rule them al. It is quite obvious to me that these guys plan to dominate this market and get even MORE MONETARY CASHLESS CONTROL. And guess how you win it? By realizing this. Soon another coin might rise and you guys'll just jump ship. And that coin might be something like XRP or some other heavily centralized coin and you'll be shooting all of us in the foot.
It is not the moon you should care about - it's the fucking ship.

Desktop mobile wallets are exactly tyhre same as a piece of paper cold wallet. They just advertise it as 
GERTR THE DESKTLOP WLLET OF URS NOW FOR SEFETYYU
Don't. Just use them to send BTC to another address that you hold the key to on a PIECE OF PAPER in an envelope in a drawer somewhere. This is what I do.
Use Electrum or [coinb.in]( to send BTC.
Go to bitadress and generate a good random wallet while OFFLINE, then print it OFFLINE and have the xchange send it to that (public) address. First however buy $2 of BTC and try to see if you can learn how to send it around.

But it's not. It just SEEMS complex. It's actually eazy peazy and quite fun to do. Green TXIDs after all the copy and pasting of the hashes make me go mmm.
But yes, I have like €32 invested somewhere on a wallet since last year's crash xD I used that money to take it off of Coinbase to see how this actually works and it is only after learning how everything actually works that I've become really interested in it and not in a money making way but in a secure way to actually own your value.

Yes, put it in the box. Then take it out of the box. Now put it back into the box. Good.

FOMO 'bull run' me thinks. People keep hyping BTC with 
Of course they will tell you that since they have money invested into BTC themselves. This shit happens ALL the time on the stock market.
Be careful.
