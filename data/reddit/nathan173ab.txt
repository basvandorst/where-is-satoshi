1. Buzzword salad.
2. This would mean something if the value you're transferring actually stayed at a consistent value, but it never does.
3. I can access my money any time I want as much as I want.
4. PayPal, also see

People such as yourself keep insisting that Bitcoin is the future of currency and that that's where it's going to get its value, yet all of you are talking about it as if it's a stock, except the stock is not backed by any tangible assets. This is what one would call an economic bubble, and it's going to burst.

Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize. I suppose that must mean he's a great peacemaker right?
Overlooking this argument from authority of yours, the Austrian school hasn't contributed a damn thing to the study of economics since. The movement as it appears seems to be nothing more than a bunch of obnoxious self-centered teens and twenties ranting about how taxes are like rape on the Internet while preaching how logically consistent they think they are.
It's a school of economics as much as astrology is a branch of science or as much as homeopathy is a branch of medicine.

You just referenced Free Domain Radio. You have lost all intellectual credibility.

Austrian school economists? So not really economists at all then right?

Bitcoin tries to pass itself off as a currency, yet most people are treating it like an investment which they hope to trade away later for mainstream currency. How do the Bitcoin fans not see a problem with this?

People who have been here for a *few* months? Sorry, but a few months is not enough to conclude the stability of Bitcoin. If it is to prove itself a mainstream currency, it has to demonstrate stability for many many years. Also, because of its finite nature, it can never be stable and be a mainstream currency. This is why the gold standard was abolished decades ago.

You're right that's not a good answer. PayPal has its issues, but Bitcoin isn't even close to being a substitute. It's too volatile to be a practical medium.

Yet you provide no explanation for this. I will interpret that as concession.

Bitcoin has not done well. It's value cannot stay consistent and those businesses that do adopt it are quick to trade it for *real* currency like USD. These are not the marks of a successful currency.


And who are these "people" you're referring to? This is just a weasel word. Here, let me try. "There are people who believe the world is flat." See how meaningless that is?


Oh okay, so you can't print or borrow your way into prosperity, but you can get your computer to solve meaningless equations into prosperity? Yeah, that Austrian sense is really onto something. would have a field day with you.


The tone was intended to be condescending.

Explain how computers solving useless equations leads to prosperity.


And what will its value be another year later? $300? $800? At one point it was at around $1,200. Explain to me again how this makes sound currency. Heck, it's not even indicative of a currency. You are talking about it as if it's a stock, but with nothing but libertarian fantasies backing it up.
