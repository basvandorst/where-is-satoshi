tbh, it's kind of stressful holding XXX amount of money in your own hands when all you life you have had others hold XXX amount of money at their bank. stop acting like it didn't take you a while to get comfortable/have confidence that your btc is actually your btc and it sits their in your trezor or paperwallet or whatever.

I would go further and say if it's not time sensitive, use the low priority fee. There is much to benefit from this: 1) saves you money 2) holds the door open for higher fee txs to get through 3) if widely implemented, lower tx fees overall.
The blockchain always works and I've never had a tx not be confirmed. peer-to-peer value-transfer is the killer app and bitcoin does that without issue.

If it's slow it's slow. I pay $.02 fee, sometimes next block sometimes next day
Until the network can guarantee confirms in next 2-3 blocks w reasonable fee, bitcoiners shouldn't use it for time sensitive transactions. If you do, it's basically like going out in the rain with no umbrella and complaining that you're getting wet. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:24:23
buy a hundred dollars worth, put it on a desktop wallet (phone wallet can be tricky,not because the apps are bad just fumbling around with a small screen, copy and pasting addresses, getting tx fees where you want them) desktop app or secure browser based best start IMO
Dont buy coffee with it. buy a tshirt or music from an independent muscian. fiddle around with it at first. you should do some research before jumping all in at once. there will be problems, sometimes long confirm times, sometime negative volotility. use the tech so you have some personal experience with it, not just taking others people words on faith or FOMO in to something you havent actually used.
Do not download the entire blockchain. Do that later if you want but use the consumer tools that are available.
if you believe in the technology after using it then scale into it. thousand a month is fairly aggressive. if you buy the first thousand at 999 you;ll probably want to buy the second at 1100 more easily than buying another thousand at 880 unless you actually believe there is a use case and have a long term outlook then you'll realize the difference between 1000 and 500 doesnt really matter.
someone mentioned a binary bet and yes it is, i agree. if somehow it becomes the world currency it wont matter if you average price is 500 1000 or 2500 and it wont happen overnight anyway. 
I feel very comfortable asserting that you should experience bitcoin with money that doesn;t matter. You wouldn't buy a $15000 car without test driving it and you know that's a necessary but losing proposition for the rest of your life. So that's my rambling too much information two cents.

Sure. I'm not talking about what should happen. Im talking what's more likely to happen. Bitcoin will not be world reserve currency in my lifetime(im 44). It might be 100 years from now but I don't think so. More likely one of many currencies, each one carving out a niche that suits it.

no, it helps to be experienced with bitcoin because it's the bitcoin network, the bitcoin protocol and every counterparty transaction is really a bitcoin transaction just with some extra data.
the language used is to create an asset (you decide name, issuance, whether it's divisible or not, and when to lock out further issuances. you can also make it callable at a certain price. 
i have never used the callable function but I think it means you can define a price at which you can call the asset token at a predetermined price (like a call option on a stock) from token holders. 
The DEX (decentralised exchange) is used to trade tokens. Some end up on exchanges, most dont. Like the project OP is planning, there's no need for a centralised exchange like polo, you can just use the DEX.

I would put 1/3 into Bitcoin, 1/3 into a basket of xcp, ripple, dash and maidsafe, and 1/3 into your favorite traditional currency, maybe the Swiss franc. NOT the Iraqi dinar. 
Stocks are stocks. They might go up but the majority of the Dow, the sp 500, even the Russell 2000 companies out profit over people and I don't like being a part of that. 
Bitcoin is fairly liquid so if you need cash you can get dollars in a day or two. I assume preservation of capital is not your priority or you wouldn't be considering crypto.

Bitcoin is fantastic (really the only choice) for peer to peer transactions. It is great, awesome, powerful. For B2C, Bitcoin is a shitty alternative for cash or even visa. 
Because of this, deep discounts are probably the most effective way to increase sales in Bitcoin, tho I doubt that will please management. 
There's also the fact that less than 1% of the population has some Bitcoin and of that 1% most are hodler ticker cheerleaders that don't use Bitcoin as a currency.

If Bitcoin settles back into a stable trading range ( +\- 5% a month) I think counterparty and things like it will get a lot of attention this year. 
I've gone from a couple BTC transactions a week to a dozen or more every day.  I just discovered counterparty over the summer and, so far at least, it works exactly how it's supposed to. 
Forgot what I wanted to say: if costs can be externalized they will be.  It's inevitable. 
Also Bitcoin might not be for everyone in the world. Maybe it becomes a preferred currency for a subset of world population: namely tech types and decentralization peter thiel libertarian types. Still could reach 10X valuation in short term (3-5 years), as such non-BTC txs on blockchain will become even higher percentage of txs than they are now.

I believe bitcoins path to 10X growth is in peer-to-peer value transfer. 
Most of the VC funded Bitcoin companies are not innovative at all; they are brokers of one sort or another. The power of Bitcoin isn't yet being realized. Becoming like visa/PayPal is pointless. The merchant still loses 2-5%, the customer still pays a 2-3% premium, visa still gets their money and the innovative Bitcoin company gets a little bit too. 
What in the hell kind of innovation is this? It's stupid. We've added another intermediary! Yay! But we used Bitcoin. So yay yay! 
Peer to peer will be the growth. When the small business owner (the bodega, the neighborhood bar, the graphic artist you regularly commission from Czech Republic) accepts Bitcoin is when shit will take off. And block size doesn't matter, confirm times don't matter, none of that bullshit matters. 
Relationships built on trust in the real world will feel comfortable using the trustless blockchain to lower costs, cut out middlemen. Small business is 40% of American economy and is leading the way in Bitcoin adoption and real world use.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:17:02
Scale into it. I wouldn't buy all at once. Come up with a plan, maybe buy 200/week for X weeks. With a market order to buy the rest if Bitcoin breaks highs on substantial volume.

it's 100% feasible for an owner-operator or small family run business to use bitcoin without any ancillary services. 
What's not feasible is for an owner-operator or small family run business to enlist help with accepting something that will not improve their top-line, bottom-line or any other line.

Trading is boring when it's not hard. And trading is stressful when it is difficult. Many more difficult days than easy ones. 
If you're working with 10,000 dollars, 1% profit a day is 100 dollars. A job pays better. 
If you want to trade there are much more liquid markets with better UIs and APIs. 
My suggestion is start learning the tech. Run a node, play with block explorers, etc. Earn some BTC as opposed to buying it. 
Alts are a waste of time if capital preservation is high up on your list. Buy 1,000$ of what you like and sit on that if you must have exposure to maidsafe or xmr or etc but those markets even thinner than BTC.

Not only is ACH supported, you can buy at market price when you initiate the ACH. Coinbase makes you wait 3-5 days for the ACH  to actually settle before you can buy( no doubt to push customers to more expensive credit card purchases). 
Coinbase disappoints me because they go beyond AML/KYC requirements. You can tell the culture is one of old guard traditional banking. I switched to Gemini just because I respect what the Winklevi are doing. Putting their own money up and having a history of putting their money where their mouth is. 
You just know that Coinbase bought a bunch of ETH last summer and they might have u loaded it all but my suspicion is that they bought ETH all the way down. That's the problem when you have no rudder (belief system) the wind is in control and you're just on a ride along.

No trolling. Just trying to have a conversation, specifically usability. No one thinks 0.00348000btc is awkward. It's difficult to even look at. When dealing with money most of the world goes two digits to the right of the decimal. So the above amount of BTC would be 3,480 satoshis. The second looks easier to deal with. But I'm listening if anyone has something constructive to say. Why is current practice used as explanation? If it's better tell me why.

So the internet will be secure and safe as the legacy system falls apart? Naive. I think of the internet as a pressure relief valve, revolution wont come until it's taken away. 
Add: Bitcoin could go to 100 billion and still be a guppy in the seas of international finance.

like it makes a 51% attack easier? because the difficulty would go down? I have to take the tech guys' word for it. I work with control systems and thought those adjustments would be similiar to tuning a PID loop. I guess not. I really need to learn more about the actual tech

Question: what, if any, effect would SegWit have on storj, bitcrystals, XCP and xcp created assets in general. Not price predictions I mean technical matters. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:02:28
i have to agree. 
the one thing that comes to mind is that ive stopped being concerned about confirmation times. 
maybe because the underlying value of what i'm transferring isnt a whole lot (real world value: nil) or maybe its because im a more experienced bitcoin user or both but the blockchain uses for me aren't all that time sensitive and, consequently, confirmation times aren't my priority at the moment.
I am using the network (sending a dozen or more tx a day) more now than ever. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:26:14
I used to use Coinbase, my fills went from pretty good to bad to high of day when buying to low of day when selling. (I buy crypto daily). I use Gemini now (their auction if buying more than 1 BTC) and I've had good experience. 
Disclaimer: I've put ~3,000$ into rarepepes and XCP the last month (stayed away from ETH and ETC). Yes I'm pushing ancillary assets that use THE blockchain. Still a BTC Maximilist! ☹️️������

I've spent 2.5 BTC on Pepes and, mark to market, they're worth 7 BTC. Very illiquid tho. More fun than GTA! 
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:03:58
Inflation (and other economic troubles) would breed fear and I don't know how much price appreciation could happen in BTC in a fearful market. It might do great. I just think BTC is more likely to go "parabolic" if the world economy goes into a Japan like stagflation rather than a crash and recovery type situation.

If the ledger is like the trezor it's just hold the private keys, all data, utxo, address balances and history are stored on blockchain and the private keys give you the ability to transfer funds to another address. 
Am I misunderstanding something? 
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:35:52
I use IndieSquare for mobile and counterwallet.io desktop. I'm trying out rarepepewallet.com, I like it. The pepecash markets are less liquid than the xcp markets (which is saying a lot). I have some bids out in pepecash but my xcp bids get filled A LOT easier.
Haven't done anything with book of orbs yet. I thought Trump winning would be a sort of catalyst. 
What would be cool? A device that hangs on your wall that queries an XCP address and displays the rarepepes in that wallet, along with asset info, 1 of 133 or last price traded.  
I bought XCP for 2 reasons: it uses Bitcoin network (one of the most valuable networks on the planet so somehow XCP has some worth) and to buy pepes. If xcp hadn't cut in half my pepes would be worth 13 or 14 BTC instead of ~7. Still not bad for putting in 2.5 BTC. 
95% of time put in a bid 1/3 or less than the best offer and hope someone sells to you. 5% of the time it's mispriced and I'll just take the offer. I do not recommend dabbling in the Pepe markets unless you can lose $ without it hurting AND you don't need to sell for 18 months at least. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:14:09
1) protection from runaway inflation 
2) peer to peer value transfer
3) an asymmetric bet to the upside
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:04:21
i had to sell ~90% of my BTC recently. (life)  I was despondent as it took me 12 months to accumulate. I had ~3 BTC left and have plowed most of it into pepe's. I read or heard that pepes will soon trade in BTC, dont know about that but pepe has turned my frown upside down. it's at least fun and (because not much money) no stress.
another use case for the blockchain! I've probably done 800 xcp transactions in the last 6 weeks. (some have taken 24 hours to confirm - i pay .0001 btc) but no issues. Outside of exchange buys, I'd guesstimate that I've done a dozen or two BTC transactions the last year. so blockchain spam? sure but if the blockchain cant handle pepe (or other assets), it wont handle widespread adoption anyway.

It's not a fashion statement: it's an ethos. Punk, I mean and Bitcoin is punk and I want it to stay punk: decentralized (no authority), it's peertopeer (no middlemen necessary), it's trustless(no judgement calls just math). The biggest headache is actually getting $$ into BTC and the market will find a way to widen that avenue. The venture capitalists came in and put millions of dollars into something they don't fully understand. 
VC: what the fuck? 
Bitcoiners: haha, you put money into something so new nobody fully understands the consequences. 
VC: raise margins, we gotta show growth tho, ok, fuck all our customers and run them off. 
Bitcoiners: um you're acting like a bank, we don't need banks, GTFO of here. 
VC: shit, how do we make $ off this. 
Bitcoiners; you can't BC you're not needed. 
VC: fuck you, we'll turn it into something we can make $$ on. 
. . . And the Bitcoin community has been mired in the block size debate for 2 years?

21.co's email/task thing is great and it's also a tiny bit of what they're doing. 
Buzzwords aside, IoT will be huge and that is where Bitcoin comes in to play. It's a visionary company. Don't really understand why OP gives af about someone else's investment. He's prob disappointed because he's not making gobs of Bitcoin despite taking 2 minutes to set up a 21 account ��
Add: I guess should've read the comments
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:39:01
I don't believe the use case is to use IoT devices to mine Bitcoin. It's meant to monetize information and big data collected from IoT and pay using picopayments, payment channels, etc. 
Has nothing to do with mining in the big picture. 
Tho 21 offers a mining device,  it's just for hobbyists (maybe developers) and it's unwise to expect any mining earnings from the machine. 
Check out 21's APIs, it's really cool shit. 21 isn't meant to be antminer or slushpool or any other Bitcoin company. It's a new thing.

Bitcoin has barely started to chip away at the modern financial system. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:09:36
In the big picture (or long run) I think bitcoin will bring people closer together as intermediaries are bypassed necessitating trust between you and me. Transactions will continue to be trustless but that just enables the transfer. The transaction itself is negotiated between two parties outside of bitcoin. Bitcoin is just the method for settling up.

Ok, I think I understand. Using Bitcoin as a substitute for a dollar or a euro (any traditional currency) isn't any better, and in some cases actually worse, than just using fiat. 
In the other hand, doing things that can only be done in bitcoin is the real world use case and people all over the world are already doing business using the blockchain. Maybe Bitcoin isn't for you?

selling at all time highs is kind of stupid - obviously assets have to break all time highs to make new all time highs - that being said im balls deep in crypto and sold almost everything the last couple days - have money ready to go if bitcoin breaks 3K or if it goes down to old highs - 1350-1100.
but i have a bitcoin based business so i have plenty of exposure to both the upside and downside.

i agree. if the mempool was extremely backlogged because of a coordinated "spam" attack they've either given up (it's just too expensive) or they feel like they've accomplished what they set out to 
i'm not convinced of either. the worst case IMO is that mempool backlog will go crazy again when/if price goes back to 2750
