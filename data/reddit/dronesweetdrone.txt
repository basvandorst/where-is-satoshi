A crypto enthusiast who thinks working for the feds is desirable. That's an interesting juxtaposition. As for him being a hero to adolescents, I think you underestimate how history latches on to images like that of what he did. This guy is going to be remembered long after most of us die and frankly, Congress can go take a hike. Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.

So salty. He isn't my hero. You need to learn how to read critically. I'm just saying he is going to be in history books. I'm not sure who my "heros" would be. Abraham Lincoln probably.

$50B is a tiny market cap. still plenty of time to buy

Good point. I cede the point to your LOL and ad hominem. I'm just a guy who loves history. This guy will be remembered. Ever heard the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? How many good pictures are there of Bitcoin's rise? Not many.

I'm sorry, I don't know you or your post history here, but politely this is a totally ludicrous statement. Nobody knows where Bitcoin or crypto will go as a whole, but if you think it has seen anything close to it's potential at this point, you don't know much about crypto, economics or both.
Bitcoin's market cap is currently 50B. That is 20B less than Uber, a ridesharing pyramid scheme. Bitcoin's market cap could be in the trillions if not tens of trillions in our lifetime, if it gains a fraction of the sort of traction gold has as a reserve currency. Alt coins may compliment Bitcoin and also see massive gains, but if you think Bitcoin has maxed out it's potential you are woefully mistaken. Personally, I think bitcoin has officially hit 1% of it's potential. We have only just begun. I would go into it more here, but there are books like Digital Gold or The Age of Cryptocurrency that you can read.

Perhaps, still he found a new job so apparently it didn't hurt him that bad.

Also, he basically became the "tank man" of bitcoin. Guys gonna be in textbooks and documentaries and on magazine cover one day. What's one job? If he is connected enough o get that close to Janet Yellen, the second most important person in the world, I am pretty sure he will land on his feet.

Bitcoin is like God. Those who have faith are blessed. Lol I'm atheist though, so... Bitcoin is God
