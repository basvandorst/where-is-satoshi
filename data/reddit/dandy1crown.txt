It looks like this will be the biggest bank very soon not the second!

If anything they will make their own and call it FaceChain, BlockFace, BlockBook, FaceBlock, FaceChain, CryptoBook, or maybe CryptoFace

This is certainly a change of tone - a few banks have been blocking transfers while South Korean government is publicly saying that 6 banks will be prepared to service cryptocurrency exchanges this month.
I can see South Korea becoming the new Japan for cryptocurrencies once they iron out the edges.
Congratulations to those who survived the dip!

That's pretty awesome. I hope that student held onto it and didn't spend it on 'stuff'.
Love hearing about interesting stories involving crypto.

Cryptocurrency makes it profitable to reduce energy costs. Crypto has already accelerated the pace of GPU improvements. Why not power efficiency improvements?

Now that's an interesting example. Worth to note anything can happen and people adopting Bcash/alts instead btc... does not mean long-term solution, if things change.

bitcoins worth 1 Million? Sounds heavy! If you need someone to help you carry those coins, i'll be your man!

100 billion USD left the crypto markets in the last 24 hours. What we are seeing is institutional investors and super rich bastards locking in long term capital gains before the end of the calendar year.
we may not see a symmetrical recovery after this and my guess is not every crypto is going to rebound the same. these investors will re evaluate their allocations and buy those cryptos that make the most sense

Can you add a search function to filter coins by their abbreviations? For example, if you were to add a chart for Litecoin you could simply enter "LTC" instead of having to type the full name. I believe a lot of people would appreciate such a feature.
