great advice OP.  Theres going to be many more ups and downs before we get this thing to go where we want (100k+).  Hope people can handle that

best thing I ever did was convert my ether and lite coin for some more btc 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:43:49
am I the only one checking the price literally every 15 minutes?

We are so spoiled. 100 dollar increases mean nothing anymore. Tough life we have

I could be wrong but it looks like coinbase?  In any event, congrats OP!  Hope you held on to them

a girl offered me a bj last night for .35 btc.  I said hell nah, I'm going to the moon

god im so glad i bought a couple in 2013 and completely forgot about my coinbase account for 3 years, after the value plummeted.  What an exciting time we live in!

Bitcoin makes up the majority of my portfolio but you really should look into etherum and other blockchain based platforms.  Blockchain is the future
