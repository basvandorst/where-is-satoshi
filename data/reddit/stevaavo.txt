Forgive me, I'm an engineer, I don't know math.

Oh no, nothing so safety-critical as that.  Just a mechanical engineer.  We design bridges and explosive ordinance and such.
(not actually what I design)

I just found this official translation on Caixin's English-language site:

Here's a link to the original Chinese copy written by Caixin (put through Google Translate):

Unfortunately I haven't, though I'm keeping my eyes peeled :-/
It doesn't look like any big news sources have picked up on the post to the People's Central Bank website yet.  The only article I can find is from this crypto news site, which I haven't heard of before:

***CORRECTION:*** **This post is actually just the English translation of Monday's ICO ban, posted a few days after the original Chinese announcement.  In reality, the People's Central Bank has made no new announcements today.  If you follow this link to the original Chinese version of this announcement, you can see it is actually dated September 4: 
TLDR: Exchanges are forbidden from allowing their users to trade ICO tokens.  As long as exchanges do not deal in ICO tokens, they are permitted to continue trading CNY fiat for cryptocurrency.
This is essentially a strengthening of the anti-ICO regulations announced earlier this week.  It is not the ban on bitcoin trading that we feared was coming.

The new regulations prevent exchanges from dealing in ICO tokens.  Exchanges that do not allow their users to trade ICO tokens should be OK.
However, the language is unclear as to whether exchanges will be retroactively considered to be in violation of banking regulations.

Hey Genghis.  I believe that is actually an article published earlier this morning, in which Caixin speculated on the contents of the regulations that the central bank was going to announce.
Now that the central bank has actually announced the regulations, it looks like we're out of the woods... for now.

This is a very good point, many of these articles don't support the new rumor.
Still, I believe the primary source of these rumors is the Caixin article, which stands (at least as far as its date is concerned):

The threat sounds a little more legit than the author from allcryptocurrencies.news is implying.

Oof... that's a scary datapoint.  Let's hope they got it wrong this time.

The translation is confusing, but I don't think that's quite true.  If you track backward in those sentences, you see that the "virtual currency" limitations are only applied to exchanges that are trading in "coin offerings".  For example, the biggest limitation is imposed in section 3, and it specifies:
