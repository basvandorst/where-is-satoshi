Look into ETFs

Ohhhh right. I'm on mobile. For some reason I thought smile links had the charity associated with the link

I decided to buy $200 worth of Bitcoin using a credit card on this sketchy website. Needed to send a pic of my face holding my ID. Weirdest thing ever and felt like I was getting scammed.

What charity are those smile proceeds going to?

Well at least you're honest with the community... Respect

While I do think that getting celebrities to spread the word about bitcoin can help to strengthen the currency and its value, I don't think Lebron James is the best bet when it comes to getting celebrities to promote something such as a currency.
We should be focused on reaching out and talking to successful small business owners. With the support of more and more "small" figures in the business world there's no doubt in my mind that eventually corporate businesses and retailers will follow suit.
The adoption of bitcoin is very interesting. It seems that the most effective way is to start with the small fish and hopefully create a big enough wave in the water to get the bigger fish to latch on to this idea and follow suit.

As it stands right now, I think that bitcoin is more useful for small business owners. Unless you're paid in bitcoin it's kind of hard to obtain them. Small purchases aren't really worth it, and those living in situations such as this probably have a lot more on their mind than turning to a virtual currency.
Maybe in time this will change and Bitcoin will prove to be helpful to people such as these.

This is great. It sparks up conversation about Bitcoin as well as providing convenience of being able to purchase these pieces of art without worrying about currency conversion.
They have a great page on their site about why they chose to accept virtual currencies as their method of payment:

You'll get an exact date right before you confirm your purchase. I put in an order a few hours ago and it told me that the purchase would go through and that I'd get my coins on Monday, July 8. This was all before hitting confirm, so if that's too long to wait you have an option to cancel.

Just donated $5 via coinbase! Hope it goes through :).

BitInstant support seems to be struggling lately. Although I completely disagree with your opinion that they are not running a legit operation. Tons of people, myself included, have never had a problem with them. They always seem to come through, even though it may not be anywhere close the time frame you were quoted or made to believe.
I imagine that they're receiving a crap load of unwanted attention from governments around the world. They've become a huge player in the day to day business of bitcoins. Give them time to get their shit together. Demand for and attention to bitcoins is at the highest level it has ever been. With that comes an increase in the amount of bitcoins people are looking to purchase.
Bitinstant is probably facing increasing demand from customers, and along with its new site rollout came a few bugs as well. Give it time. Check out other ways of getting bitcoins, and come back when things with Bitinstant get back to normal.

My friend worked for D'Angelo Grilled Sandwhiches for about a year during high school. They paid him by loading up a prepaid bank card with his paycheck every week. I always thought that this was a shoddy, rude way of paying people, especially for a large business name such as D'Angelo's. My poor friend wasn't even able to withdrawal the money from an ATM without paying a $5 fee on top of whatever the ATM was charging him.
That's just plain cruel.

I totally agree with you. But like you said, until there is little to no learning curve and barrier to entry, bitcoin will remain a secondary currency.

Oh great, another BTC gambling site...
I like this except you need to send BTC over the network each and every bet. A wallet system should be implemented wherein you send a bulk amount of BTC and be able to choose your bet and draw on that temporary wallet you submitted bitcoins to.
