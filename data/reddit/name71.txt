Thanks for proving my point.

It's kind of weird to think that at some point hundreds or thousands of years in the future we will probably just start creating land like in Minecraft rather than finding planets to live on. And this land will just orbit around a stable star or something.
Well at least we got kitten videos and endless porn. Not as good as irl space Minecraft, but not nearly as shitty as what people had to live with historically.

OK my op was hyperbolic. What I should have said is something along the lines of: The content is clearly organized and structured by an adult, directed by an adult, spaced out and worded like an adult. That 12 year old might be responsible for 60% of the words in that speech, but 0% of the "content".
Anyway, I don't want to rain on either her or her dad's parade or anything. Her dad has her interested in something, and they are doing research &amp; speeches together about it. That's a good thing.

Does *Gresham's law* also require a physical money/currency as in how described it above? Like.... is his definition of bad money, money that can be altered to have more value by a simple process; like cutting a $20 bill in half and having an authority recognize that as two $20 bills now?

I am aware of the new-ish Airport one of them built out on the ocean by creating land out of huge ass boulders and soil I believe! But I meant like... huuuuuge lands. Moon sized lands.

Bitcoin's success is derived entirely from Bitcoin's success, which itself was originally formed from Bitcoin's success.

That's another way of saying communism! Unless you believe that the people of Cuba and North Korea aren't under an imperial system of control???

Quantum computers have no effect on symmetrical cryptography nor one-way hashes, since both are completely void of mathematics, and only contain very simple primitive logical operations. For example, in an SPN, all that really happens is bits are grouped together, swapped around using a lookup-table, and then broken back up into individual bits and mixed around with each other. At some point the key needs to be mixed in. This is called a "round" and typically happens many many times until it's SAC/GAC goals are achieved.

Er no, "penny" is the name of the physical coin, a "cent" is how much it's worth. All American's I know call them pennies...
Also a quick Google search shows Americans are very familiar with the term penny.
And Google also mentions (no idea if it's true) the term "penny" means 1/100th of a nations currency and dates back pretty far in history.

* (f) iPhone: Since it would be in mint condition, 1000 years from now it's value as a working collectible would be insanely huge. I think it's way more likely a working item from now would be worth more than a single bitcoin, so I am not picking (a) for this reason.
* (e) Loaded gun: Both for (f) reasons (working item from 1000 years ago = value), and because it may provide temporary safety while I figure out what in the fuck it's like to live on Earth 1000 years from now lolol

No of course not, that's silly. I think Cuba and North Korea are prime examples of communism and why it's a terrible idea.

Sure, there is also a lot of silver content in dimes/quarters before 1968 I've heard. They're worth around 8x their face value, so a dime has about 80 cents worth of silver and a quarter about $2. I've been told that anyway by a coin person, I don't know if it's actually true.

You are not. C is still by far the most used language for everything important. It runs almost all OS's. Most OS's only provide a C API for device driver development simply because all other languages have proven to be unsafe for such tasks. Safety related things like medicine, military, and aerospace all rely on C. The ISS runs on C. Almost the entire planet's encryption security is provided by [OpenSSL]( and it's written in C.
Rust is the current garbage-language fad that will get replaced when then next garbage-language fad inevitably comes along. Meanwhile.. the good coders will continue to use ASM and C to run the worlds entire infrastructure &amp; communication systems.

BTC.com does not have 31% of the hashrate. BTC is a temporary alliance of individuals formed in order to make it more convenient to mine bitcoins. The alliance can break up at any time. Thus.. BTC.com does not have any hashrate other than what it physically owns. If BTC.com gets 51% of the hashrate... why would those individuals who ultimately make up that 51% want to attack themselves and their own financial market?

Same, this is pretty gross and not one word that 12 year old said was her own. That speech was written by multiple adults, and this is some grade-A propaganda.

But it wouldn't be from 1,000 years ago. It's like re-making a golden amulet after something that is 5,000 years old. It's not going to be worth as much as the original 5,000 year old golden amulet. It's just going to be worth it's weight in gold, plus extra because it's formed into a cool looking shape. But it wont have that collectors value of the 5,000 year old amulet.

In my opinion, you are aged 18-22, you took 2 light programming classes in high school, and now you are just repeating what other idiot programmers have repeat on the internet since the 1980's on coder BBS's.
C++ is garbage. It's slow. It's incredibly slow. You would know this if you were a real programmer instead of an idiot. Download any debugger, any debugger at all, and read the ASM of the code your C++ compiler generates. Look at all of the gpr's that can't be used for your code because they need to hold vtbl's and \*this pointers. Look at those glorious stack frames and cry at the sight of those dozens of cpu cycles and missed cache hits that are choked away into the blackhole abyss of C++ abstraction. It doesn't matter how much of a God you are at C++ programming when the compiler itself is always always always going to generate slow ASM code. A lot of core parts of C++ are implemented through **run-time virtualization** which means there is always going to be wasted clock cycles and needless cache misses on stupid shit that isn't needed to accomplish the goal. C++ was designed so idiots in factories could pump out mediocre software en-masse. C++ is the Michael Bay of software languages. It's to get money back for investors from idiots who like to spend money on shitty software (cough EA). C++ is one of the best languages for exploiting retarded consumers and getting money from them. Those $60 games you don't like? Those were made in C++.
