We also have drive thru liquor stores.

I'd forgotten about that!

Could you clarify this a bit? What status are you referring to? How is the other user notified about anything? If I send the bitcoins, do I click on the link that you're referring to, or is this link something that the other user will see? If it's something that I'm supposed to click on, I can't seem to find the link that you're referring to.  I'm just a bit confused about it all and I'm sure that everyone would appreciate a bit more detail about this.

I was looking for the same link in my email as well. Of course, you can't even log into their site right now, so I have no idea how to "confirm" my order.

Sent! I can't see any downside to a company like WU adopting bitcoin as a means of transfer. It would only give more validity to using it as a standard currency.

There wasn't one, at least not that I saw.

42.5 now!

Figures that this would happen the same day that I *finally* received my order from BFL.

Give it some time. Even with the new servers, they're bound to be overloaded right now since everyone in the world that is into bitcoin has been waiting for this exact time to hit! Things are going to be crazy for quite some time, so either buy, sell, or wait. It's up to you.

I got lucky yesterday and sold less than 1/6 of my coins at $255, which covered my initial investment. Now I'm just going to spend a few here and there, let the rest of them ride, and see what happens!

They'd been bugging me for days. I finally answered and told them I could only donate in bitcoin. Don't be a dick.

~540 Mhash/sec on my 7970. I'm running it 24/7 on my work PC, so no electricity bills and it keeps my office nice and warm in the winter!
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:59:57
I just wish there were more places to spend my coins!
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:23:07
I agree with everything you said. I switched my 7970 rig to LTC mining a month ago for the same reasons. I think it will get hyped up and maybe I'll get a few more bucks out of my old mining rig. It will never compete with BTC though.

How would increase fraud? 
Bitcoins are already used to purchase things. I just bought a set of springs for my car using bitcoins, and before that, I used them to buy an intake. I'd buy everything with bitcoins if I could.
