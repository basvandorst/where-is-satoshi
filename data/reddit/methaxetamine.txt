I agree, coinbase is the biggest obstacle.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:59:31
You can use segwit already.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:59:10
Because the price will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:40:44
Lower fees, faster transfers?
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:24:39
I bet they're whales making bitcoin really clogged and inefficient to keep the price down while they accumulate.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:18
Still better than inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:39:38
Why not? Segwit isn't long term either. None of them are. They scale as needed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:55:08
It was 20  cents a week ago. Its 93 cents now, despite the crash, so the sats went up while BTC was crashing. Plus by that logic it should have been crashing as there were millions being dumped. Nope. at least a 5x return is very, very good.

I noticed they don't have money problems but instead they have strange problems otherwise. Drug addiction is very common, many of them go to rehab. They have problems that I think I cannot relate to as easily, not that I don't try.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:36
If you use segwit it is fast. If you use coinbase you don't get segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:12:14
Would you like lower fees? Free transfers?

ok how to buy bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:39
Just wondering, why not use 133mb blocks to prepare for worldwide usage? Is it bad?

They're basically like online collector's items at that point.

I saw they made more tether last week. Got a little bitcoin, the price pumped.
It happens every time. Hes not wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:51
Nice job! See you when the knife is finished falling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:01:32
That cheap? Personally I think it might be a hedge against the USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:00
What does that have to do with homes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:51:52
Are you one of them?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:08:20
Then people will buy it, they saw the 'big' dip from nearly 20k to 16.5k and think "oh shit, that was the amount of BCH" and continue to pay coinbase for ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:29:30
Don't be fooled by big mattress. They're all scams. Mattresses are dirty, never get washed, permanent magnets for back pain, dust mites, urine/semen/blood from the springs and overpriced on top of that.
Sleep in a hammock or on the floor with a blanket/rug or sleeping bag. You can wash all of those, they are ultra portable, you will save money and time. 
I recommend never using a bed ever again. They're just scams the same way toothbrushes are.

Fun fact: both the wachowski brothers are transgender now, they're the wachowski sisters.

They made larger blocks. Whats wrong with larger blocks? Its fast and cheap to transfer. Its not a bandage. It solves a real world problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:52:42
Premined? Everyone got a free airdrop.

n00bs are dumb. Its not anyone's fault but their own they throw money at something they don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:59:51
I don't think anyone has that issue. They're holding it in the exchanges since they don't know what it is, they just see $$$
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:49
Yes it can be another mt gox.
Should you worry? Maybe. I think it may be too big to fail now.

You can't.

Low? Bitcoin over 15k. I might have lost money from buying at the peak but low? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:08:22
Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:04:41
Oh sorry I meant that it isn't a large concern for the people who panic. I've never had that happen to me, I don't use bitcoin to transfer, only to store value. I use eth to transfer and then change it back.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:57:29
bcash is not the threat that tether is. all bitcoin needs to do is add larger  blocks. bcash solves a real issue: the cost of the bitcoin transaction. lightning network and sidechain have been in talks for years.
if this will finally cause some changes: good. all bitcoin needs is larger blocks and then bcash will lose its appeal to more people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:04
How many PC can mine bitcoin? Why has it not switched to scrypt?
See my point? Its already centralized in China.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:47:41
How is it trash? They have similar gains.
Why do you guys hate each other? I have a little of both.

Yet we can do nothing about it. :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:32
Did you hold bitcoin when it forked?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:34:15
Heard of blockstream?
I feel like money is corrupting the whole crypto community.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:26:52
You shouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:59:44
Fees. Significantly lower fees. Free transfers as well (to a point, maybe 10 or 30).
Why give coinbase all your money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:06:46
Exchanges have your info.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:26:15
Me neither. But here are some options:


1. Nobody gets their house foreclosed for no reason dude. They do impose taxes, and if you don't get it sold to you, whats the issue?


2. Really? Are you tied to a house forever? Some people travel and use it for airbnb.


3. Bitcoin may go to zero. Maybes don't help. 
Your issues are semi legitimate concerns, I doubt there will be a  foreclosure for no reason.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:04:34
The poor as well. They are too busy working to hear about it or do anything about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:39:58
Nice dude. Very happy for you!! Its good to hold bitcoin just for the inevitable forks.
I don't know where you got the idea that there was a 20% premine (can you tell me who told you that actually? Its really bad misinformation), but with that 6k you can buy back into BTC (maybe you will have 9k in a few days) or maybe hedge it in BCH (gold I have no hope in at all). 
There will be more airdrops. Don't forget to look for stellar lumens!  
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:03:32
What is making me panic is tether. Fuck tether.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:44
bitcoin is centralized in china though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:21
There is little reason to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:46:47
I think of it like linux. More choice isn't bad. BTC takes forever to make changes. Right now there are few miners on it BCH (less $$). Bitcoin gold I have just because I have bitcoin but I don't like it because its premined and its not open source.
I am pro larger blocks, but I hold bitcoin because I feel like its the 'true bitcoin'. If bitcoin had larger blocks I think bcash would go away, its basically one line that changed right? Its already centralized in China so I don't think it'll make a big difference.
With that being said, I still use BTC to store value, the airdropped BCH is the only one I have of it.


Def see your point. Do you think we should have larger blocks? I don't know much about segwit, and blockstream, but I heard its like visa trying to take over transactions so its proprietary. Once theres a good sidechain, BCH may go away, and even the BCH people will be happy with faster cheaper transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:07:21
Why are you using coinbase? Its the worst exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:52:00
bcash has similar gains to btc and has low fees. personally I hold onto both and seeing my old transactions I'm a little mad I had to pay so much to send it, and it still was slow.
right now i just convert to eth and then reconvert it back, still cheaper than using btc's slow rates.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:57
Cashing out? HAHAHA turn my crypto gains into monopoly money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:48:01
Shouldn't we worry about the present though? Bitcoin is about controlling your own money, not about it being decentralized. Ripple is what I think of, bitcoin is deflationary, which isn't at all like fiat.
The issue is that I don't see any problems going on like that with BCH. The fees are low. It is just bitcoin with larger blocks. 
Segwit is a larger block, but it isn't as large as BCH's. 
I also don't know what the benefit of running a full node is. Donating to a few public servers would preserve integrity if its an issue, and everyone can run partial nodes. 
If coinbase used segwit I doubt we'd have much of an issue tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:41
Like chinese miners don't centralize BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:36
gdax is the same company but lower transfer fees

Because its not trustless. I didn't say why I sent money, and it still works.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:03:57
So world currency? Imagine if everyone was stuck on bitcoin... $20 to $7 transaction fees.. who would choose that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:46:42
Quality? Its slow as shit. I'm all for keeping it but I change it to eth then reconvert it later.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:20
Why doesn't BTC switch to scrypt? A thought experiment would be what to do if a 51% attack occurs. Would we fork it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:22
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:12:47
Why does that matter? Will that make the exchange worst?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:27:31
I told you!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:05:53
I have never seen gemini go down. When people were complaining about cb, I logged onto gemini with no issues.
Again, I have never seen it go down. It may have, but I have never seen such a thing happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:32:26


Bro the ship has sailed once it passed the 1k mark, which was already a stretch for a lot of people. Most people see 2 bitcoin, one is 3k and the other is 16k. They think the 3k will go to 16k in a few months.
The inequality is already apparent. Most people cannot get into bitcoin (anymore, or ever for a lot of even poorer people).
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:36
Oh yes I completely agree! I feel like it has a real world usage though, I'd love faster transactions and bigger blocks on BTC more than BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:32:36
buying bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:19:41


A solution now would be great. Deploying the LN now would be wonderful.
My question is why not do it then? China already centralizes bitcoin. There is no doubt that already happened. The nodes won't make a difference. Its costing $20 for a reasonable speed, $7 for one in an hour, and if you mess with the fee yourself you can lose the transaction for a while. 
Some people hold bitcoin. Most people who want to use it realize they cannot use it in a reasonable amount of time without being slaughtered by the fees.
So far, my solution has been to convert to eth and change it back. Its impossible to send bitcoin fast without being raped by fees.

Doesn't the update double the block size as well?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:00:50
It's why I don't get why they didn't just up the blocks or make it scalable. There's a hard fork for scaling for miners but I don't see that happening. Is there a way to code it so that blocks can get larger as there is more congestion?
Thanks for explaining it. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:12:21
Would a block size update have gone that as well? I read a bit on it, I have like .23btc and .23bcc since the fork. I'm trying to understand what it does and why
