Its probably because there is no recourse for mistakes, sent  your mortgage payment to the wrong address, lost forever. Also bitcoin would not be well suited to the needs of the market. The price fluctuates too much in relation to the needs of the economy. The current monetary supply can be changed over time to ensure a stable price of goods. When the economy grows the monetary supply grows.

This is not specific to a marketplace. Any decentralized system will be more wasteful when compared to a centralized one. "Running a node" for each person is less efficient than a centralized system where one server can service many users and it is in an location where power and air conditioning are cheap.

The advantage to bitcoin is that you can buy things the Chinese government would not allow, like illegal drugs.
