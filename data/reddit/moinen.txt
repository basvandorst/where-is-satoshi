Let's see the lag just a tip

Now there is a third transaction of 0.0001 BTC. These better not be hints, because anyone could send money and mess up the sequence.

What this man is saying is true in my experience when it comes to personal computers and some other things, but this is in ways changing with the popularity of smart phones and tablets, and when it comes to electronic payments Japan is in many ways ahead of many other countries.

What I've gathered so far:
* There are 124 characters in the picture. Amongst them, a bitcoin address 1HXUobwcB19cGDrghuh42HDdJdJvrJUEra.
* The address contains 1.41613221 BTC at the moment. At least two of the transactions seem to be outside contributions to the pot, with attached public notes containing advertising.
* The goal of the puzzle is to find the private key to the address. A private key is 51 characters, starting with "5". It must not contain characters O, 0, I, l.
* 21 characters before the address, 69 after it. Directly after the addres, there is a O or a 0, and a second one near the bottom, as well as an "I". Two "5"s can be found at different positions.
* Two figures in the picture are the developers of Dark Wallet, the logo of which is displayed also. I believe this to not be a direct part of the puzzle at this stage.
* The unoccupied cells have colored dots in them. Mostly green and red, although pale yellow and one blue dot can be found. These seem likely to be a part of the puzzle.
* I do not believe the color of the cells themselves to be a part of the puzzle, as there are many shades that could be hard to distinguish.
* Colors of the letters might have meaning. Some of their shades are also a bit hard to discern.
* Position and spacing of letters seems likely to be meaningful
* The final solution will be a 51-character private key, but as of now, we still have 90 characters and many other forms of information unaccounted for. It is unlikely that the riddler has included extraneous characters, thus I believe that there are multiple steps left until the private key. I wouldn't be surprised if decrypting some of the characters revealed a hint to a next step.
* It is not out of the question that hints exist outside what is displayed in the picture. I have checked the EXIF data of the image, but found nothing. The image was posted by OP at both twitter and imgur, both of which likely strip such metadata, as well as any pixel-level steganography.
* The transactions to the bitcoin address could easily contain hints, and some of the values are interesting, containing only ones and zeros.

It currently has two transactions, 1.111 BTC + 0.1010101 BTC = 1.2120101 BTC. Could be just the riddler having fun with ones and zeros, or could be a hint.

Also, I'm not sure of the "o" on row 3. It could be a oddly colored dot. There are two similiarly two-colored dots on row 8. (seconds from left and the right-most)

I know something about cracking partial QR codes. I can't watch the video right now, does anyone know how much bitcoin is in the address? Would it be worth it?

I think you're already confusing bits and bytes in your comment about how confusing "bit" is.

A very simple and cheap device with no internet connection can listen to the blockchain over radio to check if somebody has sent money to it's own address. This is great for vending machines, parking meters, any bitcoin-operated devices out there.
The payer must still have an internet connection, but the payee no longer needs to have a cable or a sim card.

Here's the code transcribed so you don't have to do what I did (I hope I caught all):

1MILK... would indeed be difficult, as it is not a valid address ;)
No I, l, O or 0 in bitcoin addresses, to avoid visual ambiguity.

Hi 500 bits

Explanation for spooky morphing background objects: OP shot the frames freehand at slightly different anges, and had photoshop auto-align them so the table wouldn't move.
