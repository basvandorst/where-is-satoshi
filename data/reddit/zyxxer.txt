Bloomberg says the open interest is just 1.1 mm USD. If my calculation is correct, the total amount of USD traded since inception is around 38 mm USD. Does anyone have an idea what might explain this mismatch?
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:19:56
Some quick back of the envelope calculations show that the figures presented here cannot be true.
If really 10mm USD of purchases were made per day, that would translate into 500,000 transactions per day, assuming an average purchase price of 20 USD. In reality, we have about 80,000 transactions per day, and it is probably save to assume that far less than 50% of these stem from actual purchases.
Second, selling 10mm USD worth of bitcoin equals selling 30,000 bitcoin a day. The average total daily trading volume of all bitcoin exchanges put together was around 25,000 bitcoin a day in the last 90 days (excluding exchanges who do not charge transaction fees). Again, it is probably save to assume that only a fraction of these 25,000 bitcoin traded are actual sales from merchants.

Ok thanks. I used another browser and could then see their order book on the main page. Very thin still and what is there seems to be algo as it moves around all the time. But good to have a potentially reliable alternative in the UK

If you think about it for a second, the number of coins being bought and sold is always exactly equal.
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:46:41
Here we go. Don't like the question but don't want to argue why it is not a valid question? Next best thing is to criticise the way the question was asked. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:16:21
Well the startup activity certainly is something that could get the ball rolling. What's the number of transaction per second again that the protocol can support? Wasn't it around 10? So it should be able to scale to 900k per day as is now? Wonder how the efforts to increase the limit are doing.
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:37:36
That's exactly the reply I was not looking for :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:57:30
Because reformatting the chart will not change the fact that here is little growth in the last 6 months
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:40:32
Why do you assume people are shorting btc in a noteworthy amount? AFAIK that not even technically possible.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:34:32
That is correct. It is delaying a filing for insolvency and is a criminal offence in most parts of the world, and I am sure in the US, too.
@_date: 2015-11-08 14:55:42
So that still happened a couple of months after it happened to me? Well, then it is probably safe to say that this happened many other times also and they did not always get the BTC back. So I'd assume by now they are bust.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:31:39
lol. You should become a prop trader

Back in Dec 2013, when BTC was at 1,000, I was able to withdraw 60 BTC from Cryptsy I did not actually own: 
Being the honest man (or idiot) that I am, I sent them back everything. It is painful to see now that they behave in this way.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:36:13
Great he does this, its a sensible compromise.

$200m XRP trading volume on Poloniex today.
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:24:29
You are off by a factor of 10, the market cap of XRP is $30bn not $3bn. So it's higher than bitcoin at this point. I started a thread here on reddit a few days ago to discuss this but unsurprisingly was downvoted by the "all is ok in bitcoin world, keep you pants on" camp : )
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:24:56
Will do, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:23:37
Yes. So my question is: is this because there are withdrawal issues there, as is the case with gox? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:16:09
Did you just tip me 100 bucks? You'r insane dude!
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:40:00
What is a trade key? Sorry, not the greatest expert.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:02:42
Has been discussed at length, use the search.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:46:49
Why the hell should one support a criminal who acts out of completely selfish motives and has done more harm than anyone else to the idea of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:24:11
Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:42:40
Thanks, I decrypted the BIP 38 encoded private key using bitaddress.org, scanned it, and cleared it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:35:06
Thanks for sharing. That explains why they suddenly trade below btc-e whereas they were always at a premium before. I hope they get this sorted out, I have always been a fan of them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:07:22
Thanks Paul, it did not really occur to me to keep that. Glad you got the issue sorted. I like your site, and there are not many other places to buy Protoshares : )

I have looked the historical price evolution a bit and would like to share three more or less random observations I have made in case people are interested. I think these indicate that a) BTC trading is maturing and that b) the current price increase is not comparable to the one we saw in April.
In the first chart I plotted the relative price differences between a) Mt Gox over BitStamp and b) BitStamp over BTC-E. It is widely known that BTC usually trades highest on Mt Gox (because of the withdrawal issues), then BitStamp (in my experience no issues here at all), then BTC-E (perhaps because deposits take quite long, which could be interpreted as a deposit issue, or because of the higher anonymity). You can see that while the Mt Gox over BitStamp premium was as high as 15% in recent months, this has now come down to around 5%. The BitStamp over BTC-E premium is currently also very low, around 2.5%. As an aside, note that these premia do not seem to be related much to the BTC price level.
The second chart shows BTC volatility, calculated as the 20 day standard deviation from daily prices, scaled up to the year by multiplying by sqrt(252). BTC has been criticized much for its high volatility but this chart shows that we are currently nowhere near the &gt;300% vol level we saw in April but more in the 50% area, even during the latest price increase. Of course 50% is still quite high compared to other asset classes such as FX rates (less than 10% these days) or equities (perhaps around 30%), but certainly not completely out of whack for an asset class that new.
The third chart shows historical trading volumes on all three exchanges. Note that a) the recent price came with a trading volume MUCH below the one we saw in April and b) trading volume is now split much more evenly between the three exchanges, with Mt Gox having lost their dominating position (withdrawal issues again).
Bottom line, I interpret this as evidence that the recent price increase is fundamentals-driven rather than a bubble and that the market is maturing. No big news I think but reassuring nonetheless.

Yeah, 60k would be nice! : p
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:08:23
Yes that does help, thank you. Do you know of a software I can use to clear the BIP 38 paper wallet again? Thx!

Re 1: Think of it this way: There is now computing power worth several hundred times the computing power of the 500 fastest supercomputers working on the blockchain. If all of the people running these computers agree on creating more than 21mm of them, then yes. Otherwise no.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:02:11
The same happened to you with the same amount? Hard to believe, what address was that?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:04:28
Good idea. It might be worth computing a contact list so that people know where to send an email.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:15:43
I agree.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:28:51
Me too, but the high price is a very recent phenomenon after they were down for some time last week, so i am just wondering whether its still ok.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:53:12
While there is some debate as to the exact number :) people seems to agree its very small.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:34:27
Yes I think you might be right. It seems to mean that trading bitcoins is VAT exempt but buying something with them is not.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:57:18
That is possible. Give them some time to sort it out.
Edit: yes the portfolio value is messed up right now. But that should not matter.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:56:03
Found localbitcoins to work in London only if the market is NOT moving fast. Otherwise there is no liquidity. Why don't you open an account with bitstamp? That's what I ended up doing.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:22:01
I just came across this link. Its a response of the German government to the question of whether purchases made in Bitcoin are VAT-taxable. The answer is no.
I must say this surprises me as it seems to be an enormous advantages. Does anyone know how this is handled in other jurisdictions, e.g. USA?
