Interesting. Must have missed this from a the CoinTelegraph article a few days ago. It seems to me that there is a fairly useful incentive for building an asset tracking system on a blockchain for a game (and potentially securing it with a highly secure outside blockchain).
I am also curious about how this will interact when dealing with exploits and thefts within a given MMO or multiplayer community.

I'm listening and it's a pair of people talking about the Bitcoin community who don't seem to like But, from what I've seen, this subreddit is still excited when mom and pop (or grandma's bodega) get into bitcoin. This isn't some sort of fad that goes through, that bitcoin is successful on the scale of ordinary people is still celebrated.
Did they just spend almost half of this podcast talking about how one person wrote a joke article that flopped and insulting I am not sure this was even culturally relevant.
The last half is commentary about BitLicense and Wall Street, that at least has some sort of substance.

I just got mine this week and so far it's been a wonderful experience. I intend to use it a few more times over the weekend in order to give it a proper "shakedown."
So far it has had a very high ease-of-use and has caused me no trouble, the Shift app has a clear UI, and I get an e-mail notice less than 10 minutes after I use it.
I have not formed an opinion as to its space in the Bitcoin ecosystem yet, but it certainly bridges the gap between owning bitcoin and spending bitcoin.

If people manage to get Blizzard on board with taking bitcoins as payment I will absolutely be there report on it.

The developers of MazaCoin also seemed to be extremely hostile to reporters. I couldn't get word one out of them about the coin or the connection to the Lakota without a lot of snobbish rudeness. In the end, I decided it wasn't worth trying to cover after I couldn't verify a few facts I thought were central to the story.
Obviously there was some disconnection between it being the official coin of the Oglala Lakota and information being put out the media. Without that, MazaCoin rather lacked the luster it was sold with.

A nice strong connection between Bitcoin and a major software outlet and not to mention gaming. It's hard for me to get numbers when it comes to how many gamers there are in the Bitcoin community and how much impact being able to use a cryptocurrency for gaming-related services/purchases but I think it ties in nicely with many of Bitcoin's strongest innovations.

Because of this, when first introducing any story about Blockchain.info I do exactly that: refer to the wallet service by its domain name. While I understand that people in the Bitcoin community know that Blockchain.info is not the Bitcoin blockchain, I always feel weird talking about Blockchain knowing what the Bitcoin blockchain is.
Any just-learning audience really needs a way to distinguish Blockchain the wallet and website from the Bitcoin blockchain and realistically making it obvious that I'm referring to a website and not the protocol and technology is the best I can do.
Therefore, I would never countenance a headline saying "Blockchain hacked!" unless the actual Bitcoin blockchain was somehow meaningfully hacked.

On the subject of cryptocurrencies -- I see free-to-play gaming being the more likely testbed than Blizzard or other established markets. I am hoping to circle back to Bigpoint and see how much of their sales have gone through BTC so far. Virtual items, digital currency, seems like a solid fit.

OpenBazaar has been on my radar for a while, but I have not had a chance to launch or try it yet even in a professional (checking it out) sense. The idea feels like a very good method for producing a democratized Craig's List to bring trades together.
I can see it as an excellent proof-of-concept but is it yet into the stage where people have used it to facilitate a trade? (Working beta?) I understand it's still a little esoteric, but that it's moving rapidly towards a more casual user experience.
I'll probably circle back when I hear that it's at the point where I can just click-and-shoot (Spring 2015?)
Good idea. I'll just keep an eye out for when it matures.

I love what the people who come along do for some of the finales -- but then again, as gamers we like blowing things up. 
Sadly, I cannot say that we have that many innovative crypto discussions, but a few of the people who come by the live stream are interested in BTC and I'm personally interested in how cryptocurrency and games intersect so it comes up time to time. My primary focus is on gaming, mechanics, why people play and how games engage players. If Bitcoin (or some other crypto) makes inroads into gaming, it will likely come back up.

I do like the QR code use.
The strong ties that Bitcoin-apps have to QR codes (and therefore smartphone application) does make BTC a lot more portable than ... well money -- when it comes to virtual worlds. Since the exchange happens externally to the virtual world (WoW in this case) it can support itself in whatever game/world.

I used ChangeTip a few times a couple months ago. Nice, solid setup. It's nice to see it getting some play and that it's working out extremely well.

This is exactly the same question I'd have. I use Xsplit as a second camera source -- and I also have OBS installed -- it makes sense that the client should be able to "see" separate camera sources on the machine and then use them instead of just the webcam.
Doing so would make game streaming a lot simpler.

@_date: 2015-01-04 21:40:12
Yes. In fact, I've been waiting for a similar market to emerge. I've seen some come and go for various MMO games, but the problem arises that many MMO games it is against the EULA for players to exchange virtual items (a service of the MMO) for real world money.
The result, of course, is this black market of traders, because people who do work in MMO and online games with virtual items that can be traded want to find a way to profit from their activity. And, we also see the "gold seller" type also drift towards this sort of payment system due to the chargeback problem.
I believe that a born-virtual currency like Bitcoin is perfect for the process of exchanging in virtual items and I've been on the prowl for its use as such. To make this work an escrow-system would have to be in place that accounts for the eccentricities (and possibly API) of the game in question, which doesn't happen due to the illegitimacy of RMT virtual item trades for most games.
I am always on the lookout for anything related to Bitcoin and gaming, so if you manage to compile more data or information about the market, ecosystem, I would love to compare notes.

That's really interesting to hear. Having someone with a successful music career looking into how music is distributed, payments are accounted, and consumers are approached -- using a blockchain as the underlying technology -- could be groundbreaking  in of itself.

I am not surprised. BitLicense has had problems since the get-go that have been roundly criticized by the entire industry -- it's hard to say how it would affect LocalBitcoins traders and the vagaries of the language put a lot of people at risk.

I loved the discussion. This lines up with my interest in virtual currencies and virtual assets -- which become quite secure and manifest when these assets are secured with the Bitcoin blockchain, because it provides the trust needed to provide an item a real value.
I can see a number of interesting pitfalls for virtual items being assets on a blockchain (including irreplaceable theft) but at the same time there are benefits (including anti-counterfeiting.)
I know we probably won't be seeing an EVE Online or World of Warcraft blockchain edition too soon; but it seems from an economics perspective for a platform that publishes multiple games that have gamers that interact or interchange playerbase-wise might have a decent reason to go to a blockchain-based asset system just to lighten the load of tracking assets and giving those assets value.

Well. On and off I find CoinTelegraph a useful source for information, but I've always taken much of their work with a grain of salt. Of course, there's also sourced facts in the work that I've read that I could follow up easily.
However, I can't say I've read most of the site, or even followed it always, there's a multitude of publications out there some sketchier than others.
The possibility that some of the articles happened to have been plagiarized or part plagiarized is a very big problem. As a writer and someone who has managed writer, when I catch plagiarism it's hard to see how that person's credibility could recover.
I do like the artwork that accompanies CoinTelegraph articles.
The lack of knowledge of who is being the publication feels very odd. Of course, I also rarely have reason to contact them -- but without a reputation to stake opinion or sources on, it makes it harder for me to believe that I should be citing them.

I think that 21 is just in a phase where they're building up assets and preparing for the primary phase. A lot of businesses go through a hype-cycle. No doubt we'll hear from them again when there's a major confluence of bitcoin technology or if they've prepped for whatever is coming next.
They still have notable hashpower in mining pools, so they've not gone anywhere. They're just not marketing right now.

Good move for BitPay, this continues to follow MMO and multiplayer game publishers joining up to allow virtual items to be bought with bitcoins. IIRC, Bigpoint and GASH Point, and other gaming services/publishers have been slowly coming on board to allow the purchase of gaming subscriptions, time, premium currency etc. have been slowly trickling into the economy over the years.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:43:48
I have not had time to try out the web (or Android) apps that run the game (I hope to soon). The basis of using the blockchain to secure tradable cards sounds like an excellent proof-of-use for any virtual item.

The mesh networking capability and ad hoc networks is by far my favorite part of the potential product -- and yes, it seems like it would not function very well at low power especially if its expected to relay transactions while it's sitting in a dark wallet to keep the network up. This can only be compounded if its expected to do computations as well (such as verifying the transaction and updating the block on card.)
I suppose "no such thing as casual use" if there's an actual ad hoc mesh in play and people nearby are using their cards.
I will keep an eye out for more news, and no doubt it'll appear accordingly -- if the mesh ad hoc network does become vaporware, I will be disappointed but not surprised either.
@_date: 2012-06-25 00:06:19
I recall that video, to this day it's still way too slick marketing for me. The physical prototype of the card does relieve some of my eye-rolling -- still, it appears to be knee-deep in development so I'll just keep hanging on for more details from the developers.

I have enjoyed watching this game develop. I even own some BitCrystals from a while ago. I just have not had a chance to actually play and enjoy -- but if anything, it might be a better experience if I wait until after the beta stage is completed.
As someone who reviews games (even those in beta) for a living, I can certainly agree with feeling the desire to wait until the "last reset before launch" before getting into something that's about building up a deck or character. This is a common thing for pre-beta games or before a soft-launch because it allows newcomers to start on a level playing field. Part of review or beta testing is to get an experience early and one of the costs of that early experience is not having that head start advantage (in fact some games sell a head start advantage as part of marketing).

It's interesting. I put it into the SiliconANGLE Bitcoin Weekly yesterday because it's a different type of market opportunity than we're used to in the general Bitcoin exchange ecosystem. Also, looks like its working extremely well right out of the gate.
I am not an economist person or a BTC trader, but it seems to me that different opportunities that reduce risk and provide known mechanisms from other markets (NYSE, Nasdaq) to BTC trading will only help robustness for BTC trade in general.
It also makes the Gemini exchange a proof-of-concept for this sort of BTC trading, being the only exchange that I know does this.

I am currently working on a hands-on review of the TREZOR for SiliconAngle. So far, the results are very good. The device is relatively intuitive, easily interconnects with Firefox and Chrome via a plugin (although I had some issues due to the fact that I run script blockers on both.) It uses an interesting PIN protection method and takes user interaction from the device whenever signing or using the private keys.
It also provides a recovery seed (that you should save in a private/safe place) which works extremely well.
The device integrates nicely with Electrum and MultiBit HD wallets; although my go-to wallet is Armory and while integration is planned it doesn't work with that quite yet.
The FAQ mentions a few security measures that the device takes to protect itself; however, if it's not running fully upgraded firmware you should get that updated immediately as there is a known side-channel attack out for earlier firmware (I also noted this in my review.)
Not quite done yet, but as I said, I like the device so far.

Hey nice move! I have always felt that there is a real audience-booster when it comes to reaching out to communities that are more likely to use bitcoin -- i.e. the gamer and geek communities. Better yet, the gamer community has a mixture of what we'd call the classical geek community and a highly extensive outreach to people who just aren't geeks, unlike sports like Football, gamers have always tended to be more technical, but have a not-so-small extended community of casuals who are less-technical individuals.
This means that gaming is a great place to introduce bitcoin because of the overlap. While huge sports events, see Bitcoin Bowl, may have a larger reach to the public, that potential grassroots interest overlap just doesn't quite exist at the core fandom level.
Not to mention that gamers are already used to digital currencies and use them constantly. The idea of a currency that they can transfer online and store on phones will likely be second-nature and more intuitive.

No doubt that Coinbase filed for these patents but neglected to prepare for community reaction and sentiment is going to provide for some discussion for a while.

I have been thinking it would be interesting to use a mechanism similar to bitcoin to supplant publisher-wide virtual currencies (such as Perfect World's Zen.) However, the model also supplants the "lock in" at $10 or $50 of currency that can only be used as corporate scrip that gaming businesses might be betting on to make money.
As a born-digital currency, bitcoin could also just be an easy way to spend money on games in general for smaller transactions (depending on where transaction fees go) which has giant benefits for mobile indie developers and lower the costs of accepting payments.
I am constantly on the lookout for gaming solutions that embrace cryptocurrency (especially bitcoin) and I've seen a few come and go but nothing is sticking quite yet. There's BitFantasy, a bitcoin RPG, VoidSpace, a space MMO that uses Dogecoin; we've seen developer BigPoint Games begin accepting bitcoins... The list goes on.

I do rather like BTC donations as a way to actually put a little bit of "micro" into micropayments when it comes to tipping streamers (entertainers) who use Twitch. Having to access a bot in a Twitch chat (via ChangeTip), however, isn't exactly the most ideal way to make it happen but it's a start.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:52:57
There could be a certain amount of public relations issue when it comes to the vocal community who want bitcoin to replace money now -- and it certainly could do that for economies that have weak central systems (such examples as Africa). Bitcoin is growing very slowly and a large part of that is likely because there aren't enough ready-to-go consumer tools for using it -- it's still rather arcane even with Coinbase (and I'd say Circle, but even I can't get that working.)
Ideas people are going to be common this early in any development and I love ideas -- although it is going to be practical solutions and social connections that will win the day in the end if anything does. Those dozen startups trying to open up or build on bitcoin each have a chance of making something that will deliver.
I'm really not one for mottos; but I do like people.
The original question was "what keeps you in the game?" but I don't so much play as spend my time talking to the people who do.

After watching G2A partner with BitPay, I expected that Kinguin would not be that far behind. There's a few other large-ish game-related marketplaces out there, such as MMOGA that may also follow suit.
The Wild Wild West nature of marketplaces such as G2A and Kinguin, though, may not be the best place to use bitcoin because the merchants themselves who take part in these markets are a little iffy -- that said, flea market gaming sites does seem like a very likely adoption point.
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:50:54
Pretty strong show from Coinapult so far. They do exist in a highly targeted industry and managed to recover at least in part. They didn't implode, did transparently let everyone know how they intended to deal with it, and turning withdrawals back on means that as long as people get their BTC back out there's less customer impact.
I am pretty happy with how Coinapult is managing the aftermath so far.

You are correct! The source is "silliconangle.com" which is not [SiliconANGLE.com]( The article in question does not exist and the real author, Collen Kriel (whom I know, and who doesn't know who Craig Wright is), did not write it.

Tracking all the scams in the Bitcoin space does seem like it would be a full time job. And earning credibility currently is a thing that every new venture needs to do. 
I remember BadBitcoin -- and unfortunately the site looks like a jumble, I thought it still had value in identifying some apparent scams -- but hitching a wagon to GAW? At the very least reserving judgement would be better, but the evidence seems to be piling up against.
It's a good time for other sites to compete in the scam-identification space.

That worked pretty easily. I just integrated ChangeTip into my livestream on Twitch (and I can see the bot in the viewers.) I'll have to tell everyone watching about it tonight -- but I don't have a very bitcoin savvy audience.

Vitalik describes exactly my frustration with Wright's reveal and announcement. There's a giant circus act surrounding what should be a really simple proposition: just sign something with a private key that Satoshi was likely to have access to. Then give us the text, the signed result and a reference to the public key and let cryptography experts verify it.
At least then the argument would be over "do we all agree Satoshi had access to this private key?" and not "did Wright actually sign anything?"

I will have to watch this space. The Bitcoin tipping phenomena is something I've enjoyed reporting on, and the reception can be sometimes mixed, but overall it seems to be quite good.

This is beautiful. Adding another payment system accepting Bitcoin promotes new audiences and shows merchant support; but at the same time Adyen is the payment processor for Jagex Game Studios, the developer of RuneScape. As a game, RS has been a sleeping giant of a community forever and shows me a beautiful example of the intersection between bitcoin and gaming.
Here's hoping for more metrics for gaming and bitcoin so that I can get a better view of how MMOs and the free-to-play industry embrace the techonology.
I barely heard anything out of it after BigPoint Games started accepting bitcoin (yet another example of a good market intersection.) That was 2013. So adoption feels a little slow for something that seems like it could be a sleeper hit.
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:27:58
Interesting. I missed that $1 million seed round at the end of April for this. 
I am looking through the website now. I can see how the Zapier system is very useful -- being able to trigger events (especially e.g. generating a blockchain receipt upon important record modification/creation).
Also spent some time looking at Chainpoint, feels like an elegant way to create a publishable hash that can be then put into a TX on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Is a Datastore a single database (looking at pricing).

I think a great deal of my interest in Bitcoin, and it's ancillary technologies, is how fluidly our culture took to the concept of economies in games -- even before I started writing about bitcoin, I followed game currencies and corporate currencies. Bitcoin resolves a lot of issues with exchange of value when it comes to computers (which, as devices, are amazing at producing products that can be infinitely copied).
Gaming seems like a perfect connection for bitcoin and consumers, the only problem I foresee is that the gaming industry is highly competitive and is a market of walled gardens. Games might accept bitcoin as payment (BitPay, Coinbase) but they'll never want to connect themselves to an indelible, transparent ledger service.
For the moment, I'll just squint at my BitCrystals and wait to see where that goes.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:51:49

How micro- are the micropayments expected to allow? 
Are there any partners who will be trying to use this for people paying people (such as micropayments in mobile apps)? or is the primary intent to design something that can be used in the IoT context mentioned in the article (i.e. lightbulbs paying for their own electrical usage hour-to-hour)?

NFC enabled bitcoin chit? (I got the image of a poker-chip with an RFID chip in it; but I'm guessing that's not what you meant.)
Well, NFC is really nice for inside devices -- i.e. for computing and casting back to the Internet when two devices are in play, therefore proving a "relationship" between the two devices during a transaction; whereas QR codes are probably best for advertisement or for solo distribution -- i.e. for when only one device or mass-production is needed.
NFC is nice because it's another kind of burst communication and can be triggered by a behavior between two people (or two devices) and the interaction can be programmed or scripted by both in the interaction. It's a little harder to intercept the information and the "I send you something" behavior can differ depending on how you want to code the transaction, proximity is really the only rule. 
QR on the other hand is static. In this way QR is brilliant for advertising, giving an interaction point for web pages, transferring information when someone can take a picture of your screen, print it out and carry it away for someone to scan, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:28:27
Same here. The first municipality to accept Bitcoin for government fees would open up a totally new market for the currency. Seeing how something like E-Gov Link would abstract away the cost of accepting (and reduce the fear when it comes to "odd" currency) it seems like the most likely way for a municipality to sign in as long as BTC is controversial or obscure in the eyes of the general public, and it will have the effect of normalizing the idea that BTC can be used to pay for everyday, mundane things -- rather than being an ethereal "virtual, digital" thing that exists only on the Internet.
I'll look forward to watching that happen.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:00:08
That's very neat! In this case QR may be more useful indeed -- except for the ease-of-use for reporgramming the chip or the geeky part -- of course, a QR-code could just be printed onto a sticker and then slapped on if it needed to change.
I see NFC being used differently than what's depicted here, a little bit overkill for the application (but as I said, there's a geeky part to take into account.)

The usefulness of NFC for BTC transfers couldn't be understated, it's a technology that I think puts us one step closer to the "trading credits on the street." Very science fiction. I've been following the slow introduction of this technology and its design evolution for a few years now -- the market impact feels small, but more than a critical mass of smartphones have some version of it already.
