I don't know if sourceforge is actually at fault or not, I really don't think so, but even unrelated to this I'm moving releases off of it starting today.  Regardless of this incident I've heard too many shady things about what's going on with it, bad practices, invasive ads, among other things.  I'm now going to use github releases.

This is Jim here.  I wrote OBS, and R1CH pointed me to this thread.
I am really pissed off that someone did this with my software.
I can't help but feel the need to defend my program and myself here, my software is open source, so people can modify the code as they please.  I never intended it to be used in this way.  Whoever did this is a serious asshole.  I worked my ass off for this application over the past year and a half.  So I just want to be clear before anyone throws any accusations at me or others on my dev team, I did not even let anyone give me any donations for the entire first year it was available.  I now have at least a million and a half users, and people already donate to my team and I because of my program.  If at any time I really need money (which I don't, I have contract work thanks to my success with OBS), I would just start charging 2-3 dollars for a version with more features, or do some sort of donation voting for feature thing like synergy does, and that would be that.  (People have over and over again told me I'm crazy for not)
I'm really pissed off that someone reprogrammed it to do something like this.  I'm really sorry about this.
I couldn't help but say this just in case some sort of drama started happening.  This application is seriously my life right now.  It's the one big accomplishment I have in my life, it's made my dad proud of me, the one person in the world who means the most to me, and I don't want to see it tarnished because of some asshole in russia is scamming people using my publically available source code.
