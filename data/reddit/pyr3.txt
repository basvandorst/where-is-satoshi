Well, there is also _fleeting_ value. If all of that value could disappear tomorrow it's not very secure. I'd bet that Bitcoin crashing to $0 tomorrow has a higher chance of happening than the US dollar crashing to worthless.

Many people hate TechCrunch too, but they aren't auto-killed.

As I understand it, Gawker.com articles are auto-killed when submitted to Hacker News. I forget why, but some Googling would probably turn it up if you were so motivated.


I'd like to see examples. I regularly see criticism of Y-Combinator-backed companies as well as articles shining a good light on their competitors. If their goal was to 'surpress' [sic] discussion, then clearly these would not be allowed too.


That's a pretty low bar to proof.


Is this supposed to paint a picture out of A Clockwork Orange (maybe Hacker News the Korova Milk Bar)? What's next Ron Paul and his Libertarian Ruffians? ;-)
