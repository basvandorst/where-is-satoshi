“I don’t ask just kiss”
Give me a break. Stop lying

Yeah, he's a shitstain. But so is Donald "creeping on teenage pageant queens" Trump who has also been credibly accused of rape. So you can't denigrate clinton and then act like Trump also isn't a rapist....

Hope your evening goes well too. I also hope you recognize that Trump is as big of a POS as Bill Clinton and you don't owe either person jack shit.

He admitted it on Howard Stern, dumbass. 
And you think he had time to figure out if it were consensual when he just walked up to strangers and started kissing them? Because that’s what he said he did. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:32:03
Lol, he fucking admitted it on camera! HAHAHAHAHAHA "anything bad about Trump is fake news amiright?" 
He also admitted to intentionally walking into the dressing rooms of 16 year old pageant queens........ dude's a pedo and you're bootlicking him. How sad 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:51:14
Lol, convenient how you left all context out. And pedo Donald creeping on teenage girls dressing rooms. You keep ignoring that. 
Edit: alt left! Hahaha, I’ll tell the boys at the range that. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:31:03
How sad that you have to lie about what I mean to feel secure about yourself. More pathetic projection hahahahahaha you’re probably a total incel. I TOTALLY mean that you have to ask explicitly every time /s lol
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:19:13
You’re projecting so hard right now. How sad. A wealthy person with influence saying “I don’t ask just kiss, grab them by the pussy” doesn’t strike you as predatory? You think women are falling over themselves for trump? How brainwashed are you? Hahaha. These women were total strangers dumbass. You don’t fucking walk up to strangers and start kissing them. Are you brain damaged?
And barging into teenage girls dressing rooms to see them naked! Total pedophile. Keep supporting a pedo. I’m sure you’re such an “alpha male” amiright?
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:11:19
I mean, I guess you can't technically refer to 'ignoring something' as missing it. So yeah, I guess you didn't miss anything.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:05:22
There you go projecting again hahahaha
“Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. You know, I'm inspecting, I want to make sure that everything is good.
You know, the dresses. ‘Is everyone okay?’ You know, they're standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good.”
Keep bootlicking perverts. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:41:05
He wasn’t joking hahahaha. There’s literally no indication that he was joking. I think you need to go back to elementary school and learn how to read
There’s also witness testimony from this timeframe. Multiple people, but now I’m guessing they’re all Democrat operatives or some other retarded shit
You’re projecting because you’re just accusing people of random shit. You’re insecure. It’s why you bootlick pervert strong man to feel better about yourself
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:26:13
Bzzzzzzt girls below 17 were in those rooms. 
And LOL, bbbbut whatabout whatabout whatabout. 
Also, he wasn’t talking about consensual groping. He was talking about walking up to strangers and pulling shit. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:54:06
Maybe I jumped the gun there. He admitted to *sexual assault* (so much better right?) on camera AND on Howard Stern, he admitted to barging into the changing room of teenage girls to see them naked. Dude's a pervert and a predator. 
His wife is the one who accused him of rape:  
Lemme guess, "bbbbbut but but  but but whataboutClinton?" He's shit too.
