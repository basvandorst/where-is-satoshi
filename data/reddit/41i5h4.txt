In interest of full disclosure, I'm Canadian, so we're publicly funded, but don't have the private option (unless we hop the border). 
I'd argue that most of the time, the public hospital system in Australia is better than the private. I work in healthcare, and worked in the Australian public system. The private hospital had a nice little corridor where they wheeled their patients over to the public hospital when things got complicated. The private Drs also had a habit of cherry picking their cases. So basically the easiest, least sick, most straight forward cases went private, everything else was public. 
To add to the public vs. private debate. The reason your bills are so high in the USA is because of insurance companies and wages. Doing my job in Canada earns me approximately half as much as I could earn in the USA for the same job. And even though we are underpaid, really, the American figure is astronomical (essentially what a MD doing bare minimum gets paid in Canada). 
I think the whole American system is ridiculous, but I like money, so I'm taking advantage of a prosperous healthcare system and better wages as soon as my papers come in.

I started out with 50 of LTC, and 50 of BTC. Then I added another 50 to BTC. Then my SO got wind of it, and I added another 100 to BTC, and he matched me for $500 total. If we sold today, we'd make $60! That's better returns than... really, anything right now.
