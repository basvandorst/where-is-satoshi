It sucks.  I just signed up for coinbase yesterday, excited to buy some bitcoin.  I linked my debit card and got verified, try to purchase $50, keep getting a message that says Buy Failed, Unable to authorize card.  Apparently a lot of other people have been having the same problem.  
I can't use Kraken because I live in New York and they aren't licensed to do business here.  I don't know what other sites to use.  I'd prefer to only use a credit/debit card, I'd rather not use ACH or Wire transfer.  This sucks.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Coinbase already licensed in New York? 
Edit: Nevermind, if I bothered to read the article before I made this comment I would have found my answer.

Does Gemini offer credit/debit card purchases or only bank wire?

Also Shapeshift doesn't do business in NY either, which sucks because I have about $1200 in Dogecoin that I bought 3 years ago and I was hoping to exchange a bunch for Bitcoin. Looks like I'm out of luck there too..

Well all of the Bitcoin ATMs in my area charge 7-15% so they're definitely making a profit.  The closest one to me is currently charging $898.71 for 1 bitcoin.  This is why I'd prefer not to buy from an ATM, but I guess the privacy is what you're paying for.

I was thinking of signing up for coin base. Why do you have to wait 5 days?

Then let them charge the 10.9%.  It's still better than the 15% that some Bitcoin ATMs are charging.
