I completely understand that now 
But the fact I'm trying to make is that they have wallets that give 11 word seeds and there is more people then me that are affected especially considering there is a program that exists to "combat" this issue they they cocindentally knew about and sent it to me asap then ghosted me  
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:22:17
 I thought they were one of the best wallets in genera until this happened 
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:40:02
Woah swearing....... I think you owe one dollar worth of crypto to the swear jar....
I feel like the blame is being placed because you did accuse me of incorrectly writing it down....
I also recall being told on twitter the support tool is not yours but you guys believe it to be safe etc 
I sent screenshots of where I wrote it down
I don't think I went carpet bombing and censorship is never an answer. I don't think you paid attention to this in history class but typically countries that censor stuff don't last long.
And it's okay now to admit it's a bug. You guys already did your ICO so your not gonna lose millions by admitting due to your error a 15 year old got a messed up wallet, I forgive you 
Summary: I forgive you, just admit your mistakes, think of this as a learning experience

I had XXX amount of Bitcoin in USD in it 
I know this for a fact because I used to recommend this wallet to family members and show them my wallet with my balance on it 
@_date: 2018-05-30 00:47:30
My seed was only 11 words ( two people have confirmed this issue)
It took 2-3 days for my wallet to sync
I'm missing some bitcoin from my wallet 
And they banned me for asking for help on their sub
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:14:25
Yea I have my seeds in order for everything or so I thought
The only issue I have had regarding seeds is with Breadwallet 
I wish that whoever is in charge there can address this issue asap because I have a feeling that it is larger than me 
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:41:12
 I don't recommend them for multiple reasons now
It's infuriating that this wallet is recommend despite all this 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:29:27
There was another redditor that commented his son had this issue as well 
@_date: 2018-05-30 00:33:44
They talk about being decentralized but they steal their customers coins and they censor their subreddit's
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:02:19
I was given an 11 word seed that doesn't work
The app made me re type the seed to use the app so there is no way I could of incorrectly written it down and coincidentally there exists a tool to fix this issue for your app 
Next I'm still missing coin from you. That is what I am currently talking to support about.
What you may call "degratatory" I call expressing my feelings towards a company who didn't really help me at all until I started doing this....
If you can't take criticism when you guys clearly messed up what are you then. It sounds like you are censoring. What is this a communist country where we cannot freely express our viewpoints....
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:19:12
I'm attempting to talk to support to solve this and I'm hoping it can be resolved 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:37:34
The link in my post called "github" is the program 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:14:27
Okay thank but this did happen to me 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:19:26
Okay I'll remember to do that next time but I probably won't because me losing my money in your guys app is the last straw for me 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:35:57
I used the program they provided me and it still didn't work
I don't have the technical knowledge to bruteforce it myself so that's why I'm trying to contact them and have them address the issue because after all they are the ones that created the problem 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:06:50
There being bugs is completely understandable nothing in this world is perfect 
This is more of a major flaw than a bug and I'm irritated that the company is not providing any help or assistance because this is a serious issue 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:17:32
Well it's not complete bullshit 
It happened to me and believe it if you do and if you don't believe it then don't 
I just want my issue resolved 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:59:51
It was for me 
How else would I have gained access to the app because at registration you need to type in your seed again or that's how it was.
And there also exists code to solve this issue
I understand it was never 11 words and I'm not blaming a dev, I'm full out calling the company out because this should not have happened to begin with 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:27:51
I have 11 of the 12 words because that's what the app gave me 
I can PM you my contact info and I can describe my error to you more if you need some clarification 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:45:05
I doubt it because once again it made me type the entire seed again into the app and I can't remember a long string of random words 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:25:23
No because it made me re type my seed into the app in order to activate my wallet........
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:57:32
The combo's I have been given aren't working 
At this point I just want to inform others because this appears to be a big issue 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:36:49
His issue was resolved and though it has characteristics like my issue - I'm not going to comment on his because my input  would be as useful as a rain jacket on a sunny day 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:45:55
I figured since it was  one of the most recommended wallets and best wallet for iOS there wouldn't be a ground breaking bug like this 
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:50:50
The fact that you need to resort to cursing random people out on the internet when they are trying to generate public awernese for a bug is sad
Typically if you are taking your anger out on people there might be bigger issues in your life. Since you are a fan of Reddit there are sub Reddits designed to help you up. We are here for you . We won't let you down, I encourage you to get the help you need. My PM's are open shoot me one if you need help 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:19:57
According to the Blockchain Wallet app the seeds generated are invalid 
So I'm rather lost and relying on support who isn't doing much at all 
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:26:14
I persist because I'm missing coins 
I persist because it took 3 days for my wallet to sync 
you say that's it's my fault for being given an 11 word seed but don't address the issue that your app makes you re type the seed  in order to get it to work ��
Two people have had this issue not including me 
Of course you never know if your app has a bug until someone reports it which I'm trying to do only for y'all to continually deny it and I don't see any harm with you guys accepting it 
P.S. how did you find this thread on a huge sub but could not find the PM I sent you asking for help....
And support only sent the same scripted response so patiently is a bit more of copy and paste 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:22:53
No the most I did with them was re entering them in the app until I tried to recover it 
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:24:46
Yes I have posted it before
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:49:00

When you write your book about the US dollar include that part as well. Include that it has been used since 1776 for those type of transactions

I still have to type it out but I wrote my final draft out by hand because it was quicker for me than typing 
The book is around 60 pages (a bunch of stacked on top of each other)
Includes sections explaining what bitcoin is, talks about everything relating to bitcoin, how it works and how to get involved, how to use bitcoin, address myths about bitcoin, talks about bitcoin companies and even has a bitcoin dictionary
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:50:49
I have access I just preferred to do it by hand
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:02:19
Also if anybody has any knowledge
How should I go about publishing this
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:37:38
Bitcoin is as much as bubble as the USD or the Euro. The USD and Euros are backed up by nothing and the only reason that they have value is people are willing to accept them and the community gives them value. Bitcoin only has value because people accept they and accept the price that it traded at. If one day if everyone stopped accepting the US Dollar then the bubble would pop; just like the bitcoin bubble would pop if everyone stopped using it
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:51:42
I am thinking we put everybody that enters on an excel sheet
everybody will be given a number on the sheet and the sheet will be shared with everyone on google drive via a shareable link
We will then livestream selecting a number on twitch with a random number generator from google
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:01:06
Sounds like a good idea 
If you want post it over at the sub as a method to pick random numbers
