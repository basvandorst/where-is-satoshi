Bitcoin isn't the KoolAid, selling Bitcoin is the KoolAid. The is the replacement for dollar bills, not the way to make them. It's value will one day be based on its purchasing power, not its dollar value.

Try to find a local person or place that will exchange cash for your Bitcoin, in small less risky amounts. Do that until you are comfortable with what you have left. Do not make transactions alone. Do not sell it back to an exchange, because at some point they will be forced into turning over records of transactions, and you will owe capital gains.

Turn fiat currency into Bitcoin, anonymous. Spend Bitcoin, anonymous. Sell Bitcoin peer-to-peer for fiat currency, anonymous. Sell Bitcoin on an exchange for fiat currency, the taxman cometh. This is why when you buy, you confirm your credit card, but when you sell, you confirm your identity. If you sell $4000 worth of Bitcoin on an exchange, and you cannot prove your cost basis, it will most likely be zero. Bitcoin can be very anonymous, but only if done the correct way. If you keep it under your mattress, you are fine. Deposit profits into your bank account to buy a car, and you are exposing yourself. Hackers may steal your Bitcoin, but the taxman will throw your ass in jail too.

Also, DO NOT forget that for every amount of Bitcoin you owned prior to August 1st you also own an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Even if you sell Bitcoin, that Bitcoin Cash will remain where the Bitcoin originally was. At some point in the future, there will be an easy way to extract that into a separate account. I do not know of an easy, secure way to do that yet.

I have been following Bitcoin for a year. Beyond the price increase, I see this as the future of spendable cash. I am not anticipating being a rich man because of my investment, but I do believe one day it will be as common as dollars in my wallet. But here's the thing. If I bury $1000 in my back yard, and dig it up in 15 years, it will buy half of what it did when I buried it. If, in the same timeframe, Bitcoin does the same thing, I am even. So, I buy now with the hopefulness that someday I will see Bitcoin as a common form of payment, with digital scanners at gas stations, grocery stores, and wherever you pull your dollars out of your wallet for.
