Thanks, please try donating a small amount, (at least $3) to help this succeed.  You can even donate to Save The Children ( which is on your list.

This is a good point. You can just sell and donate yourself. However this platform enables people to donate to charity and use potentially use some of the advantages of the Bitcoin network. For example:
 *   During the Counterparty launch, 2,130 bitcoins were “burnt” – See  If this project is successful and builds up trust, a Proof of Donation mechanism can exists, which would provide many of the advantages of a Proof of Burn scheme, with a major difference being that charities benefit.
 *  Bitcoin donations could be integrated into any existing Bitcoins service or applications, for example Changetip. This could make donating easier.
 *  One could create a fund that pay dividends to the holders of the Counterparty asset we have created, further incentivising more donations.
We do appreciate the point you have made, which is sensible. However we hope we have created something which can encourage some charitable donations.

This is why we publish all the data from every donation, so that we can prove its not a scam.
For example:
* Yesterday someone sent money to 13oByiseSkdgAk14tbRLuDdR7N3BVFk5sx (  This is the address of Amnesty International in our database.
* The following link then demonstrates we made a matching donation to Amnesty International:

Well there are over 10,000 charities, which is a wide selection of causes. Also most large global charities have a UK branch which is available on the site.
If this is successful we plan on expanding to the US

Thanks, see  where you can see the donation comment, proving we made the payment.

We promise to pay the charities within 24 hours, therefore we only need 24h worth of trust.
There is a database of all the Bitcoin addresses here:
We have also put a SHA256 hash of that file in the Blockchain so we cannot change it:
Anybody can  monitor these Bitcoin addresses and if we fail to pass the donation on to charity, even once, then everyone can see we are fraudsters.

If you search at the top, you should be able to find lists of charities that you are looking for. Our database contains the same charities as those listed on the JustGiving website, but currently we are only able to process donations to UK charities.  Of course the great thing about Bitcoin is that anyone can donate, form any country.
