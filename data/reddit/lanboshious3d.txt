I'm not saying he's a genius but he has an understanding of publicity and marketing that few people can match.  Love him or hate him but there's no denying that what he's done is remarkable.  I just don't think he's an idiot.

In technical circles Jmac is well respected. Like it or not Russ hanneman is probably the smartest characters on the show from a visionary standpoint.  He's a douche for sure but that makes him stupid?  Same goes for Macafey.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you're one of those people that actually believes Trump is an idiot too?

The economy is doing alright.  Unemployment is lower than it's been for years.  Manufacturing  is coming back to the States.  But hands down the best things he's accomplished are tax reform and getting rid of unconstitutional Obama care mandate.  How anyone can be in favor of such a gross violation of rights is beyond, so glad it's gone.

We'll he's done pretty good job for being over his head.

Less....are you serious?  People are more cautious in an unregulated market because it's unregulated.  It's Soo much easier to scam people in a regulated market because everyone and their dog trusts it.  LMAO this guy.

Like most poor people, your thinking is flawed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:38:00
70k isn't exactly poor but whatever.  Obviously there are rich people who are stupid and vice versa, I never said they're mutually exclusive.  What you said is that MOST poor people are smarter than the average rich person.  Which is absolutely a ridiculous thing to say.  You really believe that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:56:58


LMAO, no
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:18:29
Rich people are rich for a reason. I'm guessing you haven't spent much time around them.  What you and many of people fail to realize is that Trump is a character, and an effective one at that.  He knows what he's doing, you don't accidently become president against the will of some of the most powerful people on the planet by being stupid and dumb luck.  You've watch too many movies.  If you truly think that Donald Trump has a subpar intellect then the joke is on you.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:53:49
Ahhh the old changing defines to try to back out of looking like a dumbass but actually looking like a bigger dumbass trick.   
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:05
Why do you want to make people less rich? Just worry about yourself asshole.

You do realize that our infrastructure (roads) are falling apart right?  I guarantee you a private company could manage roads more efficiently.

I'm saddened to think that some people want to make decisions for other people.
Based on your comment I think it's safe to say you're against tobacco, alcohol, fast food, coffee and candy as well?  
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:23:49
Wow you really don't get it.  If some is diagnosed with a life threatening disease, the single biggest factor on whether they survive or not is if they live in the United States.  Because we have the best health care providers period.  And we have the best because we pay the best.  
Also healthcare isn't a right, you can't make people pay for other people's healthcare against their will, it's a violation of their rights.  It's shame that you want to take away Americans rights.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:14:37
LMAO you're an idiot dude.

Do you write off capital losses from deflation when pay taxes in dollars?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:39:49
It's not the same outcomes though....but whatever you can shop around and find cheaper doctors but don't try to make healthcare shittier for everyone who don't mind paying more for better care.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:18:35


If there is profit to be made then yes.

Have a look at the top 5.

Not as much as you drive them nuts.  You just can't leave them alone.
  There's nothing stopping you from setting up you own socialist system within our country.  Why don't you do that?  That way everyone that wants to have their lives controlled by a socialist system can choose to take part and those who want to make decisions for themselves do their own thing. Seems like a win win. 
Why does socialism have to be an all or nothing thing?

Wow you really love having to suck on the fat teets of the feds for everything don't you?

That's "million" with a silent 'm' and very loud 'b' there bud.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:47:48
Oh wow, you really don't understand supply and demand.  So what happens if everyone tried to cash out there bank accounts at the same time?  Or what would happen to a stock price if everyone tried to sell at the same time.  These are basics that you seem to not be comprehending.  Stick with your 1000 ROI model and don't give others financial advice.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:32:19
LOL sooo salty.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:37:49


LMAO!  And just figuratively.  I actually laughed when I read that.  You are the biggest sucker in this thread.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:44:07
Obviously that's not true.  At 10k a day I think you find better things to do than getting triggered on Reddit.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:25:24
LMAO this dude's jelly and pissed he's getting left behind!
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:04:57
Wow you're starting to flame here.  I don't think I've don't think I've called you a single insulting name.  OK so let's say youre right and America has an awful healthcare system.  I still don't agree with a system that forces citizens to participate.  It's anti freedom and anti human rights.  Just because you think it's best for everyone doesn't make it so.  We should let everyone decide for themselves.

Billionaires don't hold their net value in liquid assets.  That's like calling Warren buffet a special kind of stupid because he can't spends most of his net worth on consumer goods.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:37:04
It's made many many people multi millionaires so there's that. Again I think your pissed because you missed out on a massive amount of money and are throwing a fit to comfort your ego.
