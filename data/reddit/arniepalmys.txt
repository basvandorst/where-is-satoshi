I don’t own any btc and only bitcoin. You’re just a fucking one sided lunatic. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:24:28
No. You’re just like Congress. Hate the other side and just be angry. Fucking kids these days eh?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:22:56
Holy shit. This guy escalated this quickly. Fucking christ calm down. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:57:35
This guy manipulates!
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:57:44
Oh fuck you’re the shill. 5 weeks. Laters. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:51:15
Did dude just watch Fed talk about rates and think this would be a bump?
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:44:26
Damn! You got downvoted and the guy above got upvoted. This sub is slipping. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:51:27
Hence why crypto is treated as a commodity by the traders. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:08:46
Try capital harvesting. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:54:27
Still loses to indexes. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:45:13
Making trusts be submitted to authorities is a start. A global database.
@_date: 2019-04-07 04:34:05
Is this the bitcoin sub or the bitcoin cash sub? I forget if they were switched or not. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:53:15
And we wonder why crypto is dead.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:46:52
I hold because I can’t spend it anywhere. Oh I crack me up. But seriously. Where the fuck do people spend this currency other than trading it to other holders?
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:54:45
How does that work?
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:00:54
Updates, hey where are all my coins now? ��
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:23:35
Holding is its use no?
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:52:13
I don’t follow. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:13:15
I’ll look up ‘seed’
Edit: Noob gets downvoted for saying he’ll look up a term the cool coders invented. Yay this sub! 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:48:07
Bought at $6100 the other day. Fml
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:17:45
So why the stupid comment?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:46:32
Well I certainly bought at the absolute peak. I must be the only person on the planet down on bitcoin. Always my way with investing. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:58:33
I’m just gonna stick with indexes now. I was playing biotech before. Damn you GILD. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:51:03
Look here. This guy is funny. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:46:16
Why was it stupid and how would you have avoided my poor decision?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:26:46
Doesn’t ‘All the fees’ kinda kill bitcoin for consumers then? Can someone ELI5 it for me?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:07:36
Fuck me. And my Ledger is lagging in shipping this whole time. Guess I missed a $1500 boat
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:27:53
I just wanna use it like ApplePay for nada. :)
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:23:36
From what I have read, nodes could have power over the network somehow and the old FIAT powers are said nodes. Frankly it is hard to figure out myself. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:50:06
True. It’s for immediate losses. I’m down $30k in the markets this past two years. Sounds impossible but I did it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:05:55
Does this mean it’s cheap to send like bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:19:10
It grew much more than bitcoin this week. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:26:56
How is it cheaper?
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:47:05
Oh jeez. That HODL think killed crypto for me. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:31:55
Right. I just invested in a commodity and let it sit.
