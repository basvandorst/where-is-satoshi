This is so beyond naive. An entrepeneur who actually threatens the status quo will be dealt with accordingly. "Filling in the gaps" will not be allowed because it will lose people lots of money. Everything you're dreaming of is based on people not being greedy, which as we both know, will never happen.
A free market the way you're thinking is not possible. The biggest players will always tilt things in their favor however they can.
The government is not empowering corporations to be as greedy as possible, they're just an inconvenient hurdle that can currently be overcome. Removing that hurdle will NOT make things better, we need to make the hurdle higher and more transparent.
BETTER government is the answer. No government sends us back to the stone age before people figured out societies work better than anarchy.

The government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. Never forget that. It's not your enemy, the retards we elected into office are. We can fix that. Trump overturned lobbyist regulations that Obama put in place that would have started this.
How exactly? They buy the little guys. Over and over. There will only be monopolies, with no antitrust laws to break them up. If you think government is standing in the way of many small competitors threatening big business then you're very ignorant.
Big money is the problem with government, and we need to get it out. Plain and simple. Problem is idiots are allowed to vote and put Big Money itself into power.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:06:30


We can make sure that doesn't happen anymore.


Wrong. Bell Labs breakup wants to have a word.


Same way they do now, by being monopolies. Do you know what economies of scale are? Nobody is "forcing" you to buy their stuff, you have no choice because we allow mega monopolies. This doesn't magically go away if the government does, it just makes it easier for them to get away with it.


Wrong. They buy any competitor that threatens them with a "better" product. And because money is king in this world, nobody stops it because they can't and don't want to. The bigger you are, the more money you have, the more efficient at making money you are, and competition is easily squashed or subverted. Hell, in this "post-regulation" world, underhanded tactics like corporate espionage and sabotage go unpunished.
What you are describing doesn't and will never exist. Regulation is the only way to make this better. I don't know who brainwashed you but it sure has worked, Big Money is your enemy with zero empathy or want to make the world better.

Yeah you're right, they'd be even more powerful because they wouldn't have to waste resources to sway the state their way; they'd be free to go ahead and use their immense wealth to fuck us over as they see fit.
Critical thinking is hard. As if greed would magically go away if government disappeared.

They will be eliminated as a source of competition. Being bought out, hostile takeover, or otherwise. There are no rules against it and it's profitable to make sure nobody cuts into your market share. Those who do just get swallowed.


Those who are on top. You're imagining some kind of equally-segmented circle chart but you really just need real-world examples to see it's just like that game where a small fish eats slightly smaller ones until it's huge. 
Economy of scale comes into play and nobody can compete once that happens. What kind of laws are there right now that are preventing you from competing with Wal-Mart? Even other (smaller) giant chains are getting pushed out.


Ditto. 


Outlaw lobbyists and make all campaign contributions equal. Problem solved, and the public doesn't get swayed by giant budgets.
Your first mistake is you either don't realize or don't care that what's most profitable is almost always bad for humanity. Low wages, higher prices to maximize profit margins, elimination of competition. Just like in the late 1800's when kids went to work and got black lung and business acted with impunity. Deregulation does NOT work.
Your second mistake is assuming people will just be able to "vote with their wallet", as if every market is somehow profitable enough for even 2 let alone more competitors selling the same thing. 
Regulations don't hold back innovation. This is a bizarre rhetoric that boils down to "I don't want to have to pay for the impact my business inflicts on human life". No you can't dump raw sewage into a stream or smog into the air, that hurts us all and you deserve punitive action. No you can't pay your employees below living wage, that hurts their opportunities to advance in life and do their own innovating.

If your mortgage interest rate is below around 4%, don't pay it off early. 
Money today is worth more than it is tomorrow and putting it in the stock market will get you returns bigger than what your interest rate is costing you.

Yes, but dealing with tenants is a headache I don't need and real estate is sky high right now anyway.
I'll take your advice under consideration, thank you.

Or maybe you're an actual trader so your point is moot.

You're the one not understanding. You'd still be paying higher taxes on the $50k after 200.

No way. They're only about 15 bucks apiece which is pretty good considering how secure and easy they are though.

Zoom out on the mempool and notice the only 2 times congestion got this bad was around the hard fork and now. Even with all this increased adoption.
You've got your head in the sand if you think there aren't malicious actors at play here. has been marveling at the blatant manipulation happening.
They're like T_D, they just care about being anti-core, no matter what the cost to crypto, even if it hurts them. Toxic individuals who can't just be happy with their own fork.

Pretty obscure reference, innit Jez?

I was talking about all the drama in May, when the mempool was even higher than it is now. With less adoption. Totally follows the pattern, too.

More FUD.
Go ahead and tell me how many people have commit access to Core. Now tell me how many of those are on the Blockstream payroll.

Who exactly developed 2X, and who do they work for, since you care so much?

Of course they have influence on Core, it's a group of devs who were there from the beginning and formed a company. Why do you think that's inherently a bad thing? 
Hint: It's not.

Ah yes, ad hominem attacks once you figured out Blockstream doesn't actually control Core after all. You've been fed lies and swallowed them with gusto, and I'd bet you'll continue spreading more FUD just like this.

They aren't "going their own way", they're rejecting women as loudly as possible in for some kind of retarded "revenge" or something as if women care. It's pathetic.
If they were really going their own way that sub would be filled with self-improvement articles instead of submissions demonizing women.
