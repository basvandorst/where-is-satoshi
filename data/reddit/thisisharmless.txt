Sure, neither do I, but what is your vision here?   Saying you want zero employees in the Treasury dept doesn't exactly seem serious to me.

Has it occured to you that when you buy an item w/ bitcoin, a merchant immediately converts it to fiat?  Buying items with bitcoin (the way it is being implemented by Coinbase, Paypal and others) then has the same effect as selling it on an exchange.  Marc Andreessen has said as much, that's why he invests in bitcoin companies, not bitcoin the currency.

Canada's only regulation will be to pronounce bitcoin 'bee-quoi' in Quebec.

The first country that adopts bitcoin as a legal tender (can pay all public and private debts including taxes) will have an interesting first mover position..
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:49:59
Well, considering the hundreds of millions of US citizens and businesses filing taxes, what number do you think is reasonable?
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:09:09
Did you really expect that level of clarity from the get-go?  The Treasury department alone has [~109,000 employees; 14k in DC alone](  I have confidence that most of the regulations can be solved in software (and make a good business).  The same rules apply for buying with gold, or general bartering.. tl;dr: freedom isn't free.

Taken with other movements by IBM it's an interesting announcement. That is all.
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:42:33
The comments here are surprising. Remittences and Forex have long been identified as promising for bitcoin - in a way, modernizing traditional money transmitters like Western Union.  This is pretty forward thinking of IBM. 
They are potentially going to use the sidechains proposed by blockstream.  
Not sure why people are talking about IBM attempting to be a 'centralizing authority' for bitcoin itself - I didn't read anything in the article about that.
Where did the smart people on this forum go? 
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:52:34
Consider that you might have missed the point..  
Think about what IBM could do with sidechains:

I believe it's called an "audit".  The feds can and will confiscate your assets if you don't follow the rules.

Lower bound if it accounts for a 1% fraction of M2 supply.

Good stuff. I have a feeling bitcoin will find a lot of use here.
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:10:44
I just don't see how you expected more.  This is a tech startup.  Do you expect them to act like white shoe bankers?  That will be after the greatest gains are gone.  And, dressing and speaking well does not equate to trust... 
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:07:26
That is a very good point.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:13:28
Not at all.  If you add more to the M2 estimate it would make the final result only higher.  I am looking for a lower bound on future BTC value.
@_date: 2013-06-29 05:07:15
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:38:07

@_date: 2013-11-07 19:21:29
Ouch, yes, thanks.  I recalculated for 1% of M2.
.01 * 10 Trillion = 100 Billion.
This puts a lower bound at $4.3k USD / BTC.
