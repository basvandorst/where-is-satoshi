With XThin Blocks 2MB propagation works  better than in case of 1MB without XThin Blocks.
Orphan rate and propagation latency is tightly bound to propagation time. Propagation time is amount of data needed to sent when block is found divided by bandwidth.
This is exact problem that XThin Blocks address. Prepare as much data as possible before so when block is found much less data can be sent.

Hardfork won't cause nodes to relay invalid transactions because they didn't update, SW softfork will.

Wallets don't need to be HF-enabled, although they need to be SF-enabled if we want to see any increase in throughput.

Yes, I can never remember how many satashi is one BTC or mBTC which I mainly use as it is the closest in value to real money.

If they couldn't reach agreement before (block size was supposed to be increased, 2-4-8 that wasn't far from being adapted) some pressure to make something with problem that was known to arise in future (now) is only a good thing.

Classic scaling plan is simple because in month they have to fix something people trusted Core to figure out in last 5 years.
Increasing block size was part of the plan either way, Classic just decided to make it now.

The hashrate argument hardly applies as most other concurrent cryptocurrencies use hash algorithms that are much more complex computationally. 1GH/s SHA-256!= 1GH/s scrypt != 1GH/s Ethash

The BIP 109 allows for 2MB block but limits the maximum sigops and hash operations to the current maximum one. Meaning maximum time spent on confirming 2MB blocks would be the same as 1MB blocks.
I suggest you read the BIP itself.

Seriously: Blocks are getting full, with regular fee ($0.04 for single sig, two output transactions) it is lottery when you get into chain. You will hear people say that they get their transactions confirmed in 10mins, which might happen, but really it will be bigger and bigger lottery and delays for regular users will be longer and longer.

In my country bank accounts are free, transactions are totally free (unless you want 15min express) also if you spend more then 25 Euro from debit card the card is also free.

As someone who gets DDoSed on weakly basis I can say that apart from hardening, using/buying DDoS protection and using hosting with prepared infrastructure (in my case it is OVH), there isn't much a legal actions can do.
Also getting DDoSed on VPS is much worst than getting attacked on dedicated server. Protecting other sub-servers on VPS infrastructure is more important for hosting providers, than one VPS that is getting DDoSed so they probably will null route your IP or at least filter it really hard.
Most popular, and simplest, attacks, UDP Flood and Amplified UDP Flood, are both untraceable without massive resources and connections. In case of Amplified UDP Flood you might want to talk to people whose services are used for amplification but in case of normal UDP Flood most commonly randomised source IP address is used.
As for hardening: drop connections on unused ports using iptables or nftables, increase conntracker connections count and some more complex I won't get into here.
TLDR: legal actions do not work.
