The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

That's just not what an investment is.

That idea is in every definition of the word I have ever seen.

So trying to invest is only for rich people. 


This isn't what investment means. An investment is made in the expectation of receiving a return on the capital.

This was an initiation of aggression per Rothbard:
*In short, Smith has the right to “blackmail” Jones. As in all voluntary exchanges, both parties benefit from such an exchange: Smith receives money, and Jones obtains the service of Smith’s not disseminating information about him which Jones does not wish to see others possess. The right to blackmail is deducible from the general property right in one’s person and knowledge and the right to disseminate or not disseminate that knowledge.*
A shady businessman initiating force on others without his customers being able to withdraw service due to information asymmetry? Why, it's almost like anarcho-capitalism is founded upon assumptions which don't hold true in reality!
Step into the light, an-caps. The state is a requirement for the rule of law, and the rule of law is necessary for liberty.

What do you think it says, internet libertarians, about the position of your ideology with respect to violence and authoritarianism, when the home of neo-conservatism is on your side?

It's more useful to talk about privately owned means of production rather than property per se, since capitalism is defined by the former rather than the latter. 
Privately owned means of production historically only existed beginning with the advent of states (specifically, the temple cities of Mesopotamia). Before that, as you said, the means of production (hunting grounds, forests, rivers) were not privately owned but held in common by the tribes (the tribes may have fought each other over them but that doesn't change the relationship within the tribes towards ownership of the commons). Personal property like baubles and clothes existed but these aren't capitalist phenomena. Recent examples of tribal societies traded this personal property, generally according to abstract principles of reciprocity and need rather than barter. That is, individuals in the tribe would keep a mental tally of who owed favours to whom (debt). The invention of money itself is due to the disappearance of these mental tallies due to the larger and more complex societies created with urbanisation and with the introduction of a class system. Money became a more formal way of accounting for debt. 
The class system was introduced by the conquest of one tribe by another for purposes of economic exploitation.
