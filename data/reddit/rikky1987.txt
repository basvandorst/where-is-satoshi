Bitcoin ATM in U.S. requires your ID scan (tried it myself). The Cash App that was mentioned in another thread requires your ID photo to withdraw BTC. The Circle Crypto App does not require any ID pics (as far as I know) and I personally use LocalBitcoins to buy with my Amex Serve card (!!!)you will need to get this card in the mail with your name on it before you can use Serve2Serve transfers though). The max that I ever needed to verify on LocalBitcoins was my cell number via text. But most sellers on there do not ask for any verification. Their system is pretty fool-proof against scammers.  I used Serve2Serve to buy and sell and also PayPal to sell. But they have many others like GooglePay, etc.

Yeah I used LocalBitcoins to sell and buy little sums of Bitcoin \(it is not worth it going through an exchange\). Here is [a list of sellers who sell **minimum $10 BTC**]( and all the different payment methods they accept. Just make sure you check they have clean reputation. And then recently Cash app \([ has added Bitcoin for U.S. users so you can buy with a U.S. bank issued debit card via Cash app too.

How? Even to register on GDAX is a real hurdle. They are part of Coinbase and who wants to use them with their draconian verification procedures. Just check Coinbase's reviews on Trustpilot to get a taste. I have BTC stuck in Coinbase  wallet that I cannot withdraw after I changed my phone number. I would use LocalBitcoins or if you got a US bank issued debit card, use Cash app. If you live outside the U.S. I am sure there are local electronic payment systems that integrated Bitcoin. Just Google it.
