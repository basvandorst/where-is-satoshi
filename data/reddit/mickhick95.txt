You may be confusing a fee with an exchange against a fee to use the bitcoin network. If you already know, then that's great.  
When you are using a crypto exchange to change your money from fiat into bitcoin there is usually a fee. That fee is some percentage that the exchange dictates. For example, a market buy on coinbase can cost you 1.49%.  
Now if you were to use the bitcoin network, there is a miner fee you pay to send your money from person A to person B. There has to be some incentive to keep mining after all the bitcoins are mined. The miner fee you pay, helps keep people verifying transactions. You set the miner fee to use the bitcoin network. It could be a couple Satoshis or a millibit, etc. Percrnt wise, it could be 0.00001%. 
If you have questions, ask. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:25:47

Coinbase wants to know its users personally. They have a "know your customer" (kyc) policy when signing up to their exchange. Coinbase requires a couple forms of ID. I supplied my driver's license, social security number, current residence, phone number, and my checking account info. So now coinbase knows who I am, and they can hand my info to the government if they so choose. Now my privacy is breached because when I convert USD to bitcoin, I need to send that bitcoin out of my coinbase account to a specific address. Coinbase already knows that I own my Coinbase account, so they assume that the bitcoin address I sent money to is also me. I kinda revealed my personal identity when purchasing bitcoin through coinbase. However there are ways to help regain your privacy, samourai wallet has a Ricochet transaction. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:44:45
The easiest way I can think of is using   from here, you can deposit $50 into it from your checking account. (which takes about 7 days). Then you can perform a limit buy order for a price that is lower than the current market price at the time. This will allow you to circumvent most fees. Once you have bitcoin in your coinbase pro account, you can withdraw it to your BRD wallet. You will only need to pay the bitcoin network mining fee. Ask me more if needed.

You are trusting that the company who is setting up these bitcoin notes is a reputable company. These notes only work if the company is not corrupt.  
  
For example, I have a Ledger, I am trusting that my ledger does not have a backdoor set up; where one day if Ledger decided to flip a switch, all my money in my hardware wallet would be sent to Ledger's wallet.  
  
What if these bitcoin notes have a backdoor set up in them?

So your specific use case, you want to hold the majority of your money on a hardware wallet, and then load spending amounts onto the card. If that is the way you want go go about it, I will support that decision.
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:28:51
I came here to say exactly this.
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:52:57
Lets take the company Wirex for example. You sign up for a Wirex account and purchase a Wirex card. You then send your bitcoins to the Wirex wallet. However this wallet is controlled by the Wirex company. You now have fallen into the "not your keys not your bitcoin" category. Wirex owns those keys not you; Wirex has given you a receipt saying "You have this much bitcoin". At any time, they can close up and not give you your money back.  
Lets switch gears to actually using the Wirex card. You go to a grocery store and swipe your Wirex card at the register. You have told Wirex to convert bitcoin into paper money and send it to the grocery store.  
The process is broken down into a few steps. You tell Wirex to send money to VISA, VISA then sends the money to the grocery store's bank, the grocery store's bank then sends the money to the grocery store (hopefully).  
Every time that money needs to exchange hands, those banks take a little cut. Wirex takes a cut of money when they convert bitcoin to paper money and send it to VISA. VISA takes a cut of that money and sends it to the grocery store's bank. The grocery store's bank takes a cut of that money before they send it to the grocery store's account. This is the crux of using a bitcoin credit card.  
However with bitcoin alone, you can just send money directly from your wallet to the grocery store's bitcoin wallet.  
I recommend storing your large sum of bitcoin in a hardware wallet and storing that in a safe place. Then get a mobile wallet and load enough money into the wallet that you are willing to spend on a day to day basis.  
Let's create an analogy.  
Currently, my real physical wallet contains 60 USD (paper cash) and my debit card.  
The 60 USD represents the money that can be stolen from me if I was physically robbed at gunpoint. This is similar to how a mobile wallet can be stolen from. You would only want to store a small amount of spending money on your mobile wallet.  
Next, the debit card's checking account refers to my hardware wallet. I store a large sum of money in my debit card's checking account. I don't walk around with that large sum of money in cash, on my person, on a day to day basis. I need to store that money in the bank, however with bitcoin, I want to store it in my hardware wallet.  
  
Overall, the process of using a Wirex card or a bitcoin debit card is a a way for institutions to create middle men and restrict your economic freedom.  If you have any questions please let me or r/bitcoin know.

Not a good idea. Just use a mobile wallet. You can fool people by making fake ones. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:29:13
If they don't have an internet connection they cant use bitcoin no matter what. Therefore, the bitcoin notes will be useless to them.  
In the case where there is a poor internet connection, that is still a connection, so they will be more suited to use a mobile phone bitcoin wallet.

If Satoshi ever came out, the bitcoin gig gets damaged. Why would people wanted to ruin this 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:29:52
How many Sats are we talking about? 100, 1000, 10000, 100000?  
When you establish a lightning channel, you send an on chain transaction to a multi-signature address. Which cost me recently a 500 Sat fee. I guess this is a long term solution for sending small amounts.  
If you just want to send Sats to your friends once, an on chain transaction at the moment is like 300 Sats. I think this is an optimal course of action.  
What do you think after reading this?

I absolutely agree. Also think about how hard it will be to give a loan to someone in BTC. The person giving the loan is going to really do their research on the customer. Loaners will possibly have their personal people knocking on doors asking for their money back.

People are desperate to sell USDT. Therefore they are willing to sell it for less and less. One person may sell it for 1 dollar, the next person may be desperate and sell it for 0.99 cents, then the pattern of undercutting continues. The price of USDT will continue to drop lower and lower. 
On the opposite end, this creates more buy demand for Bitcoin. People are more willing to purchase a bitcoin for higher and higher price.

Yeah I'm not too happy with that KYC policy. It was too long, complicated, and invasive. I don't know how much information they got from my license. I don't care so much about the $1,300 markup. The KYC is what ruined it for me. We need Bitcoin ATMs with no KYC.
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:33:16
I watched this video a while ago and it talks about quantum computing and wallets.
I don't think we need a fork to implement this at all. We can create stronger encryption by wrapping quantum proof encryption inside sha256 format. The bitcoin rules will be applied still. The wallets will need to implement upgrades tho. Kinda like talking an ipv6 address and wrapping it inside of an ipv4 address. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:43:35
Well your first problem is that you are trying to buy something on the deep web, and it sounds illegal. The second problem is that you are using a credit card. The credit card is probably linked to your social security number / identity in some way. Using the credit card will link the credit card transaction to the transaction on the blockchain. Use cash at an ATM or OpenBazaar if you want to stay fully anonymous. Also look up Samourai wallet's Ricochet transaction.

Security over your own money is very important. 
Also contributing to the bitcoin network with a full node is important. 
However, I would put obtaining a ledger over full node. That's just my opinion.  
Also buy the Ledger directly from ledger's website. Not a reseller. Shipping takes 2 months, from France.

The 21 million supply is a rule that was set. I believe so the geometrically declining supply function can distribute coins over long periods of time. If you need more units to transact, you can subdivide the smallest unit. Currently the lightning network subdivides a satoshi.

The whole "Don't trust, verify" philosophy requires you to run a full node and verify all the transactions yourself.  
When you do not run a node, you are offloading the trust to someone else.  
Therefore, you should only believe your self, and run your own full node.

I would start here: 
  
Requirements would be similar to the following:  
Computer with large hard drive 500 Gigabytes +  
Internet service  
Above average computer skills. On a scale of 1:10 where 1 is having no computer skills, and 10 is owning a computing company. Running a full node requires you have a skill level of 4.  A skill level of 4 would be able to use Google better than the average person.
  
  
To directly answer your question about coding, no you do not need to code.  
I will say that having bonus experience with Linux will make your full node more secure.  
You can run a full node on Windows, Mac, Linux, other.  
There are videos and resources on github, youtube, and bitcoin.org
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:26:14

I'm not really educated as much as I want to be in the investment side of things. Can someone tell me why there is a demand for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund? Does a Bitcoin ETF act like a receipt for bitcoin, or can I with draw my bitcoin ETF to a wallet? Are traditional investors already so deep in ETFs making them feel more comfortable with bitcoin ETFs than normal bitcoin on a wallet? I'm not even sure if i am asking valid questions. If someone could point me in the correct direction, I would appreciate it.

Some people are purchasing bonds with negative yield rates. Here is what a bond is, you loan the government money. Normally you would make money from a positive yield by the government paying you back. However with negative yield bonds, you loan the government money, then you keep paying them!  
  
Some banks like the ECB for example have a negative interest rate of about -0.05%. Some bonds have a yield of -0.03%. So locking your money into a bond will cost you less than keeping that money in a bank!

It depends if the wallet has been upgraded to recognize a bc1 address as a valid address to send to.  
Your Segwit wallet will recognize legacy addresses as a valid address to send to.  
Older wallets, aka legacy wallets, won't recognize the bc1 address as a valid address and not let you send it out.  
  
Kinda like how a square is also classified as a rectangle, however not ALL rectangles can be classified as squares.  
Segwit is square, the rules are tighter.

Quick maths.  
(21,000,000 btc / 0.1 btc per person) = 210,000,000 people who can own 0.1 btc.  
  
210,000,000 people / 7,000,000,000 people on the planet = 0.03 x 100% = 3%. 
  
Effectively, owning 0.1 btc guarantees you a spot in the wealthiest 3% of people on the planet.

One of the core principles of bitcoin is to hold your own money. You are doing the opposite by giving binance all your money. Not your keys, not your coins. To help ensure a decentralized network, hold your own coins. Binance has not robbed you today, but they can rob you tomorrow. Do it for yourself and hold your own keys.

Bitcoin has a finite supply, 21,000,000 coins. It is more scarce than gold.  
  
Value is based upon who uses a currency. In the USA, I won't accept a euro because no one is using the euro in the USA. I can use a Bitcoin everywhere, Bitcoin is border less.  
  
The united states has awful credit, it has defaulted on countries and the debt is out of control which will never be paid off. There is no faith in the US government because they will never pay off the massive debt. Rome fell, so will the US.  
  
People are using Bitcoin more and more. People who are held hostage in countries are escaping oppression by switching to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin is performing more and more transactions every day. More people are joining the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is doing almost as many transactions as Master Card. Look up the size of the block chain and how much it has grown over the past year.

Bitcoin is a protocol for trust over a network, without a central authority. Bitcoin is a promise that your money will move from point A to point B with no interruption. Bitcoin is also a promise that no money can be lost, the entire money supply is tracked. Bitcoin is transparent, meaning that every person in the world can see every single transaction and verify the validity of that transaction themselves. Bitcoin has no debt. Bitcoin is open, anyone can innovate on top of bitcoin without permission. Bitcoin is border less, it exists in every country connected to the internet. Bitcoin is censorship resistant, where it can not be shut down because of the mesh network topology. Bitcoin is neutral, meaning that it does not exclude any person; you don't even need to be human to use bitcoin.  
  
Bitcoin is the greatest humanitarian movement the modern world has ever seen.

With the lightning network smart contracts can be built where one person accepts BTC and the other accepts XMR. Then use atomic multi-path payments (amp) to effictively pay in Bitcoin but your recipient receives XMR. You can use Bitcoin your whole life and not know that you have paid people in the coin of their choice.

Bitcoin has more scarcity than gold. What you think is a weakness is actually a strength.  
The concept can be copied, and that is the purpose of being an open protocol. Alt coins are only worth what their users make it to be. Just because an alt coin comes out and claims it can do xyz, it only has value if people use it. The alt coins which are copycats of Bitcoin do not have as much value because no one uses them.    
To relate this concept to the USD, the dollar has value because people use the dollar everywhere. There is a value in the network of people which use the dollar.
  
Bitcoin has value because numerous people use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account. The network of people who use Bitcoin is growing and growing.
  
The users are changing from the dollar network to the Bitcoin network.

When people transact on the Bitcoin network, those transactions get aggregated into a block of transactions. The cumulative transaction fees will be paid towards the miner after successfully adding that block of transactions to the blockchain.  
If all 21 million bitcoins are mined, the block reward from mining won't pay out. (currently the block reward is 12.5 bitcoins) However the transaction fees will still be paid to the miners after all 21 million bitcoins are mined.     
  
Transaction fees are an incentive to keep mining bitcoin after all 21 million bitcoins have been mined.

2. Click Send.
3. Click the address field so my phone's keyboard comes up.
4. Lock the phone.
5. Wait about 30 minutes or so.
6. Unlock the phone.  
Samourai Wallet opens fully, bypassing the Samourai pass code. If someone fished me and unlocked my phone they would have full access to the wallet. They can complete a transaction to fully drain my wallet.    
  
I also opened Samourai Wallet, left it on the home screen, locked the phone for 30 minutes, and when I opened my phone, Samourai Wallet prompted me for my Samourai pass code.

For those who are unfamiliar.  
  
Watchtowers and backups - to provide maximum safety for the funds of Lightning users, “watchtowers” will monitor the blockchain for invalid channel transactions. Typically, Lightning nodes need to be online in order to protect against these events, but watchtowers provide this protection for nodes that have intermittent connectivity, e.g. mobile phones. Even for connected nodes, watchtowers can serve as a secondary line of defense in the face of unplanned service outages.
Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) - allow large Lightning transactions to be divided into a series of smaller transactions as they’re sent over the Lightning Network, but in such a way that they’re automatically joined back together. The user sees only the total amount of the transaction, without needing to be aware that AMP is being used behind the scenes. AMPs also ease the mental burden of using channels, allowing a user to interpret their balance readily as the sum of balances in channels. This is made possible by the ability to send and receive an AMP-like payment over multiple channels, at both source or sink.

I checked that I am port forwarding 8333 to the proper IP.  
From the raspibolt tutorial:  
  
I have used the settings for uncomplicated fire wall


$ sudo su  
$ ufw default deny incoming  
$ ufw default allow outgoing  
$ ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22 comment 'allow SSH from local LAN'  
$ ufw allow proto udp from 192.168.0.0/24 port 1900 to any comment 'allow local LAN SSDP for UPnP discovery'  
$ ufw allow 9735  comment 'allow Lightning'  
$ ufw allow 8333  comment 'allow Bitcoin mainnet'  
$ ufw allow 18333 comment 'allow Bitcoin testnet'  
$ ufw enable  
$ systemctl enable ufw  
$ ufw status  
$ exit  
Do the firewall settings here restrict my phone from connecting to my node? I would think the settings are correct because I am connecting from my phone via port 8333 to my node.

Oh I see what you are saying. Currently, people live in different countries because they don't like the laws established in other countries.  
The model for a decentralized government could work on a planet scale, if the human race was a muli-planetary species.
But for now, I would be content with a decentralized government for something the size of an average country.  
I think that would be very beneficial.  
To be honest, there could be hundreds of these decentralized countries.  It could possibly be a more efficient way to live.

A Bitcoin hardware wallet will generate you a wallet with the proper public and private keys while never being connected to the internet.  
The part about not being connected to the internet is important.  That means that no one has a hint as to finding your public and private key combo.  
Hardware wallets are also called cold wallets; because their private key has never had access to a device with the internet.  
As opposed to a hot wallet; some wallet like a mobile wallet, or a wallet on a computer, which has access to the internet and possible malware.  
The term hot wallet comes from a wallet being generated on an insecure device connected to the internet.
Think of the hardware wallet as the safe you store all your valuables in the basement. And your mobile wallet as your purse which holds about $100 USD spending money.  
You would normally take money out of the safe and put it into your purse when you want to go shopping. You don't want to walk around with your entire life savings as you go to the grocery store.
Overall, for long term storage; you don't want a hot wallet, you want a cold wallet, aka hardware wallet.
Here is a link to Ledger wallets support page, about why you should have a hardware wallet. You can also buy a hardware wallet from them.
Here is a link to Trezor's hardware wallet.  
I recommend that you purchase a hardware wallet and store any amount of crypto on it.  
If you have any questions, let me know.

To uphold decisions you need a Judiciary system. If we were to do that decentralized there has to be some way for a network of people to properly interpret the law and uphold it.  
The enforcers could be the current police we have today, they just uphold the rules people vote on.  
  
However, possibly dystopian as it sounds, a network of robot enforcers. They will hold up the law, making sure the people are following the rules.  
How these robots are made, are with the decentralized production systems.  Like a super advanced 3D printer, imagine it could print out a police robot. That robot then connects to a decentralized network that upholds the law.  If you don't like the law, don't produce a robot.  
I am just randomly spitballing. But hopefully it stirs peoples minds.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:50:33

Think of some open source super advanced 3D printer in every person's home. It is powered by the homeowner's solar power or something.  This printer is also maintained by the homeowner.  
The printer requires materials, those materials could be anything, the super printer will perform nuclear physics or something to make the atoms it needs.
This printer can print out everything, advanced things like computer processors and even less advanced things like wooden spoons.  
In order to print something, you purchase a key from a retailer pertaining to a specific product. The key contains the "blueprint" for the object/device you want to make, and your ability to make it a specific number of times.    
Then the printer will build your object. 
Because we are using a super printer, the specifications for a device are already taken care of.  
This super 3D printer will be able to make items on the spot and not require distribution.  
Thinking forward, we might actually not even need a decentralized distribution system because everything is produced in house.
We are far from this technology, but it is achievable,

The Loop service, says Bosworth, is helpful for managing liquidity because “it sidesteps the liquidity problem for Lightning, which is that you can’t do flow rebalancing. If you run out of channel capacity in one direction, there’s no possibility that you can get more in a totally self contained, only-Lightning world. You need to go outside in order to rebalance.”
So, the natural step for users to mitigate this problem today is to perform a swap, which occurs on-chain and thus requires a transaction fee — and transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain can be quite substantial. With the alpha version of Loop available to the public, Bosworth and Lightning Labs had to think about how to make managing liquidity as efficient as possible.
Making Liquidity More Efficient
To address this issue, Bosworth developed a concept called “Hyperloop” as a next step toward solving this problem. Hyperloop is a concept that aggregates swaps so that individual transactions don’t occur on-chain with individualized signatures and outputs. Hyperloop batches inputs together using a method called signature aggregation.
“With signature aggregation, if you can manage to get a bunch of people all together to sign cooperatively, you can take the normal signature cost of moving funds on-chain from however many parties there are on-chain to one signature. I don’t think there’s any limitation to that.”
While this saves costs, one of the requirements is cooperation between many parties over a short period of time, which can be more challenging than it sounds.

FYI - legal tender only means that the government must accept the currency as payment. Businesses have the right to refuse a countries legal tender. A united states store can refuse to accept USD, which is perfectly legal. That same business could accept bitcoin and refuse to accept USD, which would also be legal.
