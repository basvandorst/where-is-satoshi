depends where you are resident.. but maybe coinbase.com.

Get an account with  and then use it to send EUR to kraken.com. They charge £2.49 per SEPA transfer and 0.5% for converting GBP to EUR.

It amazes me that people keep asking this question.. but yes you can just withdraw into the deposit address on the other site.

well circle isn't allowing bitcoin purchases anymore, so no big loss.

Is there any measure of how much of the [currently segwit signaling]( hash power is BIP148 ? standard core ? or segwit2x? With around 48% signaling for segwit, if a significant portion of that were BIP148 then it seems likely to succeed.. if it's all core or segwit2x then perhaps we have some way to go..

maybe  but bitpanda.com is fine too also kraken.com, bitstamp.net and zyado.com

Typically bitcoin atms only take cash (not cards). while some have been made that do accept cards, I don't think many of them are in operation and I doubt you'll ever see one. There are some online sites where you can buy with a card and the fees are probably always going to be higher than a standard atm cash advance.

Basically the miners will activate segwit 1MB and then fork off to their own 2MB network, where everyone will dump their coins for a quick profit.

If BIP91 isn't pulled at the last minute - then segwit2x BIP91 should force BIP141 activation.
If we get into BIP148 with 20-25% UASF hashpower included in 51% generic BIP141 hashpower that seems very likely to activate BIP141 as well... making it even less likely for segwit2x to abandon BIP91, since it would activate anyway under BIP148 if they did.
It seems like a done deal to me, but many prominent community commentators are taking a very cautious approach for some reason.. maybe there is another shoe to drop still.
On the other hand, maybe you're right and everyone will suddenly decide to adopt vanilla core (or I suppose some combination of core and others) and we get an organic 95% BIP141 without any forced orphaning of dissenters. That's what happened with litecoin after all.

I think you can probably use bitstamp.net - it's not the most convenient (no bank ACH - only wire transfers) - but should work.. there's of course always [localbitcoins](

There's no laws that apply to you.. there might be something in your relative's employment contract that stipulates they need to notify their compliance department about trades done by their family.. although if you just don't tell your family member you made a trade I don't see how they could be held responsible.

not really, because then it wouldn't be bitcoin.. the developers can't change what's installed on my computer. some people would like to do that and try and get everyone to switch over to the new coin that would result.. but then again why doesn't everyone just switch to zcoin or litecoin.. or any of the 700 other altcoins.

gemini does accept canadian customers, but they don't have any CAD orderbooks and I dont think there are any convenient deposit/withdrawal methods.. you're probably stuck with SWIFT wire transfers and their associated fees and fx slippage. You could open a USD account.. some Canadian [banks]( offer them with ACH access.. I have not tried this, but it probably would work well.

Imo it would be nice to get paid in BTC, but I doubt your employer would honour the contract if BTC went up significantly anyway.

the hard fork is a non-starter.. hope for a clean softfork or uasf.

 is good for depositing to kraken in EUR (and other EUR exchanges - but not coinbase). Yes, it supports GBP too, but dont bother with that.. the fees and lack of liquidity make it not worth while.
