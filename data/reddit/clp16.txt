Thanks! Love to know what you think. We're also on twitter  if you want to let us know there. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:10:03
You get your change back immediately if you want or we have a timer that refunds you in an hour at the latest so you don't have the think about remembering to get your bitcoin back. 
Love to hear how it goes!
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:45:18
How about a site like Gyft? Since you can buy a gift card to a ton of stores, does that factor into your decision or is more about being able to support your local stores and encouraging them to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:40:41
That's awesome! Glad you liked it!
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:59:09
Also not to self promote but yeah I'm going to self promote, because it's factually wrong. We made it plausible and possible to buy that latte already at Starbucks at  It's important that everyone knows his statement is wrong. I emailed him to let him know. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:00:22
We transfer the remaining balance off that card.
If want to continuing buying something at Starbucks, you can just select "load more" when you are finished to continue using it.

Really happy to see so much support. I'm friends with the folks behind Jerry. They're the best people to hangout with and really care. Some of the best designers and engineers I know!

Right now we are using Coinbase, so that's an easy way to get your refund. 
But for those not with Coinbase, we send your refund back to the email you enter. Hope that clears things up.

We're a small company and we've got developers who have more experience with iOS. Because of this, we wanted to make sure that what we made was really good. Venturing into new technologies won't let us do that, but if we can make it work really well for iOS, we'll be ready to find the best people to make Fold great for Android too. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 01:58:23
Sweet! 
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:43:12
We don't support the use of a current starbucks accounts at the moment. Though the 20% off is a greater deal than what the rewards program offers, but we understand that the rewards program is really important. We're still thinking how we might integrate that into our service in coin for coffee or in Fold in the future. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:36:40
We built it to work in the US first but we haven't tested outside yet. We'd love to test it but haven't got a chance to do so yet.

Sorry I got caught in my product/software person parlance. I didn't mean that Android is new or untested, just that our skill set as developers is better for iOS at the moment. We're working to find the best Android people we can but learning a new environment like Android is a good way to create a bad initial product.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:15:06
We would love to do that. Although, at Coin for Coffee, we're working out of Atlanta, I'm originally from Mass and couldn't agree with you more!

We're working to let you spend your bitcoin at shops like Starbucks and Target and other retail stores. You can check out our prototype at coinforcoffee.com. You load up your desired amount of btc in USD and scan it at the register. Let me know what you think of it. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:35:18
Internet comments are never great. Actually they are like the dregs, but I think it's really exciting to get a site like Lifehacker to actually write about places where people can start spending bitcoin. Their readership is probably a good crossover of early adopters and more mainstream folks.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:45:28
It's just a warning, and you should be able to click past it. If it's more than this, that's definitely not our intention. Would you mind posting a screenshot so we can fix it if it's a bug?

Hi. One of the founders here. 
Yep we load your bitcoin and let you use it at any Starbucks location and then refund the difference.  
Let me know if you have any questions. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:01:03
Yep. This post sums up my general thoughts for why we've been working on coinforcoffee and eventually Fold. They are mobile payment apps that we are building so that people can go to everyday retail stores. You can learn more about what we're doing at coinforcoffee.com and foldapp.com. Bitcoin has been a super difficult space to work in, and that's been the really exciting part. We're hoping we can be part of the solution to get everyone excited. 
Edited - Grammar
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:18:46
Yeah we do it already! There is a deal going on for 10% off if you use coinforcoffee.com/hn
Edit - Also want to mention we just launched and US only atm. We'll try to expand soon. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:46:02
We give you back your change immediately or in an hour at the latest to the refund email you enter when you use the app. It'll be delivered through coinbase, our payment provider, and you can transfer it from there to wherever you like. 
We'd love to know if it works in Switzerland!
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:57:44
We built it first to work in the US market, but to perfectly honest we aren't sure which countries it works in yet. We would love it if people tested it out. We just had someone use it in Canada, which was awesome!

Unfortunately not yet, but that's something we're looking into doing. If it's a really important feature, definitely let us know and we'll move it higher on our TODO list. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:36:57
Once you've loaded up your Starbucks barcode, it should scan and work immediately like any other card. There might be a slight delay waiting for the card to load up and we're working on reducing that time. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:02:48
A country list is a really great idea! We'll definitely work on more location testing go forward. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:57:39
One of founders here. Users from all over the world have used the app without any problem. We've heard of success stories from the UK and the Netherlands, so hopefully that means it works in other parts of Europe. 
The one caveat is we do show the current value in USD, which is something we still need to handle and will hopefully be fixed when we release out iOS app Fold (foldapp.com).
We haven't gotten a chance to test it everywhere in person, but we'd love it if you guys gave it a try and let us and everyone else know!
@_date: 2014-08-02 01:55:59
What email did enter in the payment form for refunds? It should be sent back to that email via a Coinbase account if you don't already have one. You can then transfer the money from there. We can't refund it right back to your wallet yet, but we're working on making the experience more seamless. Glad you liked it :)
You can send me a message or an email at corbin [at] cardforcoin [dot] com if you're still having problems. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:35:52
We built it to first work in the US, but we're finding out if it works in other countries. We think it works in Canada, but we'd love it if people test it and let us know if it works or not.

The performance has been an issue for a while and we're hoping to to get it better and better, but yeah I can understand if it's a bummer to have to plan ahead. 
When we release Fold(foldapp.com), our iOS app and eventually our Android app, the speed should be really quick.

Really cool! I went by to the Goat Farm today and played with it a bit. Looks really cool, but maybe a touch slow. Do you know what the hardware is? We might be looking at using it next time we're over on the west side. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:50:36
Cool. We're more focused on the bigger retailers, but I know what you mean. It would be cool for local shops to accept bitcoin. The risk to them is a little high though, so it's not always easy to convince them of the benefits. Really appreciate your feedback!
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:44:37
We're thinking of expanding to other shops like Target, Walmart and CVS. Are those places you would want to use bitcoin?

I haven't used any of the services so I don't think my opinion carries much weight. I did find Kraken to be intimidating. I've met the people who work there, and they seem like nice, intelligent people. Maybe it's focused on being a platform for serious traders?

That's really awesome to hear. What about the starbucks app makes it more difficult? Also hopefully you'll get to use the discount this time around!
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:25:42
We started off building Card for Coin back in early 2014. It was and still is a gift card/bitcoin exchange. 
We then saw there was a huge gap in the space for using bitcoin in the real world, so we built Coin for Coffee as an experiment to use bitcoin at Starbucks. It was a huge success last summer, so we decided to build it out as it's own product and rename it Fold. That's a brief history of the company.
As for the team, Matt, Chris and myself have been friends since we were undergrads in CS at Georgia Tech. Matt and I have done another startup together and Chris has worked on projects for us for years now. I'm sure if you look hard enough, our old, terrible college projects are still out there somewhere!

@_date: 2015-04-17 00:51:43
This is our full time job. We've been at this since last year and want to build something great for bitcoin. 
We trade bitcoin for gift cards at our other website, cardforcoin.com. We exchange for lower rates than 20% off and pass that on to customers of Fold. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:00:21
Unfortunately not at the moment. We haven't been able to link up your current Starbucks account to our app, but it's something many customers have requested and we're looking into it. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:52:44
Up front, I want to make a couple points clear that I also mention in the blog. The sampling for this data is not statistically significant, and it's going to be skewed very heavily toward early adopters. That being said, I was very surprised to see iPhone beating out Android. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:02:32
We haven't tested it yet, but potentially it works in Hong Kong. We've confirmed that it works in US, Canada, and the UK. 
Potentially they also work in Australia, Thailand, Singapore and Mexico, but we haven't tested them yet. 
If you get a chance to test it, let us know. We're giving away bounties.

Which stores would you want to see us add to Fold?
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:48:35
We're definitely working on implementing the bip70 protocol so we can work with the wallets that work with it. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:37:19
It's in the works! Working on it today in fact. There will be an Android app as well
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:34:08
Yep. We definitely will. It won't be as big as the Starbucks one, but it should still be pretty good. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:49:31
We're working on adding more denominations. We started out with smaller fixed amounts to make the user experience simpler and the engineering easier. 
The tip bot integration is an interesting idea! I don't think we've thought of that as a way to add funds to Fold. We've got some gifting ideas we've been playing with and have some exciting developments coming soon. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:09:55

We're wary of publishing our customer data. We'd definitely would anonymize it and aggregate it, but I'm wondering if you guys are OK with us posting stats of your usage and which stats would be OK or not OK to publish.
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:25:03
We work in the US, UK, Hong Kong, Australia, and Canada. Possibly Fold also works in Mexico and Singapore, but we haven't been able to confirm that. 
Sorry that it doesn't work in Japan yet. Getting the system working with all the different Starbucks systems around the world is definitely in our product road map!
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:15:25
You're welcome. Well besides shamelessly plugging Fold( which is still in beta, I really like what Paul Puey and the guys at Airbitz are doing. 
Also the guys at  are doing an Acorn-type app but for bitcoin. Really cool idea for spare change. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:26:43
Love to hear your feedback after you use it!
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:11:44
To your gifting point, we've been working on a few ideas around that and will have some exciting announcements in the not too distant future. 
As for using Fold later, we really wanted to build an experience that made it super quick and simple to load up bitcoin when you needed to use it, and send it back to your wallet when you didn't need to use it. When you do make a purchase, your session is saved and any purchases attached to that session persist. Logging in with an email or Twitter will let you recover those purchases for latter if you are logged out. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:52:56
Right now, the discount is indefinite. In the future, we are playing around with the idea of doing rewards instead of discounts. For instance, get 20% bitcoin back for spending or other rewards. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:07:01
At Fold, we give a 20% discount to everything bought at Starbucks. Check it out at  You don't even need to make an account. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:14:06
We send back all the dust, even when the transfer fee is larger than the remaining balance. Your funds are your funds, and you should get it all back. That's something we fundamentally believe as a company. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:49:40
We've confirmed that Fold works in the US, Canada, the UK and Hong Kong. We think it can also work in Australia and Mexico, but those areas aren't confirmed. Where are you located?
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:40:17
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:21:53
We're still a small team, but we do trade shifts and are up nearly 24 hours a day to answer questions. (Software dev hours :)
That's a good point to publish more of our company and team information. For the sake of transparency, our address is 318 Cherokee Ave Ste 107 Atlanta GA 30312. 
As far as we can tell with our limited testing, Fold works in Starbucks in the US, Canada, the UK, and Hong Kong. We think it might work in Mexico and even Australia, but we don't have confirmations of that quite yet.

@_date: 2015-04-10 22:59:11
Nope. We designed it so you can just send bitcoin to an address and pay. The Twitter login just makes it easier for us to remember your refund address when we send you your cash back. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:40:02
No. We purchase secondary market gift cards through our other business cardforcoin.com. Much like other gift card exchanges, we purchase the cards at a discount and then pass those savings on to users of Fold.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:27:00
We use the Coinbase spot price at the point that the order is created. We've been thinking about the best way to show that in the user interface without adding too much clutter. 
I'm just happy people want to learn more about what we're doing! Also as engineers, we tend to build more than doing storytelling, so that runs us into trouble at times :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:31:44

You should drop by the Boost accelerator office if you got the time. There are a bunch of us bitcoin companies here, and it'll give you a good sense of what people are trying to do in the space. And it's always fun to talk shop :)
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:05:40
We've worked to make it easy to simply scan the barcode, which at Starbucks, we've seen is a behavior that most folks behind the counter are comfortable with. But you are right that we have to create a better set of instructions for new users to feel more comfortable. Also there is an issue when there is no scanner at the Starbucks. You can also tell the cashier the card number, but we haven't made that clear, so we'll definitely add something like that. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:50:18
Thanks! Please let us know what you think of the app after you go tomorrow. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:19:15
Good point. Being more transparent and being more communicative is definitely a goal of ours. 
We're currently working on rolling out several other brands that we visit all the time. Places like Target, Whole Foods, etc. that people visit every week and use bitcoin. 
The community is growing larger every week and we've just had our best week yet! I'd love to hear your feedback if you get a chance to use the app.

I get that ChangeTip isn't "real" bitcoin, but Facebook and Whatsapp isn't "real" Internet but they have been a huge way for people in areas that are newly exposed to the Internet to understand the power of it.

I'm pretty sure I'd get those quizzical looks from them again lol
