Bitcoin doesn't care about your feelings.
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:00:33
One of these crypto-groups with nigerian people, telling you can make 100k a week with only 1000$ investment?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:05:12
@_date: 2019-06-02 11:31:14
Yes for some it is.
I'm very happy with fiat money in daily situations.
I just trade crypto for profits, bc profits garant me a better life.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:27:46
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:17:09
Why lol?
Just buy the dip and hodl, right?
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:55:44
What's wrong with profittaking?
Most people trade cryptos for profit not for "muh liberty" and hodl-circlejerk.
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:46:52
Yeah, i think a 99% drop will be a very nice correction.
And we need that correction every week!
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:03:04
Ok, you think big institutins doesn't care about Money loss, as long as they can show how inovative they are.
Makes sense to me...
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:18:34
Uuuuh, it's a conspiracy from your government. 
I hope you wear your thin foil hat!
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:40:24
Yes, hodling is much better!
2018 was a great year for hodling!
You want to buy the dip? Why you haven't buy the last time BTC was on 8500,or 8000 or whatever?
You guys would post your hodl memes even the Btc goes down to 10$.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:31:45
Because no one can now where the bitcoin stands in 1 Week, 1 Month or 1 Year if 30 minutes are enough to drop the price 20+%.
Do you think that realy big institutions are interest in a currency that can lost 20+% of its value in 30 Minutes? I don't think so.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:49:54
No my mother tongue is German and Thai, so i hope you agree with people not speaking your own language perfectly.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:54:35
I had cryptos before since 2015 or smt, but in december 2018 i put 100k in Btc.
But now i'm done...
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:41:28
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:15:31
Now we go to the Moooon!!!
Minimum 33'000 till 5 pm!
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:08:52
It's the internet.
Good behaviour is not recommended.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:28:14
Yes of course.
You "I'm happy for the loss, because i will buy the dip"-people, are the real Idiots.
Do you had sell'd everything in this 30 Minutes the bitcoin go's from 7900 to 6300?
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:23:52
Yes of course!
This -200 red candles really looks like a golden-super-duper-Bullrun!
Every fucking hour someone posts some shit about "THe BulLrUn WiLl StARt EVerY sECoNd"
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:29:31
The reality is: Bitcoin is NOT on a rise, it goes down, we are on 8565 now.
You guys can scream "Bullrun" as often as you want, just screamin "bUllRun" "BuLLrUn" doesn't make it better, it just looks stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:29:14
Just shut your stupid mouth...
@_date: 2019-05-30 08:11:11
BSV just had a Flashcrash from 234$ to 44.7.
Play stupid games, win stupid prices.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:50:28
Yes i complain about volatility.
Bc Bitcoin has no value, as long as it can go up and down 500$ in 5 Minutes, it's just fucking useless.
What shold i make? Hodl till the end?
I have to much money in it tho sacrifice my money for a mindless Hodl- and "Bullrun starts in 5 Minutes"-religion.
I had big hopes in Bitcoin, i hoped it gets stable because of the big institutions, but nothing changed.
No one can say how much a BTC will be worth next week, tomorow, or in an hour.
To read every 10 Minutes "The big Bullrun is just minutes away" even maximze the frustration.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:09:51
Oh yeah, Bitcoin is a reddit thing!
If you're not long enough on ReDDit, you can not have cryptos.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:47:04
You know nothing about cryptos.
Haveing 50$ on Bitcoin and make every 2 minutes a post about hodl an bullrun, dosn't makes you an expert.
I have 40'000$ Dollar in Bitcoin since november 2018 and know the charts since 2013.
With that value the drop affects me a little bit more than you. 
Maybe you shold spend your pocket money in someting else and stop making idiotic coments on reddit about your "expertise"
Go play some videogames kid.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:23:51
A few days ago, i write that i have enough from the crypto shit, and taked my 100k out, and everyobe was tell me i'm an Idiot, "tHE BUll  MArKet Is CoMMinG RiGHt NoW" and other bullshit.
And now i'm more than happy that i take out at 7900.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:44:24
Yes, it's gone back to 224, but the run is over.
Check the Orderbook on Bitfinex if you want.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:58:40
Oh yeah, get a life you fucking looser.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:08:06
Tell me, what do you have from holding BTC forever?
I'm doesn't give a fuck, about "Muh freedom from Goverment and fiat money".
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:14:43
Gold is also finite and don't has a volatile +-200 Usd every 30 Minutes.
Also there is no danger that gold will fall 20% in 30 Minutes.
The volatile is the bigest problem, i can send instant 500 Dollar to anyone in the world but how can you use something that is only 450 worth 10 minutes after sending it?
I never wold sell something for a currency that can be 20% less worth in 30 Minutes.
Crypto will never replace fiat in any way.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:01:35
Oh, you think you win an internet discussion on reddit? 
If this makes your tiny dick hard, then i feel sorry for you fatty
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:50:30
And 2017 it was on 20'000, then goes down to 3500 and now on 8000. 
If you had pull out on 18'000 you had make'd a massive win. 
Please explain you'r "hodl till the end"-strategie to me, bc all what i see is a big loss.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:51:29
I'm done with this Kryptobullshit. 
Im Holding since december 2018 and this up and down without any reason makes me sick!
I pull out my 100k and never go back to kryptotrash again.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:28:02
I just want to make some Money. 
I don't care about "Muh freedom and shiiiet"
If the Bitcoin rise at the level i prefer, i will pull out and never use Cryptos again.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:56:27
Bla bla bla again: just shut your stupid mouth.
It's worthless to discuss with a fucking internet hero.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:35:17
You're right.
I'm also sick and tired about Idiots screaming "Bullrun is comming" every 5 seconds, bc they have bought some BTC for 20$ and hope to get a Lamborghini next Month.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:43:31
Who's the idiot now?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:34:35
Oh yeah, if you're not on reddit you know nothing about Bitcoin!
Reddit is the Church of Bitcoin, looking 3 years on stupid memes and idiotic hodl religion makes you an expert on Bitcoin.
I'm just sick and tired of people like you, who knows a bullshit about cryptos and just have a big mouth.
