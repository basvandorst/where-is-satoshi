What are they doing wrong? I don't disagree, just curious of others reasons...

That's the smartest thing I've heard all day.

Agreed. Clearly YOU were spruiking cold wallet storage methods while we all just put our btc online like idiots.  
Buy 10,000 dogecoin then tell me if you start leaving them around on exchanges etc.

MySpace was the SHIT. then Facebook rolled along. Apples and oranges but the seed for MySpace was social networks but it's delivery languished. In fact I never understood the attraction to MySpace. Facebook is ubiquitous now because the delivery worked so well. When the community attacks it's own development team though it's pretty fucking clear there's no love for Bitcoin on the whole; Andreas is a Demi-God at the moment. Why? Because he "stood up to the govt and got applauded!". This fractured community is going to have a tough time holding up to corporate competition in the space. 
In fact I wouldn't look at it as just one option being the winner. We have Facebook, Twitter, Reddit; all serving different demographics and purposes. Currency will not adopt a new world order. It'll be modeled on the same shit as the past; secured with a Blockchain is nearly a certainty, but know that a well funded corporate think tank with a well paid development team could deliver a similar functionality and then use their deep pockets to initially incentivize miners to secure the network. The facade of community will crumble as soon as the price is better somewhere else. The fickleness has proven itself time and time again and all it really takes is selling the Bitcoin Bulls on headed to the moon quicker to buy them.
Of course the details will not match exactly, but rest assured the Reddit Bitcoin community would leave en masse at the slightest splash of a bearwhale. How do I know? Because the bearwhale doesn't warrant attention if you believe your community controls the market with its effort! The bearwhale is a nice analogy to how easily corporate interests will be able to use financial leverage to overrun/buyout Bitcoin; offer the moon if you're buying Bitcoin out, cripple it if you're competing. The Pal of the majority is Pay after all!

Wow, that's bad. It's could've been much more malicious.
