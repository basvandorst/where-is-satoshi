It would be cool if he posted the address he transferred the btc to.

I've said it before, I'll say it again.
He already weighed in back in 20-whatever.  He said the block size limit was meant to be temporary.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:54:23
He actually did.  He said that the block size limit was intended to be temporary.

What is the US dollar backed by?
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:34:52
Fuck BFL.
I ordered a 25 GH/s on dec 20 because it said "in stock immediate shipping" for $1250.  No word from them other than taking my money.  Then a couple days ago I saw they dropped the price for the 50 GH/s miner to 950, and is "in stock".  I've emailed and called many times.  No word, and no miner.  The thing is going to be useless by the time it arrives.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:08:17
yes that's exactly right.
and if I understand your question correctly, then yes.  If an attacker found a vulnerability in bitstamp's network/application/spear phishing/whatever, they would be able to gain access without 2FA.

This is cool and everything, but serious question.. How does blockchain.info make money? Just wondering where the money to reimburse is coming from...?
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:54:41
I don't see any way this could possibly go wrong.

if you need help unfucking this, PM me.  In case nobody has told you yet, DONT SEND ANYONE YOUR WALLET.DAT.  Even if they're offering to help.  That includes me.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:52:12
there's actually a shitload more.  Since the password is 4 UTF-8 "characters", the actual length (in bytes) of the password can a bit longer, which adds a metric fuck-ton to the keyspace.  Not to mention that it's not limited to 62-characters when using UTF-8 encoding.
Just further reinforcing your point.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:24:37
So by that rationale, gold is worthless since you can't pay your taxes with it?
Makes no sense.

Serious question... 
Would this be illegal in Florida?

serious question - what had he done back that to make your grandfather not trust him?  I'm not doubting or anything (obviously he was right), I was just genuinely curious.  I looked at his wikipedia page and the stuff he worked on then seemed pretty benign.

on a total unrelated-to-bitcoin-note, that was completely awesome.  the amount of engineering that went into making that happen is mind-boggling.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:18:04
I'm kind of out of the loop here, but charging 60 cents to send almost $200 doesn't seem too incredibly horrible.  If not like this, how should the business cover operating costs?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:50:09
Well thank God they're protecting the users!
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:30:04
That was the most glorious thing I have ever read.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:05:08
No. :)
It's based on faith in the dollar. The is dollar has value only because people accept that it does.
We got away from the gold standard a long time ago, so it's no different than bitcoin, or any other currency in a modern financial system.
There's nothing "backing" or "behind" the US dollar any more than there is bitcoin at this point.

Isn't Google Authenticator essentially a shared-secret that allows TOTP?
If so, and bitstamp was compromised, couldn't an attacker simply add the users' google authenticator codes to their google authenticator and move funds normally?
I'm not saying this happened, but I think it would be worth investigating.
update: I researched it, and this is indeed how it works.  If bitstamp was hacked, and the intruder(s) were able to gain access to the shared secret for this user, the attacker would be able to add this to their google authenticator.
I'm not sure why nobody has considered this...?
2nd update:  if you're down-voting this, please explain.

How does it ensure that if enough people go offline around the same time, that data isn't lost? Like what happens if some disaster cuts a section of the Internet offline?

Awesome segment on the show. Thanks for having an intelligent discussion on the subject. Keep it up!
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:27:34
I can't decide what I hate more. Mt. Gox, or editorialized reporting... The article would have much more impact without the overt jabs at Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:18:41
Serious question.
Instead of raising the limit, why not get rid of the maximum blocksize altogether?
As I understand it, this limit is entirely self-imposed, and the way Satoshi envisioned it, there was no limit.

c'mon dude, imagine running that site.  you're a giant target 24/7 and it's not like he's making a shitload of money from it.  "unbelievable levels of incompetence" is a pretty extreme thing to say.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:39:35
It does, thanks for the info. I suspected it did something similar to raid, I was just wondering how well it would stand up to large-scale failures or outages. Sounds like pretty well. Do you do simulations or anything for that sort of situation?

@_date: 2015-05-05 16:10:57
Serious question... I saw a previous post that (at least I think) was similar.  How come you're giving away bitcoin if you're doing a food drive thing?
Like are people here encouraged to tip back or something?
Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just don't understand.

I would recommend taking the original wallet.dat and importing it into a new blockchain.info wallet.  From there, if it shows up, you can transfer it back out to the wallet of your choice.
This would be the fastest, easiest option, imho.
edit: this has the benefit of not impacting any methods you're currently using with your bitcoin-qt client.  You can do this in parallel.
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:44:17
it's temporary only long enough to transfer the money out.  plus he already has the wallet.dat.  And they have a super easy way to import it.
Not really sure how it's bad advice?
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:24:46
oh snap.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:13:12
That's pretty cool.
So, do you *really* use the same towers as Verizon and Sprint?  I'm currently using vzw and am hesitant to change since every other carrier seems to drop lots of calls here.

if you're still using windows, bring up a command prompt and type (assuming it's mounted as "D")






If you're using OSX or linux, mount the drive and type (assuming you mounted it on /mnt)


In either case you should be presented with the directory containing your old wallet.

what about an open market site, where people can buy or sell goods that would otherwise seem... dubious.  you could host this site on tor.  users could buy everything with btc, and use gpg to communicate.  perhaps call it the polyester road?

I hate to ask a dumb question. But what exactly happens at a bitcoin meet up? (Serious question)
@_date: 2013-05-25 01:52:48
ok so, another dumb question but what is the purpose of trading bitcoins? (another serious question)
edit: unless by "trading" you mean "exchanging" for actual currency. if that's what you meant then I understand the purpose already obviously.
