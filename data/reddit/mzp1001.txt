It will bounce around making a big pennant until the end of the month, then...BOOOOOOM

What about going the other way, bullion for btc?

the last time I was this distracted at work was 9/11/2001. I have burned out on looking at bitcoinwisdom, no more of that for me today.
edit: demo of the same mood but counting down instead of up:

The “E” stands for exchange and the problem with making a big pile of BTC on Wall Street are the same as doing it anywhere else. We are familiar with the frauds and thieves exploiting thier trusted access to other peoples money, now in major ETFs the scale just gets bigger.  Some people will just re-learn the lesson, no problem for BTC.

LEDs flashing morse at sensetive cameras from rooftops in multiple frequencies and colors could do it at short ranges.

Has anybody done LN transactions for just cash yet, or the other way around? Faster and more private than waiting for on-chain confirmations right? Could bisq add this feature?

It could be a new version of the old “let one hundred flowers bloom” campaign.

Yes, sounds pretty bad for BTC. SELL!

I have some gold, spent more on it four years ago than bitcoin. Before the end of the year all gold of mine will be replaced by more bitcoin.

One bolt is found on the receivers of mauser rifles made in concentration camp factories for SS contracts, aka the “single rune” Mauser, rare and collectible. Also, I forgot about the 12th SS Hitlerjugend panzer division, which also includes a key on top of the bolt, which could stand for satoshis with the best security and privacy.

I remember a video of his a while ago, where he started bashing the bitcoin system and fundamentals suddenly. It was very disorienting. He almost started crying I swear. I figured some large trade went 180 degrees wrong and it was expensive. How to get it all back and then some? A personal shitfork bcash style. It’s annoying after all those others came out.

If zuck bucks make it into decentralized exchanges would it open them to surveillance and increaced centralization while also increasing liquidity at the same time?
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:44:57
Bitcoin Heaven? Another shitfork to autodump?
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:23:16
he called a breakout that turned into a bulltrap a while ago. He wont think bullish again until candles close above 11700.

Vodcoin, right?
