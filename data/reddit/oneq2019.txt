Thats my genuine question I'm asking to learn and understand (although I think I already know the answer). But you didn't answer that one.
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:29:33
Is there something that objectively determines which one the real bitcoin is, and why would that be an objective answer? Satoshi described Bitcoin with a core design set in stone for the rest of its lifetime (i think mainly to take trust and power away, because it can only be truly decentralized that way?). According to that BTC is not the real bitcoin?
Am I seeing this right that the Bitcoin forks are all a continuation of the very beginning of Bitcoin? So if someone held x Bitcoin from the very beginning until now, he also had x Bitcoin of every fork? Which one would probably be the real Bitcoin in satoshis opinion, and why? (I might have answered that already - idk.)
@_date: 2019-11-13 17:36:27
No. I even explained you why your answers could not help me understand anything any better. You are very active in this sub and tell people they have no reason to use bitcoin. I wonder why (not really).
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:04:53
But didn't satoshi talk about hard forks as a way to counter 51% attacks? Doesnt that mean that a chain with less proof of work could be considered the real one under some circumstances?
And if a fork gets more demand/higher price than BTC in the future it would become the one with the most proof of work and become the real bitcoin? Is that how it works? And would it get the BTC ticker then, or keep the current one?
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:16:34
Many care, including me. Thats why I'm asking. Why arent you answering my questions? If you dont care/dont know then why even comment?
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:00:48
Yeah at some point within years or decades, lol...

You are right, sorry, he never said that. But he explained how to increase the block size limit at some point. And I think he was clearly for big blocks, but I have to look into that again now. Thx!
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:20:53
Where is the point in achieving more decentralization by limiting the on-chain transactions to around 10 per second, when almost noone out of a few billion people can use it and is forced to trust 2nd layer networks with their money, which are less decentalized/secure than bitcoin without that limit would be?
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:14:48
He was a big blocker, he talked about full nodes being server farms. Ofc second layers make sense for micro payments. But obviously not as a full replacement of the first layer for most people, where most cant even make one transaction to bring their coins to on-chain safety. Thats just a joke an you know it. And if it stays that way (as core devs etc. intend) most people will probably just use one of the forks in the end. Because why would they prefer less decentralized/secure 2nd layers when almost everyone couldnt even make use of the secure and decentral first layer (just one billion transactions would take years right now)?
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:00:49
But the BTC devs etc. are saying that they envision a future where most people will never make on-chain transactions. Get their coins already on LN etc. Thats what my question refers to. What does it matter if you can trust layer 1 if almost noone can use it, lol! Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency for everyone. BTC not?

He didnt say the design was to be set in stone, he said the core design was to be set in stone. Im not sure what that means. Was a change to the core design required to fix the "everyone-can-spend" issue, or just a change to the design?
And I'm all for improvements obviously, but does BTC work for a billion people right now? Does one of the forks that kept things as they were intended? And what happened in 2017? Did people have to stop using the unstoppable bitcoin because fees were too high? No issues with satoshis approach...
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:26:36
No because layer 2 decentrality/security is a joke compared to bitcoins decentrality/security if it had big enough blocks for everyone to use it for everything apart from microtransactions. No contradiction here.
Thats the whole point of my question.
Because they get paid to do so you clown. By traditional finance. Probably like you to write this. And then there is a lot of censorship and propaganda to explain your next question. Thats not conspiracy theories.
Not gonna keep arguing. So far you said nothing that could help me make sense of it. I didnt say i knew the answer, i said I think i know it. Which means I dont know it. Thats why I was asking. But I still dont. Hope you got that now.
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:54:51
I didnt say any of that.
And yes im still interested in your opinion and the answer you gave so far in contradicting an argument you made yourself.
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:28:06
Yes, but there was an exception with the blocksize limit and i described why.
No? Because the protocol was to be set in stone and the blocksize limit was to be increased (which makes it backwards incompatible)? Can you answer my last question in the last comment now?
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:30:52
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:33:26
Because the argument is that most people will never make on-chain transactions. Get their coins directly on LN etc. You said luckily but can't answer my question?
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:40:36
Is there one BTC wallet that could be considered the most "official"/trustworthy one?
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:45:17
And if thats a fact, not an opinion, why is it a fact? Thats what I asked for.
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:39:55
Lol no the limit was supposed to be a temporary security measurement according to him.
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:37:57
Hi, electrum is available as a standalone executable and a portable version. What is the difference?
And generally asking if I put a tool like this on an USB stick which was not named a portable version, could this lead to problems?
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:44:11
Thats basically included in my question and doesn't answer it.
@_date: 2019-11-11 18:14:58
He wanted it in as a temporary security measurement. There should have been consensus required for changing the idea of bitcoin by keeping it, rather than consensus for changing bitcoin by removing it (which was the plan but some could prevent it by not agreeing). But that was technically not possible, i guess.
So is it now what its users want it to be, or what some, pretending to be its users, want it to be? Thats a question he wanted to avoid by keeping the protocol set in stone. Backwards compatibility didnt matter to him, as he wanted to increase the blocksize, which makes it incompatible. So again, why do you think he would consider BTC the real bitcoin? Or did you change your opinion now?
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:04:20
Because what youre saying doesnt make sense. It was already included in my question. The point you seem to be willfully ignoring is that the limit right now on-chain is about 10 transactions per second and it would take years for just one billion people to make just one transaction. So most people couldnt bring their 2nd layer coins to safety. And thats how core devs etc. want to keep things. And bitcoin can have a decentralized and secure first layer with big enough blocks for everyone to use it. Just less decentralized and secure. But the balance needs to be where everyone can benefit from that decentrality and security. Not trust 2nd layers that are even less secure and decentralized. Thats what I'm asking. Where would the point in this be?
What youre saying is literally that they stopped the magic of bitcoin from reaching a lot of people. Thats exactly what I meant by "I think I already know the answer".
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:56:11
I think I know it, but i dont know it. And I want to know it. That makes my question genuine. Looks like you can't answer it because there is no point to benefit bitcoin. But maybe that's wrong. Thats why I'm here asking.
And I've not been using crypto at all so far, why are you asking?
@_date: 2019-11-11 17:39:45
Yes, yes, i just meant a continuation of the ledger. I think by "set in stone for the rest of its lifetime" he meant the protocol, not that it always needs to be backwards compatible to the original clients? Of course! Because you said bigger blocks make it incompatible. And he was all for increasing the block size. So can you answer that last question you quoted again, considering this?
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:23:12
Bigger blocks. Because there is no point if most people cant even bring their coins back to on-chain safety.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:14:24
But billions of people cant make their own channels when a single billion of on-chain transactions takes years? Decentralized or not, if there was a security issue people would like their coins back on-chain but couldnt because of sky-rocketing fees, right? For example I was assured that there could never be Bitcoins on LN that are not represented by actual Bitcoins on-chain, and it happened.
And the problems you are referring to in the way of billions of users were not there in the original idea of Bitcoin (with big blocks etc.), right? Hmm...
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:23:59
I thought Bitcoin with big blocks and hardware improvements that might be there before too many wanted to use it could do it. I think thats how Satoshi saw it.
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:28:23
How does it make any sense to limit Bitcoin to a few transactions per second for more decentralization/security, while forcing most transactions (if people want to do a lot more than a few per second) to be on 2nd layer networks (or sidechains), which are less decentralized/secure than Bitcoin with big blocks would be?
Im thinking about selling other coins for more BTC, but first I need someone help me to make sense of this.
Like if billions of people were using BTC and almost noone can get their coins from 2nd layers/sidechains back on-chain, where is the point? (It would take years for just one billion transactions to be processed on-chain with a limit of a few per second.)
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:44:12
From Satoshi's Mail in your last link:
"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size. By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of  transactions."
Question for everyone:
Why is it (Bitcoin-BTC) still limited to less than 10 transactions per second 10 years later? If it wasn't to stop bitcoin, why wasn't a blocksize limit chosen that would at least allow enough transactions until LN fully works? (By enough I mean enough to keep fees at least below a dollar, so noone has to stop using it because of high fees.)
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:03:30
Fully? No more risk of funds loss?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:11:45
But bitcoin did a 500x from 7 years ago until now...
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:56:51
You didnt understand my question. Did you even read it completely?
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:09:45
Maybe I actually dont. Thats why Im asking.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:02:56
I know thats why I said Bitcoin-BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:33:21
"LN transactions with BTC security guarantees" :D:D
I think youve been fooled. Another question for you and everyone:
Why would billions of people choose BTC/LN, when almost all of them cant ever get their coins from LN back on-chain, over a Bitcoin with big blocks? Where would the point be if almost noone can profit from the decentralization/security of the first layer (just one billion transactions would take years on BTC)? Again, why wouldnt they choose a fork with big blocks, if thats more decentralized/secure than 2nd layer networks they would be stuck with on BTC?
