Well, at least, you'll have your crypto to keep you warm. And bonus: cold wallets never want to cuddle afterwards.

Thought this comment was interesting:
In Q&amp;A following speech, he said that he feels current/existing financial institution regulations (used for banks and such) are "sufficient for today" to apply to Bitcoin. 
Also: “We do not currently see widespread use of virtual currencies as a means of terrorist financing or sanctions evasion,” Cohen said in his speech. “But these are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces, and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.”

The news: Blockchain.info has acquired, paying in Bitcoin, RBTC (the web trading platform developed by Clark Moody), as noted by u/pitchblend about 20 minutes ago.

I hesitate to comment on this article, because part of me wishes this story would go away. But, that being said, Salmon is right on when he says: "Dorian Nakamoto could have told Goodman explicitly that yes, he invented bitcoin — and still a lot of the bitcoin faithful would not be fully convinced unless and until Dorian proved that assertion cryptographically."

They were launched by Shakil Kahn (Spotify, Bitpay) in May 2013. 
In September 2013, CoinDesk launched its proprietary Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) "aiming to establish the standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals." 
Not sure how BPI fits into their plans for monetiziation, but I imagine there is potential there, and with possible ad revenue as noted by another poster.

If you have invested more than you can afford to lose, get out now. 
If you have invested what you can afford to lose, hold. Go long. (That is my approach, though my interest in Bitcoin is not primarily as an investment vehicle.)
Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme, and there are much safer investment options.

According to the NYTimes: 
"But Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, filed with the Tokyo District Court under Japan’s Civil Rehabilitation Law, which is similar to Chapter 11 in the United States, will mean that a bankruptcy supervisor is set to develop a restructuring plan, and will also be responsible for handling any payment of claim distributions to its creditors. That process could take form several months to several years.
The exchange has liabilities of 6.5 billion yen, or $64 million, compared with total assets of 3.84 billion yen, the company said. It has 127,000 creditors."

Well, I think if you felt uncomfortable participating, then you were right to refuse. On the other hand, though, I think it's important for informed and educated voices from the Bitcoin community to engage with the MSM. The reportage won't improve if knowledgeable sources are not part of these stories.

When I read his first post, I thought it was quite likely legit. Now, I'm pretty convinced the person posting as Arthur Nakamoto is either a.) a fraud; b.) a shit-stirrer and attention whore; c.) drunk at the time of writing; or d.) all of the above. He promises an update on Dorian but really offers none. 
Downvote.

To play devil's advocate: my boss spoke GS not that long in their auditorium. The event filled up fast with a waiting list. He spoke on a topic of interest to their employees, but it certainly didn't mean that (or result in) GS as an institution investing in his vision, though I know that there are employees there who personally support it. I think there was just a lot of curiosity about his work, as there certainly is with Bitcoin now. 
Not saying OP is with GS, but saying that we should not get ahead of ourselves and think this means that suddenly Wall Street is coming around.
Also, fwiw, Barry Silbert/Second Market spoke at a GS conference recently and Bitcoin was part of his presentation.

I think it is far more likely that the government seized Gox assets, including these wallets, than it is that he lost the private keys and is unable to access the wallets. 
We know for certain that Gox is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York. I think an indictment is imminent, which also helps to explain why the Bitcoin Foundation, SecondMarket and others have gone through such great pains to distance themselves from Karpeles and Gox.

This post is misleading. The panel is hosted by The Microfinance Club of New York (MFCNY), not Morgan Stanley, with the location being the Morgan Stanley auditorium. MFCNY events take place at various locations throughout the city, and because most members are financial professionals, a location such as this is not unusual.

400 Bitcoin ATMs in a city with a population of 2 million? Some people on here will believe anything bitcoin-related so long as it's 'good news'.

I'm sorry, but she's not very convincing. I have a hard time imagining her version of events holding up if she had to respond to more formidable interviewers. The story she published in Newsweek, even if Dorian S. Nakamoto is Satoshi Nakamoto (and I don't believe he is), is fiction and hyperbole passing for investigative journalism. 
The invasive and exploitative way in which she wrote about Dorian S. Nakamoto, and her seeming inability to understand why some might take umbrage to her doxing of an innocent man suggests to me that she not only lacks empathy but also possesses a deep sense of entitlement.
