Wow wish you best on your future. Not many people would be like you.
Did you acquire these Bitcoin when it was dirt cheap? Just curious. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:37:26
How do you deal with the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:12:02
Omg i love you guys 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:27:09
I completely understand what you're saying. However, say it drops significantly I'd miss out on the potential earnings.
I guess if I invest more then I'll cash out sooner. At this point I'll ride it out.

Why is it bad to sell during peak times? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:36:48
More than double. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:34:12
Fees for buying. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:51:53
What benefits do you get by having the prices being locked in?
Edit:Just bought $50 with $1.99 for fees on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:32:24
So if coinbase locks in the price that means if it rises it'll be beneficial to me but if it drops it'll be beneficial to them? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:24:02
The fees are a lot though, around 5‰ per order.
Ill look into the exchanges you suggested. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:38:13
Right, I'll try exploring GDAX a bit later on. Other than immediate uses are there any benefits to having your Bitcoins earlier? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:43:42
Okay thank you! Definitely helped me a lot.
Would you mind if I ask you more questions on Bitcoin in the future? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:29:41
Exactly what I have right now, around 3k. I want to dump it all in but the risk of losing all the money I've saved throughout my whole life is scary. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:55:36
Aren't you buying the Bitcoins from them? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:09:48
Sorry but I'm not getting it. Are you saying Coinbase is going to pay you the extra? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:42:17
Would a Mycelium work? What's the process of doing such a thing? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:15:18
Care to explain? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:21:14
How easy is it to use for a beginner? Downloaded the app but looks very confusing. Any tips? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:27:41
What if I buy Bitcoin from Coinbase? Will I be able to transfer to my actual wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:26:31
Went on GDAX website and have no idea as to how to use it. I'll try looking into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:22:42
Oh I'm getting it now. Basically you're getting more for your money.
I guess it's the same even if the price drops? Does other sites don't do this if there's not a price lock in?
