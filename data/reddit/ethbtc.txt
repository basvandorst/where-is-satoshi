Could someone please elaborate on why other competing protocols of TCP/IP didn't succeed although being better for certain use cases?
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:40:43
What are the cons of a cryptocurrency with a super short confirmation time?  What changes fundamentally with short/long confirmation times?
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:42:35
I have heard that Bitcoin can be attacked when only 30% of mining is centralized.  How can this be?  Can someone link an article?

You don't believe in Blockstack?
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:09:45
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:29:23
How do you compare Blockstack to a flash plugins business?
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:28:46
Is there a full clip of this anywhere?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:12:32
Right, you can pay close to nothing...but miners won't continue to provide as much security to the network if they aren't getting paid well.  And we are assuming that there is only one transaction in the block.
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:45:06
But they aren't entirely dependent on blockspace...The miners have to get paid to secure the network, and without a block reward, all revenue will have to be derived from transaction fees
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:58:11
But do 2nd layer solutions amount to miners being paid the same as they are now?
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:29:06
Why so much hate for Michael?  He is super passionate about the space and has a lot of insightful things to say.
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:21:45
But what do you think will happen?
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:42:40
Miners will have to get paid to provide security.  So how will they get paid if everyone is using 2nd layer?
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:52:31
When a LN transaction is settled on chain, is the fee paid by the collective or just by the person who executed the on-chain transaction?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:19:35
When the block reward is gone, transaction fees will be the only source of revenue.  If LN participants rarely close their channels, there will not be a lot of on chain transactions, but the transactions that do hit the blockchain will have to pay fees that support the current amount of security. If we assume only one transaction hits the blockchain per block, the transaction fee will have to be massive in order to support the current amount of security we have at the moment.
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:07:59
No, When the block reward no longer exists, miners will have to get paid through transaction fees. The network will no longer be subsidized by block reward. If we did not have a block reward today, I would argue transaction fees would have to be much higher in order to maintain the same level of security (i.e so miners are paid the same as they are today)
@_date: 2018-09-02 17:35:06
If someone decides to post a lightning transaction to the blockchain, you don't think this will be astronomically expensive?  For example, if I sent you $5 on lightning network but wanted to close the channel after, would it be prohibitively expensive?
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:18:58
He loves Bitcoin and decentralization.  What are you talking about?  He is promoting them both!  His investments will only bloom if they are successful which would be contradictory to your statement!
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:23:11
Right, but I am worried that once block reward goes away, and we are purely transaction fee based, lightning network will result in a small amount of transactions on-chain while the cost of securing the network will still be high; therefore, any on-chain transactions will be very expensive.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:30:11
I don't know which is why I asked.  The question is will it cost $10K to close a channel since not many transactions hit the blockchain but all money revenue is due to transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:17:44
But let's assume worst case scenario that in one block only one transaction is posted (which I think is possible), what is it's fate regarding transaction fee?  
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:37:17
can they delay it further or is this final deadline?
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:03:45
But you think fees on settlement layer will net be the same when less overall transactions are being posted directly to the settlement layer and instead grouped together?

To be clear, the statement says that Renminbi withdrawals are still OPERATIONAL.

Is there any additional info on why Barry thinks Bitcoin will not be the winner long-term?  I remember him saying exactly the opposite about a year ago.

@_date: 2016-01-14 00:07:33
I see.  Thank you very much for your response.
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:45:48
Sorry for the delayed response.  I just read the article and that is very interesting.  Although I wasn't able to completely grasp this exploit example it was the first time that I have witnessed something outside of the basic HTML, PHP, Javascript attacks that I have read about.  Thank you once again.
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:58:27
In general though, if any service out there is offered to a US citizen but not offered to any other country, will I still be able to access my account from a foreign country?
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:25:51
Thanks for the information.  I really appreciate it.  I'm actually reading a book published by O'Reailly regarding PHP,Javascript,AJAX,Jquery right now!  Would you say security risk is the utmost important skill set needed to be a good programmer in this space?
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:39:43
Thank you

How do you know?
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:29:58
Hey Joey, when you say that you plan to sidechain with Bitcoin when the technology is available, how does that change your usage of Ethereum for the backend?  Or does it change anything with regards to Ethereum's relationship with Augur?
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:19:03
True but I think so far 21 Inc. has the most exciting product.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:21:03
Interesting.  But I wonder how much new product information is disseminated amongst all engineers and PR in such a large company.
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:02:46
So if I could guess as to a simple explanation of sidechains, it would be that the sidechains operate completely independently of Bitcoin in terms of features as long as they don't mess up Bitcoin.  For example, an alt coin with 6% money supply increase to infiniti with 2 second confirmation times will operate independently of Bitcoin but with take advantage of storing the blockchain state in Bitcoin every 10 minutes.  Is that right or am I totally off here?  Seems like sidechains only purpose is to take advantage of Bitcoin mining power to ensure greater security in storing the alt coin blockchain state every 10 minutes.  Also, the alt coin would still have it's own independent mining network correct?
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:51:31
Lol just say it
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:21:43
So then what is the main purpose of a sidechain?
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:40:37
A user posted this answer when I asked if a BTC sidechain is the same as a fixed exchange rate between an alt and BTC.  Let me know what you think:
According to the sidechains whitepaper (footnote 6), a sidechain can have its own tokens not pegged to bitcoin.
It seems impossible to impose any constraints on what sidechains can do, since they are supposed to be designed, implemented, and maintained by independent teams. No matter what the bitcoin developers might require, the implementation of a sidechain can have bugs that cause it to violate those requirements.
The only condition that the bitcoin developers can meaningfully require is that the sidechain should not mess up the bitcoin blockchain and network. e.g. by double-spending bitcoins or creating bitcoins out of nothing. But that condition is ensured by the bitcoin network, not by the sidechain.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:31:55
Do you think that Bitcoin will be able to achieve an ease of creating Dapps which will make ethereal irrelevant like Open Bazaar?
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:44:19
No answer on this?
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:21:23
Thanks it would be helpful
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:33:58
I understand what your saying but regardless of what Ethereum's token is called, it still is essentially going to be a fixed supply (inflationary rate will approach zero in time as a fixed amount is created yearly) currency like Bitcoin.  I assume that Ethereum will need a strong mining network to be secure and assuming Ethereum can do everything that Bitcoin can and has the same currency characteristics then why is it not possible for Ethereum to overtake BTC?  Also what are your thoughts on a BTC sidechain with Ethereum's code?
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:47:44
Thanks for sending the link that was interesting.  So do you agree that BTC and Ethereum can coexist even though Ethereum may be a better overall platform already with its own currency?
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:29:56
How so?  They both contain currencies.  It almost seems like Ethereal is capable of easily executing Dapps while Bitcoin it's more complicated.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:43:44
Care to explain?
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:39:29
I'm speaking on 51% percent attack potential.  How much $ in security is necessary?
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:31:07
Can't Bitcoin run decentralized software like Open Bazaar?  I believe that Ethereums inflation rate will eventually reach zero since it's a fixed amount created every year.
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:42:27
yes me neither...please let me know if you find one!
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:41:53
I completely disagree with your statement.  
Bitcoin users and enthusiasts need to be aware of the competition from other similar protocols.  Not only that, Greece served as a PERFECT example of WHY BITCOIN HAS SO MUCH VALUE.  Therefore, it is entirely relevant.
If some new cryto was 1000x better than Bitcoin, the readers of this sub-reddit should know as it is ENTIRELY relevant to the competitiveness and sustainability of BTC.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:31:53
Ok.  So is this just going to be an open marketplace to sell illegal things?  Nothing that important to most people is banned from Ebay as far as I know.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:24:24
I know you can solicit internationally.  I guess the fees are the biggest takeaway?  But then you have to pay arbitrators I suppose.
@_date: 2016-02-22 07:15:31
Was thinking about this one.  I remember that security hole around a year ago which was kind of scary though
@_date: 2015-07-31 03:58:02
I understand where you're coming from, but imagine if there was a sub-reddit devoted to Tesla Motors.  Considering that the forum consists of enthusiasts &amp; investors in Tesla, don't you think that it would be relevant to allow posts on new, highly efficient lithium car batteries allthough made by a different company, or a new car manufacturer that will be a significant competitor to Tesla?  I feel like any truly irrelevant posts will just be downvoted like an altcoin with no believed potential or a Bloomberg article that it completely off the mark.
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:59:42
Will it be possible for very poor people to use the lightning network?  Why?  Why not?
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:09:48
Dirt poor.  Does someone need to pay money to start using the LN?
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:02:23
If I buy a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet, how do I know it hasn't been tampered with?
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:10:07
I read somewhere that you need to deposit like $20 to use it.  Is this true?
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:17:10
Thank you for that explanation!
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:55:27
Would it make sense for SMTP or TCP-IP to use a token? Why or why not?
All of these projects are open sourced but have a token that needs to be used. Could this model be applied to SMTP or TCP-IP? Why or why not?
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:40:34
I suppose that Bitcoin has the option to opt-out to a new version if things become like that of the US dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:22:18

Why doesn't the university just have a searchable database with the issued diploma?  Why do we need the blockchain?

Thanks for providing this — it is very interesting.  How did you get the info?  Does OKCoin offer the ability to detect liquidation orders through an API?
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:07:11
Cool thanks man.  When you see the orders on the order book in bold font on OKCoin, is that a liquidation?
