So sorry for you loss mate. I relate to your brothers pain in knowing you were an early adopter, I mined over 6,000 BTC and probably close to 50,000 LTC (just as it came out it was so easy) I was really doubtful about all that and sold everything for $1000 about to cover my electricity costs. So I am really gutted because I could have retired now.. And that is what sits in the back of your mind, constantly nibbling away at your happiness. It can lead to severe depression. I avoided this by living of the philosophy that money does not bring happiness.  I have a great wife, a 8 month bouncing boy.. that is the only treasure that matters and the only thing worth fighting for. I bought back into BTC and LTC and trippled my profit.. yes I am happy because no bank will do that and my sons college fund is now sorted. Again.. sorry for your loss mate - It is sad that money causes more pain than happiness.

If you count the places on earth that are uninhabited - as world wide coverage then you sir, are an 1d!i0t - You wanna sell BTC to penguins and sperm-whales?

0 - Nobody managed to tune the LNB on the correct angle yet and the atmospheric noise is proving massive degradation in SNR causing anomalies in the block chain... meh.
