Have you tried voiding the transaction? 
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:02:13
Yes it is. Just follow these 5 steps:
1. Transfer bitcoin to an exchange such as Coinbase.
2. Sell bitcoin for USD or other fiat
3. Transfer fiat out of Coinbase
4. Transfer fiat into stock platform such as TD Ameritrade
5. Purchase stock! 
**Note: Steps 1-3 can be skipped by just using fiat

Its probably only worth $90 now. The price is falling rapidly. Sign up for an exchange account and sell it ASAP. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:30:31
I could see this. Maybe pre-weight loss though.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:53:03

3 guys find out that they have 3 weeks to live. 
They realize that they have nothing to show for in their lives, so they each decide to try getting into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
The first guys says, "I have pretty long arms, maybe I have the longest arms in the world!" The second guy says, "I have a big chest, maybe I have the biggest chest in the world!" The third guys says, "I have a small dick, maybe I have the smallest dick in the world!" So they each submit their applications to the Guinness Book of World Records headquarters. 
A week later, the book is published, and they all gather around to see the results. The first guy opens the book and says, "Hey look! I have the longest arms in the world!" The second guy looks and says "Wow! I can't believe I have the biggest chest in the world!" And the third guys looks and says, "...Who the fuck is @_date: 2014-02-20 21:45:44

He was referring to the future value.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:48:52
I suppose you could, but doge seems to be a lot more stable.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:50:31

Completely agree. Until stores start selling goods in BTC instead of fiat, there is no reason to use it. And no reputable store would assume that risk.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:38:50
Translation: I bought a metric shit-ton of coins. Someone please buy them?
