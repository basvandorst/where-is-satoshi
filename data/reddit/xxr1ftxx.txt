You can do it from phone but I personally prefer to use my laptop because it is easier to use

Not someone multiple people because Bitcoin will most likely have a large dip due to rapid increase.

Thx Boss

Everyone go make sure you write down the 12 word recovery thing so Bitcoin isn't lost forever.

Fr I bought like 500 and wish I bought more. Feels bad man

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:55:17
Yeah im in it for the long run but I don't know If I should wait for the dip to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:38:54
Same bro im thinking it will drop soon since it went up so rapidly.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:30:31
Completely agree
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:52:34
It is honestly the worst because I don't want to miss out on profit if it continues to rise but if it drops I can make even more money. Risky business.

Oh ok that makes sense thanks Wiicon
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:40:21
That is why I'm worried don't want to miss out on potential gain
