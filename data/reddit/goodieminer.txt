I was thinking of sharing the analogy with cars,phones,internet etc... of how progress isn't intuitive until it has already happened. Would be good to have a quick "Why bitcoin?" in hand as an app or website to show to nocoiners for those of us who are terrible at explaining it...

The beauty of bitcoin is to be your own bank, it's very simple to implement your own "payment processor" for which you have your own balance between manual/automated stuff depending on your number of transactions.
