You *ask* a woman before you kiss her? 
“Excuse me... umm... do you think I could maybe... umm... kiss you?  Umm that is... if you want me to?”
How pathetic!  ��
Nothing dries up a pussy faster than an insecure little boy is too scared to just go for it.  Hopefully someday you will lose your virginity and learn these things son, but for now it is clear you are a kisskess incel virgin and will remain that way for the unforeseeable future.
Take care Mr. Fake News

Tell me again how Trump “admitted to rape” when he talked to a friend about consensually touching a vagina.  ��
Also, a __pedo__phile (someone like Joe Biden who [groped children on c-span]( is attracted to __prepubescent__ *children*.  Not the legal adult women who participated in Trump’s Miss USA beauty pageants.  (Not that you have any evidence he ever entered the dressing rooms anyway).  ��
You are very confused about the definition of words.  Let me help you.
Nobody is ever going to take you seriously if you continue to misquote people and use the wrong definitions of words. Rape has a very clear definition. Pedophilia has a very clear definition. It’s very sad how brainwashed you are to believe in your silly little tinfoil hat alt-left conspiracy theories.
I hope you get on the right medication soon for your Anti-Trump Hysteria Disorder.  I will pray for your poor brainwashed tortured soul.  ��

Oh look!  A triggered alt-left soyboy who loves fake news.

Touching woman’s vagina with her permission is rape?  The only thing this proves it is that you have never had any kind of sexual relations with a woman whatsoever. Do you think they want you to sign a fucking contract before the heavy petting begins? A man knows when a woman wants to be touched. And you know damn well he said “they let him”.  That’s consensual you fake news brainwashed little bitch.  It’s convenient how you ignore half of what he said and misquote him in an attempt to claim it as sexual assault.  Guess what? I have grabbed pussies before, and “they let me”.  I bet you haven’t.  ��

Again, there’s no evidence he ever went in any locker rooms.  You believe that because you heard it from an “anonymous source” on fake news CNN? �� You would believe anything the talking picture box told you.  Hilarious! �� 
Rational people, on the other hand require __evidence__ for their beliefs.
What’s it like being so easily brainwashed?  ��
I feel genuinely bad for you.


Except that when someone __let’s you__ do something, it is by definition __consensual__.  Are you really this stupid?  You have never touched a woman sexually have you?  Sad!
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:15:23

You are twisting his words and you know it.  I feel genuinely bad for you that you are so dishonest and stupid.  Maybe someday you will wake up. But it’s doubtful.

He was joking around with Howard Stern.  How can you not tell?  Are you autistic?


I don’t think you have any idea what that word means. You can’t just say that to every single thing a person says. It’s the equivalent of saying “I’m rubber, you’re glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.”  Are you twelve?
So now we have figured out that you are not only stupid and dishonest, but also autistic, and most likely about 12 or 13 years old.  Neat.  ��
I gain no joy from defeating autistic children in a debate. I think I am done with you now. You are boring me.

__“and they let me”__
Pretty convenient how you brainwashed alt-left incels always leave that part out.

Because I am capable of independent thought unlike you?
Why are you so easily brainwashed by fake news?  Have you ever considered doing some independent research outside of your far-left echo chamber?
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:30:32


You have been brainwashed by fake news CNN.  Why are you so easily influenced and brainwash?  You should do some independent research instead of believing everything the talking picture box tells you.


It’s not 1980. The cold war is over. Why are you so xenophobic against Russians?  Is it racism?  It’s really creepy to be quite honest how much you far-left fanatics hate Russian people.  You were so easy to radicalize, and it only took a couple years.  
It really explains how the German people became Nazis.  Propaganda is a powerful thing.  I hope someday you wake up and stop being a pawn.
Take care.
