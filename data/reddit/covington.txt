I wonder what percentage of the raw computing power NSA can temporarily leverage it would take for a successful 51% attack, if it came to that.

She identified him based on the fact that he used two spaces after periods in his writing. With that kind of steel trap mind, surely she wouldn't jump to unwarranted conclusions and inferences in support of her dreams of a Pulitzer.

What is the total address space of the algorythm used to generate them? How many potential bitcoin addresses are there in the current implementation?
What I am getting at, obviously, is what is the chance of two users accidentally generating the same address? Is part of the blockchain a registry of "used" addresses to prevent that, even though the chances might be ridiculously infinitesimal?

I'm asking about the theory. Smarter people than me are certain that these risks have been eliminated... but I still want to understand why, and this thread seems like a good place to hear explanations.
Underlying my question is this more basic one: Is the root of it all "security through improbability?"
I just want to know if Zaphod Beeblebrox is going to power the Heart of Gold with bitcoin wallets as fuel.

One could infer quite a bit about his psychological issues just from his misplacing "kindly" in that sentence.

Would all those tiny spam transactions earlier in the week mean more volume of mining work done overall during that period?

What would it look like if instead of a toothless ban, the processing resources of entities like the NSA, were turned momentarily to a 51% attack?
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:01:05
The standard reply is 2^160... but I can't really picture numbers that large.
How about the second part of the question - are used addresses tagged? If so, can't that registry be used to bulk/brute duplicates to get the private keys of existing addresses?

Perhaps he ascended and is with the Ancients now.

Excuse the newbie question, but what happens to that trail when fractions of coins are traded, and when tiny fractions of coins from the stolen horde are traded in with larger amounts of "clean" coinage? Does the taint of the theft transfer virally to everything it touches?
For example - if 0.001 BTC from the stolen horde gets transferred into account "A" with 100 BTC, then 0.0001 of account "A" is used to pay into accounts B through Z which total 1m BTC, is that now more than 1m BTC poisoned and subject to seizure as stolen goods from contact with the original .001?

So long as bitcoin itself exists, no matter how reworked the code is, that address remains the headwaters of the money river?
That's a very evocative idea.
For Zelazny fans, that block is the primal pattern at the center of Amber.

Good point. A lot of people just discovered Bitcoin, but are afraid it's a bubble at the current price. If one assumes it's strong enough to stay alive and will continue to be the premier crypto-currency, then buy-and-holders won't be affected by temporary price drops, because the inherent 21m coin limit means the price ceiling is many, many multiples of current.
However, it sure would punish small businesses who have adopted bitcoin payment but can't afford to sit on it if they are transacting in it during a period of rapid value loss.

Got a text write up of what you are doing?  The video looks and sounds like a ransom note from some militia.

Once there have been a few jumps, it looks the same as the fact that 90% of US paper currency tests positive for cocaine... interesting but irrelevant.

Secretly I was hoping to find out it is Stephen Wolfram behind the algorithms.

You're asking the reverse of the real question you should ask - why sell them if they would be more profitable to own?

So is that what those huge Google Barges are? Bitcoin mining facilities?
(Only 75% kidding.)

It is so long as the short is backed... what if the "phantom shares" scam came to bitcoin speculation? Unethical shorters could really make a mint hammering the market. It would be fraud, of course, but that didn't stop them from destroying some stocks with the technique.

Is there arbitrage between the different exchanges? They sure seem to lag each other by quite a bit at the moment.
(Complete newbie here, just fascinated.)

Very cool. So are all those little transactions like tributes... tiny tokens sacrificed for luck? Or like carving initials into a famous landmark?
