While I agree with your view on welfare state future, in such situation keeping savings in crypto would seem much more sensible than in fiat.

I guess you might be interested in checking the latest developments in Monero. It's getting bulletproofs with March hardfork, which will reduce tx size by 70~80%

These lectures are the best explanation of crypto currency mechanisms I've found so far. Easy to understand, still skipping no important detail.

Do you really think it happens only in Netherlands?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:49
IF it crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:25:19
You mean adopting Monero, right?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:37:00
Especially, when it's pretty easy to figure out who is talking with whom over HTTPS. It encrypts the content only, but doesn't hide the parties.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:27:04
How could bitcoin upgrade to match monero's anonymity?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:59:52
The adoption will come. It's much easier to set up an exchange account than introduce BTC payments into business, so we'll  have to wait. It's slow but progressing.
Perhaps Bitcoin will never become a kind of money used to buy coffee, but it's a great tool for big, fast transfers. Imagine oil market denominated in Bitcoin.
The use of power will diminish with block reward.

Unregulated? You seem to have confused some terms.
ISPs won't regulate the Internet but just the part of infrastructure that belongs to them. And that is perfectly OK, because it's their property. They rent the infrastructure to customers by mutually voluntary contract and customers may accept their offer or refuse it and not subscribe.
The "neutrality" **is a government regulation** that puts limits on the use of property by ISPs. An artificial limit on use of your own property, as long as you don't use it to cause harm to others, sounds like unpleasant thing, doesn't it? I'd say it's plainly immoral.
The root of the problem is that ISP market has been regulated. To provide Internet to customers one has to apply for licenses, permits, provide data retention or wiretapping backdoors and comply with a set of government requirements. That creates monopolies or oligopolies where providers don't compete for customers by offering better and cheaper services, just because the government limits protect their market positions from new competitors. (I don't know the specific situation in US, so please forgive vague terms, but I'm pretty sure the ISP market isn't free there.)
So, to cure problems caused by one regulation (of the ISP market) the government will create another regulation (Neutrality) instead of abolishing the former. Over years that will create a pile of legal acts that everyone will have to comply with. This raises costs, which will be reflected in internet access prices. Also, it will cause pathological situations in many places just because the government isn't omniscient and regulations don't apply well to all possible situations.

Unfortunately, banks are often legally obliged to take burden of that police work. Otherwise they would be held responsible by the state for any fraud they missed to investigate.
Try starting any business even touching the finance industry, and you'll spend next year studying those regulations (or spend a fortune for lawyers doing that for you).
Of course, there's a lot of cooperation between banks and governments. Indeed, the regulations aren't created to prevent frauds but to carefully select those allowed to perform them and block any competition.

Hey, NN is a further regulation itself.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:22:11
Or they both aren't idiots and know not to mention the commercial aspect of the ride to police and insurer.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:40:47
So you should petition against NN and for liberalization of ISP markets. Amirite?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:34:29
Find out how, exactly? Two friends in a car. Who would ask any questions?
Another story is that Uber doesn't necessarily provide insurance. At least not in every country.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:05:42
IIRC we live in times of widespread radio communication. Which means laying miles of cables through someone's property isn't necessary anymore to build infrastructure. The barrier is usually some regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:36:24
Why are you pushing internet into hands of government monopoly? In a decade it will be as censored as it is in China. I'm glad that I don't live in US.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:09:41
Uber sticker? I haven't seen any in my life.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:07:37
History shows that getting rid of regulations isn't as easy as setting them. Therefore adding a new regulation to fight effects of a previous one makes things harder in total. Doesn't it?

And no one chooses bitcoin because HODL.

Geez. I don't mean to hide that he had a passenger. Just not mention it was a commercial ride. Or the other driver discovers it telepathically?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:16:00
The car is still theirs and they can do whatever they want with it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:22:39
Would love to witness it. Iran should adapt bitcoin ASAP to circumvent the banking sanctions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:38:32
Perhaps the source of the problem lay in the fact there are not enough ISPs who could compete with their services? Which means that liberalization of telecom market would help here, instead of regulating a problem that arose from regulations?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:13:00
In my country they get fined always, so nobody would put a sticker on.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:20:23
Why mention the commercial aspect of the ride to anyone? They're just friends in one's car.

This is exactly how anti-privacy and tax laws are made. Want to run business? Comply. You are responsible for collecting tax from customers (VAT) and employees (PIT). You are also responsible if any of your business partners turns out to be anonymous or fictional (KYC). The businesses carries all the risk and business is about risk management, so everyone complies or starves to death.
The average employee/consumer has no idea how it works, and usually they blame businessmen for high prices, low wages and privacy intrusions.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:59:50
Hopefully not. Czechs also use cash a lot.

By the time the last Satoshi is mined, the world population will reach 21 billion. That means 1mBTC for everyone on average, still divisible by 100,000. Less would be inconvenient, more would be excessive.
That was Satoshi's master plan.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:23:17
They just transfer USD from Company A's account to Company B's account. Whether Company B offers Bitcoins or toilet paper for that money, is not the bank's business (or, at least, it shouldn't be).
@_date: 2019-01-08 12:52:05
And at the same time they demand higher taxes. WTF went wrong in France?
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:25:14
yea, my head
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:16:58
This is a good time for the govt to acquire mining farms for free, just by raiding and seizing them like governments used to do for ages.
The question is how hard are they willing to slam against BTC. Confiscating 1/4 of world's hash rate would be a smart move. Leave the network functional but reap profits.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:38:36
Yes, move there so Russian government will nationalize your farms some day. Just like Chinese is doing right now.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:11:15
Wow, I didn't expect the situation in US to be so bad. Thought it was more business-friendly.
Over here several banks suspended accounts belonging to exchanges, officially because of money laundering suspicions. But a week later they reopened and there was no such trouble anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:52:54
Hard to say. Most of them are open source, which means you may create your own coin in matter of minutes.
And this is beautiful. Free competition of currencies for people's trust. The market will verify.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:02:59
Let's realize that Bitcoin failed to fulfill the "censorship resistant" part.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:09:28
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:00:03
Nobody sane would kill a goose that lays golden eggs. They won't ban BTC. They will just rob mining farms from their owners. Since that moment we will be supporting Chinese government owning 25% of hash rate.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:53:32
You forgot one important thing: **ENCRYPT THE ENTIRE DISK**
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:41:28
I don't know what exactly you want to achieve, but if you mean kind of escrow, Bitcoin's script can perform such operations without external application. Check [multisignature](
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:42
Okay, just give me the phone.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:51:50
Shit, dude, that sounds painful. I hope this m/f is gonna overdose those drugs he's probably buying right now.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:41:55
I guess that your purchase is just a record in their own database (how much of BTC in their wallet belongs to you). Most exchanges work like that.
Only when you withdraw, a blockchain transaction is created to move coins from their wallet to yours.
Blockchain transactions are neither fast nor free, so it's sensible to limit their number.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:59:04
This sounds like Lightning Network which is one of the prominent waypoints on Bitcoin's roadmap. However, it's just my guess, because I haven't internalized that knowledge yet and can't tell you now if it's applicable in your case.
There's a lot of reading on LN project and perhaps the best introduction I found is [The Lightning Network in the Old West](
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:13:03
Sometimes I offer even as little as $3. Commissions are usually percentile, not fixed. What matters more is how much you withdraw. This is a balance between fees and your trust towards the exchange company.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:21:35
Do you mean that bank transfers in US can be reversed by the sender?
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:58:51
Seems there won't be one coin to rule them all. Bitcoin looks like a candidate for capital location and big transfers. Monero gives anonymity. Some others will be convenient to pay for pizza.
And this is good. When atomic swaps become popular, the crypto payment world may become seamless as internet is, no matter if you're on dial-up, cable, optic fiber or Wi-Fi.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:07:26
Bitcoin can't Monero
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:27:35
I'm actually flattered by those comments.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:38:40
Banks don't need to deal with that. My customer would only make a transfer to exchange's account, which is nothing unusual.
But the idea of an exchange that allows transfers between accounts is interesting. We could both create accounts, transfer USD there and then I exchange it to whatever crypto I want, whenever I want, myself.
It doesn't have to be anonymous. I'm pretty OK with sending my ID scan there. I only want to save hassle on my customer's side.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:10:34
The paradox of absolute amounts of money is that they are still relative. For someone 100 EUR is just spare change, for someone else it's fortune. Instead of telling us the amount, better tell how do you feel about losing it.
If you can risk it without much regret, go all-in. Otherwise diversify.
100 EUR is amount where transfer and withdrawal fees can make a significant dent, so probably you would like to use it at one exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:13:05
I'm not fucking. Selling.

A man can have more than one account. In more than one bank. Yet.

Did he buy a big house, boat, or spent that money on exotic holidays or hookers? He didn't.
Did he write about his mission and ideals? He did.
The truth is he started the website because of ideals and he got punished so severely **exactly because of that**. The state fights opponents mercilessly.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:56:53
I'd just buy Monero and convert on other exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:11:41
That's sad. There are easy ways to buy bitcoin anonymously but very few to sell it for fiat.
