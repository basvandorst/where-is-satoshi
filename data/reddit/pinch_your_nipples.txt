Hey...me too prick.  I've used them all.  They are NOT lazy.  Your dumb ass just can't see the big picture.
Try telling those ordering from coinbase that don't get their orders filled that coinbase is on the ball.
It seems you've got a long held grudge.

Trying what?  Are you attempting to win something.  I just espouse truth.  Truth isn't always popular but you know what it is?  True
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:23:34
Probably because you're a fucking liar that will say anything to support your point.

Fuck you!  
How the FUCK is becoming a RETROACTIVE money transmitter not the US govt.'s fault?
It's ok though, in a few short months you won't have many choices at all.

I don't believe the drawing more and more energy has as much merit with the advent of asics. 
So now there's an industry being created around creating asics that are better at sha256.  I'd say that's a pretty good thing.  It's far better than the false economy created around paying bankers EXTREME amounts for stealing everyone's future.  
Money saved should actually go UP in value.

Lol...yep.   Been in this game longer than you.  Why do you think folks can't get their money out easily now nimrod?
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:04:46
I've been in this game a while.  I know.  You try running an exchange.  
They've taken on the brunt of the bad guys from the start with much less funding than these newer exchanges and are STILL a top exchange.

The NUMBER ONE complaint now against Gox is not being able to get money out quickly.  
Perhaps you haven't noticed that the game constantly changes.  Been in since 2009.

Warren Buffet is a fucking criminal.  He and his buddies call bitcoin rat poison.  Bitcoin IS rat poison if you're a rat.
You know why it's rat poison for them, because they won't be able to get loans anymore they don't have to pay back. 
Google "Warren Buffet crook" and maybe you'll find some enlightenment.  
He DID NOT make his money by sound, slow investing.

Hahaha!  Nice.
You should post the link.

I wonder how much Google had to pay for this ad since they own  Ripple.

You've convinced me.  They should close up shop.  I hear Coinbase sometimes doesn't fulfill orders too.  Coinbase should close up.
Bitstamp has had some bad times too.  They're out.  If only we could get a decent place to buy and sell Bitcoins.  Geesh...it's not that hard.

This guy has hated Mt. Gox for so long he can't understand why he still uses them.  LMFAO.  
Folks that have fucking options use them.  It must really not be that bad for you.

Bam, Kaplow, bazinga...bitch is lying.
