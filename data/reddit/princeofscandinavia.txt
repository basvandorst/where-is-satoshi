Hardly right security as long as the hacker went off with bitcoins from their hot wallet. As long as this is even possible bitcoin is going to attract every scum hacker out there.

As everybody knows, the real joy of money comes from spending it. Go nutz!

Almost every dane has a 'Dankort' which is a chip and pin based debit payment card with low fees. The fees are likely to go up after this, possibly enticing more bitcoin adaption in Denmark.

Sorry about your loss. At least its a fairly small amount of bitcoin. I lost a whole BTC the other day in a transaction error, and I am definately not rich. Did you read this? Particularly, number one on the list.

Someone actually buys something with BTC, posts on reddit, gets 1200 upvotes.

I had this thought yesterday about Dorian S. So this guy likes model trains. I mean, from the (who knows how accurate) reports that's just about all he does these days, playing with his trains, plus guarding his privacy and secrets. Right?
Now picture the blockchain in your mind. What does it look like?
I honestly did not think Dorian was the guy before I had this thought..

Glass beads + ass some kind of American passtime I regret never hearing about?

Wow. Much tip.

I am also interested in this application of the blockchain. It surprises me that noone has gotten there yet. Interested in selling limited edition photographic artworks (possibly digital assets) trackable via a blockchain.

I wonder how much of all bitcoin is currently in the hands of scammers, hackers and thieves. It seems like an exponential curve. On average, it must be thousands of BTC shifting shady hands daily, people getting mugged for all to see on the blockchain. Sad state of affairs, really.

Now, there's a 'free' transaction right there.

Best news all day!

'Get over here, Bits!'

It is not just an interesting idea. This is new 'free' technology, that can transform many aspects of digitalism. One application could be copyright assurance of digital assets (I am a photographer, and talk about stealing!).

Thieves needs to dump their 10% stake of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:13:04
I'll start the bidding at $5.

Iceland would be my first choice for large scale bitcoin mining. Not necessarily for the economy or the cold there, but because of undepletable green thermal energy supply. Also, Satoschi did not foresee the speed of bitcoin adoption / speculation, so could not foresee the ASIC speed race, which has meant that mining bitcoin aint for average Joe, and definately not 'essentially free', unless you speculate.
