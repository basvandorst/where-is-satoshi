Mechanical turk, amazon giftcards and credit card rewards seem to be common options.

SNAPCHAT is IPO-ing at $22 billion which is around ~30% higher than BTC.(doing these # in my head) The fact that it's higher than BTC is a joke. 
I know it's based of speculative ad growth, but come on!

looking at purse.io to use bitcoin for a discount on amazon. I think they have an auto discount of 5% but you can "ask" for more. I've personally had success at 20-25%
Saying that credit cards are a free 45 day loan is a pretty out there. Very few people buy everything on credit cards and pay off 100% of them.

I believe this right now is currently the best use case for bitcoin in the US. If you can teach people that gamble (and there are a metric fuck ton of them) using BTC, you will continue to get more adapters.
2nd best use case being Purse.

if that's the case, I'd keep the minimum you're happy with losing on breadwallet and then buy a trezor or ledger for any investments of large $.
Like in my breadwallet on my phone i got about $200

I use this altcoin all the time. This altcoin keeps losing value vs my BTC

What is the minimum required to start a new roth IRA account with you? Not a rollover but a new one.

before you use any of these.. go to 
They have every book graded and a list of bitcoin books. Make sure the grades are C or higher so that you know the book is reliable. 
Lot's of new bitcoin books are out that haven't had time to increase their grading so it could be difficult.

I know plenty of people whom use Circle or Coinbase to send BTC to gambling sites and have been caught. It really depends on how good the website is at making different addresses. I know Nitro uses different ones for everybody but some books do not. They can also tell from withdrawals too if it comes from the same cold wallet.
Take it from Circle/CB &amp; send it to another wallet before sending it to a gambling website

Bovada isn't a huge Sportsbook by any means. They are well known for limiting anyone with a pulse to $50 max bets. They have lines that are so far off market.
The only way they're "huge" is because they send their odds to every journalist out there in hopes of lazy ones publishing them. It happens all the time and is completely off any actual market.
There are much bigger and better Sportsbooks out there that have been taking bitcoin for a while. I don't have the list off the top of my head but sportsbookreview.com has information on them.

some Bitcoin Sportsbooks do do this. Even if they transfer the deposit into USD and back into BTC on the withdrawal it still increases BTC's usage.

Ironic that a guy getting 10k from random people is "ethics rules" while most public officials at the highest level get 100x that much or more.
