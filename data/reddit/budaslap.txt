Take everything you read in this subreddit with a grain of salt, as much as I love the idea of bitcoin it's very unlikely that it's going to unseat the government and replace flat currencies.

If you don't use bitcoins they will have no value... They aren't a stock that has a company behind them driving value, they are a currency and using them as such is the only thing that is going to keep them from being worthless.

The way of reddit is to downvote different opinions. Especially in a subreddit like this one where all people want is to have a crowd of like minded people repeating calming statements to help them deal with the stress that comes with risky investments.

Bitcoin is still a currency, and it won't continue skyrocketing if everyone refuses to use it. Look at it this way, you can now buy a lot more with the btc you have.

I don't think you've ever looked for investments or startup capitol, unless it's extremely obvious you have a huge idea its very difficult to get loans. No bank would finance a bitcoin startup that needed that kind of cash, it's just not a safe investment.

Yeah I totally agree that those coins exist, but again, there's no proof Satoshi has them.
I agree it's LIKELY that Satoshi is holding a bunch of coins, but these could be lost coins that at the time had no value...
Furthermore, look at what you're saying here;
You're implying that the government created bitcoins out of the blue, let them run for years gathering value and facilitating tax evasion and underground markets(think silk road) until they suddenly decide to mass sell their 120 million dollar pool of BTC to crash the market and financially devastate a bunch of people. 
Just trying to clarify here, but is this what you're trying to say?

BTC aren't an investment, and it's posts like this that undermine the whole system.
If you want to make money off of bitcoins, buy a bunch of them, and then use BTC exclusively for all of your online transactions.
Buying and hoarding only hurts bitcoins overall.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:21:33
Really all they have to do to "invest" in the bitcoin economy is offer payment through BTC as part of their normal business, this is essentially at no cost to them.
Nobody in their right mind thinks BTC are going to replace all currency or online payment options, it's just a really nice no fee option that we can use.
I think one problem is that it's being treated like a stock right now for most of it's transactions, once you see a thriving non stock market style economy it should stabilize.
Or it stays the way it is and fluctuates wildly scaring off everyone, only time will tell...

Just an update from what I've been through the past few weeks.
1. First I was denied by paypal for being &gt;45 days, they told me I should go through my bank.
2. Bank denied me as it was a pre-authorized withdrawal and the Canadian government passed legislation limiting chargebacks to 90 days for these types of transactions
3. Decided to try paypal again, mentioned that in their own rules and regs that pre-orders must be able to deliver within 20 days or it's invalid, also mentioned I've been with them for years, and that I've heard they are able to issue an ultimatum to the seller that they must provide a tracking number within 10 days or provide a refund. 
4. I should be recieving my refund in 9 days.
The key is, be POLITE but firm with paypal and they will escalate for you.

@_date: 2013-12-19 06:57:18
Math checks out. Bought 10 @ 45 for 450. Currently worth approximately 10 times that (500 each) instead of 20 times(1000 each)
Also as I've said before, bitcoins are not a stock but a currency, and people treating them as though they were stocks is a big part of why they are so volatile.  
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:25:42

Basically it's people who have all invested in BTC and are only capable of parroting what they read here, there is no criticism or critical thinking.
Bitcoin could be a big paradigm shift, but hearing people say shit like "all of my savings are in, don't want the pyramid scheme of flat currency to catch up with me" is just scary...

These are questions that present no simple answer, but here's how I see it.
2a. Nobody wants to use a currency that fluctuates in value by $150 in 48 hours. 
2b. If the only practical way to avoid losing your shirt on every purchase or sale is to buy BTC then instantly use them they are pointless.
I'm stumped on your last problem, we're at the point where 
1. The markets need to settle and stabilize which will improve investor confidence
2. Once markets are stable people need to adopt BTC as a real currency and not a penny stock
Unfortunately the way I see it right now 1 needs to happen for 2 to happen and as 2 is happening people will flock to the markets in hopes of getting rich off of the rising value.
You are the economist, how would you fix it?
