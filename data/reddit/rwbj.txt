If you don't live in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Washington then you're good to go. Every other state has one party consent laws for recording conversations. The above have mutual consent required so perhaps you could simply ask? Please do record it. Calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme is one of the most idiotic things I've heard. It'd be amusing to hear the mental gymnastics they're going to have to spin trying to make it sound like they weren't just blowing smoke.

Sounds awesome. I've been interested in bitcoin and tried mining in a group but never quite reached the 0.01 BC needed for withdrawal as my office began turning into a blow dryer.

Some things you're not really considering. First off our system, particularly as it is today, is designed to prevent change and minimize the impact of voters that would try to do that.
[Gerrymandering]( takes care of this on a local level. If you're not familiar with it the whole idea is to cheat elections by effectively changing who people are allowed to vote for. Each state has a number of representatives, these representatives are voted into office not by the state at large, but by their "districts." These districts are completely arbitrary and can be manipulated.
So let's take a basic example. We have a state that has 10 representatives and two major parties, both with 50% of the vote. The obvious result is 5 representatives for each party, but we can cheat and change that result through gerrymandering. One, of many, ways to do this would be to create one catch-all district that encompasses the areas where the supporters of one party tend to live. The other 9 districts are spread evenly among the other party. Now since one group of people only get to vote for one candidate we end up with a situation where even though there's a 50/50 split, one party gets 9 seats and the other gets 1 seat.
There are a lot of examples of exactly this happening, the wiki entry lists some. For instance in 2012 in Pennsylvania democratic candidates received 83,000 more votes than republican candidates. Republicans took 13 out of the 18 available seats due to gerrymandering.
Even for the presidential election the electoral system plays a similar role. That system made sense at one time when state was more akin to how we might view national identity but now a days it does nothing but make voting ever more pointless. In 2000, for instance, George Bush lost the popular vote by more than half a million votes - yet as you know he still became president thanks to the electoral college. In fact the us has had 44 presidents and 4 of them lost the popular election.
And this isn't even getting into issues like the fact that in our current election scheme if we have 4 individuals running for a position with a tally of 21%, 20.6%, 20% and 19.8% (the remaining ~20% going to smaller parties) we have a situation where now the guy who gained 21% gets 100% of the representation. It's silly. The reason you don't see this sort of wide spread of votes is because we have a system where now the 21 and 19.8 guys realize - hey we might lose this by ourselves, let's team up. The 20.6 and 20 do the same thing and suddenly you have 2 megaparties that are little more than clearing houses that no longer truly represent anybody (for that would entail possibility alienating another), but who exist solely to continue to be elected. Taking the republican party as an example you have this strange blob of libertarians, neocons, religious extremists and even some old school simple small government republicans. Those views are in a number of cases directly contradictory, but they're lumped together so they can win elections and we end up, unsurprisingly, with a dysfunctional congress with an approval rating of 8%.
So simply "vote smarter" isn't really a solution here. I hadn't thought of bitcoin as a tool for political change before but it really does make at least some sense. The ideal being to enact political change in a system that is specifically being manipulated to avoid any sort of change - all without violence. Now of course the reality is that should the digital economy actually seem like a threat there's a trivial way for any government to take it down - buy it. Right now the total market capitalization of bitcoin is around $5billion or less than what the US federal government collects in taxes in a single day - they raked in 2.77 trillion in 2013. Said banning government could even spin it as a positive. They pass a law making it illegal for companies to accept digital currencies as payment, but simultaneously offer a brief period of a government buyback of digital currencies to ostensibly avoid inflicting economic harm on anybody. It's fascism with a smile and a check.

It's not temporary Reddit drama. The reason I transitioned away from Reddit a few months ago was when Reddit was censoring any front page posts discussing the legal troubles of Reddit CEO Ellen Pao or her husband. They were fine until they hit the front page of the site at which point they'd be nuked, which implies admin intervention.
To many folks this wasn't a big issue but that's because I don't think they thinking about the implications of it. This sort of censorship isn't whimsical. Some employees at Reddit suggested censoring content because it might make the CEO look bad, it went through the proper channels and was eventually authorized. That is a *radical* change in operations that goes against everything this site has stood for since it was positioning itself as an alternative to Digg. Here are some officially endorsed ad banners for the site still hosted on their self styled [propaganda page:](

Consequently everything that has followed since then has been no real surprise (though the rapidity of it has been) and it's only going to get worse from here on out. Calling it temporary is seriously just burying your head in the sand and remaining oblivious to what's happening around you and on this site.
And Voat, while currently struggling with the huge amount of traffic Reddit is sending its way, is already substantially improved over Reddit in terms of base functionality. Moderator/admin removed posts and comments are now visible as a base part of site functionality to ensure transparency. Images/videos are shown inline. Functionality that has to be added on Reddit through user extensions like post previews, view source, etc are built into the site natively. "Features" of Reddit like removing the up/down vote on posts, which does nothing but hamper transparency, were removed. And so on. 
The site itself is already leagues ahead of Reddit in terms of functionality, it's just a matter of getting the servers upgraded to the point of being able to handle the enormous increases in traffic they've seen while also preparing to scale for what by all indications may likely continue to be exponential growth.

It's funny how you change "transitioned a few months ago" to "transitioned many months ago." Regardless, check my post history if you like. The dates, from a few months back, are going to correspond pretty much 1:1 with the mass Reddit migrations that tend be the times that Voat goes down.

Except bitcoin is infinitely subdividable.
Land not so much. Divide it enough and transfer fees and special fee fees end up costing more than the land itself. On the other hand, I suppose you could actually take care of that with bitcoin. *Oh hell yeah, I own 0.000000001 cm of prime Hollywood real estate!*
