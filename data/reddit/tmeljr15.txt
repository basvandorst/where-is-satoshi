5 grand would essentially buy you one S9 at around 3,000 resale. So you would definitely be better off buying a btc at this point. To actually be making money off of mining you'd need to be around 5+ S9s
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:00:03
S9 is the most efficient per hashing output. Use a mining calculator to calculate your roi but at like 2500-3000 usd (resale of the S9) you'd probably be looking at around a 160 day return with free power.

Could've bought the island if you hodled
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:40:01
All valid points except I think the fortune seekers rationale would push them towards buying btc not mining them. At a 0 cost in electricity and assuming it wasn't your main source of income and could hodl mining doesn't seem like a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:32:03
Depends on your kwh cost for electricity

Bitcoin is at the stage where carrying 50 dollars meant taking your horse and buggy to the local bank getting pounds of gold coins and then going miles to drop it off. Just wait

Oh yea I've been in at around 2400

The only thing PayPal offers that bitcoin doesn't is buyer protection. For instance, buying something on eBay. If you pay the seller and he decides not to ship. Unless I am mistake here.

Trying to play the dips will almost always result in losses, daily price averaging will yield greater returns in the long run. It has also come down from the ath and sitting in between 4500-4550.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:02:37
In 10 months you'd make your original 50 bitcoins back and everything after that would essentially be free bitcoins, following your assumption for free power. Imo opinion a free bitcoin has more value than one you have to pay. Math: price on April 1 (~1200) / cost of S9 (~1200) x 13.5 TH = 622,000 TH =~5.5 btc per month
You'd also have the 50k in hardware so essentially would have a cushion to recoup some of the initial invest should btc crash

No one knows but strike before the iron gets hot...very hot.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:39:22
I never said "profit" I said making money. You can have one S9 that'll make you maybe 200-300 a month, if you have 5 you'd make 5x that. You'd be better off buying btc for 4300 instead of an antminer at 3k
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:20:46
Fees have drastically lowered, mining profitability is up.

From 2011-2013 we saw gains of 1500%, 299%, and 5400% respectively where from 2015-2017 we've seen 37%, 130%, and 220%. Gains have become more steady and I don't think we're in the bubble phase anymore, but, instead, we will see market corrections on overbuys. It would be foolish to think that in 2020 when the rewards half that bitcoin won't be easily in the mid 5 digits. Imagine if people knew there was only 21 million ounces of gold ever available and in 2020 the production rate was halving. Except in this case, function, practically, and (hopefully soon) utility is much higher with bitcoin. No way btc will ever crash.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:29:50
The question is what is a better way to invest 5000 dollars, buying one antminer and living on a decreasing reward scale starting at  around 300 dollars doesn't make sense. But to your point after you hit your roi in the same amount of time, you'd be making 20 times one miner which is a lot more profitable than buying a bitcoin. After your roi is returned you look at it as instead of paying X market value for Z bitcoins you are paying your utilities cost (electricity and internet) for Z bitcoins. And again five would start producing a reasonable sum of money if that helps you. Be my guest and buy one antminer and see where that gets you. Most miners don't own one miner
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:41:06
I bought a handful of s9s back in July on 8 cents a kwh and am making around 2500 a month after expenses. You can turn a profit you just need a large initial investment and cheap utilities. Only thing you have to account for is difficulty increase, but hopefully the price increase can offset that to an extent.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:25:30
So we're forgetting about steam engines. Anyway, just wait . Right now bitcoin is a transfer of wealth not a currency. It's a liquid commodity. Try paying for things with a stock or bond and see how long that takes and the fees your broker gets. It's pretty ahead of its time relatively speaking 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:12:51
Unfortunately you can't really mine bitcoin for fun without expecting to lose money or make almost nothing. Alt coins are a different story however

A rational decision-maker won't spend, assuming (or knowing) that his or her bitcoin with be worth exponentially more in the future. It makes no sense to until an equilibrium price is reached.

If resell is the only price you can buy something at then yes that's what I would tell them it costs. Buying an antminer now costs anywhere from 3-4K usd 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:47:32
It all depends what you can get your gear for. I made an investment and started mining in August, and have already made back almost half of my initial investment paying around 10 cents a KWH. It's doable, but the hardware is not cheap. Especially now.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:20:59
Who knows at this point. Market will decide and price swings of 1.5% and greater in either direction will be few and far between

Yes I did, but I do not recommend it by any means if you don't know exactly what you're doing
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:07:13
You need an outlet with a240 running to it, otherwise the 120 will only power the fan. You can use the standard plug on the PSU you just need a heavier gauge outlet. Also make sure you're at a high enough amp on your breakers. If you overload them they'll just pop. I'm running 30 amps and it handles 4 no problem.

I didn't wire it to a 120 outlet, I used a normal 240 hooked up a heavy duty PDU to it and ran 4 machines to the pdu. Which when you have multiples machines is probably the easiest
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:50:34
It'll go back to normal after the forks
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:25:49
Power distribution unit, basically a hub that distributes the power to all the machines so you don't need to keep adding outlets every time you get another machine. So one   Pdu can power 4 machines with one plug in the 240 outlet. Again keep in mind wire gauge and your breakers

Didn't want to get into the buying and selling of it in here as I don't think that's what this sub was intended for

We've added no new money to the market space. People have drained Alts to try and benefit from both forks. We could even see potentially 6k+ by the 2x fork, but I'm almost 100% sure we'll return to around these levels once the dust settles and Alt/btc ratios return to normal.

Yes, it's mostly a bunch of people chanting over a cauldron. Not really practical.

Lol look up Elliot waves and the horizontal triangle pattern. Like nothing else the bitcoin is a commodity. That's just what the "analysis bullshit" points to. Believe whatever you'd like.

it's in wave III out of 5 in the cycle. Should see around 1-2 more crashes around 1700 before it breaks the 3k ceiling
