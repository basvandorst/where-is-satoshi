I am totally sympathetic; however,  you can always ignore people leading you down a dangerous path: even if it is people you are supposed to trust who are leading you.

How many arcade cabs can you fit in a Dodge caravan? One? Not really what I would consider an arcade... but if it had a nice view of the river maybe people would come no?
Edit: I can't use auto correct as others have pointed out already

I did go bitcoin road, just not all in like I would have if things were a bit different,  have more than most and am blessed and happy. just want my arcade to succeed so I can invest my day job money in crypto again instead of putting money in the arcade to cover overhead.
