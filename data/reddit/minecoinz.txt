Indeed. I have no idea who buys this shit. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:55:30
No.

People who think trying to have people killed is bad = trolls with an agenda, possibly paid shills. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:18:26
Uh what?
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:58:01
Yes indeed. Because Bitcoin is known for all the scams it avoids. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:57:19
And as usual we have to guess how it's relevant to Bitcoin.

Just random people who are disgusted by how many here simply ignore their hero tried to have people killed. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:47:03
Yes we know. It's on top of the mainpage. Please...

How old are you? 15?

Can you point out one paid shill here. Just one. 
Since i see these accusations daily this must be really easy. Thanks. 
Yes, just downvote it and it will go away. The easiest solution when you have no answer. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:08:17
Downvoted to 40%. 
Absolutely hilarious!
Every single day we see posts that people got their coins robbed from their computer but if you post that you're worried about getting your coins stolen you're downvoted to oblivion and excommunicated. 
This is place is insane.

You're in a Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:31:42
Try reading the thread. Just like you should look and read before submitting. 
Your post from 20 minutes ago is not removed because of censorship but because it's been posted 2 dozen times in the last few days. 
Seriously, this thread explained that already. Why do you still act as if you're being censored?

This off topic "news" has been posted several times here already. How exactly is it relevant to Bitcoin?
