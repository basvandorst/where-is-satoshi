No bro, there is no we!    Either software commits are judged by content, or it turns into identity politics.  
Your belief structure is irrelevant.

Personal beliefs are irrelevant to software development.  Also Bitcoin is open source and each commit it judged on its merits, not on the author.

I have mixed feelings about this.   It obviously shows the value proposition of censorship resistance, but it also sets the US government's sights on BTC.

I don't understand how this guy can say you can't financialize bitcoin.
Claims the follow at the 33 minute mark:
1. No Payment system - fails to ack Lightning Network
2. Can't hedge it - ignores various futures products
3. Can't fractionalize it - Umm that's the whole point of bitcoin

No one uses that shitcoin.  Look at the transaction throughput and even if people did "use" it, they would be spending it, which drives down the price.  
No business owner is going to hodl a shitcoin with 10-20% weekly volatility.

Governments can't afford to provide healthcare, unless they run a deficit. Bitcoin will reduce the size of government so they only perform tasks that the free market can't handle..  National security is probably the only thing they should be focused on.

Why the F would the US cut military spending when there is a resurgence of terrorism and China flexing their muscles?  
How about cutting all medical programs ran by the federal government.   That will actually make a difference and the free market would flourish with competition,

That's some amazing luck on behalf of BTC.com.  They found two blocks within 9 seconds of each other.

just another dip shit who doesn't understand bitcoin.

I really wonder what their ban list looks like.   They are not a sub free of censorship.  It's a sub of group think and peer pressure.

Is there a max difficulty?   Any chance we break Bitcoin one day because there's too much hash power?
