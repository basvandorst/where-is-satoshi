Loaf of bread will cost LESS in BTC since number of btc is limited but number of loaves increases. This deflationary nature of BTC is its main weakness (discourages us of btc for exchange of other goods)

But that impact is known and thus priced in.

World productivity is growing. Basically by every metric we produce more stuff (globally) year over year. This is why inflation adjusted GDP is a positive number and this growth (so far) is exponential.

Sure it does. If you spend your life in a room without windows/not on earth you will still age and die... In general most physical processes are time dependent.

You exchange some exchange medium (typically a fiat currency), but you are not exchanging a good or service.

This, investment in btc is not adoption, just pumping of a somewhat deflated bubble. Adoption is actual usage of btc for exchange of good and services.

So the only use case you refer to is for criminal purposes? Because being convenient for criminals is not a good justification for multi-hundred billion valuation.

You asked why we need inflationary currency, I gave the answer. Whatever the currency of tomorrow is, it will have to be inflationary (otherwise why invest).

Inflation is good in that it promotes investment. If you don't need to invest to grow money because currency itself is becoming more valuable then you limit business access to money and decrease production.

Price inflation can occur for a variety of reasons, typically because of monetary inflation (what you alluded to earlier). However, price inflation itself is simply increase in price of some exchange medium. The price in bitcoin of basically any exchange medium (be it food basket or USD) increased. More importantly, the colloquial use of inflation almost always means price inflation, no one actually cares about M2 supply, or whatever.
Edit: if we are talking about bitcoin being a currency, we should care about how much things cost in bitcoin and whether there is price inflation/deflation. Preferably there should be neither.

You can have multiple exchange media.  Price inflation is increase in the quantity of a particular exchange medium to get something else (other commodities or exchange media). Since BTC is typically discussed in the context of USD (which itself is an exchange medium), the relevant price inflation of BTC is relative to an exchange medium called USD. This is why i directly mentioned USD in previous post; food basket is a colloquial reference to PPP equivalent of some exchange medium.

When people say "inflation" they almost never mean monetary inflation, they almost always mean price inflation. Heck, if you go to wikipedia and search for inflation they point you to price inflation.
