I understand the meaning of this event, what I don't get is WHY is it an event ?
Either you leave it or part of it on exchanges and you know what you are dealing with (crypto blocked, exchanges/account hacked, etc...), either you put it on cold wallet and know as well what you are dealing with (private key lost, wallet lost, etc...). 
It's just a matter of trust/risk. Either you trust someone else (exchanges), or you only trust yourself (cold wallet). 
It's one's decision and shouldn't be an periodic event.

"Anything invented after you're 35 is against the natural order of things."
This sums up why governments are never in phase with technologies. Old people ruling countries with outdated perspectives.

I don't see the difference between leaving crypto on an exchange and leaving my dollars at the bank.
Cryptocurrency is as virtual as "real" money which is nothing more than bytes. 
Banks do not have enough cash to satisfy everyone if we all decided to withdraw our money at the same time. 
Yet 99% of people participating to this proof of keys wouldn't dare withdraw their entire stack from their cherish bank.
If the goal is to show dominance on your own crypto, I don't know, pee on your screen when it displays your favorite exchange :D

Like many who love to create (science, graphical art, music, etc...) He/She just wanted to remain anonymous.
A lot of people do things anonymously, no matter how big they think there project will be.

It is not easy to do as the principle is to stay anonymous so you may not know them as they do not get mainstream attention.
For instance I can speak about what I listen. I'm mostly in Techno/House music (not David Guetta style). Theses styles have a huge musics collection, yet many of them are released as "unknown artist". 
If you are into the genre, SNTS remains an anonymous artist for example.
To name a few that are/were anonymous and famous: Banksy, Andy McNab, Isaac Newton when he solved the brachistochrone problem (he submitted his solution anonymously but was revealed by Bernoulli because of how he solved it, a way of his own)
