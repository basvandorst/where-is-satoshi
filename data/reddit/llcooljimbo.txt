Like a sticky note on your monitor.

*I decided to mine Bitcoin so I purchased an asic and was mining along happily... but then I got scared*  
The problem doesn't seem to have originated with eBay.

If anything happens to you, I'll accept your Trezor.

Maybe they were solo mining and they got scared they'd never find a block. It's a cold cruel world out there on your own.

I would like that. I find this sideways one soothing to look at as well.

I've also wondered about this but I assume it's the difference between the market value and the value they give you for the sale. So right now the Coinbase dashboard shows value at 1227 but if you go to buy you're paying 1233. Then they tack their fee on top. I always figured the difference in prices made up transaction fees or covered losses during big swings.

 and  are quick and only require you to have a wallet address.

I did more digging. They do charge a fee for transfers under  0.0001 but they cover your tx fee if it's above. So yeah basically they charge you enough to cover the cost. Reviewing some of my old transactions to an intermediary electrum wallet, it looks like they set the fee pretty close to having the slider all the way to right in Electrum.  
*edit - I also found an archived page from Coinbase that says "Coinbase pays the miner fees (typically 0.0003 BTC)" but that page was edited 2/23/17 and currently doesn't include any specifics so I think they probably just base the fee off the average fees being paid on recent blocks.

I too like to test lady night.

I used the last 4 as the date I wrote it. That way if I had to go back to try to recover something or if the person wanted their stuff back before I donated it I could try to find it easier.

I destroy my own drives and any trash drives for work are destroyed. If I do side work for someone and they don't request the HDD, I format it and give it to goodwill with a btc amount written on it. I've been doing this for over a year. Dozens of HDDs out there now to cause a panic. I never use an exact number though. Always something like 234.4839BTC. Goodwill probably wonders why the HDDs sell so fast.
