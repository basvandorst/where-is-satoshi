So how was the evidence chain of custody compromised to make this possible?

What makes you think this? Is there some reason to believe the evidence chain of custody was not followed?

So where are all these people and how does the math work? 2013 Willybot price was around $1200/BTC, current price is $1850/BTC. Or did you mean that you should buy at the bottom and sell at the top?

It always was?

Why should he do anything, he's perfectly happy with the status quo.

So total absence of evidence of foul play is actually evidence of foul play?
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:27:01


Yes, because it's not actually helpful.

Let's not rewrite history. *Bitcoiners* sold this lie to each other. There were plenty of clear-headed people who pointed out right from the start that PoW is not free and bitcoin's linear security model has absolutely awful scaling.

Just in case you're serious, no, you don't get that either. Most economics-related videos on youtube are made by idiots, quacks or fraudsters, especially the bitcoin- and ancap-related ones.
