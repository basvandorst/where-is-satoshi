Much of the turnover is from miners selling. After the halving that number should look even better.

I am assuming because there is more long term holders.

That is called "free market". The reason why you might not want to do it is because you can not control all other whales.

Kraken does not sell it's own product so that makes no sense.

You sound like an ignorant person. He sounds like a critical thinker who is tired of a broken system in which the left and the right is just a delusion of choice. Andreas is as stand-up-guy! You may want to watch his video a few more times but as just a human being (no politics).
Also, me calling you ignorant is just an observation. It is not meant as an insult. I am also ignorant when it comes to many things.

The whole point is to turn more people into holders.
