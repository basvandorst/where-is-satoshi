So they can be scared shitless, but I can propose a MUCH better way to handle this.
Have a guy that stands next to the "ATM". (Should really change that to a better name.) You present your ID to the guy similarly to how you would to a bouncer. He checks your name on "the AML list" (there actually does exist such a list, what do you think these robocoin ATMs check against?) 
Once he sees that you're "not a terrorist", he lets you use the ATM.
No names tied to Bitcoins and everyone is happy.

I don't understand your two word response. Are you saying you have to pay sales tax on the purchase of gift cards? Because you do not. Are you saying you have to pay sales tax when the card is used at the store? Well... when you take your Bitcoins to a brick and mortar that support them, they're also going to be charging sales tax. Can you please clarify?
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:45:34
Now why can they get away with charging 10%? Oh yes! Because there are people in your situation! Just pay the fee and move on with life.

Ah. If they do this right, you might not even realize the partnerships. What if all of the bitcoins were randomly spread around a mall's food court? And if you had to wait a certain amount of time between picking up each? Some people might waste 4+ hours there and then be stuck with tempting food smells. You could even have time based coins that can only be obtained +/- 1 hour from lunch time.
Another use: you could essentially "buy" a crowd for a certain area. For instance, to make extras in a movie.

AMD can be vunerable to a "$5 wrench attack" (er, court order), just as Intel can. Really, the only way you can get around this is to use open hardware. ( You will be sacraficing speed by running your CPU on an FPGA. Also, its only vunerability proof as long as the FPGA itself doesn't have any malicious bits. (Harder to hide in an FPGA instead of an Intel processor, but not impossible - for instance, do you trust your RAM chips themselves or the EEPROM itself?)
Maybe we need to go back to 74 series discrete logic to be "really secure". (And then use old chips because they would be less likely to be compromised.)

Bitcoin was centrally planned. By Satoshi. (And you might say the developers around him.) What is the difference? Bitcoin worked. Why: Bitcoin is a system. Centrally planning of shared systems like Bitcoin (that require voluntary usage) seems to work quite well. Forceful central planning of resources has never worked in the long term. (Communism.)

You'll need one of these: 
One of these: 
A crystal, USB connector, other odds and ends (a PCB, some resistors, capacitors, etc.)
*Maybe* do-able at hardware cost of $7.20 (Assuming you can get the rest of the odds and ends above for about 80 cents. *Maybe* in large quantities.)
Instead of getting such a fancy OLED LCD display, you could probably settle for a Nokia screen for (about $1.23) less: 
That would give you about $2.03 to get a PCB done, and USB/caps/resistor parts.
Assuming you can get this working with your PCB layout, this one would be about 9 cents. 
That leaves $1.94 remaining. That's just about enough money left over for one square inch of PCB from OSHPark. ($1.66) (Assuming you can squish your design into such a tiny space and not the.... maybe 3 square inches? that the original design has?)

BitPay is terrible because of this! You can set up Coinbase in a day. Or at least begin the set up process. With BitPay, you'd better have a legit business with a legit website already running.

Would you support a quantitative easing to print out 1,000 more USD, if it were possible?
Presuming you do not view USD as a get rich quick scheme, then what would be the problem with changing? It would still work the same way it does now - you would still have all the supposed advantages.
Increasing the amount of USD would also make it easier to work with (I.e. everyone could just use a number of 20 dollar bills instead of deal with complex small coinage.)

They have their head in a stock market mode. Their stocks are worthless outside of Wall Street. You can't go to a Burger King and buy food with GOOG or AAPL stocks. You *can* with Bitcoin. (Through Gyft.) This is so different, it makes most people on Wall Street's heads explode.
(Most people on Wall Street never even own/touch stocks themselves. They own the promise of a stock from their broker, they never touch the stock directly... Sound familiar to anyone? Goxcoins anyone?)
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:37:38
What you're essentially saying is, Mtgox should have had even more "using (spending) people's money in their accounts instead of storing it". I think that's just very very wrong.
Companies like Mtgox failing is a blessing in disguise. It tells people - be damned careful who you give your Bitcoins to because unless you own the private key, its just a promise of Bitcoins (or USD). I'd rather the idiot Mark Karpales crash the whole system in 2014 than in 2050 when half the world's economy runs through Bitcoin.

Case in point - Instagram. It lets you "take pictures" with your phone and share them online. Something most phones could already do before their service. Twitter. It lets you see a shared message someone has sent. Something any college level student studying databases could accomplish 15 years ago.
It was all about marketing in both of these cases.

Also, I spoke to some of the core developers on IRC once. According to them, there will NEVER be smart contracts in the bitcoin main source code. So don't hold back on the looking for other alternatives. Bitcoin will remain a great way to store value. But that's it.

Bitcoin is fairly well funded as well. Tons of cash in the system. Not a lot of investment from the users in expansion though. (Why do the top Bitcoin holders not have more of an interest in "spreading the word of Bitcoin"?)
Maybe something with smart contracts (Counterparty/Ethereum) will incentivize this.

Correction: A domain name is controlled by someone *appearing* to be a certain corporation or individual. (Outside of Namecoin.)
How well are people authenticated when managing a domain name with a provider? Caller ID? (Fakeable) Physical address? (Usually not secured.) I'd bet you could count on one hand the number of domain providers that expect cryptographic authentication. And even those domain providers (as well as every brick and mortar business) are vulnerable to fake snail mail government requests and even fake credentials displayed by fake government agents.

I don't get why its implausible? All you need is something simple that looks for a certain string of bytes. Then you include that string of bytes in one of the companies that you have compromised (via court order) like say... Google.
Google just inserts something like this into one of their already very obscured lines of javascript code:
//HEY_SECRET_PROCESSOR_STUFF_GIVE_ME_MEMORY_ADDRESS: 0x12345678
The bits added to the processor only have to essentially "grep" all the memory traffic for "HEY_SECRET_PROCESSOR_STUFF" and follow whatever instruction is given. The information is sent back to Google in one of their obscure variable names and encoded using an algorithm also planted on the chip. (So it looks like what amounts to garbage.)
You then only have to send enough data back and forth to bootstrap up to full Admin/root access. Even if the user reinstalls the OS, the vunerability is still there. Even if they use an alternate OS like Linux, its still there. Even if they write their own OS and open source every line, still there.
The backdoor doesn't have to know ANYTHING about how higher level protocols like TCP/IP work.
This could be done via any popular website like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, etc. (All are NSA compromised.)

The real stupidity is when I hear people jumping on altcoins using alternate blockchains. They love the fact that "there's not a lot of competition in mining", but don't seem to understand this actually makes the altcoin more likely to be doublespent. (Especially if its SHA256 based. One Bitcoin pool could pretty much aim their hashing power at any tiny altcoin like that and kill it off.)
That is what I'm scared of.

The actual move is something more like telling merchants: FU. You will be on the hook for the liability of fraudulent transactions after 2015 if you're still using mag stripe.
This is how the industry works. You can't really force anyone to buy a new terminal. But you can put the liability onto them, years later they will probably move. (But there is *always* legacy. $$$)
I don't entirely understand this though. Will it mean smaller fees for merchants? VERY unlikely. You'll pay the same 3-4%, transaction processors will just pocket more of it. Its a money grab.

Until ghash.io turns into a service that's more like a VPS that allows me to choose which bitcoind I run (and some way to verify they are actually using the source code you selected) and which pool I want to connect to, they are crap and a danger to Bitcoin in general.

If you were trying to attack Bitcoin from the ASIC/silicon side of things and you had an insider edge, I'd put something in the ASIC that had a counter (non RTC dependent, it would have to be entirely in the same silicon) that would blow a fuse (on silicon) and stop it from doing anything after so many counts from the main clock. Maybe like 3,110,400,000,000,000 (6 mo * 30 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds * 200Mhz) (Basically a ticking timebomb that bricks the ASIC.)
But then, this assumes that everyone is using the same ASIC design. And thankfully, they aren't. :-)
edit: Just thought about this a bit more. It wouldn't be a jarring of enough stop to really do much. After all, people started running their ASICs at different times. It might decrease the hash rate slowly over time and make a lot of angry people though.

That just made me think for a minute. Large governments have huge amounts of cash to spend on forging another country's currency. (Whether it takes buying millions of dollars in tools or people, I'm sure there are countries that might try it.) Why are many countries not in favor of Bitcoin for this very reason??
Something I learned while doing localbitcoin: Its actually quite hard to authenticate cash. You can go through every authentication mechanism. (IR, magnetic scan test, microprint test, texture feel, etc.) But there is still no way to really *really* know it wasn't counterfeited. (Other than to let a bank do it for you and hope they don't "do a chargeback on your deposit" if they later find you gave them bad money.)

From the paper:
"As our attack requires capturing multiple signatures, one way of mitigating it is limiting the number of times a private key is used for signing. Bitcoin, which uses the secp256k1 curve on which ths work focuses, recommends using a new key for each transaction. This recommendation, however, is not always followed, exposing users to the attack."
Wow. Its more important than ever to use a fresh address for EVERY transaction!

You are seeing processors stuck in a model of "instructions only do one thing". I see them as "instructions can do almost anything depending on the context and evilness of the silicon." If there is an AES instruction, who says its not grepping certain memory addresses for bitcoind and then returning malicious data if it finds that? (Just as a very bad example. A better one would be: everyone goes to google.com. Allow two way communication by embedding stuff in google.com javascript (who reads it?) that gets grepped by every processor, then the processor returns stuff back by substituting certain strings that are then sent back to google? (And remember, google *is* in bed with the government, NSA/Snowden proved this.))


I don't think you get what I'm talking about here. The protocol is by *consensus*. If they all agree to evil, they are in consensus.


Very good point. But are &gt;50% of bitcoin nodes running on pre-bitcoin silicon? Unlikely. :-( Also, if they have a generic backdoor like I've specified above, then you're still screwed.

An incentive to get your transaction included in a block. Essentially, saying no to a miner's fee is trying to tell miners you think it costs nothing for them to operate / include transactions into blocks.

"It provided only 3D acceleration and as such the computer also needed a traditional video controller for conventional 2D software. A pass-through VGA cable daisy-chained the video controller to the Voodoo, which was itself connected to the monitor. The method used to engage the Voodoo's output circuitry varied between cards, with some using mechanical relays while others utilized purely electronic components. The mechanical relays emitted an audible "clicking" sound when they engaged and disengaged."

There are means to transact in a USD/EUR value without connecting to the internet. In fact, you could even just put Bitcoin paper wallets in an existing vending machine. My idea: (haven't seen anyone actually implement it yet...)
Print out a Bitcoin paper wallet with the private/public key on it.
Keep copies of these keys.
Load/unload the paper wallets "remotely" as often as needed when the exchange prices differ. (Once per day at midnight, or every few hours.) Load "$1" of Bitcoins into the wallet, or whatever you have the vending machine set to. All of the wallets could be loaded/unloaded with the correct kind of transaction and fee.
There is little risk for using a traditional vending machine for this. Because, its going to hold $1 of Bitcoins, or $1 of chips/candy.
Instead of being a "candy transmitter", you'd be a "Bitcoin transmitter". :-)

Proof of stake just says "we're all wealthy and we're not going to screw over our wealthy neighbors". (Kind of like a giant cryptographic "gentleman's agreement".) It doesn't actually *prevent* wealthy people from screwing over other wealthy people (and poor or normal people.) This might be a huge concern, especially when you're trading with what might be a hostile neighbor in the future, like another country.
Bitcoin actually *prevents* this. Even in the case of a 51% attack, any changes to the blockchain ledger are discarded when a new block is mined by an honest node. (So you just have laggy transactions as a worst case scenario. ie: having to wait for 6 confirmations before you can really really really trust the transaction.)

Instead it should say, "Not including a miner's fee is essentially giving a big FU to miners everywhere, so your transaction will have to wait around until someone nice enough to accept a zero transaction fee puts it into a block. This could take 24 hours, 30 days, a year, or more."
Or you could just, I don't know, *not allow users to even select that without enabling some sort of expert mode*.
What really sucked is the Robocoin got tired of waiting for his transaction after 24 hours and cancelled the request. I'd call that a huge fucking bug! Robocoin ends up with the Bitcoins in the end and the user ends up with nothing!

I'm not 100% sure, but don't these sorts of "no" decisions really rely on the people managing the 20%+ pools? (When you mine for a pool, you're not running a full node, your node is a slave and doesn't even touch the Bitcoin protocol.)
If there was more transparency in the code pool operators were running, at least miners should be able to pick the one they like.

I think this should always be, "the key is very very very hard to extract". Its not that its impossible. It would just require millions of dollars of equipment to do it. (You'd need to dissolve the package off the chip, then use a scanning electron microscope to very carefully read out the values and not set off any of the IC-level booby traps and get around safeguards against scanning electron microscopes.)

I think my ideas are not being communicated clearly.
If you only have a "your bitcoins have been received" message and you're using SMS, even if you trust the person sending you the messages, there's no way to trust the SMS network because it is inherently insecure. (That was my comment on OpenBTS being available. Most people would have no idea if their phone is on a rogue BTS or not.)
Encryption on the phone could help with this, but only if you have a smart phone. A feature phone would have no way to cryptographically authenticate an SMS. (Assuming you aren't using a J2ME or some other waaaay old technology. Also possible if you write software specifically for that one exact phone manufacturer/model.)

You have to be careful even on an offline computer when generating bitcoin addresses. It can use what looks like random input for the private key, but in reality it could be crippled to be broken easily by some third party. The same can happen to any microprocessor or other silicon design.

Changetip does not even seem that complex. When you invoke a user's name like  if you pay for reddit gold you can get notifications.

I only said 0.5% just to throw a number out there.
Here are some *actual* numbers: (I'm putting source links because otherwise you probably won't believe me. I was actually a bit shocked, I haven't checked these in a while.)
Chase Savings: 0.01% source: 
Wells Fargo Savings: 0.01% source: 
Bank of America Savings: 0.01% source: 
There are some edge cases where you can get more. For instance, tens of thousands of dollars in a bank account might get you a fraction of a percent more. Some checking accounts give just a fraction more. (While most checking is actually 0.00%)
I've searched for a LONG time for my own personal account. I'm getting a huge amount of 1.60% (and its just a local bank.) I don't think I've personally heard of anything larger.

51% attacks will merely introduce a delay in transactions. The consensus of the network throws out the malicious transactions in the next few blocks later. (That's why its good to wait 6+ confirmations/blocks so it becomes very likely that this hasn't happened.)

Or is it that a multi-million dollar professional mining farm is going to keep their machines running even if they're in the red?
Because you have two choices:
Watch all of your shiny millions of dollars of mining equipment do nothing and eat, say, a $10 million dollar hole in your wallet. (Especially if they are ASICs. Literally zero value other than trying to mine Bitcoins.)
Run them anyway, get some money returned, even if you're "running in the red", and maybe hope for bitcoins to go up in value, hope people will pay more for "new coins", or ???
Unfortunately, the more miners who choose the second option, the less we come to an equilibrium on "what mining should pay out".

It feels so backwards that you would say this. One of the reasons why there is a block size limit is that - you can still run a full node from your home internet if you wanted. Try doing that if the block size limit increases. It might get to the point where you'd need a 300Mbps full node just to participate.

This is a bit like saying the postal service should get into the email delivery system though, right?

Maybe you take it to a postal service in place A, they scan, email, authenticate, and shred the originals, saving the physical transportation costs.).
So - its just not going to happen. Just like the postal service, traditional banks are very set in their ways. They're not going to become a super secure database for you. Its just not their business model. Even if it makes tons of sense.

Security issue of what? The device knows the words. In fact, it has a general purpose microcontroller, it's not even a "secure processor". (For cost reasons? And because I guess it doesn't need it?)
If you meant - they had the device on the video while showing the seed, then 1) the guy will probably end up re-initializing the device if he does anything serious with it 2) 240p video makes it hard to see WTF is going on, so you can't see crap.

Also, the lightbulb is unreliable because it goes out any time a group of humans get too greedy. The power consumption varies over time wildly, and it may cause breakers in your house to trip. Most people know there is a better lightbulb, but are scared by the gun to their head telling them they have to use the approved lightbulbs only. Freedom always wins over tyranny in the end.

It does fix a Greek debt problem. If people were to use a currency that *can't* be corrupted by banks and fractional reserve banking, they would starve the government from going into debt like they did.
Government says: "we'd like to borrow $100 billion from thin air to have an Olympics"
Bitcoin would say: "meh. find people with that many bitcoins, then you'll have $100 billion"  (I realize you can't hold $100 billion in Bitcoin yet.

Why is it then that some Bitcoin miners attach no transactions and yet they are still able to cooperate with the rest of the network? (Although really, this seems like something where other miners should have code that says "my mempool has a million transactions pending and you include zero transactions? I'm going to block your IP / ignore the block you just mined!!!" I guess the problem would be, what would you set this threshold to? More than zero? People would just include 1 transaction. 25% of any transactions you see in mempool? 25% of the top fee paying transactions?)

Exactly. You'd be trading from a centralized coin (Citicoin) to a decentralized coin (Bitcoin). (Because of the benefits of a decentralized coin.) But once it's in any kind of digital currency, it's easier for exchanges to form around the trading of one to the other. (Versus having to deal with paper currency / ACH / etc.)

Citicoin has something to offer though. What if they allowed Citi customers to withdraw their funds into Citicoin? And 1 Citicoin = $1 USD (not because they just "say so", but because they are willing to trade it back to a dollar for you). Then you could go to an exchange and get rid of that crappy Citicoin to get some Bitcoin...

I wouldn't assume that they current process has anything to do with a potential NFC sticker.

I had them deny my "real credit" credit cards for buying a laptop in a store even when I had the "available balance". (For reasons of - "we deny all large value transactions and require you to call in and speak to someone in India for half an hour". And this was with one of the largest 4 credit card providers...)

These are not the rules of Bitcoin we're talking about. Fedcoin can (and will) have whatever rules they want to throw in. Made by governments, for governments. Including "turning off coins when we don't like you".

That's not what the bible says. The bible literally says that god is in heaven and heaven is in the clouds. You're taking it out of context. The context is: I'm a 2,000 year old sheepherder that has never seen the clouds, therefore, mysterious places are within there.
Unfortunately, that sort of nonsense dries up when we take an airplane right through where heaven was supposed to be.

You either have software that works around that block as soon as they *try* to block it, or you form new networks out of band from Comcast, etc. Especially if you're mining, you wouldn't want your connection to go down.

To answer the question directly - yes. I remember reading a paper on bitcoin scalability.

The safest way is to not use a paper wallet at all. Why? While bitcoins in a paper wallet can be "cold" (you can send to an address that has never existed before on the network), the only way a paper wallet can be utilized (that I know of) is to put it on a hot bitcoin client.
The better way is to use actual cold storage that's offline like Armory. Then, the thing that holds your private key is always offline and you just have it signing transactions to be later broadcast on the bitcoin network by another online computer.

Should you even worry about a double spend with relatively small transactions? (Lets say under $500.)
For a car worth a couple of grand, wait for 6 or 8 confirmations - whatever makes you have a fuzzy feeling.

If you had a number of people to pay out, you could send Bitcoin to many people and only have to pay a fee once. (I believe this is called a send-to-many transaction.)

You have a swimming pool. You can see how deep the water is. You have no idea how fast its being emptied and it might even vary wildly. You want to know how fast its being filled up, but that number is not available. So instead, you try to use the "how deep water is" as an approximate. All of a sudden I put a hole at the bottom and it starts emptying out rapidly. You take that as a signal that the swimming pool is being filled up at a slower pace (because you can only see the depth) instead of that its being emptied out faster. Do you see why this is a bad thing? (For metaphorical equivalent, the hole in the bottom could be MtGox hiring additional call centers/investigators to process verification faster.)

You could spend an infinite amount of time and resources to try to get most people to answer, but more than likely you're going to miss out on large percentages of the population. (Even the US Census has some amount of error and that's one where they try to get *everyone* to respond.)

Don't give it to some random dude on the internet. Coinbase is probably your best bet. (Or Bitstamp if you can do international wire transfers.)

With blockchain / most other online wallets, there's a secret key to access your wallet / spend your bitcoins. You know it with the printout and blockchain knows it to allow you access to your account.
By having your own bitcoin wallet on your computer, only you have to know the private key. With Armory offline, the thing that has the private key never even has to be online. (You give it transactions to sign and then take those transactions to an online computer to broadcast them.)

Central Bank money is inflated at the rate at which new workers enter the economy so that way the value stays semi-stable over time. That means that the ones doing the inflating will always be rolling in wealth while the common man will always be trying to keep from going broke.

How can the government even identify you as unique? (Let alone a government's voting system.)
The closest thing I could think of would be multiple DNA samples from all over your body. (Under government supervision. And the supervisor him/herself would be just one of the weak points.)
Once they have a strong idea that the person in front of them is unique, they'd need to cryptographically extend that trust. (And then all of a sudden they have to deal with a private key that has to be kept even more secret than all of the cash and bitcoins in existence. If they sign your key to prove you are who you say you are, now you have to keep a private key secure with a high level of security.)

My own Startup Weekend approaches. Trying to come up with ideas myself too. I'd avoid anything where cash/bitcoins are exchanged. There are already exchanges for that and in my opinion its fairly high risk. I was thinking maybe a game you played Bitcoin to play. Or perhaps the powerups in a game would be a very small amount of Bitcoin.
Another idea: a matchmaker for service providers and people with Bitcoin. (You could even tie into an existing service provider company.)

Most arcade machines are based upon a simple serial protocol to their cash acceptor. It should actually be fairly simple to hook up a cheap tablet (you can get some cheap ones for like $50, compare that to a $300 cash acceptor) that spits out the "good" signal when the bitcoins for the game are received.

Maybe, but it would still be distributed and anyone could participate at the highest level (being a miner / processing transactions) because of its distributed nature.

I'm guessing you've never seen a pick and place machine? You pop in a panelized board (that may have many PCBs within it) and it places components using a robotic picker VERY fast.

I know at least one answer to the first question: If you had infinite hash rate, you could find all the blocks to mine the rest of the 21 million coins available almost instantly. (Minus the time to actually broadcast to other nodes you've found a block.) I'm not sure of what the lower bound is to get the remaining coins in one second. Likely something huge like at least 100,000 times the current hashrate.
21,000,000 is the real numerical upper bound. The reward will halve and halve every few years, but there is a hard limit on 21,000,000 coins in the bitcoin protocol itself. Its not just a magnitude. (Checked the source yesterday because I had this same question.)
The upper bounds is only arbitrary in that's what Satoshi picked. :-) see here for a bit more info: 
Not sure what you meant by the fourth one. Are we also supposed to factor in the approximate cost of ASIC miners right now? (There's more to mining than just the electricity. Don't forget cooling too.)
EDIT: I just thought about what the other redditors said. Impossible to mine them all in one second unless you had more orders of magnitude of hashrate than the entire sun can provide in energy. (My oversimplification.) Just know that its a HUGE number. You'd chug along in microseconds getting blocks and broadcasting them until you hit the 2016 block roadblock when difficulty would GO TO THE MOON. Then you'd have to be that much faster the next round.

First of all, I hope I don't blow your mind.
They aren't key pairs. A public key is derived from your private key through a one way hash. This means that I can give you my public key (bitcoin address) to send money to, but it would take more energy than the sun has in order to "go the other way" with this hash.
This is why you can give something like blockchain.info your private key only and then it just "knows" your public key.
Its usually too much to tell newbs, so I understand if this was your reason for not saying it like that.

Glad you are following. Please see here:
On the third chart from the top (looks like two mountain facing each other) we have a bunch of buyers and a bunch of sellers. This is called the market depth. So at the V point towards the center, there might be someone who wants to buy at $165 (the bid price) and someone who wants to sell at $170. (the sell price)
This "V mountain" is constantly shifting right and left as people (or trading bots) adjust their limit orders.
Btw, at the tip of the V is the "latest price". (The last trade to have happened where a buy and sell where matched.)
What evens it out? Nothing. People are the ones that set what limit orders they want. (Unless you say "buy at the market price". You are actually saying, buy at the farthest left tip of the blue mountain on the linked chart above.)
The fourth chart from the top is sort of a "zoomed in view" of the third chart's "V".

I tried to get xe.com to add bitcoin:
Me: When are you going to add the trading value of bitcoins to your site? How old does a currency have to be before you consider it valid? Bitcoin is already around four years old and has a $2.5 billion dollar market.
Them: Thank you for your enquiry.
In order for us to include the currency, it will need to be recognized globally as a currency, not just a unit of exchange. This would involve things such as a getting an ISO4217 currency code allocated by the ISO. If you wish for Bitcoin to gain more recognition as a currency, you may wish to try lobbying the ISO as a start point.
Thank you for your interest in our company and services.
(This got me going down a rabbit hole of searches to forums about the application process of ISO4217 and how its been tried and denied because bitcoin has no "native country" or some nonsense. Gold also has no native country and is ISO4217 listed...)
The gate keeper to getting in ISO 4217 is "SIX Interbank Clearing".

Bitcoin is a distributed transaction ledger. So when you say, "I have 0.01 BTC and I give it to you", its actually being included in this giant distributed accounting ledger. Approximately once every 10 minutes, a new copy of the ledger is verified by mining which makes it cryptographically impossible to double-spend the same money.

A shared global ledger keeps track of how many bitcoins everyone owns. (Think of this like a bank's ledger, but on a P2P network similar to how torrent works.) It is cryptographically secure.
Bitcoins have value because of exchanges where buyers and sellers are waiting to immediately exchange your bitcoin for USD/EUR/etc and vise versa.
Bitcoin wallets can be created by anyone at any time. (Unlike the lengthly traditional process of getting a bank account requiring providing your identity, making sure you're eligible to participate in the banking system.)
Since its "internet money", it can be sent across the world instantly.

I don't think you understand. When you move all the money to one address, you forever tie them together in the blockchain.

And? Early adopters often profit more than late comers. Look at Google with its search engine and Apple with its white roundy products. If I made a search engine (quite a trivial computer science exercise) I don't get paid billions to make it. If I make a roundy white product, I also don't get billions. That "land" has been discovered and duplicate competitors have to deal with the existing volume to well entrenched brands.

The miner gets it "instantly" in that everyone knows they have it now. (Because they included the transaction that gives it to themself.) But they can't spend it until 120 confirmations later.

Agreed. No retailer is going to be an expert on authenticating gold. What does it take to authenticate Bitcoin? A wallet that you trust. How can that trust be formed?

Not that it would matter, but the entire bitcoin network averages closer to 0.5 transactions per second right now.
Wallets are software limited to 7 transactions per second (unless the wiki I got this from was old.)
We understand that VISA has around 2,000 transactions per second.
If the 7 transaction per second limit were removed (and if it were even needed to be removed - right now its not even needed), and if you ran every full node on at least a core i7 2.2Ghz computer with typical broadband internet, the network could easily scale to thousands of transactions per second. (From how I interpreted the wiki.)

Your  doesn't really make sense. Does it matter that you can't get your bitcoin out of gox? You could always find a different exchange when it comes to it. (Of course putting your money in gox to buy at the higher price instead of buying at bitstamp makes very little sense.)

If I have a country with a specific currency, how do I get VISA accepted? (I've gone to some countries and used VISA to get money before. They charged a $5.00 conversion fee or something like that, but I was still able to have cash to spend there!)
Does VISA only play ball when your currency is based upon a fractional reserve banking system or something?

One huge difference? To incorporate Bitcoin might be a small software and maybe a hardware upgrade ($30 web camera for scanning QR? Not really necessary if the payments are only going to the merchant. Maybe necessary for a refund.) What would it take the average vendor to start validating / accepting / storing gold? A WHOLE lot more. You'd need a vault at every register. You'd need an armored service to take the gold somewhere else to be sold. (As well as the volatility involved.) You'd need cashiers who understand how to test gold. You'd need drill testing. X-raying. Weight scales. Electronic lookup for spot price. You might *still* have people doing fraudulent transactions.
You *can* do a 0 confirmation Bitcoin transaction in about 2 seconds on a mobile phone. (BitPay accepts this, so it wouldn't be impossible to integrate.) How long would a typical gold transaction take? 10 minutes? 15 minutes?

To anyone with this opinion, I would ask, "aren't banks just running a database with a bunch of account balances in them? why not be skeptical of that system for its simplicity?"
The value of systems like Bitcoin or the traditional banking system are from their utility.

Only if you are using bitcoin wrong. Well formed bitcoin transactions have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Hard to know if the output is change or the recipient.

If you're using something like a blockchain.info wallet, it does not do this by default.

Don't forget the hashpower security. A tiny altcoin can be toyed around with by someone with a large enough ASIC miner.

You could precompute private/public keys offline and just wait for someone to put some bitcoins in one of them. You could do this with regular wallets as well, but the possibilities would be astronomical (you'd even be better off mining for bitcoin with the same processing power.)

I've read the SHA256 pseudo code on wikipedia. (Bitcoin doesn't actually have SHA256 libraries, it just uses them.) While I understand the fundamental mathematical operations that happen to do SHA256, I do not understand why the hashes generated are unique to such a high degree. I'm not a math major and this would probably be a question for them.
If you're having trouble falling asleep, this may help: 
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:36:59
That was also my first question. :-)
Other peers only count it as a share when you've included everyone else in the "reward part of the block you mine". (With their percentage of bitcoin paid out as part of the 25 btc reward.) And you're finding the proof of work against this. So those transactions are locked in there. Its actually so ingenius, I'm not sure why its not more popular.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:25:16
If I hit wikipedia with a botnet to search for "bitcoin" does this make the price of bitcoin go up?

"simple question I think"
You're saying its a simple question to ask for quantitative numbers on a relatively anonymous currency? We know exactly how many coins are in circulation. Anything more than that is actually fairy hard to nail down. You can count active wallets, but how to you know there's not someone with a bot out there just to keep that number artificially high? Same goes for mining. We can know the upper limit to these numbers, but finding the lower limit or exact value is actually pretty hard.

Hi, I've already discussed this (and its just probably a repeat of what other people have said). Its quite simple to solve.
- Bitcoin (10 minute confirmation)
- Outerspacecoin (1 day confirmation or longer if you'd like)
- Marscoin (10 minute confirmation or whatever you'd like)
The reason for a Marscoin is to segment the payment network from Bitcoin. There's no point in stopping people from trying to use Bitcoin on Mars, but they would soon find it doesn't work quite right for the reasons you've pointed out.
There would also be exchanges between these various coins.

I think you're making it more confusing than it actually is. Each address has a private key. The public key is derived from that. Bitcoins are sent to public keys. You can only spend a bitcoin if you have the private key.


Not really. You can send your bitcoins to any valid bitcoin address, even if its never been used.

So as of this post, you'd move the price up by about $7 by buying $100,000. (About a 2% price move.)

DNB says that exchange rates may fluctuate significantly and there is no central issuer which may be held liable. Consumer Also, the deposit guarantee scheme does not apply.
DNB emphasizes that it does not monitor virtual currency.

Online wallet to online wallet will of course be faster than using the official bitcoin wallet.

Merchants should have a variety of incoming online wallets (with places like blockchain.info) to make sure transactions are as fast as possible. Of course online wallets are at the mercy of the website provider (as seen with instawallet), so only keep "carrying around money" in there, and keep your bitcoin savings in the official bitcoin wallet.

There is only a private key. The public bitcoin address is derived from a hash of your private key. (But like most/all hashes, the process is irreversible. One of those, it would take more energy than the sun has sort of things.)
The blockchain records you sending your bitcoins to a public bitcoin address. You are able to make this transaction because you have access to the private key that can sign the transaction and make it valid.
So the answer to your original question, how can offline paper wallet generators exist, is because they can make a random private key (hopefully random enough!) and because they have enough computing power to do the hash. (It actually takes quite a bit of computing power even to "go the right way" on a hash. I've seen a video of someone's arduino generator and it took maybe... 2 minutes! (Because its 8-bit and all the math has to be emulated.))
I think this is why many standalone paper wallet printers like the Piper use a raspberry Pi. So as long as you never connect that to anything that's online, your private key is safely hidden inside. (Assuming the software is perfectly random and not handing you pregenerated private keys. That's why open source matters.)

Yes, but people using your service should be encouraging you to use a new receiving address for each transaction as it helps protect their privacy more. Using the same receiving address is basically allowing all customers to see your entire income history and the history of all customers that ever used yours service.
Yes its "easier" to just post one QR code for all incoming Bitcoin, but IMHO its worth it doing the extra work for one receiving address per transaction. (As the stock Bitcoin client intended.)

EDIT: Would you ever consider vending with my paper wallet idea? As in, have paper wallets in the machine, (traditional candy dispenser type) pull all the funds out (every day / every few hours), then put back in funds that are appropriate for the preset amount ($1.50 / etc) that the vending machine is set for. (In order to adjust for the current market price of Bitcoin.) For bonus points on this, use the "send-to-many" feature of bitcoin to do this for (hundreds? thousands?) of paper wallets for one transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:02:29
1) Ask your bank if you can do international bank transfers
(If not, find what would be required then do that thing.)
2) If they say yes, transfer it right into bitstamp and get the market prices
Alternatively, you might email coinbase's support email and see how fast they would be willing to get you verified and up and running. (They might move faster if there's a bit more of profit incentive, I really don't know though.)

I suppose you'd save the cost of having to run a large infrastructure with 99.9999% availability to accept the votes.
Still though, entrusting average idiots with cryptographic certificates seems iffy. Maybe if we gave them all smart cards that had the private key inside and the ability to sign. (The government already does this in some areas, but it would require all computers be retrofitted with USB smart card readers. Also, the future is mobile.)

Bitcoin is a distributed decentralized currency. Anyone in the world can hop onto the network and start mining bitcoins.
Btw, its quite hard for mining to be profitable today. Its kind of like getting to the gold rush and they only find BB sized gold nuggets every year. If you're mining you could speculate on the price of gold/Bitcoin in that case, but you could also do so by buying the gold/Bitcoin itself directly.

Regulation - 
3. the percentage difference in some quantity related to the operation of an apparatus or machine, as the voltage output of a transformer or the speed of a motor, between the value of the quantity at no-load operation and its value at full-load operation.
4. the difference between maximum and minimum voltage drops between the anode and the cathode of a gas tube for a specified range of values of the anode current.
5. the normal, prescribed duration of a game according to the sport's regulations, exclusive of any extra innings, overtime period, etc.: The Knicks tied the score in the final seconds of regulation, sending the game into overtime. 
Regulation has a long history long before there were "government regulators". Think of various regulators and regulation systems in a car.

Its true that my estimate has some flaw because if you don't just buy it all exactly at one time, the market will react as your order is executed. If you did it all at one time though, by the orders that are out there when I original posted that, it would be $8,926/btc.

To the OP, are you suggesting some sort of communist coin???
Let me put something into perspective for you. I can work 40 hours a week making USD minimum wage and do you know what I get in 10 years? Many percentage points of lost value on my money! Do you know what I'd get if I was working for bitcoin? Even if the deflationary aspect slowed/stopped, I'd at least preserve the value of what I had! If not improved it!
Some people refuse to accept that there are genuine opportunities out there that are once in a lifetime. I believe buying Bitcoin now is one of them. (Imagine if you were the first to buy up the land in California or New York many years ago because you thought the year round weather was great. And then millions of people started living there!)

Another slightly derivative work I was thinking of, sort of an IQcoin or SkillCoin. You take a multi-choice test. The answers on the test (lets say they're all true/false) make a binary hash 0/1 with many different "bits". They go through a one way hash. It would be very easy to prove you did great on the test, but very hard to figure out what the answers are. (Without collusion of test takers.) To assist with the collusion problem, new tests are generated by the people who proved skills from the old test.
What is the end effect/goal? You could go to an employer and say "7nf7823bf45b" and they would have solid proof that you have that skills. (Which could be more efficient than days of testing by a potential employer.) Sort of a decentralized CompTIA.
One interesting aspect of this, you could brute force the incorrect test answers if you knew most of the correct ones. This means that it would only be good for proving that you know, say, 80% of the material. (That would also be less useful if new tests were made by people with existing skills. Also, if you took other skills tests, it could prove a broader range of skill. Example: Taking a Computer Programming test and a Computer Hardware test has a greater meaning that you know more about IT.)

Bitcoin wallets have two parts. The public bitcoin address and the private key. (The public bitcoin address is actually derived from a one way algorithm with the private key.) If a malicious party had your private key and you had a backup copy and knew your primary copy was stolen, the first person to transfer the bitcoins away "wins". (Because after that, they're now "at the new address".)
If you were targeted for being a bitcoin user, they might already know this and you'd be screwed. If they were random thieves, it might take them some time before they figure out how to work your bitcoin.

Paper wallets are a great way to physically donate Bitcoin to someone if their phone doesn't support Bitcoin (such as a feature phone). I'd still tell them they should transfer their funds to a wallet under their own control.
Besides that, it really has limited uses.

Ideally you want a paper wallet that you get printed out in the form of etching into metal. Like wheyjuice said, don't trust hardware. Other possibilities are to have it carved into stone. 10,000 years from now, don't you want some archeologist saying something about your financial holdings?

1) Find the owner. It would be useless to talk to employees, they can't make a decision like that.
2) Write them a letter. (Or to the location of the restaurant but to their name.) Explain that you'd like to talk about it. Compare it to how credit cards were when they just started out.

Even parents should be thrilled. Money - that children can spend - and they don't have to co-sign? (Traditionally children cannot have checking accounts unless they have a parent co-sign.

It is absolutely legal in most states to have underaged people work for their parents. (I think there is also a dollar cap.)

- Is there any reason why you'd want to support centralized mining? This is typically seen as an evil thing by the Bitcoin community and hurts the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

If there was a magic money printing machine but a group called "The Federal Reserve" was offering to print the money for you (in their centrally housed data center) even though you gave you the output, would you trust them?
Its not quite that extreme, but - 51% attack. They have no incentive to be below that unlike other mining pools. Also, they will be choosing the bitcoind software to run. That means that they will make the choices of what whitelist/blacklist bitcoin address strategy to employ if any. (I'm not saying they're going to. I'm saying the risk is there.)

This isn't necessarily just about block rewards. This is about the power of the miner. The power to determine what transactions to include in a block and the power to allow double spends. (And the so called "51% attack".)
I believe such power should stay distributed, as Bitcoin is a decentralized system. As soon as you start to centralize it, you make it vulnerable to attacks like this. (And also vulnerable to governments and other outside influences.)
Btw, the leaders in  agree with me. (The IRC channel, not a damned twitter handle.)

So I *really* take issue with this question. (The only one I got "wrong" according to your test.)
What is the safest way to store a large amount of Bitcoin?
- On your rooted Android phone
- In a reputable online wallet that uses two-factor authentication
- In a paper wallet offline
- In an encrypted file synced with Dropbox
This test makes me think that *you* don't actually know the safest method. "In a paper wallet offline" was the correct answer you had on the test. That answer leaves a bit to be desired.
I would have accepted "In a paper wallet that was generated offline". Your answer is misleading and might make people think they can simply keep the paper offline somehow and then its safe.

Hi. Sounds nice. Most older vending machines only have one of those 7 segment displays though, not something fancy enough to show a QR code.

Foreign addresses really can have landmarks in them. I've seen it like this for some from Central America. It makes you wonder what happens if the landmark moves, but in some countries things happen slower so this is less likely to happen.

I don't really understand why this sort of virus can't be entirely autonomous. It would generate a random key, encrypt everything with that random key, then hold the files hostage until it sees your bitcoin transaction. (To an address baked into the virus.) The only thing it would need is a hook to a few bitcoin transaction log websites. (Of course... you might be able to present a false answer? But then what if it checks the HTTPS validity? For bonus points you could actually turn the machine into a bitcoin node and know for sure the transaction would go through. But that seems kinda slow.) Hrm, lots of cat/mouse. Most people are probably not smart enough to begin to not just pay the 2.0 BTC.

Bitcoin is more decentralized than gold. With gold, you have a bunch of mystery miners who release the gold at an unknown and changing rate. This could be (and is) influenced greatly by bankers and "those in power". With bitcoin, the rate of mining is predictable and known by anyone who cares about it.

I'm not sure why people think virtual machines are somehow more secure. It would take a virus that understands the memory layout of a virtual machine in memory, but its not like this is hard or something. You're thinking of the security inside out. Your raw metal hardware is protected against the malicious virtual machine. And this is true only when the virtual machine software itself doesn't have any bugs.

Its funny, but the thing is, nobody said it had to be easy. Slow growth is still growth.
Easiest way is just to leave a repressive country for a less repressive one.

I think maybe people need to learn how to not use banks if the big bad bankers come and shut down your accounts.
For people who you can't convince to use Bitcoins, there is still:
- Cash (which you can get from localbitcoins if you have no  other alternative)
- Money orders (which you can hand people who refuse cash and "have to have a check")
- Check cashing service (which you can use for people who refuse to pay you in other ways)
Be prepared to rack up a lot of fees using these services. (Sometimes money orders are free or just a few pennies. Probably the one that will bite you the hardest is the check cashing service.)

If you're buying a small amount, that sounds like a good idea. If you're buying a large amount, I'd look into Armory offline wallet (cold storage).

Its not illegal to trade BTC for USD using paypal. If you can find some sucker willing to sell you BTC using paypal, more power to you. The risk is on the BTC seller side, since the buyer can do a chargeback.

Because all bitcoins in a transaction must be spent or else they become part of the transaction fee. So, in order to avoid this, you send back the part that's change to a new address. (In reality things like blockchain.info send back to one of your existing addresses unless you explicitly specify a new address. A new address is more secure though. That way, nobody can tell if you were sending the change or the amount when they look at the transaction.)

Because the price of Bitcoin fluctuates. Example:
(Lets say you had the machine set to $2.50/item, I don't know if that's possible on all machines.)
$100/BTC = 0.025 BTC in the paper wallet
$500/BTC = 0.005 BTC in the paper wallet
$1000/BTC = 0.0025 BTC in the paper wallet
If someone breaks into the machine, they will be able to grab a bunch of paper wallets worth $2.50/ea. If someone breaks into the machine full of chips and candies, they get chips and candies worth $2.50/ea (or whatever they are).
Yes it is to adjust it to the current exchange rates. I think that is one of the main hurdles I am solving with my idea.

Actually, you'd probably want a blockchain with an even longer average time between confirmations (maybe 1 hr?), and then a third coin that's seperate from bitcoin to use on Mars itself. (Because if you just used Bitcoin on Mars itself, you'd have lag again.)

- Bitcoin (~10 min)

I found this. It looks close, but not quite. (Maybe you can even load what they have in javascript/AJAX and somehow render a thermometer out of it?) 
Edit1: I just looked a bit deeper at what they are doing. You can use this for sure. Reload the coinwidget page with firebug on. Looks like their script calls another script on their server, lookup.php, that just passes JSON of the bitcoins at a public bitcoin address. So you can just style this to be a thermometer.
Edit2: Their "api" looks easy enough to use.
^ I've already switched that to a different bitcoin address on the URL to test it. Then you get: 
var COINWIDGETCOM_DATA = [{"count":18,"amount":7.64397598}];
(Which lines up with what something like blockchain.info says.)
**(Working example)** Edit3:  I found a goal meter example and modified it. Child's play!  (The only thing it lacks is a USD/BTC conversion, but that could be complex, you'd have to load in the data for that somehow.)

I've been thinking about a two mobile phone solution in Africa. Since they are still using feature phones, you have to depend on provider pushed J2ME stuff. So with the other phone, you disconnect the carrier (so no back doors/pushing), upload some new firmware, and use it as an offline wallet. Alternatively, you do the same idea with just another cheap offline hardware wallet. (But since they already have feature phones there, I think its actually an inferior idea.)

What's a "chipher"?
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:01:01


Nope. Your public bitcoin address is like a one way hash of the private key.
There's no way to really audit how blockchain.info stores things. The safest way is to keep bitcoins yourself in something like Armory cold storage. (Where the private key is forever stored on a computer that is never connected to the internet and just does transaction signing.)
If you "create a paper wallet", all that's going on is a private key is randomly generated, a QR code is made from that, the public bitcoin address is hashed from the private key, and a QR code is generated from that too. The two QR codes are printed on paper with one being hidden.
The problem with paper wallets is: there is no way to prove someone else doesn't have the private key. (The person giving you the paper wallet, the computer they used to generate the paper wallet, etc.) They're a fun novelty, but I would never use them for any seriously large amount of bitcoin.

So it doesn't take days to sync, get the bootstrap from torrent.
(This took me about 4 hours to set up, but I have 40Mbps internet.)
(I should have said bitcoin-qt instead of bitcoind. bitcoind is the CLI one, but both of them act as a full node.)

Avalon group buy offer:
282MH/s for 0.078 BTC (About $11 USD at the moment)
$0.039 USD per megahash/sec.
Butterfly Labs (assuming they ever ship)
50 GH/s Bitcoin Miner - $2,499
$0.049 USD per megahash/sec.
The margin in buying chips, putting them on PCBs in a working design, etc seems pretty close.

No. Use p2pool. Payouts happen *every* time they mine a block. Its zero fees and miners keep all of the transaction fees. It also helps support the bitcoin network because everyone runs a full node.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:26:05
I originally didn't get the reason for doing this also. But now I think I understand it:
Its like saying "I don't want to spend the Bitcoins I have that I'm hoarding, but I do want to support people who accept Bitcoin". People are free to do whatever they want with their money, so of course they can do this too if it suits them. Every time a Bitcoin is traded back for fiat, (what merchants typically are doing when they use BitPay) the "Bitcoin market cap" shrinks just a very tiny bit. This is sort of a way to reverse that trend.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:31:43
Isn't it worse than this? For every dollar you give your bank, they can turn it into 9. (Or something like this. Fractional reserve magic.) So for every dollar you pull out of the system and turn to bitcoin, that's 9 dollars they weren't able to create from thin air. (Maybe I'm understanding this wrong.) They will turn their money printing machines to go faster and cause hyperinflation madness.

No field to enter a custom transaction fee. (Not even in the settings unless I'm missing something....?)

I've been thinking about the blacklist posts for the past few hours. I was originally inspired by someone who said we should tax them with transaction fees, but then someone corrected them saying it would incentivize this from a miner's perspective. The solution then? Ignore "whitelisted" addresses.

I'd like to answer that question. Bitcoin miners are trying to get the 25 BTC reward (right now the current reward) and the transaction fees. So if its not as profitable, miners will drop off. If only the transaction fees were there and not the reward, we'd still have mining but it would just be a smaller group. The reward/transaction is effectively split up amongst miners, so this is a self regulating system.
