I wanted to post back here and explain how I was able to recover my funds.  
I first spent several weeks threatening bad reviews and essentially negative SEO, following through one at a time and sending the review URLs to iGot to demonstrate I wasn't kidding.  They failed to respond and continued to ignore me.  I threatened the report at ripoff and went out of my way to give them the opportunity to reply to me for almost two full weeks before eventually submitting the report.  Unfortunately for Daniel, I was unaware that he only worked for the company and wasn't the CEO and ended up accidentally throwing him up under the bus in the report at the link above (I've since corrected this report and URL to accurately reflect who is to blame.)
As a result of the report, Daniel put pressure on his boss to release my funds.  After being told what was a fifth time that I would be receiving a wire, it happened.  Took several days and of course was short by $600 (we later got this in the amount of 2btc.)  At the end of the day, I was able to recover my $12k by mistakenly throwing Daniel under the bus, who from what I understand no longer works for the company.  We received an angry email from Daniel, of course, asking us if were proud of ourselves for going about it so "nasty" and the answer to that question is FUCK YES and FUCK YOU.  I got my money back.  We warned and warned and warned again that we were going to submit that report and each time we were blocked, banned, comments deleted, etc.  We hit them up via email, facebook, twitter, domain contact, etc.  and were disregarded for weeks.  We gave ample opportunity for iGot to get back to us.  They never did.
Fuck iGot - do what you gotta to get your money back.  I did just that and my funds were returned.
We recommend anyone else who has had issues also follow through here:
