Zimbabwe is planning on financing in BTC. Not kidding. Go look it up.

Thank you. I was personally skeptical of Bitcoin Builder myself but the people I conversed with on my forums said it was legitimate.

I am basically in the same race too. btc is the perfect model for an online Pub I got thinking so Any and all resources would be excellent.

Thank you for enjoying it! I normally do more digital art than write, but you can find most of what I do on BIPPEE13.com of googling "Black Iron Kisses" my most active page is facebook.com/bippee13 which includes content from multiple people. And the works can be a little to controversial and "witchy" to some. You can of course follow me  for my personal page but a lot of my writing is done in shorter social bursts. Again, thank you for liking it.

Hi Yumcoin, thank you so much for doing this for me and I truly appreciate it and makes me feel really warm and fuzzy inside, I have done some of the modifications as suggested by FakeTips. And as mentioned the full text is available, I hope making the content fully available does not violate your policies and have added a link back to your site on mine where I have it published. 
Thank you for your elegant platform and genuine push for support and quality service. I hope we stay in touch and do good for each other as we grow. Best.
Sia A.

Hi, this is Sia, I am the guy who wrote this story. 1st, its cool to see the Yumcoin support crew have been gracious to put this up for me. I just saw this as I was trying to do a quick google search for the link. Very promising to see they have gone the extra mile in promoting my content, I will most definitely be putting more of my works on their site.
Second, thank you for your feedback and I understand your hesitation. The typo in the last light correlates with the rest of the story and was left there intentionally. I have reduced the price of the story because of previous feedback and have actually decided to provide a link to the full story on my own personal website, though the pdf version is how I wish people to experience it. I do hope you enjoy the work and afterwards tip me anyway.

It's good to know that Steve Balmer is finally on the btc bandwagon.
