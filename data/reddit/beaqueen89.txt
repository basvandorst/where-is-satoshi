For the purposes of this hypothetical let's assume China really wanted to kill Bitcoin.

No, the distinction is that there's no precedent saying it's legal.
So an **alegal** thing has more likelihood of becoming illegal if the people in power wish it so.  A thing which has already been tested in the courts and declared **legal**, has more behind it which they must overcome in order to criminalize it.

I don't know why you think this, but putting **a** in front of words to negate them is used for several English words, usually ones based on Latin roots.
Moral versus amoral, theist versus atheist, political versus apolitical, and more.

Interesting......... And if many countries did that, but another allowed and capitalized on it, they would be profiting at the expense of the others.  Then to truly block its effective use, the banning countries would need to also block transactions with the allowing country(ies).
But this is not something a single government could do....... Not unless they have enough of a hold over the rest of the world to threaten them with economic or other (military) consequences for non-compliance.  I think even this Trump's America does not have that combination of leverage and arsonist mentality.
So the more infrastructure we can put in place for easy access, the more we mitigate that threat?

Just because some private companies choose a policy which is more restricted than the law, does not make it now illegal.
What percentage of banks is this??  1% of the sector?

Dictionaries describe usage, they are not the authority, usage is.  That's why the number of words in the OED hasn't remained static for the last hundred years.
It unfortunately means we have to bear the exasperation of 'literally' now also meaning 'figuratively', but the good side is that when there isn't already a fitting word for something (like this alegal concept), that we can come up with one. :o)
Which word would you use instead?  Extralegal and unlawful both exist, but are typically used with very negative connotations.  Like the extralegal lynchings of the 19th century.  Unlawful is most often used as a synonym for illegal.  Alegal seems quite suitable for something which has not yet been explored by the law (and it doesn't carry the same baggage as the word 'unregulated').

You're right, I framed that somewhat incorrectly.  Oops!  What I meant was when a case is brought claiming that a person's actions violated a law, and then court eventually decides that it did not.  They don't say 'X is legal', but they say something close to 'X does not break law Y'.
Then, if a government or other influence wants to criminalize X, they have to overcome that precedent, they may be able to use law Z to do that, but Y is not likely to be useful to them unless they can twist it a different way from how it was interpreted in that past decided case.
So the laws in the green countries may have had a case which involved cryptocurrency, and it was decided in a way which legitimizes CC or Bitcoin specifically, or their existing laws or precedent already had explicit language which can be taken to include Bitcoin without new precedent being needed.
I hope that makes it clearer. :o)

I posted this to another commenter already, but I don't know if you would see that so I did copy it this once.

Not exactly, no........ actually something that is illegal cannot be 'alegal'.
Just like something which is moral, or immoral, cannot also be amoral.  An amoral action is one that is without agency (like a hurricane or gravity), or by an agent which is not a moral agent, like a lion killing a zebra.  We don't consider the lion moral or immoral, because they have no concept of this.  If someone wants to argue against that, well, go to an analogy of a virus or bacterium causing you to get sick and die instead.  Or the gut bacteria which helps you to digest your food, keeping you alive.  Neither bacterium is making choices which involve morality, they are amoral.
Immoral actions can only be taken by agents capable of moral actions.
Your example of atheism is a charged one, as much of what represents atheism online and in our culture is popular and in the public sphere primarily **because** it's inflammatory or controversial, you don't hear about the majority of atheists who are normal people and not activists.  A rock is atheist, a baby is atheist, a gazelle is atheist, because none of those have the capacity for understanding the concept of theism.  It does not mean they are opposed to theists or theism, it does not make them anti-theists.
I hope that helps. :o)

What other people have said is that it's illegal to use it as currency for purchases there, because VN only allows the VND and nothing else for that.  But there are no laws against possession or trading.

Do you mean so it'd get flagged by AV and interrupt Bitcoin nodes who use that AV?  That seems like something that would be quickly ameliorated.  Antivirus companies respond pretty quickly when enough customers are affected (especially if they are vocal).
If you mean active code I don't think that's possible, as the blockchain doesn't get 'executed'?  Embedding links to child pornography didn't kill it, so embedding some text that makes a virus if you save it to a separate file wouldn't do it.
You could kill it 'with a virus' if you got all the full nodes infected (and tamper with them), but that wouldn't happen even if every government combined forces....... :oP
Can you think of another way to use malicious code to damage bitcoin (more than existing stealth miners and wallet stealers already do)?

Is it at all a doubtful figure?
The current ''normal'' suicide rate in the USA is about 1,300 per 10,000,000 annually, so that would only need losing your home, livelihood or business, and life savings to increase that propensity twelvefold, and that doesn't seem like much of a stretch. :o(

Don't you think that not writing something down is just irresponsible?  After all, anyone who's ever done any research on memory knows that for something crucial, you never rely on grey matter as your only ''backup''.
Why not also do something like, load up a USB with games and text documents and other things, pick three out of them (the subtitle file for Walking Dead s08e15 over here, the ReadMe for that graphics program over there, and the walkthrough for that retro arcade game there), scroll to the 4th page and insert a third of your key or such there........  When there are 5,000 files on an otherwise uninteresting USB it's hardly going to be a target.  Have one copy of it in a bottom drawer of your desk underneath things, another could be tucked away at your grandparents place, another copy can be dumped on one of your computers in a ''crap from that blue USB'' folder.  Who's gonna know?
It's best to be realistic about such things.  Don't rely on your brain for everything.  It's good for winning bar bets, but I don't think you should trust it with large amounts of money that can be lost forever due to a ''flipped bit'' in your neural network. :o)

Only if you count people being caught because they used their credit card to buy some bitcoin, and then sent it from their wallet to a fake drug dealer's wallet, probably.........  But they don't even need to work that hard when so many thousands of people are still getting their illegal things sent to home and work addresses!

Did you miss the part where there were multiple (plausible/nondescript) copies on multiple devices?  That's the important part.  You can try to keep it in your brain's memory storage AS WELL if you like, but storing **anything** digital in only one place indicates that you do not value that thing and haven't taken adequate care to avoid its loss.

Wait, so you can't use the same card to get 50€ worth of BTC?
This sounds like a pound of feathers versus pound of lead sort of distinction.
