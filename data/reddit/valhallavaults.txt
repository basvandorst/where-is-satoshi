* You would request to end the subscription and to have your wallet sent to you.
* Security checks will be run (Sign up phone number, email and Co Signer will be verified with a security response key to be sent back to us directly from the sources.

We allow people to invest in Bitcoin, at a pace they can afford, for a time when the market is more mature. 
Therefore then our advice for our customers is to go long and hold on to the Bitcoins for a few years (While building up their investment) and allow supply and demand to drive up Bitcoins value while they wait for a more secure and mature Bitcoin market at which point they can initiate the procedure described above.

Nice to hear some feedback, I hope I can help answer your questions fully, so to clarify a few things :
* Our costumers investment and wallets are stored on an offline computer. These wallets are customer property and not owned by Valhalla Vaults, we simply store them in a safe environment like a bank vault would physical property.
* Valhalla Vaults does not provide Multisig wallets as all of our wallets are created on a 100% offline system. If there is enough inquiries to this however, then It may be something we may peruse.
* We are not a bitcoin exchange or market, the wallets we are creating are not active until the customer chooses to stop investing, at which point the wallet is mailed to them and they are free to do with it as they see fit.
We are not a bank and can't 100% guarantee that nothing will go wrong, but we believe that we've taken as many possible steps to safeguard our customers investment. We allow people to invest in Bitcoin, at a pace they can afford, for a time when the market is more mature.
