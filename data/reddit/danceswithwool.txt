Sure you can live that way but you’ll be POOR. The original comment talked about quitting your job. Why would you quit your job over a million dollars? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:22:43
Yeah if you use it to pay for Med school then yeah, ok.

Index funds don’t earn 10%

You’re wrong. You can’t retire on a million dollars unless you’re already 65 years old. If you invest it at 6.5% then you can earn 65,000 a year but that doesn’t count for inflation. It sounds like a lot of money but it’s not.

But if OP is American it’s not even close.

You’re obviously from the UK because you keep using pounds. Here in the US a million isn’t that much. It won’t go far. If OP is American then quitting his job is suicide.

Quit your job over a million dollars? Are you nuts? It’s not that much money. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:27:47
How old are you though?

10% ? You’re not an investor. If you get 8% for a sustained period you’ve done well.

I said in an earlier comment “if he is American”.   I could take 1 mil to Somalia and live like a king.

Your professor is right. You CAN get higher than 8%. But it’s not sustainable. Companies like AT&amp;T pay about 2% but you’re almost guaranteed to get it. These companies that pay 12% can’t sustain that. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:49:09
It’s not enough to sustain living. If you’re 35 years old that’s not enough money. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:42:30
But they would probably keep working. My original point. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:38:50
Oh ok
