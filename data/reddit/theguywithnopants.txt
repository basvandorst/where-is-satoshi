If you're that nitpicky, you can set your marginal gain, then once you hit it, hawk the market til a suitable dip, then reinvest. If you're worried about getting every drop of dividends then hawk it when you get close to your fil and sell when you sell.
If you put a limit order Gdax doesnt charge a fee
If you use immediate buy/sell it charges you a small fee.

1) hodl is a meme from a drunk guy who was on a bitcoin forum and he misspelled it and we also made it a legitimate abbreviation for hold on for dear life.
2) if you brush up on capital gains tax codes and know what would work best for your profit margin you're making a more informed decision than I am. You could lean into the hype too that some of us think bitcoin will be a more accepted currency than the USD

Doesn't effect us if we hodl on. Some of us are nut cases and think the next financial melt down will lead to everyone buying bitcoin as a better median of exchange since it's not regulated and it's one of the last free market places. Some of us see it being used for day to day transactions and it could possibly be, there are bitcoin atms popping up, businesses are using bitcoin. Small amounts of these mean nothing but if everyone does it and you see bitcoin prices listed next to a burger then you know we've made it.
Hold on for dear life cause this ride goes to the moon

limit price buy ~10% of what is at now or ~1% of what it is now. Bought bit coin.
Limit price sell ~25% gain or higher, wait for your limit order to be filled, you don't have to predict the ups and downs but if you get in low and hodl until it bumps up past your initial investment you should be good. No one is forcing you to sell low

Don't use coinbase as your wallet to buy things use an actual bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:10:59
Both, you can send bitcoin from Coinbase to your wallet and you can use your wallets partners to buy more bitcoins

What would be a good place to move on from gdax for trading
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:02
I use airbitz, that's one of the downsides of Coinbase, probably better just to use Coinbase for trading and from airbitz you can purchase bitcoins with a vetting process

Hodl. If you liquidate your asset you might pay capital gains. I'm not sure if Uncle Sam really cares how much of it you made but I'm sure he'll want his cute. So let it ride. Who knows maybe it'll double or be halved but generally it's best to let it ride.

Let’s the miners rewrite the ledger as they want. What the actual hell how does he teach block chain and not know that the pool of miners are independent and check each other’s work to verify consistencies and fight fraud. Could collision be possible sure but a lot of people would have to be in on it.
