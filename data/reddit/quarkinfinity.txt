Wouldn't they still force businesses to withhold a certain amount even if the employees were payed in Bitcoin?  They can still force businesses to collect sales tax too.  The only thing I see that could change is that government spending is brought back to the realm of reality.

Merchant adoption doesn't mean a thing for price until they start to keep it and use it for business themselves, although the might raise a little more awareness of Bitcoin.  This news about Coinbase in Europe is great though because it gives more people easier access to it.  I think we will see another Cryptos boom before early next year or whenever the block reward halves.

Do you mind sharing the specifics of why you say that?  I'm genuinely curious because the stuff Kolin has written about seems to be happening and I'm willing to wait to see what happens down the road with it.

Stanley Fischer touched on this back in August in a speech he gave in Sweden.  The key line in the speech was:
"As part of this approach, the United States is preparing a proposal to require systemically important banks to issue bail-inable long-term debt that will enable insolvent banks to recapitalize themselves in resolution without calling on government funding--this cushion is known as a "gone concern" buffer."

you hit the nail on the head OP.  That long downtrend made me discover that its more fun to tease the euphoric ones than to be a euphoric one.

So since a 51% attack isn't an issue then that means the one thing people were complaining about with Quark goes completely out the window especially since Quark has checkpoints anyway.
Edit:  My point is that you can either stick with the coin that ASICs miners have a monopoly on or you can come to a coin that built its distribution model around avoiding this sort of thing where the free market actually reigns.  Unless of course the "experts" are lying which makes me wonder why anyone would stick with them anyway.

I hadn't even heard of this guy before he bought those Bitcoins and I still don't really know who he is other than "that guy who bought the Bitcoins", nor do I care.  Anyway, I just got back from work and your post started my day off right, thanks.

Last I heard, the Chinese could still get into cryptos through major Chinese exchanges and the only difference was that the exchanges use a corporate bank account or the account of the owner of the exchange.  Know anything about that?

But it wouldn't really be the USD at that point, would it?  Unless the Federal Reserve had total control, right?

I'm just a little confused as to how Bitcoiners simultaneously talk about how strong their network is and how much computing power it would take to launch a 51% attack while saying it isn't a big deal but have a history of putting other coins down because of such things.

Great, a thread to push altcoins!  Check out Quark everyone!   But seriously, I'll be happy for the next bubble in Bitcoin and further adoption of crypto currencies.  I believe in Quark and I guarantee that your % gains will be better in the next cycle if you put some into Quark.

Normally I would agree with what you just said which is why I support Quark.  Kolinevans.wordpress.com explains why you aren't seeing boosts to the price of Bitcoin every time a new comany or large corporation announces that they accept it.  We have actually been watching it go further down.

You're right.  I have just had too many experiences with the wrong people.
@_date: 2014-08-26 20:09:19
Quark is a crypto that is only a year old and it distributed its initial coins with the first 6 months so that the new supply wouldn't have the inflation Bitcoin does and open it up to the market manipulation Bitcoin has.  It also used different algorithms to prevent any mining monopoly from being able to be formed.  It received tons of flak for having a low hashrate and people claiming that it couldn't be trusted because of the possibility of a 51% attack and now we are being told 51% attacks aren't a big deal.  Quark has blockchain checkpoints anyway which means it wasn't a big deal to begin with anyway.
EDIT:  Here is a link that describes how Bitcoin is overvalued due to the mining monopoly.

Its kind of dickish to charge for it but at the same time I don't blame OP because skeptics are dismissive dicks themselves when they should have taken an objective look at it from the beginning with their own research.

I saw this earlier today and wondered if the small bump is because of this news breaking.  It's been years since I've heard about China eventually dumping the debt and now its finally happening.

I've thought about this too OP.  I just don't understand how users on can say they want bitcoin to go mainstream but expect people who aren't computer savvy to follow their magical 37 step guide to storing bitcoins offline.  One wrong move and you'll get twenty "Sorry for your loss replies" after someone's hard earned money disappears forever.  With the amount of identity theft that goes on too do they honestly expect people to jump into this new experiment and risk stuff when they simultaneously tell people that it could potentially fail.  "Don't invest more than you can lose" but we're going to the moon.  So much double think in this sub.  Sorry for the rant.

I doubt it.  Bitcoinism is a hateful ideology that has no place in a future world of equal blockchains.  Blockchain supremacists view one string of verifiable data as superior to others by believing it to be the master chain.  I've already contacted the ADL and SPLC about these digital Nazis.  Listening to these closet racists' hidden agenda is like another Shoah.  Oy vey.

Pretty much this.  I feel sorry for the doomsday preppers who never made it past the Mad Max fantasy scenario in their minds.  The reality of the situation will be more like the massive market crashes of the past only much worse this time.

Except that he never wanted war.  He spared the British and French troops at Dunkirk and gave Britain a very reasonable 16 point peace plan even though they were the ones who declared war on him.

Don't forget to thank Bill Still too.  
I'm not too concerned though.  Quark was back up to a penny several months ago.  Once Bitcoin breaks the all time high we will see rampant speculation all over the place again.  I'm not saying Quark will do anything spectacular but I do see it being profitable for those who bought at these lows.

There is nothing wrong with banks that follow the rules.  You should feel bad for taking the "hate the banks" meme too far.  Plus, I would rather not risk giving the satisfaction of saying SFYL it I were to make a mistake.
