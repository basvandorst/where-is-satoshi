But...Bitcoin *is* money...
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:46:01
Back when primary exchanges were on Tor, and it was rather difficult to acquire, it was under $1. If you could get on a trustworthy exchange, it wouldn't have hurt to put $20 in and just let it ride -- a kickstarter for currency, if you will.
I saw it there, but my computer was shit at mining, and I couldn't get into the invite-only exchanges. It burns to see how far it's come, and maybe if I networked a bit more I could have joined that early.

This is just...all the wrong reasons...

The funds I buy from my bank are x% of gains, absolutely no payment of anything out of pocket, is there a term for that or something?
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:57:28
Woah how do you get .2? Wealthsimple is .4, and that's only if you've got over 100k
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:53:23
Can you explain that chart? Is that over a lifetime or something?
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:55:30
2% of what though? Isn't it 2% of the gains?
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:56:01
Why is this only available to "accredited investors"?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:47:33
Well, the great thing about a local transaction is you don't have to go. It's not like an exchange where a buy/sell order is placed and the rest is done the instant someone accepts.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:48:42
Yep, that's called arbitrage. Very common in many markets. It's a risk, but with spreads like this, you probably could have made a few thousand today easy.

I'm in to buy, getting into MtGox is near impossible at this point. PM me.

Even, for example a brokerage? That's essentially what you'd be. I can't imagine your insurance broker pays income tax on your premium, then the underwriter paying again; or a stock broker paying tax on receiving your money to work with. That'd be one heck of a double-dip.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:32:45
The question asked about 5 transactions per second. You're right in that it should work 100% under all conditions, but then there's always the possibility this was implemented at the server level rather than the db level as is being attempted now.
Now, PHP is another discussion on its own, and you're right, you're fighting the platform for security.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:41:49
Ah shoot, made an ass of myself by messing up the first sentence...I meant the question asked about 5 transactions per user per second. Which is rather unlikely except for the case of a bot. That said, with any sort of lag, issues could well happen at 0.2 transactions per second.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:58
Mt.Gox doesn't actually need to freeze the market. What should have been done, is the "last price" ticker should be replaced with an algorithm showing true price. These microtransactions can too easily manipulate the price.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:28:47
 Found it here.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:18:03
ahh where were you 2 days ago? lol
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:54:46
I'm pretty sure if you can keep records of what's going on, you wouldn't pay tax on it. It's not your money at all, so there's no reason for you to pay taxes on it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:43:44
How would a captcha not be a free market? Maybe a trusted user subset who don't need to enter a captcha, but then if they start doing some bot shit, that gets suspended.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:32:15
Doesn't matter in the slightest. Their purpose is to operate at a loss in order to drive market prices up or down. They operate at very small losses, while their owners buy up thousands or even millions when the market is driven down, and sell when the market is driven up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:42:48
That's the point. It was written before the biggest rises these past 5 days.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:10
verify verify verify. Also, today is probably a decent day to buy, as in asap, prices are crazy low.

Try exporting your key and importing it in another wallet. I couldn't get my first transaction to show up until I transferred my key from android to multibit.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:29:05
oh no :( I mistyped my address:
Edit: I have to say, you're awesome for doing this. I'm just getting into it now, and I think this is an awesome thing for all us noobs out here.

In windows, task manager has a network tab, or it may be called "performance". You can see the network activity, and assuming you're doing nothing else, can see that it's downloading.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:16:38
I was tipped with my actual address, not my username.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:04:00
5 transactions *per user*.

Even 25% of rich is moderately rich...
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:25:24
Good luck sending that transaction. I don't think you can make payments that small yet; there are filters in place.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:32:21
I'd like to know this as well. I seem to recall reading someone who was in fact qualified saying that you only need to pay taxes on it if you convert it back to your home fiat currency. I believe it's an asset, like any other; you don't have to pay capital gains tax on your house until you sell it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:16:45
I'd argue MySQL &gt; Postgres for a case like this, in part for the same reason NASA uses 15+ year old technology; it's tried and true.
I'd also question scalability. I'm not as familiar with postgres as I am with mysql, or even mongo, but it strikes me there's a reason it hasn't taken over by storm (considering some of the admittedly awesome features).
Not to mention maintainability and ease of integration...but I suppose that just comes with popularity.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:16:12
I can see the transaction here:  . This is the address I was given on the phone app, but I can't see it on the app as a balance. As far as the app knows, I have exactly 0.00 :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:47:05
This wouldn't really help. It's programatically trivial to make a million bot accounts, set them all up with small amounts of bitcoin/fiat and set them about on the quest to drive prices up/down.
What needs to be done is a change in the way 'current price' is shown. Some detection is in order to determine the difference between a 0.0002btc trade and a more plausibly real 2btc trade.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:52:34
Well that was silly. If you're not trolling, remember that in that image, the 'noose' was made of liquorice.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:09
Awesome, I'd love to buy sub-30
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:14:24
It was even better yesterday, something like a 60 dollar spread from gox to cavirtex. The problem is it's likely not actual value that's causing the spread, but lack of volume. cavirtex takes a while to catch up to gox because it only corrects to gox prices when a transaction actually happens.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:52:59
Oh no, one of our kin (a technologist) is asking a question on stackoverflow, let's call him a retard! Come on guys, I understand exactly what he's doing, and there are a number of reasons this isn't all that bad. The first being that there could well have been another implementation of locks beforehand (perhaps a server based lock rather than a mysql approach). And not the least being that this is a fairly extreme edge case....5 whole transactions per second!
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:50:23
To be fair, he understands the concept of locking, however the lock as he  has written it is not working as expected. Also, he's dealing with an edge case (5 transactions per second??).

As a software developer who accepts bitcoin as payment, I would give a discount for bitcoin.

Sorry, I'm exporting from "bitcoin wallet" the android app. It's encrypted and then saved. I don't know how to decrypt it, and then import it to the desktop app.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:12:45
Well there's this...
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:04:57
That's not what he's asking. Individuals would have to pay capital gains tax, and the market would have to pay taxes on their profits. The question is how to stop the government from frowning on millions of dollars from users coming in (as account credits)
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:09:01
CAD exchange is typically above the USD one. I assume there was some sort of frenzy pushing it up, and lack of volume to bring it back down. Just my guess though.
