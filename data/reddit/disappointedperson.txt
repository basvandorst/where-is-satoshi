Give this an upboat. People need to know :)

Wow... there is no getting through to you, huh. You are probably the kind of person who will only see what's right in front of you for your entire life.
I can't respond to this nonsense all day. You need to read a few thousand books and then feel free to come back and correct yourself.

In fact, for anyone else who seems to think what I wrote was in fact inaccurate - here are definitions:
Communism: a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party.
Totalitarian: of or relating to a centralized government that does not tolerate parties of differing opinion and that exercises dictatorial control over many aspects of life. 
Liberalism: a political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual, parliamentary systems of government, nonviolent modification of political, social, or economic institutions to assure unrestricted development in all spheres of human endeavor, and governmental guarantees of individual rights and civil liberties. 
For the record, I have lived in China. I know what I'm talking about when I call the CoinDesk operators communists.

I don't know if you're mentally retarded or just trolling. Take your own advice and learn what the terms means. Then feel free to come back and apologize for your own ignorance.

I give up. Talking to stupid people is exhausting.

And just for the record, I do like the hitler headline better. But I don't think I can change it now.

It's a figure of speech. Did you read the entire post? What I am saying is, CoinDesk, a "news source" that claims to be "ethical" is publishing "false" news and not allowing anyone to talk about CoinDesk in anyway that makes them look bad.
This is EXACTLY how China and Russia are. I have lived in China, so I have first hand experience with this. You cannot be an "ethical" news source or even a "news source" at all for that matter if you behave this way.
This is a libertarian community. The way they act is disgusting.

Take your stupidity somewhere else. I am presenting accurate facts.
Read their ethics and tell me I am wrong: 
Since you seem to not understand English well, here are definitions:
Communism: a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party.
Totalitarian: of or relating to a centralized government that does not tolerate parties of differing opinion and that exercises dictatorial control over many aspects of life.
Liberalism: a political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual, parliamentary systems of government, nonviolent modification of political, social, or economic institutions to assure unrestricted development in all spheres of human endeavor, and governmental guarantees of individual rights and civil liberties.

Hint: Use your fucking brain and learn what the ethics of journalism are. This is a self-proclaimed "news site"
Geez... I expect trolls on reddit, but damn you guys piggy back off one idiot's comment and then misinterpret my respectful reply to that comment as me being incorrect.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:58:31
It must be amazing to be as stupid as you are. It must feel like you have some kind of super power to be able to argue something you have not even read. I would bet you haven't even looked at the editorial policy of their site, because if you did, you wouldn't be here shitting from the mouth.
There's no telling you though. You know. You can't possibly be wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:30:22
You guys are missing the point. Look at what they claim their "ethics" are: 
They are violating all of this by publishing false news, as I've just shown evidence for. Moreover, they are contracting themselves in the way they moderate free speech on their site. Not to mention, when I did call them out on this, they deleted my comment. Which is like basically saying they do not care about their ethics.

Are you 9 years old?
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:44:49
I cannot entertain any more stupid comments from you. Go back to school.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:39:33
Again, see their ethics: 
They are contradicting themselves.
