I had the opposite experience as you describe with circle vs. coinbase.  I had an account with coinbase since the beginning with a well established transaction history, and then in the last 2 months had nearly every order canceled without cause due to "high risk", which is what made me venture elsewhere.
I've now been with circle for ~2 months.  My advise is as follows to avoid the dreaded high risk hell: SLOWLY build your relationship with them by not maxing out purchase ability / amount right at the start.  To clarify: With coinbase I was doing 1-2 buys a week at 1-5k/each buy.  
After my accounts were linked with Circle, I spent the first two weeks buying at low transaction amounts ($50 USD on my first purchase, $250 on my next, $500 on the third) and slowly built into a transaction frequency near to what I was doing with coinbase at this point.  Overall, it was ~2-3 weeks before I was back at capacity buying without hitting a canceled for high risk _at all_ during the process.
If you can remember that you're building a relationship with a company that likely does deal with a fair amount of fraudulent and/or deceptive practices in its day-to-day, start off slow and work your way into your target area by showing them you're not a.) running off with the purchased coin and then charging back or b.) buying at your instant buy limit 100% on your first, 2nd, or hell, even 3rd purchase, you're going to be fine and won't trigging any alarm bells.
Again, My first three purchases (USD) went: $50, $250, $500, and that with a bit of buffer between to allot for the withdrawl to hit so they saw I wasn't trying to withdrawal-and-run with my instant purchase maximum and an insufficient funds result when they tried to collect.  After that, I slowly increased my buys into my old capcacity with coinbase (1-2x a week at 1k&lt;-&gt;5k), with 0 problems.
TLDR; As with most situations in life, it appears to me to be more about your initial approach and establishing a trustworthy relationship, than anything else.

I replied in your first comment under OP's response before seeing this.  Feel free to respond there if you have other questions re: how I went about things :-)

In the future (and with other friends), frame the giving as a "thank you" from you to them for being friends for so long, or helping you through tough time x, or whatever reason you can think of, rather than a "here take my free bitcoins and give me your time!" for the reasons many others in here have mentioned already.
You'll be more likely to get more "ok, well thanks I guess?"'s in the end after some "you really didn't have to!"'s than you will outright refusals.  This method will also likely lead to *them* asking *you* for answers to whatever question they have about bitcoin and a natural conversation flow.  
How many times have you actually turned down a friend's thank you?  Personally, I can't think of a time where after a few "nah you didn't have to do this, please keep it" I didn't cave in and eventually accept it, as I'm sure is the case for a majority of people.
This has worked for me in an office full of old gold hoarders at a lunch party I threw for a majority of them when I was leaving that particular company.  The "thank you" card's contained the paper wallets, and we all chatted about bitcoin for the whole lunch.  This after a number of them had also refused my offer of free paper wallets with a small initial load to get them started a few months prior.
Good luck!

As did I.  Kind of crazy, given this is the first time I've seen this on the site (though I very likely could've missed others :P), and the overall popularity of squares in the States.. :-/
Given the honorable nature of the contest &amp; since it didn't pan out, I decided to donate 35 mBTC directly to BitGive ([Blockchain TX]( .  
Not quite the ~300 mBTC you were hoping for, but at least something positive still come of the effort. :)

Awesome indeed!  I am Type 1 as well, currently 30 years old, was diagnosed at 4.  This would've helped me greatly in those early years. :-)
Donation sent!

Thanks for helping grow and support the community! :-)
A side-and-unrelated question: Any plans to launch another Poster Project-like campaign? I'm happy that I learned about your site from this post and am now a customer, but am sad that I missed the Poster Project :-(.

I ran into a lot of the same troubles.  Then I ran into Circle.  I can't speak to their use if you live outside of the US, but for me (being inside the US), I was able to sign-up, link a card+bank account, answer 2 questions via the site and I was ready to buy.
YMMV, but having come from a very similar stance / feeling (TAKE MY MONEY! GIVE ME BITCOIN!), Circle has come the closest to filling that desire for me.

Agreed. 
Unfortunately, there will always be those looking to make "easy money" on the backs of those of us not partaking in nefarious deeds such as this.  You said it yourself, one wallet found with holdings in it, and the entire effort paid off for them.. Same thing with any personal data as you mentioned.
Also unfortunately, it's likely at least partially attributable to the human element in the situation.  There will always be those non-savvy users out there which run unencrypted, with default settings and no security etc, because they don't know or don't understand the way things really are.. its a fact of life. A sad one, but one nonetheless.
Hoping / Longing for a non-crime ridden Utopian World is as appealing to me as it is you or anyone else of sound mind, but in the reality of the 2014 internet-of-everything world, it just isn't the way it is nor likely will be anytime soon.

This.  Figuring out the store was only available when the client was open sort of bugged me about it.  Sure you can go the hosted route but meh.

I'd like a copy also, and concur with my fellow torrent-requesting brethren.
