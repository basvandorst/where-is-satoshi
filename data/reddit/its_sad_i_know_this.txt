Mostly. There are some edge cases here and what counts is who gets included in the blockchain. The rule is that a single address cannot spend twice in a single block - how the miners decide which ones to keep working on is a matter of implementation. They're actually supposed to drop both of them, but I haven't played with the network enough to know how it's handled in the wild.
Even after a multiple confirms, the blockchain could get rolled back in the event of a fork. Miners aren't even paid for their blocks until it's been confirmed 100 times, which represents about how far you can roll back before destroying the trust of the mining pools. Normally a fork wouldn't matter since legitimate transactions should be recorded in both chains, but there is the possibility to have double spends where the competing transactions got split along with the chain.
For the most part, double spend is hard.

It's likely you're conflating two things there. The probably have their own wallet implementation, sure, but the sync problems are with their private account ledger.

Unless there are massive incompatible upgrades to the protocol, which would break much more than your wallet, there shouldn't be any problem importing or converting the old format. Your bigger concern should be if the drive will still be readable.
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:09:40
In addition to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin that others have mentioned, there are other practical reasons to the miners decide what to include. In order to impart a sense of stability and security to the protocol, there is the concept of *standard transactions*, transactions with script components that follow specific rules. These standard transaction are the only ones that should be propagated to other nodes, unless they've agreed to some other standard. But, non-standard transactions can still be valid and miners are, and should be, free to include them in their block. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:24:45
If we assume they're watching the commercial exchanges then that'd do no good since they could just link the input and output of the transaction. You could sell coins to a third-party in exchange for a second currency, but that falls back on sending to an unregistered address.
Either way, this would be insanely ineffective. Not that that prevents things from becoming law.

Open source is no guarantee of quality. A ton of open source software is complete shit, a majority of it. Then again, most closed source software is complete shit, too. This is to be expected as it is well known that [90% of everything is crap](
Part of the open source business model is the opportunity for anyone to offer support services. Since the code is open, anyone willing to invest the resources can provide equal support, right down to custom patches. This works better on larger projects where the potential return is greater - see Red Hat.
The Bitcoin devs, any open source dev, would probably respond in a similar fashion to this type of request for support. Unless you can provide reproduction steps from a known-good state, you haven't demonstrated that a bug even exists. The devs have no way of knowing what kind of crazy shit some random user got up to that may have been the real cause of the problem. If they spent their time responding to these requests they'd never get any programming done.
The best thing OP can do at this point is work with other community users to find reproduction evidence.

Embarrassing to get bestof'd when it wasn't even factually correct. Oldstable ("squeeze") is unaffected. Stable ("wheezy") was vulnerable and patched.
~~This solves the problem because Debian stable takes so long to add new packages that they never upgrade to the vulnerable version from 2 years ago.~~

To be clear, I make no speculation that this is in anyway what really went down, but if we want to take this thread... 
Why not wait 2 years? Paper wallets are a frequent form of deep cold storage, useful for depositing like a safe drop. Since they are meant for long term storage, it's likely the wallet will continue to accumulate funds. You could even watch the wallet and prepare your exit strategy should coins start moving out. Add in the sudden spike in valuation followed quickly by a market correction and you've found an ideal time to reap your benefits.

Bitcoin is the first one to ever acquire widespread adoption, so it is yet to be seen. The final value will be determined by the value of the other functions built on top of it. In the mean time, the currency function serves to provide economic incentives to the miners who work on protecting the network and disincentive to collude against it.

Building a block is the first part of mining. You collect some number of open transactions into a block and start hashing trying to find a nonce (random value you add) that makes the block hash to a value that meets the difficulty requirements. First to find a working nonce wins. If there is more than one workable block before the network syncs, the block with the most transactions wins instead. More transactions required more work, and meant the miner took a risk waiting to collect them.

Graphic cards have programmable shaders, essentially FPGAs that can implement the hashing algorithms near hardware. They have a lot of these, too. This means they can do lots of hashing operations very quickly - mining! The issue is one of processing capability, not memory or long-term storage.

Again, must stress that I have no expert understanding of Ripple. You avoid collusion by selecting your validators based on counter-interest. If the majority of your validators are colluding against you, I don't think you'd be able to tell directly. You'd have to view the network through some other set of validators and compare over time. If I understand this right (and i'm pretty tired, so grain of salt), each shared overlapping union of validators is working its own little chain until the peered validators come to their own consensus on the next block.
I haven't done enough research (obviously) to develop strong feelings on it. Reflexively, this 
appears to have some advantage over Bitcoin's hashrate creep (or leap), which I fear could lead to consolidation and a situation where we need to trust a much smaller group of people not to be a bunch of bastards. Historically, that doesn't work out great.
Proof of work also assumes that everyone can operate within a similar range of efficiency, with some universal constraint on how it grows. For Bitcoin this basically means, all things being equal, anyone can buy *x*gh/s for $*y*. An undisclosed weakness in the hashing algorithm held by a party who may have the **n**ece**s**s**a**ry mathematical knowledge and desire to keep it secret would have the ability to unfairly participate in the network and potentially disrupt it.

Just to clarify terms, as far as I'm using them since it's different than your use. The properties are known (distributed, pseudonymous, cryptographically and PoW secured). The functions, what you can do with that technology, are the unknowns. There are certainly some ideas, but hopefully lots of things no one has even thought of yet.
 
I never claimed it was anything other than speculation, just that there is more to consider than the currency function. The properties that Bitcoin possesses are highly sought after in many technologies. I'm not a financially minded individual, so I can't even begin to explain how, but I assume professionals have some sort of mechanism for evaluating speculative technology.
edit: I'd say the value of the currency reflects the speculated value of the network. I'd also like to point out that there is nothing marrying these functions to Bitcoin aside from it's first mover advantage. If a better (how ever that is measured) technology comes around that offers the same properties, I believe it could usurp Bitcoin as the dominant PoW block chain (or whatever underlies the new technology).

TOTP/HOTP-like might be a little strong, it would need to be something asymmetrical or else you'd need to reduce it to nothing more than a P2SH. Maybe something with Schnorr signatures. Honestly, I haven't given it a ton of thought due to the limits imposed on script.
I think the bigger thing would be to include an operation that pulls in the current top hash of the block chain. Using that as a time-based factor could limit the use of a OTP to a single block. This would impose a financial burden as you'd need to offer an attractive transaction fee to increase the chance of getting it included, but would restrict brute force attempts against the OTP allowing it to be shorter.
Now that I'm thinking on the subject, I wonder if it would be possible for Bitcoin to reimplement the disabled opcodes using new opcodes. Simply patching the bad functions would require a hard fork, but I don't think that'd be required for using some of the reserved ops for implementing new versions. I'll have to do more research into why each of those was disabled.

There are disadvantages, it gives people the idea that these bitcoin things exist in some discrete form. Deconstructing the relationship to physical objects can be quite a hurdle for the uninitiated, especially when it comes to how transactions are built.

Not sure how ripple helps with loans. To make loans, you need excessive capital that can be loaned out. You need to price it based on the risk profile of the borrower. These are not things that most people are in a position to perform.
Can you expand on how that would be replaced?
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:57:07
I'm not an expert on Ripple, but the gist seems to be that every node selects a random set of *validators* that they believe to be unlikely to collude. Validators send out *proposals*, transactions they believe to be valid. Nodes that trust those validators keep those transactions around in a *set*. Periodically nodes will make their own proposals about which set should be considered their new base and once a majority agrees everyone switches to it.
This should result in little economic cost or scaling - no constantly increasing hashrate. It comes with a (ostensibly minimal) trust requirement and a vulnerability to sybil type denial of service. 
If you can think of the fundamental Bitcoin question "can the bad guys *afford* to out hash the network?" this might be viewed more as the age old question "are people generally good or just [a bunch of bastards](

Not that hard, in fact [BIP38 provides a possible solution]( Still cumbersome to use though.
Basically, you can produce an intermediate key on your mobile device and present it to the machine. It is able to calculate an encrypted wallet which it cannot decrypt without the passphrase you used to generate the key. Decrypt the wallet on your mobile and give the machine a payable address generated from the new wallet's private key.
It should be noted that this provides little additional benefit over creating the wallet directly on your mobile device. The one advantage this could serve is if you don't trust the handheld device but believe it isn't somehow  maliciously colluding with the ATM. Intermediate code gets generated and that device knows the passphrase but not the encrypted wallet. If you scan the wallet back into a different, trusted device, the first one cannot steal your coins. Any collusion between a malicious handheld and the ATM would break this security.

I haven't examined this particular malware, but unpacking is a very common requirement in malware reverse engineering. If there is encryption involved then the dropper must have access to the key in order to execute the code. Unpacking can be done with a tool for many common packers or can be done manually by allowing the sample to run in a debugger and placing breakpoints after the unpacking routine. These protections are put in place to avoid automated detection and trivial analysis.

It's possible, I suppose,  but that wallet implementation would need to be so incredibly whacked that it wouldn't even be right to call it Bitcoin. All wallets store are the key pairs and generated addresses, balances are calculated by summing the inputs and outputs to those addresses. The only way that'd work is if you ignored some or all if the legitimate output from the addresses in question.

In doing a little more research, since the customers never took possession of the equipment that might not constitute conversion. But, perhaps there was conversion of the funds - customers paid for prompt delivery of a device but BFL used those funds to procure and use the hardware themselves before final delivery.
It's a fine distinction, but I think it helps establish the case for conversion to put it that way. It removes the whole conflict of ownership and it could easily be argued that the customers did not consent to BFL using their money to run their own mining rigs.
The major sticking point would be the need to test equipment for fitness as part of the manufacturing process. But since there are well defined ways to test that without affecting the public block chain (private testnet) BFLs actions, should that prove to be the case, show great negligence, essentially devaluing the product between manufacture and delivery.
If fraud could be demonstrated, damages could be based on top estimates of lost profit, not just fair market value of the device. That could be really damaging if you included mining when the price was low and selling at the peak.

In the context of 'buying bitcoin' he's actually correct, sort of. As that is recognized as a financial transaction it would be illegal for the exchanger to not provide reporting on the $10,000. If you intentionally avoid that reporting by making two $5,000 purchases you would be guilty of structuring, a felony. So the purchase isn't illegal, but the failure to report is a crime.

Bitcoin Core has centralized control over who can commit to the official repository, but anyone is free to access the code, submit patches, or fork it. Bitcoin Core serves as the *reference implementation* because of its direct lineage to Satoshi's original code and the collective consent of the Bitcoin community.
Other implementations exist, such as Bitcoinj. Because the Bitcoin network requires consistency between nodes, these other implementations track Bitcoin Core on the protocol level. However, if an implementation can establish better trust, display better leadership, or in any other way obtain the consent of a majority of the network, they can become the new reference implementation.

My initial thoughts are reinforced with this information. My guess is that there is some feature of the private key, maybe some string of bytes, that is causing a poorly handled exception in the wallet software.
Under this theory, it attempts to build the transaction, hits the error condition and gets handled in such a way that it doesn't propagate the error to the user. Since they key wasn't read properly though, the transaction cannot be properly constructed and is either not sent at all or maybe sent corrupted and thus ignored.
There is also the possibility that the key is simply not there and only the address has been recorded. In which case, you're not going to find much luck recovering it.

It's a matter of which transaction reaches 51% of the network first. The malicious actor could have a second transaction spending the same coins prepared and try to shove it out to the network faster than yours can propagate. Using a cluster directly connected to as many nodes as possible, they could theoretically end up winning if you're relying on standard node-to-node transaction propagation. 
This attack requires a massive submission competing transactions within the few seconds it'd take for your transaction to reach 51% of the network. This is very noisy and can be detected by monitoring services.
If for some reason you rely on non-standard scripts for your transactions and submit to specialized mining pools, this becomes even riskier since your transaction won't propagate and could easily be beaten until confirmed in a block by your pool.
Edit: An alternative attack is to have a pre-mined block containing their transaction. For brick and mortar, the timing required is nearly impossible and it would require holding on to a block worth Ƀ25 with a decent chance of losing it. For transactions that large, it's probably ok to make them wait for confirmation.

Yeah, this still hasn't brought it to the realm of ordinary people. How do I know if you've defaulted on loans or what other liabilities you have? Verify personal information such as age and employment status? Investigate a business plan to judge it's potential? How do we handle collateral, evaluate that collateral, and ensure that you have insurance on the house so when it burns down I don't lose my investment in the loan?
None of this even touch on the legal issues surrounding money handling and lending. 
Now, I'll admit, as far as the financial side goes, I'm one of those ordinary people. To me, it seems like if I wanted to participate in this, the easiest way would be to form some sort of corporation or union in which I and others in my community could deposit our bitcoin. Then this organization would perform the necessary functions in investigating those loans and return the appreciation in the form of interest on my deposit...

This was not clear from your previous statement, particularly


That said, I'd be interested in hearing more on why you don't think XBT is appropriate. The only thing you mention was avoiding the letter 'X'.


This is a big deal, and frankly, where I think the biggest roadblock will be. Standards are sticky and hard to change, by design. A significant factor, which you recognize, is that ISO 4217 requires a three letter code. Everything built on that standard expects a three letter code. Expanding that would be insanely resource intensive and thoroughly rejected by industry consensus. Unfortunately there are no other available single letter prefixes.
In all likelihood, Bitcoin needs to be part of the ISO standard more than the ISO standard needs to include Bitcoin. Better, in my opinion, to suck it up and deal with a less-than-perfect symbol if that's what it takes to get included. By the time Bitcoin reaches the point where the industry is concerned with community opinions on the matter, momentum would be far beyond going back to change it.
If many other cryptocurrencies take there will probably need to be a new ISO standard. As you said, there simply isn't enough namespace within a two-letter suffix.

It seems reasonable to add in that unless your 2FA is tied to the block chain using multisig, your account security is still in the hands of the site developers. 2FA is only effective against the admittedly common weaknesses of passwords, it is not the security panacea that some appear to believe it to be.

In this situation, I'd think you'd rather keep the source of untraceable funds going. If your financial industry friends are so upset with it, you can perhaps give them a leg up as well. But any external knowledge of your attack reduces its useful lifetime. You wouldn't share that with anyone but your most vital and trusted partners.

Effective repro needs to demonstrate the error from a known good state. The devs have no way of knowing what you might have done to muck up that wallet file. Open source software is pretty much volunteer work, you get what you get.

There comes a point where it's just being contrarian for contrarian sake. If that's your thing, fuck yeah fight the power, but the ISO standard exists because there is a need for clear communication. It's not an attempt to restrict economic freedom, just impose a sense of order on terms. Words (and non-word symbols) need to mean something, consistently,  or we're just barking at each other.
At the end of the day, you're free to call it what ever you want, use what ever symbols you want. But if it is going to be used within a system that already subscribes to the ISO 4217 standard, it's going to have to fit the standard, at least in that context.

That is a really old source. Modern Zip utilities use AES-256 and are not vulnerable to the same known plain-text vulnerabilities. You would want to stay away from Windows XP's built-in encrypted zip functionality. Also, file names are visible even in encrypted zip files - this can be worked around by zipping and encrypting twice if the file names are sensitive.

BG is a generalized case of of TG, TG remains not just unsolved, but provably unsolvable.
While Satoshi deserves massive credit for the work done with Bitcoin, I can't help but think that people generally overstate his contribution to BG as well. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the solution to BG. There were other implementations of BFT before Bitcoin for other applications. Satoshi found a way to implement it for verifying majority consensus of a shared Proof-of-Work chain.

IP spoofing has limited utility. You can't reliably complete two way transmissions using a spoofed IP address, since you need to be in control of the originating address to receive the responses. This limits IP spoofing to unidirectional UDP traffic or simple TCP flooding.

You don't even need to break out of the sandbox. Tricks such as a cache timing attack can reveal crypto information from VMs on shared hardware. I've seen demonstrations that include landing an instance on a targeted AWS physical host and extracting openssl keys.

Capture the keys at creation, that'd be one way.
