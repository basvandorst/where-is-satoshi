First time buying BTC. Should I buy now or should I wait for a small drop?
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:44:56
Mine just says "Out of tasks". How did you answered the questions?
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:07:37
You are right, I guess I had a bad idea xD

Thanks, this is why I love this subreddit!

Yeah I guess you are saying what I thought first. But other users here said that it doesn't change the rules here and they are right. I don't know if I try it, I just want to help renting the house xD
I already thought about "changing houses" with someone.

Yap you are right, I just thought that using bitcoin instead of € would help because I can have friends there, I just can't rent it. 
But yeah you are right, thanks for answering :)
