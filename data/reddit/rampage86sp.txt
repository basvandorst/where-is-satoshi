Moral of the story, even if you plan to sell most of your Crypto at some point always leave a few coins in your wallet just in case.

15k would be a nice early Christmas gift for a lot of us

Look at his post history, just constant bashing on Bitcoin with no substance whatsoever, very obviously just another bcash troll.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:55:27
Timing the market is insanely tough, buy when you can and hodl for the long run with money you can afford to lose, that's what I've been doing at least
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:06:26
And the real Bitcoin must really threaten the bcash morons for the amount they talk about wanting to take it down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:46:39
December 25th Christmas Morning would be great

Could use a new Keyboard if you wouldn't mind, thanks for the generosity OP
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:06
Ya lots of bcash idiots flooding this subreddit as of late, don't listen to those dumbasses. I'm HODLING!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:56:42
Good luck brotha, hopefully it works out well like that other guy who did the same about 6 months ago

Supply and demand, I know so many friends trying to buy right now in Canada and are waiting on verification from Quadriga. It took me over a week to get verified and funded to be able to buy a decent amount of BTC. I was stuck buying only $200/day on Coinbase while watching the price shoot up, it was so frustrating, I know that many many people are in the same boat today. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:50:54
I thought I got in too late last month but I told myself no matter what I'm gonna hold for the long term and dove in, best decision I've made all year.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:15:25
You made me laugh for the first time in a few days, well played
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:36
ON TO 13K!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:38:34
It's 3:37am I should be sleeping but it's crazy right now and I can't keep my eyes of the charts
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:17
I bought in around 10k as well brother, this is one hell of a ride but I'm not getting off anytime soon. HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:05:40
Not trying to give any financial advice because no one really knows but I can say from personal experience that everyone I know who waited and tried to time the market for a dip ended up paying more. If you're planning on buying in and holding for the long term like I did, I'd take the leap and buy right now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:27:15
Lol yup I'm totally spoiled, lets get 12k done already I'll celebrate 15k at Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:32
That was a great read, to be perfectly honest I recently got into Bitcoin mostly because of FOMO and was looking for a good return on investment but the more I read and research different cryptos the more I realize this is about so much more and could be so much bigger than I ever imagined
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:34
I'm relatively new to this game and today definitely had me nervous but I'm HODL'ing strong and fuck bcash!
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:38:36
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:34:12
Seriously seems like these bcash guys have nothing better to do with their time. I'm happy hodling my real Bitcoin, no fake scams in my portfolio thx anyways
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:23:49
If you're like me and see value in BTC and plan to hold for the long term I'd jump in. I thought I bought in late last month but I'm very glad I did.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:44
Grats and welcome to the team! :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:05
We did it 12K on Bitfinex and Gdax!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:58:42
Welcome to the club! Hodl for the long run and don't freak out too much when we spike (up or down) It's gonna be one hell of a ride, enjoy it! To the moooooooon!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:38:46
Ya I feel you man, I was getting so frustrated I had to wait over 2 weeks before I got my money into an exchange. I was stuck buying up my little $200 coinbase limit while the price was soaring thousands of dollars. But like others have said don't feel too bad, if you plan to hold for the long term the price now vs a couple weeks ago won't matter much.
