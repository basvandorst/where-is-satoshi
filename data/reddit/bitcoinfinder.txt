maybe they being bankster; it's cheaper &amp; safer to get rid of unregistered value than to process it the legal way. First heard of from PayPal, then from exchanges; if funds come in that you might be legally required to "snitch" on, it's much better to let the customer take a hint and go take that smelly unregistered value somewhere else (i.e. withdraw it and go elsewhere). But it's illegal to give that hint. So nudge nudge, wink wink, or "you're approaching your limits and if you reach the limit we'll need to freeze your funds if reach to the limit". Totally crazy, but that's the legal side of things. So lock your value on a Trezor or hard-reset and then airgap an old smartphone.

separate this into two: message, and message verification.
To update the message, it needs a new verification.
There was not mentioned any requirement to know which is the most current message, but if needed, then the verification would need to be notarised somehow on a regular interval, to mark that there is not yet any newer message that invalidated the one you're looking at.
Using SSL instead of proper message signing and notarisation is a bad fit, and brings with it loads of dependencies, all with their own problems.

Poor should NOT use bitcoin. Don't put value into bitcoin, that you cannot affort to lose (volatility, theft risk, etc). Poor with good financial literacy and willpower won't stay poor. Those without both, should NOT use bitcoin, as it would transfer wealth from them to rich white/asian males. If you're too poor to pursue a mistaken transaction, that's extra risk. Better wallets can fix this last thing. Financial literacy, that's an education problem. Willpower is harder.

CarFax in particular? I guess they're paper-trail based, manual entry into a database, distribute-by-overwrite. Not convinced. Likely easier to hack than your show :). Google finds stolen carfax logins for sale.
I didn't understand your statement I replied to really, but wanted to dig more into "like a permissioned ledger". Your show, and cynicism from the IT industry, have me mostly convinced that non-scam inspiring examples are rare.
How *could* CarFax prevent hackers gaining full write access to their database? Smart-cards, screwed tight PCs, glued USB ports, on a dedicated network. Incoming changes only via paper trail. Aggregate on a dedicated server. DB with row-level security, sharding write-access to the DB over several offices. Signed periodical "proofs" so the database can't be counterfeited, audited by an outside professional. But signing is only useful if client output also checks these signatures.
And likely it'd still be easy to fool a data entry clerk to enter counterfeited data.
Guessing CarFax safety is industry average, a hack could cause expensive downtime and hundreds of employees not able to do work.

@_date: 2016-08-19 07:14:24
What? You just can't have perfect security on something that people use. Human factors, etc. So, the highest "good enough" security of a website you can get - if the content is static, you could build it in hardware with all configuration, IP adresses etc hardcoded. If it has to be changeable like in killerstorms original question, the neatest solution is to publish over some hash-adressable storage (torrent magnet link, freenet, ...) and just have the hardware show a new "redirect to", signed in blockchain-style, so you can track backwards that nobody is quickly changing the redirect link and signature too often.
And the clients would need to (somehow) be trusted.
If the content is simple, maybe you could get the published raw data printed on a paper, and then do the cryptographic check by hand. If it's an URL, I guess you'd be able to check the signature in a few minutes. Pen and paper is still quite hard to tamper with while you have it in front of you.

mining chip development is expected to level out, and whoever has ability to mass produce and mass distribute these chips, and with most people not "root"-ing their phones (and any other high sales volume always connected appliances), that company gets to do arbitrage on electricity costs. The existing energy markets supposedly aren't verry efficient, part because transporting energy from one place to another has been difficult.
If mining chips were in every new sold charger (say, rather than in every phone/tablet/...) then those producers could put an end to electricity subsidies in China and elsewhere, or at least make major profits. Either way, there are surely some interested in investing in this, and 21 seems to be the leading option for doing such deals.

(Maybe reinventing zeronet)
Put X bitcoin in UTXO A, and sign a torrent magnet: link to the content with the private key for A.
To update the content, spend X in full into UTXO B and sign new magnet link with B.
Find the first version the same way you find the website: someone must tell you which web domain to use. Maybe bootstrap by moving X coin into a brainwallet with password=domain name, before moving it into the multisig A.
Still you also need to somehow prove that the correct people have the multisig keys for A, B, ... and at any point can metal-to-kneecaps or similar method break this security scheme.
Javascript exists for viewing content of a torrent magnet link in-browser. The blockchain crypto can be done by javascript in your browser. Assuming you trust your client machine and browser, maybe you could even make the bootstrapping less painful by creating a SSL cerificate in a way that proves you owned the X bitcoin. If the original transaction from domain-name-keyed brainwallet to A is done in a public place with the multisig trusted people present to verify their kneecaps are still intact, that's likely the best you can do.

You could refund the sent coins to where they came from easily, less the transaction fee, probably.
Or use payment channels. Then you can easily raise your bid without incurring transaction costs each time. And in the end, the seller will need to refund.
So in both cases above, you'll need someone to perform escrow services. And now you're so deep in complexity that you can just go ahead and use OpenBazaar or similar.

Ok, so you've chosen computer use only. CC autofill is nice (until you get a virus on your computer) and one-click checkout delivering to your preselected address (paypal, amazon, etc) is handy, but I guess you know you're paying a premium for that, since the lax security means there is insurance costs tacked onto your purchase price, though not directly visible to you.
Realistically though, if you loose one of these (phone, creditcard, computer) at a random time of day, for most people the phone is waht they will notice first if it goes missing. So phone physically holding your "wallet" is good safety. Multisig (something like greenaddress) or a weaker setup like some e-coin (now Wirex) hot wallet typically has 0,5-1% overhead, way below Paypal's or credit card processors.
But if you only care for convenience, get magic(.com) and you can even skip the clicking in the web stores, instead just type or say out loud what you need and they bring it (at a premium).

You as in me myself and I? Thank you, but no thanks. If there is a power outlet, some roughtly flat space, and nothing hampering BYOD, then it may be useful as a hack space. But 3 years old? I deduce you either lost faith in Christmas, or already filled that shed to the brim and are now using the second toilet for your more recent junk storage needs. Also, the batteries on those 3y old gifts have probably run flat, and the shed may be an environmental hazard. So you can probably count on the junk not migrating out by itself anytime soon.
Happy holidays!

Actually, the ETN is issued by a financial house, while the asset behind it all is provided by XBT Provider, and to give the new company XBT Provider some weight, they say that KnC Group guarantees the access to bitcoin. Surely profitable as well as useful for evangelising bitcoin.

"recipient pays the fees"
Quite practical isn't it? Making your customers create costs for a third party. The bank just needs the most selfish/ignorant customers possible, then sit back and enjoy the cash flow.
I think it's time to compare fees with actual fees and not the bank's best fees. Formulate such that for banks to refute, they'd need to provide actual numbers on how much fees they collect.
EDIT: Why banks don't simply buy internet-only customers with hefty signup bonuses is beyond me.

How do we get rid of 3+ account spammers who are polluting by repeating their opinion on 3, 4 or more places along a conversation topic?
I tried hitting "report" on several of the identicals in a row to hopefully get moderators onto the problem, but unsure if that's the proper way. Simply banning the users (otherwise history-less users) would probably encourage them to create new users and start over. Perhaps limiting how many times you can post the same identical comment, by account, would be a good countermeasure?
I avoid pointing to a real artifact since that'd help the perpetrators get attention, which must be their only purpose of spamming their comment-combos identically on several places.
If the above was unclear, here's an attempt at illustrating:
    foo bar interesting comment
      abuser1: X is my opinion
        userab2: yeah your right on that
          rotten3: that's what I been sayin' too!
     baz foo interesting
       bla bla

open source works better with several parallell projects in the start, to allow many ideas to cross-pollinate. Once the projects mature, that's the time for unifying and standardising. You can't standardise what you haven't even tried once. That's why Google, Firefox, etc build features into the browsers before there is a standard. And how SASS grew into SCSS. These things must either take time or give inferior results.

Wikipedia: "A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not, thus a Bloom filter has a 100% recall rate."
And "The invertible Bloom filter works in more or less the same way as a basic Bloom filter but it works with with key value pairs (x,y) and instead of a bit array is uses a three-component data structure that can store the key x, the value y and a count."
Note: Invertible and inverse are different words.

Apple-issues: If iOS, there are TOS to worry about. Probably let people "donate" via a webpage and you'll be alright for starters.
Keep good backups and protect the app signing keys / provisioning!
Small sums:
(Converting right to USD is likely the easiest way to go.)
Keep it simple: Use an online wallet with one of the bigger web services for starters. Preferably one that you've already got setup with (verifications for KYC/AML).
Bigger sums:
Use a multisig wallet service. That way, even if you loose one key you'll have a backup key in your vault (*) + the wallet service and can rescue your funds.
(*) Preferably NOT kept on any computer/phone. And preferably only make use of that key via some device that you can keep switched off 99.9% of the time, and thus have 99.9% less risk of infections. Let's say an old reinstalled laptop with only some reputable minimal Linux install. And treat that laptop as your bank vault.

"accurate fingerprinting"? Checking recieving address no chance, so what else? Banks like challenge-response with long number series on small "calculators". For higher security maybe. But multiSig is not meant to be used for every transaction. Think of it as an ATM replacement. Instead of visiting the ATM (which can cost up to several USD if you pick one without your bank's logotype) you'd just refill your on-phone hotwallet. Fully legit use-case, and possibly both cheaper and easier than ATMs.

um. if the atm moves so fast it needs gps while also being "in active duty", then there is probably a human or AI around that can handle location updates without the extra cost of GPS with antennas.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous enought that it didn't get forbidden right at the start. Once any cryptocurrency gets international and can function without a backing government, other cryptocurrencies will flourish for real: Even a DAC can trade bitcoin for altcoins, and a DAC cannot be jailed and the author(s) of a DAC can hide easier than Satoshi.

If we get this "securely encrypted NAS-economy" working, and someone wants to give away storage for free, why not accept happily?
Also, these storage projects evolv. If Storj figured out the economy to keep it rolling, then that's excellent. And perhaps a similar model can be used to make freenet and Fon and your favourite crowd-project spread in a sustainable way.
Defending against e.g. Dropbox or such that want's to spend a lot of resources on destroying Storj is likely hard to defend against, so if that happens then some people could loose their backups. Anyway, since this is all beta software and not even released yet, we can sit back and wait for it. And maybe support monetarily if you like where the project is heading.

If you have too big stashes of BTC, then why not spend some?
Use brawker (or similar) to get BTC if:
* your bank hates bitcoin, and will close your account if you wire money to a bitcoin exchange
* you need to buy fast (to take advantage of a sudden price dip) where can't afford to wait for bank wire transfers
* your credit card has a kickback policy (1-2% cash back on spent amount) that, together with currency exchange rates etc, makes it a good deal for you

Well, the devs. have been working for quite some time on this already. I agree the first published whitepaper isn't very scientific in how it's written, and the project looks very much a product of internet forums. The fundraiser explains that they need funds to pay for development. And they've already gotten some early investors in at the 15% bonus level, so some smart (or risk-hungry) money is in there. The current 10% bonus level round is likely to get people with skin in the game, and perhaps there are competitors around the corner. Or Google's "free" offer for businesses created a suitable news-climate, and fundraising now gives reporters a chance to write contrasting articles about centralised vs decentralised storage offers.
So, if you invest at this point, your investing in the idea and in a belief that super3 with the 15% bonus-investors (which seem to stay anonymous) are skilled enough to make this project happen. There's also a healthy dose of risk that Driveminer (proof of storage) runs into trouble. But just getting research on proof of storage, to complement proof-of-ASIC and proof-of-stake is fine with me, and very relevant. If there are some university researchers looking into proof-of-storage-on-a-blockchain, then they could come forward and ask for investment too, or at least show they exist and explain how to legally support their work.

The correct reaction to these hacks and vulnerabilities, is to step up your security, use good password managers, never repeat passwords (or password patterns!) between services, and reset password and 2FA for anything that could be used to access your value or your sensitive information. Usa 2fa, but not 2fa that simply relies on your phone's SIM.

decentralised is by definition less efficient (=more expensive) than centralised.
So VISA and MasterCard should be cheaper than bitcoin, but most people give money to banks, and miss out on cash "rebates" and pay credit fees, for fun?
If you like to make money, "quick credit" businesses can hold your money for a while and you get 7-10% on the misery of those with worse economic wits than you. Slightly more ethical, at very similar rates, is S&amp;P500, or bitcoin or your favourite pump&amp;dump. Which means inflation is up there near 10%, so having cash on hand means you're literally losing money!

Without moderation it would be 99.9% trash (think zerohedge or your local stock market chat but way worse). Who could moderate fairly? Not someone who wants to. Maybe the moderation task nees to rotate often.
Protection from sock puppets and sybil resistance. The sybils can be AI:s that repost old posts and memes, i.e. indistinguishable from the average longterm redditor.
You're your own worst moderator. Self moderation? Maybe pre-Savechecking every post, if AI says "risky" you attach some bits/monetary value that becomes payment to the platform if your post broke some rules. Reddit is already cheap to manipulate (was it $200 to get fake news to reliably stay up on the front page?) so it's might be worth it to have less power tripping moderators.
Otherwise; AI is probably already strong enough to create a multiverse of reddits. Everybody gets to see the comments and votes that would they want to see, nobody disappoint. Google doesn't dare to build "EPIC", but someone will, soon enough.

actually, there was a nice writeup about why small amounts every x days isn't optimal for something like bitcoin. If you're buying stocks piece by piece, or index bonds, then sure, but for bitcoin, just keep some cash ready on an exchange or bookmark some nearby BTM:s, then buy the dips. It smoothens out the curve, and ensures you always get a rebate when buying bitcoins.

When everyone has guns, it's difficult to not have. Stretching this a bit - maybe we can extend this to nukes, that if someone has some then it's better everybody stock up. Except your enemies; they are of course up for swift punishment if they pack any.
When nobody has guns, then very few people need them. Also the police don't.

And a struggle it sure is. On one hand, how can you congratulate someone buying 3 BTC in one fell swoop right at the ATH? Instead of maybe 1 or 0.5 instantly, and looking out for the very standard volatility and buying at a discount just hours (~30) later. If OPs post and timing is truthful, the 3 BTC purchase was right after the ATH. Now with hindsight, there wasn't enough volatility to get more than mayb 2.5 - 3.5% rebate to be had, so maybe a hundred bucks is little to debate about, especially if OP is a soon to be whale.
Oh, and I was congratulating iftodaywasurlastday (all the while convincing myself it's a good idea). Hindsight has helped here too; I no longer worry that OP lost out on a "free" $100. Especially since there's really no proof the purchase ever happened. Also, I don't recommend proving purchases publicly.

Since only miners vote, outside of a few public nodes per mining pool, there's use for reliable low latency high bandwidth "archival" nodes. A personal node as source of reliable data (SPV!) is reasonable, if you can keep your node safe. Typically, it'd work better using a node from some provider that has an incentive to be good, and preferably in a nice jurisdiction, or run by hacker collectives as a TOR hidden service.
People running full and validating nodes and looking at console outputs and checking the health of the network can have a point.
But most "I want to run my own node" are not running a safe node, so increasing the risk that their "server" gets abused to trick some wallet or track down where transactions come from.
Maybe bitcoin has, like with TOR, a large amount of public bitcoin nodes being run with the primary purpose to collect data on where transactions come from and where they go.
Spinning up nodes "to participate" typically won't benefit the network technically. At best there is some political use for "many public nodes". Mostly though these will just be leeching capacity. For "participants", maybe it better to go on the testnet and help test the latest "nightly" releases from all the camps.

Scandinavian courts are not like those in the US cough or elsewhere. In Scandinavia, only top political enemies get the full Kafka treatment (Assange, Gottfrid) and there is No corruption (officially). So likely they have another solution. Forensics resellers never want to discuss their software with outsiders. Likely similar to KYC/AML, I could tell you but I'd have to shoot you (or all the criminals who could learn about it from you).
Quick guess; Danish police bought a "native™" Windows app (web-API-based) that only runs with a proper law enforcement license, that is locked to their local network, and the (webapp) gives empty page responses if you're not having the proper private key (ehm license) to use it. Since it's illegal to steal the licence, only Police can use the software, and the software author can therefore go under oath and say that they only deliver info (snooped/stolen) from various darknet forums and super secret block explorers. Throw in an automated form to request subscriber details based on an IP and timestamp, and they've basically made the 4 officers working on crypto-related crime be able to go home at 1pm daily (i.e. very efficient tool to create the reports, with someone else under oath that the data is correct, so the officers can hopefully stay out of the courtroom). The software author oath can in most cases probably be replayed from video.

If miners get any more powerful (like they would with BU), they'll sooner or later band together and raise the 21M limit by changing the coinbase reward limits. They'd be printing money for themselves, and 99% of bitcoin *users* don't understand why 21M is an important limit so they'd just continue as before. HODLers wouldn't really have any advantage by selling off when miners change the algo either, so price drop would be gradual and BTC would become just an electronic FIAT run by PBoC.

I borrow 10 BTC from you (and I immediately sell it / short it and look for price drops to buy the dip).
You say I can keep the 10 BTC for a month, or until price goes up $50. In that case you'll need your 10 BTC back immediately (since you don't trust me to pay it back if price -&gt; moon).
Price rises. And rises. My short position is getting squeezed.
And boom! Price rose more than $50.
You demand your 10 BTC back, but I sold it, and don't have 10*50 = 500$ ready on an exchange to buy back. I return what BTC I could buy back, then sell my flatscreen and buy the last missing BTC on localbitcoins, making a huge loss.
Next day, price drops -80$. If you had waited, or price had been a bit less volatile, I'd been making a 30$ profit * 10 BTC instead, but my position was squeezed and popped.
The big short on a chinese exchange is being squeezed to the tune of 15 million USD (started that much) and this client "solved" getting squeezed by increasing his short (diluting the squeeze), avoiding the exchange force-closing the short position, but throwing good million USD in after bad. And the price goes up. And up.
Oh, and then PBoC started inspecting exchanges... and finally forbit BTC withdrawals. It kept the price down for a while, but now that short whale - and arbitratation traders but that's probably small - are lifting the chinese markets so they keep up with non-chinese market price, while logically it should be dropping like a stone similar to when MtGox disabled bitcoin withdrawals.

no, we must prioritise fungibility much more than scaling. Coinbase and authorities are already blocking *practical* bitcoin use by locking people's funds if any of the previous 2-3 owners ofa coin touched something they dislike (gambling/drugs/tumbling).
As soon as bitcoins carry taint from previous owners, it's no longer fungible and looses value. You'd have to check for taint before accepting coins from someone. Bitcoins enemies thus get more foothold. Or another currency without these flaws take a bigger share of crypto market cap.

Something like that is a very cheap insurance against all kinds of *normal* trouble kids may get into (falling off a bike), and if they are typically together they can watch out for each other. Also, you both can call them both through the watch and threaten to withdraw dessert privileges or screen time if they don't come before the food gets cold a.k.a. RIGHT NOW :)

I have a bunch of computers, none if which is able to be a full node. Not enough disk, not enough stable bandwidth. I could run a node just leeching capacity from the network for the fun of it, but I could never be of utility to the network.
I tried to piece together a few requirements for a node _being of use_ to the network, but it's painfully incomplete, and lacks the math of how much a node slows down other nodes while spinning up and time (reliable uptime!) needed to break even, but here goes:
Obviously (!?) with smaller blocks (and higher transaction fees) the time to break even for new nodes would not grow as fast as it currently does. Time to break-even must be kept below a month, probably. It's probably aroudn there already, unless you're spinning up a node on optical internet.

Your example is understandable, and seems to be true, for some &lt;person&gt;.
I copy&amp;pasted from two word definition websites to help the discussion along. It's always easier when people use and understand words similarly.
It seems to me, that you wrote an example hypothesis, using words. It didn't cease to be a hypothesis because you used words to describe it. If you try google "use of hypothesis in " and look at the autocomplete suggestions, you'll notice that people describe hypotheses in words all the time! :-)
Also, if you want to try science (!), to verify your hypothesis, typically you "pit it" against the "null hypothesis". In this case, I suspect there are several different "null hypotheses" that would need to be tested.

brands usually have "official" mechanics, where you pay a premium and can get a slightly nicer stamp in your service booklet. On this model, maybe the brands could use some centralised system to better tie you in to their mechanics, maybe get a chance to spam you when it's time for tire-switching, or when you could possibly want to buy a new car. Connected to the car event tracking system, that could be powerful. Example: after trying to overtake but having to abort, they'd play an ad for their more sporty car versions. Or after skidding, play an ad for new tires.
But I'd not want to use that. And I'd anyway just go to my faster better cheaper mechanic who quit some such place and set up on his own.

authy is vulnerable to SIM takeover as explained in Kraken's blog post.

Hey, slow down, slow down. This commit speeds up bitcoin and allows you to pay for speeding up a stuck transaction. If you're so stuck up about fees, just go ahead and set your wallet to minimum fees and push the cost of running the bitcoin network over to whoever you're sending your transactions to.
But just like with a bank transaction where you check "receiver pays the fees", the receiver will come after you about not paying enough sooner or later, or just consider the payment not received until you fix it up via RBF yourself.
But if you dislike this improvement, go ahead and _guess_ the needed fee or just pay slightly too little and sit and wait out your transactions up to several hours. Hey, why approve of well-tested guaranteed improvements, when you can instead just whine about not getting some miners to pay for your better-than bank grade security. Until they don't, because all the network miners has go bankrupt (in a couple of years).

for a sell to happen, a buy must happen.
During the stampede panic-sell, unless you manage to front-run the horde (i.e. you're a machine trading algo, or have insider info... or both), you or your counterparty in any trades will lose money. By not trading, at least you avoid losing transaction costs.
Bitfinex maybe think it's their best interest to execute as much orders as possible, getting income transaction fees and having a nicer uptime number. (Or they could be front-running their exhange users).
Their users' best interest is surely mixed, but buying or selling during extreme volatility is usually prevented by selective blocking on stock exchanges, and may be a good idea also here. Meanwhile, of course, users should be allowed to withdraw and trade elsewhere. And probably inform users by email/sms.
On the other hand, users probably don't realize they can't all sell high and re-buy low, because obviously nobody wants to do the opposite, so maybe it's too complicated.
Feature request: some bitcoin exchange to "do an IEX"  and level the playing field between robots and human website users. Let it all go through the same APIs. Have multiple front-end websites so website never ever again goes offline (you just get a newer or older version of the web GUI). And some API functions may be temporarily blocked when problems occur. Only the trading engine needs to be at least somewhat centralized to match buy and sell. Probably such an engine should not be coded in php.

For daily transactions by the unbanked poor, using their modern smartphone and data plan: no.
I think we can give up on the "bitcoin to help the poor" mantra. A few years have passed and I'm still waiting for anyone to find some real examples that make sense economically.
If you really care about allowing poor unbanked people to use better-than-bank grade security for buying and selling stuff (bags of rice?) I'm sure there's some projects that allows you to donate money for such usage. But the money would be better spent on CHARITY:WATER if you actually want to help them, and not yourself.
Bitcoin as a conduit for the not-so-poor in third world countries to evade government controls, there bitcoin still shines.
Looking for "mass adoption"? The only chance IMHO is if bitcoin and current wallet software with all their nerdiness become obsoleted like Gopher and Usenet became obsoleted by WWW.

Why? WashTrader (WT) creates one extra login (WT2).
WT creates a sell order for 1BTC @ $1100. No normal traders will fill that trade, so he logs in as WT2 and make the buy. To rebalance, the same trade is made in the opposite direction.
With 0 fees, these wash trades are for free, with the side effect that WT and WT2 will get a rebate on their CNY withdrawal fees from the exchange.
Yes, the exchanges are encouraging fake volume (wash trading).

Their silence probably means there is some legal issue preventing them from talking to you. Basically converting KYC-less cash to bitcoin, like it seems you're doing, brings legal troubles.
Another thing the exchanges are not allowed to say, is that if you'd hide carefully that you're selling via LocalBitcoins or similar service, they'd be able to work with you longer.

If you look at old charts, you might spot some cases where miners were turning off their miners for a very short time around when a rate increase was very near. Then turning them on again right after the increase. Together with miner upgrades, this has kept the blocks coming at on average less than 10 minutes (the engineered time). It is probably still true that block _on average_ come more often than every 10 minutes.

this double-coinbase issue is guaranteed to be covered, since it's easy to code. The double-spend by users is harder, because the merchants accepting bitcoins would not know to check both 1mb and xt blockchains to prevent double spends. But most merchants likely use a service that will have that covered.
But bitcoin exchanges with weak tech teams will risk losing money. The easy defense would be to already now ensure they run a system that can handle either of the current(1mb) and the xt blockchains, and when the fork happens they'd use the winning chain. I think hard forks typically work like this.

ever shared dinner bills with friends? someone promised to pay their share later? I'm guessing lightning is something similar to this, but with crypto so you don't get cheated.
The tricky part is getting properly spread out hubs to coordinate the debts. As in real life, it's too messy to track specifics, so you tend to keep a tally + - to reach zero (=so sometimes no transactions have to go on the blockchain). And transfer debt to be "more local", between friends who meet often, rather than between those who meet rarely (done via regional hubs).
ELI5 payment channels: half-baked bitcoin payments. You only put the last one on the blockchain (=paying one fee instead of many).

Agree. And the licence, by being way over the top complicated and expensive, also shows other states that it _really_ seems to be a good idea to wait a bit. All the others basically got a "free to pass" card to show any anti-bitcoin forces that bang at their legislative doors. So, by being unsufferable, the license is likely a blessing to everyone outside of NY.
And fun to see that even (some) New Yorker likes the license :)

if 1mb stays, then there should be some very easy method available to get access to see and pay to raise prio of your transaction if it's not going through quick enough. And all wallets and services would then have to change to make this possible, also risking your privacy a bit more. All in all, raising the limit seems like the easiest fix, and having a hard upper + soft limiting by miners allows the "transaction fee" market to evolve.
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:28:29


so, really you need info on how trustable, accountable and mistake-free the exchange system and people are, right? Basically ensure that the exchange dosen't make itself a big fat hacker target:
1. hold no cash, coins
2. hold no user profile info
3. keep no secrets (so, only open buy/sell bids, no shadow market to hide big buys (but this feature could maybe be implemented outside of the exchange)

what? Of course no, LN is useless if all hubs are run by the same company. Then it becomes Coinbase or Circle, but with a lot of pointless overhead that brings pointless costs. So not going to happen, unless the value of such an illusion is bigger than the costs, considering the risk of it getting uncovered and the whole investment and the business brand value destroyed.

@_date: 2015-08-17 18:03:29


[citation needed]
I was personally convinced that LN did not add much more risk than possibly having to pay a few extra miners fees in case a hub shuts down before all transactions are untangled and pushed to the blockchain. Or possibly some other hub could pick up the loose ends of another hub. So you'd chance getting faster cheaper transactions, and risk having the transactions require additional manual work and &gt;6 regular bitcoin confirmations to clean up after a failed hub. But I read the whitepaper quickly and didn't memorize much, so please add some pointers of copypaste some segments to show me wrong.

Since miners can currently choose and set the limit as they care, I applaud the vigor spent on debating this, but in reality, it seems that the hash power easily handles this between them.

it works similar to dividing up restaurant bills between friends. All friends that transact with each other have it easier if they stay on the same hub, by avoiding inter-hub transfers. Those who transact very internationally will likely want to use &gt;1 hub.
So LN will for economical efficiency group transactions based on bitcoin adresses, not where you live or get your mandatory gov.t issued ID. It will make it easier to see which addresses may belong to one and the same user, if you don't work against that. Tumblers are one option.

Maybe not in principle, but in practice mods won't care about hundreds of throwaways or regular dissidents doing "upvote me" posts when they have no upvotes, and have less interest caring when they get much upvotes. So they'll either let a bot handle auto-modding such posts or ignore them. And then you can start writing "pls voat" instead of "upvote please", saving keypresses and avoiding blatantly breaking that policy.

I'd dare to run a LN hub, since nobody told me its illegal and I'm not a citizen of NY, North Korea, Iran or which others are in the geopolitical shit-list currently. I imagine it's similar to running a torrent client. It can cause you inconvenience, and with really bad luck you could go to court. But being "negligent" would likely not be very expensive. Like with torrents, admit nothing and join a "insurance club" to pool together. One out of 1000 in the club convicted =&gt; costs are smoothed out. Like with voting, the many will over time win over the few.

No, I wasn't sarcastic. But I was calling you out. Thanks for responding to that and in a nice way. You could also have said I'm borderline trolling.
Your writeup here is a very nice summary to be compared against Bram's essay 
With both inputs, it appears a given that the blocksize will increase. And now I'm getting worried, just a bitsy bittle, about what changes are in XT apart from the ones that have been announced in the changelist and the ones that have already been uncovered to be there but not being mentioned in the changelist.
This opportunity to peruse the Reddit drama and with the few Core devs distracted with all things involved, would be a perfect chance to insert some other tiny changes in the protocol that helps some TLA's agenda. And if discovered, it could be blamed on the general confusion rather than being done on purpose. A little like hacking crazy targets during the DefCon days when most hackers and relevant feds are busy watching each other instead of watching their servers.

I agree it'd be nice to keep blockchain fees in the range of bank bill payments, so a couple cents.
There's a problem though: anything stored on the blockchain is paid for by all blockchain users. And many don't want to store much more than bitcoins there. So some compromise will happen. Presumably by making the market forces play out.
To connect back to the always-present debate, the block size will increase, and higher tx capability will increase usage, raising tx fees over time. No idea what tx fees are "the best" for longer term. But to keep miners interested and the blockchain safe, sum of fees per mined block must go up soon.

I think yes, but very automated, and technically not IOUs but rather actual transactions, just put the "IOU" on the blockchain and the debt is settled.

sending a BIP38 key means you need to explain and convince the recipient to make a wallet. This is bitcoin without having responsibility for a wallet. Wallets don't get backed up. Here you can't forget to back it up - the backup is the wallet.

Not every idea or invention can be judged by asking "would I use it myself?"

The message inside Mycelium is just for your convenience and not needed to actually receive coins. Just double-check that the transaction goes to the right address, then wait.
If not sent to the right address, you could've tried quickly contacting the sender and ask them to "double-spend"  the same transaction with a higher fee, which if done quickly enough (minutes, not hours), you could replace the wrong transaction with a (more expensive) new transaction. Only the sender can do this, and anyway now it's too late.

Bitcoiners already have lots of wallets; cold-storage, on-phone hot wallets, old wallets with just a few cents on them. So why not let newcomers try the fun with multiple ways of storing value too? (Some method of "cleaning out" leftovers, decreasing UTXO, would be great to innovate around too...)

Lightning Network (LN): built above bitcoin. Faster (seconds vs 1 hour) and usable for small payments (coffee).
Adoption will start out slow. When wallets support it, you'll get to allocate some coin (your "spending limit") to be used over LN, and maybe your choice of LN hub (support your local firemen - use their hub!).

Bitcoin keep getting new users, who ask old questions. So current wisdoms will have to be repeated.

Basic understanding of UTXO and continental internet latencies is required if you want more than a hobby debate.
For each whole chain download, a full node must keep relaying for months IIRC, or else we'd be better off without it. Double the size limit to 2mb adds months to that. Some calculation showed that relaying to 8 peers is far too low. A non-relaying node will work only until too many are doing it. Relaying nodes are too few as is.
More than 2mb has no support. Transaction capacity is not linear to the block size limit. Personally I doubt the risks involved would be worth it to just barely double.


It has been tested. A node just parroting what it got from other nodes has negative value to the network as a whole. Maybe hardcoding some more recent block + the full UTXO set going into the next block could be almost as good security as with only the genesis block hardcoded, though way harder to implement and distribute safely and correctly.
If you skip fully validating that your node is on the true chain, just use WayneChain and Wayne's your source of the true chain.
*Some users* are stuck on repeat (that won't make it true!) thinking that cheaper bandwidth and SSDs allows increasing blocksize limits. NOT so easy. Current bottlenecks are block validation and latencies in propagation (speed of light and large distances). Distributed systems can not be as efficient as centralized ones, but maybe you can get that precious transaction speed in exchange for something else. Chaumian ecash backed by bitcoins may allow the speed you came to love years ago, when bitcoin was operating way below its capacity limits.
Best setup I can imagine is BIP70 via a centralized pooled hot wallet provider peering with most big miners, merging inputs into the pool ahead of time. It tracks your balance in mySQL :) and makes merged outgoing transactions with high fees, minimizing dust. Can improve fungibility. Or with less fungibility, BitGo or GreenAddress.

Sadly, yes (on both counts). Some machines just can't support any newer Windows OS, or can't afford upgrading.

@_date: 2015-09-22 15:41:02
what is "block withholding" in this case? If it's about mining a block, and not publishing it immediately, then sure that could be practical. You can now try to mine one more block on top of your current, and have a chance to then publish two new mined blocks instead of one. If the first block is empty (no transactions) and you have good network presence, then you could watch all big pools and if someone else mines a block you immediately publish your smaller block. With some luck you still avoid getting it orphaned.
Maybe interesting to look into those pools that mined 6 blocks in a row with no (or few?) transactions in them. It could be an example of this strategy in the wild.

Well, I think you can exchange all or most of your "balance" with onecoin into tokens. Just, you can't sell much tokens, and non-token assets can "increase" in value. In short, there is a fictional premium on keeping your assets with onecoin and in the least liquid form possible, to maximally mask the fact that you can't even get out the amount you put in, when you get cold feet.
What would help is, if it would be possible to sell tokens outside of the onecoin controlled world. But it isn't, because the tokens are just numbers in a database, not actual crypto based on something like couterparty or even an altcoin blockchain. So NO third party exchanges exist, and this is how they hide the fact that on an open market their tokens would be worth nothing, because Mircea Popescu and others who distrust alts, and ponzi no-crypto scams even more, would just short these tokens into oblivion.
So with onecoin, the proposal is; keep your retirement funds with us, and if onecoin takes over the world (i.e. becomes fungible and better for illegal transactions than bitcoin) then you may, maybe, make some money on it. Otherwise it'll just become worthless at some point.
They do offer a credit card, likely tied to some additional token, also with additional spending limits and fees. Likely the card is one further way the onecoin scam is making money off of the senior citizens.

Replying to me, or to the parent of my post? I'm saying that mining (SHA1 hash-preimages same as Hashcash, right?) are supposedly quicker to "mine" = brute-force for earlier blocks than for recent blocks. And private keys ("wallets") even harder to brute force. So having "cracked" an early block would have less evidence-value than getting hold of the "satoshi coins's" private keys. Kaminsky suggested that persons aspiring to the Satoshi godlike status should  mode some of the early coins to prove themselves, which more and more seems like it won't happen, until the crypto algorithms are broken or such.

Right. So you seem to have hit the nail on the head as to why Bitcoin is wildly unpopular in the USA, as compared to other countries' bitcoin adoption.
Oh, I got the bitcoin adoption backwards, didn't I? So we still didn't find out why all US bitcoin users have got this all wrong, and why they don't stop doing bitcoin transactions that is filling up the blocks for all the poor Bangladeshi smartphone users that would need to buy coffee with on-chain transactions.
Culturally, the Netherlands should be optimal for transitioning to a bitcoin-focused local economy. While they love coffee, their coffee shops also sell other, more bitcoin-all-the-way friendly products.

With true LN implementations, the best option is as explained above
1) replacing the channel with a smaller one + the payment you wanted (if your channel counterparty is online and not malfunctioning) - miner fees are the same as setting up a channel 
In case of trouble, the _always present_ fallback option for any LN channel is:
2) tearing down the channel by pushing it onto the blockchain, sending the payment, then presumably creating a new channel again - here miner fees are for pushing channel on-chain + the transaction + channel setup cost as in 1) , so both more expensive and slower
Finally, the idea for a LN-to-onchain transaction gateway would cost about the same as 1) necessarily, unless the service is prepared to loose money on helping you out for some reason. Such reasons could be if you are their customer and maybe watch their ads, or "10 free transactions if you buy our products" or something such? This kind of service would likely demand to know wou you are, and then they could make money off of seeing the timing and sums you're paying out - maybe profiling your buying power then showing you ads for suitably expensive luxury stuff.
Such service could make transactions come on-chain faster than you would, by being better connected to big pools, or having some include-guarantee with big pools. They could also possibly make the transactions instant (Bitgo Instant, GreenAddres or even something completely offchain or maybe using another payment network).
Finally, you could likely have a LN-payment service that gives you added anonymity, say, if the owner of said LN payment service is also the owner of some popular but not facebook-shareable services and products. And in this case they would surely opt for short-circuiting these most sensitive payments so they go off-chain or bunched together. Somethink like a specialized coinjoin, from many LN channels into a few big outgoing payments funneled maybe via exchanges, unless the owner wants to HODL a big chunk.
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:44:04
people were surely just stocking up, waiting for price increases to sell again. It's the big mining operations, not the small (long tail, if it really exists?) that can not wait with selling coins to pay their bills.

All agree that blockchain without the bitcoin is worthless? How about bitcoin without the blockchain?
Now how about an ethereum chain without value tokens?
Finally, how well is it going for the economies that lock the exchange rate between their national currency and the US dollar? (BTW, don't travel to Argentina or Venezuela.)
Pegging ethereum to bitcoin wouldn't work.
The inevitable conclusion is that ethereum can not survive without its own coin.
Now to whether ethereum has a long term value. Same question is relevant for bitcoin. If rootstock works well, and thunder and lightning gets going, then there is less and less room for competitors. Which may really be a bad idea. How is that non-competition working out for broadband customers in USA and Australia? (Man/Mate that's some cruel packet loss.)

Banks have insurance costs, which probably went up for all banks after the recent SWIFT heists. Maybe multisig can do this cheaper. 
Banks still allow humans to add transactions very manually, and therefore also need additional software and more humans to cross-check at least some of the numbers.
Banks usually allow overdrafts, somethimes by mistake, which causes extra work and costs for all involved.
Oh, and the underlying currency is humming along just fine, nothing to look at there.

The Bitcoin Uncensored podcast has some content on onecoin. They control everything, so there is zero transparency. This allows them to fake trading volumes and fix the price on their (the only) exchange. The primary thing of importance of course, is that the guys on the top squeeze out as much money as they can and then run for it, before the ponzi bagholders at the bottom figure out that they'll never get back more than some fraction of what they put in. A bit like Bitfinex, actually. Most onecoin guys don't know they are a scam, yet. Educate and promulgate!

What bad experiences have you had with bitcoin?
The example I cited had &lt;20 transactions over the last 8 months. Nothing standing out. CC details leak too easily. Factory-resetting a phone with a bitcoin hot wallet and then typing in the 12 word code is cheap and quick.
I've suffered Paypal, no other personal grudges pre-bitcoin.
A friend lost his login for a bitcoin exchange. Fixed with a selfie showing the date and his ID.
I don't keep several hundred dollars worth of any currency in my wallet, except for those untrustworthy plastics. But I don't carry my wallet with me around town; just phone, ID and a limited debit card that buzzes my phone for each transaction.
I know, I'm probably missing out on pushing the shelf price tags up for other buyers by getting them to subsidize 1-2% cashback to me. Especially the poor Bangladeshi who don't have a credit score, and pay X times higher prices for bank and WU transactions. The important thing is, that you get your cashback, and that bitcoin transaction costs are low enought for on-chain coffe purchases. I got that right?


Eh? CC fees stay under 3%, so CC fraud costs less than 3% of total transacted.
0.1% CC transactions are fraud. You think bitcoin fraud and thefts is higher? Either absolute or relative numbers interest me.
You'll surely find more credit card fraud than bitcoin thefts, absolute and relative.
And how about thefts from US bank accounts with silly passwords? SWIFT getting robbed of billions. Oh, and central banks printing money.
@_date: 2016-05-21 15:50:14
Yes, because higher fee means you can bring a bigger bus. But it won't get you bigger blocks. It seems to me that your options are
a) bitch on I heard miners and devs take reddit whining as their main influence for deciscions re. block size... /s
b) help (fund?) developing solutions that allow for more and cheaper transactions
c) switch from bitcoin to another coin. Surely any other coin could just raise the block size, decrease fees, and live happily ever after? If you don't care about anonymity, I hear fedcoin is supposedly free to use after the mandatory DNA swabbing.

thanks for googling for me. Though not a answer to the question. Lets rehash, for the entertainment value:


Key words *where* and *you*. Are you actually using such a card? Do you get an actual cashback?
Outside the USA, it's more normal to pay a lot of different fees. In the UK, there was a court ruling forcing banks to pay back fees to their customers. A friend of mine financed a holiday on that "cashback". This is why I'm slightly surprised to hear of theoretical "money for free" from banks, and would be more surprised if someone would state, on their reddit honor,  an actual amount (or lower bound) they get back.
Sorry, not living in US or Bangladesh or any other popular example of an "unbanked" country, I don't know how US banks compare to Bangladeshi banks.
Presumably I just pick one card that you helped to google? The top two require a US credit score above 690. So, these unbanked poor just get a credit history, a US residency, and then get rich funneling their weekly wages via that card?
Or maybe bring the cashback cards to Bangladesh? It can't really be hard to sell them free money? Your new business maybe? Or maybe there are real world isues blocking this from happening? Oh, and then it's the question of who is subsidizing this cashback.

Is "yes" allowed?
Have you found the mythical poor person, who has a bank account and a credit or debit card, with 0 fees, and maybe even some % cashback on purchases? Where?
More specifically, bitcoin is a market fit. At 3-5x cheaper than bank "equivalents", it's cheap enough, for now. Buying one cup of coffee with your bitcoins? Probably you're cutting into both yours and the sellers profits. By all means ask them if they prefer card or cash payment for that coffee.
Paying cash subsidises those paying by card. Or, paying by card, maybe with cashback, pushes the prices up for everybody. There has been laws passed to prevent taking a "card fee" to make people prefer paying cash. But you can maybe still get a discount if you pay cash.

A stock's price changes if the currency it's denominated in changes. You're effectively suggesting there's room for arbitrage (over time). Forget that idea. Robot traders outrun and outsmart you.
Arbitrage happens between all markets already. Markets not operating 24/7/365 and laws and capital controls still slow things down, but you anyway need microsecond or better information granularity to frontrun any market with volume nowadays.
Invest in people and businesses you like and trust. VCs are starting to take small investor money if you want higher risk/reward. Or index funds. Or just HODL.

So, which names are important in bitcoin history? The ones you've heard? The ones that hit mainstream media? Tabloids? I'm sure most people don't know even one of the names of _real people_ who had an impact and made a difference.
It's like with kings and queens. Nobody knows their names. They are just not important, even if they formally are the most important person in countries like UK, Sweden, Belgium, Spain?

Uber did what? Blocking BitcoinBuilder (BB) made on-boarding easier for someone?
BB had a Business account with Uber. Users paid BB. BB paid Uber in bulk, with bulk discounts. And it was surely a TOS violation. Still, Uber could've just raised the fees and let it continue instead of blocking.

Do Uber take cash? At least the reservation through the app probably demand a credit card, and Xapo is one of the cheapest ways for an argentinean citizen to get a card that their government can't block.

you don't understand it =&gt; it must be malice / evil intentions? Or are you just sayning that to try and force someone to explain this to you? :)
Bitcoin transactions are made by sticking together small pieces (commands). The idea mentioned may be inspired by coinjoin and lightning network constructions, if you've looked into how that works?
If the payer shows his keys to the recipient, they can verify when the transaction gets mined. The recipient can probably then also decide on their own how many blocks they wait before revealing the keys and be able to re-spend the recieved coins.
But similar to how anonymous prepaid VISA/mastercard are targeted to be blocked/forbidden in some places, there will surely still be ways for miners/China gov't to censor or at least delay transactions that they can not verify and approve of.

don't curse
LN doesn't do freezes, has no customer support that give out a random template answer without reading your question, doesn't "keep your wallet safe" so you don't by mistake donate to Wikileaks, doesn't lock received funds for months to ensure you don't spend it all too quickly, etc.
So if PayPal 2.0 does what LN does, I'd pay a monthly fee to use it. I could pay them more than what I currently pay in monthly fees to old school banks.

think incentives. The block reward pays for mining electricity and internet bandwidth to serve copies of the blockchain. Central control could be added in many ways. Maybe DC++/napster style centrally controlled (filtered) hubs that fores miners to follow the rules. More efficient, but adds single point of failure which means risk of costs. Something like this would be useful to see the ratio of merchants who prefer fluid 24/7 regular bitcoin vs a centrally controlled currency that is unavailable at some known and unknown times. I'd support everything that forces old banks to evolve.

@_date: 2015-02-26 07:12:30
well, whoever you're sending money to, if they don't (want to) know how to handle bitcoin just send it via some bit-to-bank gateway. Cashila works for me to pay bills and to fill up some prepaid CCs too &gt;;-&gt;. But: check your CC for fees etc. Some banks/cards take some 10$ or €6 fee just to process incoming fill-ups. Remember to mention this to whomever you send money to and nudge them towards less bankster-y cards.

hey, if you give me 8GB blocks, can I store and notarize my heartbeat on your blockchain?
You agree fees must be locked low, right? $0.01? At 1 tx/min I'd pay over $14.40/day. Do I get a fee discount?
8GB is plenty of space. Assuming average tx size 256b means the blockchain supports 21000 heartbeat trackers. So 8GB is enough for one or two startups storing their glorious data on the blockchain.
tl;dr Bigger blocks without purging is a very shitty idea.

Hey, is the Karpeles trials concluded yet? Ulbricht appeal finished? Heresy to teach teach hearsay. Not sure how much is worth to say, in the long run, about bitcoin.
Earth: mostly harmless.
Bitcoin: the first decentralized electronic currency, before intergalactic ones were invented. Big money attracted big con artists and dubious business proposals. See also: ponzi.
Bitcoin: quite decentralised almost-currency. (Think Alpaca socks, not pizzas or coffee.)

Did you read and understand the question above? Because I've seen reports of some virtual cards being usable in Google Wallet. Maybe it was all a mistake and quickly blocked, but someone with more knowledge of how Visa / Mastercard track virtual cards, prepaid cards and credit cards and how the "authorizations" work with regard to Android Pay, Alipay and all those others, would be nice.
I'm also sure I've seen bitcoin cards that can be linked with Paypal (paying, but not withdrawing from paypal) so there may be physical stores taking paypal, and you have your virtual or almost virtual card get charged while paying in-store via your paypal app.
Or we just take your copy&amp;paste answer / word for truth, and just wait for Plutus.it to roll out their NFC payment solution. I thought it was built as  BTC -&gt; virtual card -&gt; NFC payment via the normal standards

1. Load Xapo with bitcoin
2. spend using this card when bitcoin price is up
3. spend using non-bitcoin card buy more bitcoin when price is down
4. profit!
If you use the xapo card for less trustable merchants, maybe use their vault service to effectively limit how much a merchant can charge you.
Convenient and cheap enough alternative to old school banks.

so, 8GB blocks and dynamic fees? Let orphaning and disk space solve itself?
That may actually not crash and burn.
Assuming compact blocks / XThin is used and/or fees succed to go up to when blocks get closer to 8GB.
Though any new full nodes could not be p2p bootstrapped anymore. Either you'll need a bunch of fast CPUs and a copy of the blockchain on SSDs you can physically connect to bootstrap, or you don't do full nodes, copy&amp;paste the UTXO from some other node (preferablye a chinese one?), go SPV,  and just skip verifying the chain.
