There's so many competing sites now, some even use multi sig wallets so that the markets cannot steal funds and vendors can withdraw funds even if the site closes down. I don't order much but it certainly is an interesting scene to follow even just for the drama lol. Will be interesting to see where that industry goes but in terms of bitcoin it is probably a drop in the ocean compared to the rest of bitcoin transactions.

As long as you set a high fee...

I think a lot of the frustration and bitching is because bitcoin doesnt have to have high fees. It's supposed to have an edge on paypal transactions....    
    
But we cant talk about that here...

Id say a lot of transactions are less than $5. Particuarly in LEDCs  where bitcoin has a lot of potential.  The point is the fees dont have to be high bitcoin has the potential to work without high fees or slow speeds

Its not. Its a crime to receive drugs that you ordered or knew about it. You're right though am just nitpicking. If you receive drugs in the mail that you didn't know about its not a crime though as you have no control over someone that wants to send you drugs.

It is not a crime to receive drugs in the mail. If I mail some heroin to your door and it is intercepted will you go to jail? The users have deniability and for personal amounts police will not even bother combing their pcs. At most users receive a letter or a knock on the door with the police trying to get you to admit you had knowledge of the parcel. Otherwise anyone could get their enemy in prison just by mailing drugs to them. In this regard it is actually less risky than traditional drug buying.

Is bitcoin doomed to failure as a global currency because of this factor?
