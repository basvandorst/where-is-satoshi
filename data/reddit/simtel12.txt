CGT goes from when you purchased the asset until when you sell it.  
In your second scenario (spending at 1200 and buying at 1205), the spend closes the CGT transaction and you'll owe CGT on the gain that was realized by selling.  This transaction was started when you first bought that BTC.
The buy at 1205 starts a new CGT transaction that will not own CGT until you spend it.
* 15:00, 14 August, 2012 - Buy 1 BTC in 2012 for $14.
* 12:00, 25 March, 2014 - Purchase something online for 1 BTC ($587)
* 12:05, 25 March, 2014 - Buy 1 BTC for $587
CGT will be owed for the $14 -&gt; $587 gain.

As I understand it, no - since you can argue that the "something purchased online" was purchased with the BTC you just acquired and not the one you bought 2 years ago.

I think it was a joke about how the horrified people actually had an accurate assumption.

No, people complain about billionaires dodging taxes because they can't figure out how to do the same thing.

What is the "Federal Bitcoin Reserve"?

As long as something is valued, it will be collected by a few.  Things are "valuable" because people _don't_ have much of it but want more.  Whether these are dollars, bitcoins, grain or cows is immaterial.  All of these things have been used as a medium of exchange (ie, "money") and you will never be free from the exchange of goods (some of which are more "valuable" than others) even if you become a warlord in a mad-max style distopia where you can take anything that you fancy.
The trick is to make people want to trade their valuable things [bitcoins] for other valuable things [goods and services].

Not necessarily. They'd keep the account in USD and allow you to settle it with bitcoins at the spot price.

Suggestion: add a sort option for release date. I tend to want to see the more recent stuff first.  Otherwise, I can't wait until you can ship to the US!

There was at least one purchase of 940+ btc.  So yeah, I think so.  :)

Yes, but at least with Electrum the "change" is the entire remainder of that address.  So even if you only send 1 btc out of an address that has 30btc, the remaining 29btc will be moved to a change address.

50BTC has been treating me well.

It'd be interesting to see a similar thing for Satoshi Circle.

People have to want to use it more as a medium of exchange than of investment. As long as people think that it's going to make large short-term jumps they will hoard it and panic at the first down trend.

It's not about whether they'd win, but how much of a burden they would be to the vendors who accept bitcoin and the community at large.
Defending yourself from litigation is annoyingly expensive.
