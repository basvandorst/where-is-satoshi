Hey OP, what about all you bag hodlers sell it in once, make the price drop to oblivion , so we'll all buy in for super "cheap". 
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:39:28
Just like in the Middle Ages ��
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:02:09
Not a fan, just throwing it into the mix for the sake of this convo. Anyhow, from my experience, it looks like there are 7 billion opinions about Bitcoin and what Bitcoin is. I find discussing about crypto a highly subjective matter every damn time. It’s kinda interesting �� 
Also be aware that this sub is very much cult-driven and censorship friendly. That already defeats the whole marketing positioning of Bitcoin (free and censorship resistant, and what not).
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:11:48
Their website literally looks like an online casino. Like, "sign up your granma and get 90% off the fees. Exchange the rulette numbers". 
No wonders they are "based" in the gambling island republic of Malta.
@_date: 2019-11-09 07:31:34
It’s about value for the buyer, right. Using the banana argument you mentioned, indeed, both cases are useless regarding value. Why would that matter, to me or you, how much energy someone spends for anything? 
Have you ever worked for calories/Kj burnt per hour? ��
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:33:15
You see, you’ve spent some time and energy brainwashing me with your lengthy and detailed answers, yet no one would care ��‍♂️ but kudos to you, anyhow.
Crypto ppl always bend reality and bastardize economy theories with the changing wind direction �� 
Also there is an added value theory ��
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:43:34
That’s some weird ass economy right there. So it’s a product now? And then we got the shitcoins...�� and I’m pretty sure you’re getting paid for your time, not energy. ��
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:33:58
Cause it’s the “internet of money” ��
Imagine a bank doing this; global meltdown inevitable.
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:00:58
What did you expect?  “The future of money” is a marketing term, not literal. 
Try r/buttcoin. The sub always helps... by prevention 
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:26:12
Yep, guys like this are bringing down the global financial system. Better watch out. :D
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:17:53
Why wait? Bet all your bitcoins on one particular number in any Bitcoin available casino, and it's 36x now or 0. No need to nerve over this :)
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:45:09
Go to your backyard and start digging a giant hole. Use only the shovel. Let’s say 5x5x5 meters. 
I bet you would use a lot of energy and there would be only one such a hole in the whole world. 
How much would it be worth to anyone? Really. ��

Sometimes high Tx fees do occur during peak hours. Wait few hours or try the next morning with less "traffic" ;)

Reach out to Bitcoin's PR: mister u/andreasma (Twitter:  He got answers for anything related to the currency of the future. A simple concept of retrievable funds shouldn't be a problem in the modern, Internet age. Right?
@_date: 2019-04-26 12:39:24
Great customer service! ��
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:43:52
Oh yeah, you think it can't happen to you, don't ya?
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:45:56
Don’t you worry your pretty little head. This is just a foreword. A set up before you even “use” it. The currency of the future is a much deeper rabbit hole. Eventually, everyone will lose their coins in one way or another. 
Be your own bank where no one guarantees anything ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:23
Still ppl not getting it, huh. 
Banks don't care about bitcoin cause they can easily create their own crypto. 
When countries will issue their own cryptocurrencies, right there in that moment, Bitcoin and other altcoins will perish into oblivion, or stay a "Monopoly" money (crypto), or hodling BTC will become a crime (since only dark web will be accepting btc and altcoins).  
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:00:41
Bags are getting heavy ... the crazier the prediction, the bigger desperation to recruit new bag holders. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:33:20
But where are the coins at, now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:08:34
Lol. You don't buy them, you'll get them. Well, for starters, avoiding massive corruption in the government spending, tax checks, general bookkeeping of nations accounts? Etc. 
Don't  be naive, no county will allow some random cryptocurrency to overtake "the system ". That's just a child's dream of bitcoin fanatics (not enthusiast). All crypto will go eventually to zero point nothing. Shady practices around crypto grow exponentially these day. How long you think it can withstand? 
If we talk about tokens, they will be of course utilized within apps, 
So why do YOU own crypto? 
Just don't tell me for the "investment" or I'm gonna shit myself. Or " I like its privacy and anonymity features" like some creep. lol. 
Again, it brings me to my point of national crypto: no double-spending. That's why Bitcoin was created in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:38:08
It was announced but it's live now. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:47:00
How come? It works on mine, in chrome and safari as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:53:30
If no one sells, no one buys = BTC has no value. 
If less ppl sell, less ppl buy = market gets manipulated even more. Why? Cause only 10% of bitcoin is currently trading, That means that market is already being easily manipulated by big players and bots. 
Hence, Hodlers are vitally contributing to this manipulation and mayhem. But they just don't  have a slightest clue. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:09:51
BTC/EUR for now. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:33:01
What is this for a demented reasoning? Why do you want me to gamble my money? 
Try to create a real value instead, for people, community, country. And not try to become "a Lambo owner" by doing absolutely nothing for it. That's what this is all about: "Free money", until one day people sober up. 
Bitcoin doesn't contribute anything anymore, doesn't service anything (except laundering), doesn't contribute to societal good or well-being. It doesn't make one's life easier, nor cures diseases. 
It was once a great idea until it became a joke. 
It is a delusion based on the value the next fool is ready to pay.
I know all about Bitcoin, that's why I CAN see the forest for the trees. Now it's your turn. What is the f*cking value of BTC? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:17:25
1. it's a matter of economic incentive. 
2. so what you're saying is that the pyramid has a huge base now. Hate to break it to you, but once upon a time, btc was also only the tip of the pyramid :)

That's exactly what I would write to you to sell you my shitcoin. :)
Crypto doesn't fix the "human nature" in us. 
Guess I'm more cyberpunk than cypherpunk.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:52:32
That was his point: "At the end of the day..."
It's like paying in shop via a point-of-sale bitcoin device. You'd pay BTC but they receive USD immediately converted at the spot. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:43:34
Oh, and they also discussed the obvious: "Buttcoin is a solution looking for a problem" and "FED issued crypto in the future instead".
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:16:43
Blah, blah, blah. The shiller in chief in action.
 
Of course, IT IS ONLY ABOUT THE PRICE. Value out of thin air. Since the beginning, it was about recruiting more suckers into the Scheme. 
Andreas wants farmers in central Uganda and Kongo to use the fucking Bitcoin. In countries where tribes killing each other just because, muh, different tribe. Imagine if they'd know that "the others" have BTC :/
Bank the unbanked. Fill my pockets, bagholders! 
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:50:16
The same people who disagreed with Ver &amp; Co will one day change their minds regarding changing the Core code. It's not immutable, damn not even decentralized. It's a mass delusion scheme. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:26:32
Obviously critical thinking is. 
Also, penguins and vanilla. 
Guess which one you can copy paste? Guess which one can be change easily in the code from 21 mil to eternity? 
I can create a pseudonym and copy the Bitcoin exactly as it is. With the "scarce" supply of 21 mil. Let's call it Bitcoin 2. 
And you too, and everyone in this sub. 
Would you buy it for 1 cent a pop with a premise that it will be 5k in a year? No? Why not?  It'd be exactly the same. 
Btc is not patented, it's not governed. The downside of it is that it can be replicated to eternity.  Code can be rewritten. Andreas never mentions it.  So what's the fucking value in it? Exactly zero point nothing. 
It's a delusion. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:27:58
Crypto is reinventing centuries old scams, frauds, schemes, and corruption camouflage. ...So much for the anarchy. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:48:12
You may pay in crypto but the state converts them immediately into USD. It's not like the state has a bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:34:09
You mean like dozens of available digital fiat payment solutions nowadays? With this revolutionary option to reverse the transaction if something's goes bad? 
One day, when you take your money seriously, you'll discover that those "advantages" you listed are nonsense nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:27:22
Still pushing that "currency" fairytale? It's become a global hodl meme with every one waiting for 100k price tag so they can cash out into dirty fiat.  Institutions are in it to make money on suckers, not to change the world. 
Asians understand that crypto is about making Nx on the investments. It's their gambling nature. 
West world still has the need to exercise their  will to change the world. Hence the bullshit we keep hearing everywhere. 
When did you use btc as a currency lately? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:59:34
The fact that you're using the word "investing" into BTC is already telling. How can that not be ONLY about the price? 
Actually, couple of years ago, I gave some BTC to dozens of friends, for free, under the condition that they will use it in real life/buy something for it. 
What did you do for BTC besides shilling it? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:36:40
Exactly. It's an economic incentive. Without a price, there are no miners. Therefore, it's all about the price. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:59:21

When something is open source, it's not unique, is it? :)
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:05:14
It is a scheme when it doesn't have anything except a promise of raising in value based on the next greater fool. Like credit swaps or blind bonds in the 80's. People believed in great returns based on ...well, on nothing really. What could go wrong. 
Stock and assets have value backed by products, services, soil, or people.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:38:42
Back then, when you played with your stuffed animals and didn't even know what FED is, I bought it ridiculously cheap and actually USED IT. I was/am a punk/anarchist. And then ppl like this shiller changed it to a pyramid scheme for suckers. 
Lol, this anti-establishment PR has gotten y'all well! :D
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:21:13
I see Andreas brainwashed you well. But he didn't mention that, nowadays, 99% of crypto is outright fraud. Is that also the case with your fiat? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:53:00
ignorance? are you sure it's ignorance? 
There was a time when they said: "Nobody would buy shit like Bitcoin"... aaaand voila! 
You sure it's about that copy-pastable tech? 
Maybe you think it's about the wide-spread pyramid bottom (a.k.a. "community")
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:40:11
Lol, of course they can change the supply to eternity. Its a piece of code. All you need is the consensus among the few. Who is brainwashing you people so much? Andreas?
