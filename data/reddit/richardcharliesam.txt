The risk, as you should know by now, is HUGE within the exchanges. Due to the definite risk within those exchanges, you will see more and more concern amongst potential new BTC buyers, which in turn will produce less interest. Risk is always there. Do you think people who just lost huge with Gox are going to be eager to reinvest in BTC?
You probably also don't think the "bubble" graph applies to bitcoin either...

I agree. But not all newcomers know that, nor do the traders as they seem to be the biggest losers in the gox collapse. 
As for the $600+ coins, I would agree that it is certainly probable, but you never know. Gox is done, so a lot of the recent volatility (in the last couple of weeks) was based off of Gox speculation. With that now gone, I could see it sinking a good bit more first.

ouch. I thought my 542.86 was shitty.

The US government has recently mentioned that laundering laws apply to bitcoin. Pretty sure that validates bitcoin even further. :)

Showing my transaction record on the 18th (on bitfloor) for my transfer out, but nothing has shown in my bofa account yet. 
I am definitely concerned that if that particular transaction is not cleared on the bank end (and he already had a check issued for his accounts funds) that I am not going to be seeing my money back. Mostly due to the fact that my bitfloor account currently says .0038 avail USD. 
edit- I have also sent off 3 emails with no response from bitfloor. I understand that they likely have thousands of emails in their inbox, but still, it would be nice to get a response.

Best thing? Not too sure that these last two days will be viewed as a good thing. When mtgox begins trading again, it's going to be a slaughter. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:13:47
Received mine as well. Finally. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:18:26
Hope so. I actually just re-requested it as it was still showing the funds as available. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:03:58
Fuuuuuuck, I just requested my withdrawal yesterday. Wow. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:22:51
Do you only make posts like this? Two months ago, you were begging for pizza and money for food, while also looking to buy a $600 gaming PC
@_date: 2013-08-02 16:01:57
Nope. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:40:31
Of course, but the investors are what is driving these drastic price fluctuations. Mainstream adoption has an effect, and hopefully that raises the "bottom". If the price were based off of adoption, it would be a much more steady increase and not the monstrous spikes that investors cause.

I too have some money in bitfloor, I am still cautiously optimistic that  we will get our money back. Given the (assumed) circumstances of the account closure, the lag is fairly understandable. The dogshit updates from bitfloor and zero response over email is completely unacceptable. How hard is it to send a bulk email out...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:43:42
So you just made an account to tell everyone it's going to crash?

Click the 69 on BTC-E.

Audenx, thank you so much for your continued updates. Roman's lack of communication was really shitty and I really hope he thanked you or showed appreciation for your work in this. Granted Roman did give relevant info only, but some kind of personal communication really would have helped ease fears that his customers may have had. 
Hopefully everyone's deposits come in a timely fashion. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:02:14
Neat game, I could see people playing it. An ace showed up when I picked higher than four. I was sad. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:43:28
You didn't read his post. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:47:57
I am calling complete and utter bullshit on this story. Due to the time posted and the sob stories contained within, I am guessing that you had hopes of a certain generous user to pop in and drop a monster tip on you. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:41:57
Apologies then, there has been an influx of beggars and I mistakenly assumed you to be one as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:02:01
Looks like my withdrawal got bounced back. I now show my money back in bitfloor on hold. Shit. Well, here's to hoping that Roman will do the right thing. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:18:21
I will keep my fingers crossed for you. 
At least you got a response. Given the abrupt closing of the account, perhaps there is a bit more scrutiny on outgoing funds which could lead to some lag. We'll see. I will update you if I get my funds. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:33:32
Why hasn't anyone mentioned bitfloor yet?

It definitely adds to the value, the fluctuations are abnormal, which is where the bubble speculation comes in to effect. 
US government talk is really nothing that is different from what they have mentioned in the past. Bringing in educated people on the subject is promising, but on the other hand, they are likely just looking to regulate and find a way to tax it. 
As for the end user, the one who will spend and spread bitcoin, that person would want a stable price, who wants to spend something that can go up or down $300 in a day? These fluctuations will prevent the consumer from spending BTC. 
Don't mistake the Chinese users solely as consumers, they're trading too. 
Now that professional investors are likely getting more involved, market manipulation will be exploited as well. (Yesterday's $300 drop and the immediate $200 rebound)
I want bitcoin to succeed. Stable growth is a key to it's long term success. Either way, exciting times ahead. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:33:52
Seriously. It sort of makes sense if you consider the MTGox queue, just more buyers pouring in, but once that queue starts dwindling, look out below.

While Bitcoin is very different from a stock, the people that trade stocks are what make up the graph.
If people trade it as an investment, the graph is an accurate depiction, whether it be a stock, gold, bitcoin, or dogshit.

Paddle shift. Most supercars have gone this route.

If you think about it from a believer's standpoint, yes. An investor who doesn't necessarily care about bitcoin will only be in it for a quick buck. People are buying and people are selling, that is currently what is driving the market. Pre-cyprus news, it was at a high of 70 something, it got attention of those not in the know took notice. I am hoping it continues to soar, but would not be surprised in the least if it comes back down.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:48:36
I will certainly make it right if that happens. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:30:35
If that were the case, couldn't his lawyer just put it in his escrow account and distribute from there? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:02:49
Go away. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:50:34
Do you even math, bro?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:05:34
Let them all sell (understandably so in many cases) and let the price tank, then buy more.
