Well done guys this is very positive for everyone!
Must have been hard communication, language barrier is still an issue and maybe need to implement in future meetings live translation etc

They always say where the money ends up. 
With bitcoin's public ledger, anyone can just have a look and be sure the charity's owner is not taking the money just for himself, or not going to fund terror etc etc.

I know how to recognize a good penny stock :)
And I said reddit message spam because I received 3 well made messages out of the blue basically telling me to buy eth.
They were well made. I bought at 1, and I sold 90% already and the rest will sit probably for ever.

If their concern is about the track and trace.. tell them there is already a track and trace system, an inefficient one that is only the power of the government.
Bitcoin has a public track and trace. You can check it yourself!  No more embezzlement. No more tax evasion. No more corruption.

There is only one blockchain, and it's the bitcoin blockchain.
All the others only fit on a fancy powerpoint tailored for a money-dumbed audience.

I checked your business website and I went to "services".
I was seriously expecting different services.
Have you tried, at least temporarily, having a different "theme" that would make absolutely no confusion with some escort services?
If you have ever booked escorts online you will even find the theme familiar.
Also, KYC is not "boring stuff". Ok, it is, but maybe not hint that to the people specialised in dealing with KYC don't like being reminded that.
They might also think someone who finds it boring might not be serious about it.
I wish you luck but I still find you are giving us the full stereotype, because that's so much drama, come on 35 banks...
But keep it going, because cleavage.
ps: "You couldn't afford me..." you say. I'm from Whalepool. Tell me your price.

Bitcoin's blockchain is for money.
Ethereum's blockchain's is for playing pong in a geeky hipster way.
