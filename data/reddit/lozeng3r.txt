And memes. HODL memes spammed everywhere. This place is the worst at times like this.

It's posts like this that make it impossible for me to take anyone on this sub seriously. Endless memes, jokes and posts shouting about how much better people are than the new visitors. Grow up.

Tried the support number but had no luck, might give tweeting them a go!

Except from the fact that every now and then Coinbase/GDAX randomly stop you from being able to sign in and disable your account. Mine was only just opened on December 4th, verified my ID and then was closed the next day. Thank god I didn't get round to depositing money, because their support is just nonexistent...1 week and counting with no reply.
And this is happening to countless people on so I would not recommend them right now unless you're happy with having assets stuck in your account and no way to access them. Not to mention the other issues people are reporting- seriously just have a quick look at the sub first if you are considering it.

Not sure really, I used bitpanda briefly but fees seem quite high. Just about to try using Gemini.

Yes, it is the Internet, and there should be plenty of room for actual discussion too. Just look at the top posts today... 'hodl on', 'quick grab the offer', 'bitcoin today', 'who would win'. Gifs and memes everywhere.
I'm just saying dips like this are a confusing time for some people, and everyone's just joking around.

I've owned bitcoin for several months, and how very mature. You're only proving my point.

These people annoy me so much. LOOK HOW EXPERIENCED AND SUPERIOR I AM.
People sometimes make bad decisions, no need to kick them while they're down.
