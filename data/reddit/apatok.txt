@_date: 2018-10-11 20:04:52

@_date: 2018-06-09 09:21:29
Theres a stadium for 10.000 person in Kisvarda. 2000 person lives in that village
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:01:35
so you used it on darkweb?  Sorry but I really don't get it why anybody is using bitcoin instead of fiat, for buying stuff online. Yeah it's a really interesting technology, but I try to understand why people put their money into cryptos if they don't really want to get richer .
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:58:34
its in a flower shop! yeah it accept cash
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:16:36
everybody who is here only for the technology is a liar. Why anybody put money into a technology that could make loss?
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:14:16
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:47:57

Beautiful, I would never pay that
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:16:58
In Hungary I could easily have a HODL or BTC plate because, it would be 10+ years when people realise crypto is a thing 
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:05:40
It's a beautiful country with terrible politics and wages. 30% tax after crypto is a fuckin steal
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:09:54
