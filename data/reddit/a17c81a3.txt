Shit and now the Bitcoin ETF was cancelled too. This is all because of Roger Ver's FUD campaign.

Sounds like you're saying people only look for the word 'Bitcoin' and don't understand anything?

I have never seen anyone like S2X. Seems to me it was some back room deal.
I'm not sure killing S2X will help you guys stay in control of Bitcoin though.

Fail train  is worth 6 billion dollars. Good start I say.

If we are talking technology there are a lot of alts already much more advanced.
All Bitcoin has now is name recognition and for better or worse I think it is being blown to pieces.

Yeah I will leave you alone now. Really good luck.

Because if you make a law that destroys the constitution of the nation and call it "the patriot act" people will blindly allow it.
Blockstream captured the word "Bitcoin" and now in similar fashion people are blindly following.

It would depend on whether that actor supported the core team or not ;)

Not exactly saying you are wrong, because it is hard to understand their insanity, but:
  


Negative yields in banks could be done easily by just charging for holding the money, but people would just take out their money.
I think what they mean is they want to have negative interest rates, but in such a way that people cannot opt out.
They could also only deposit say 90$ to your account when you came in with 100$ in cash. That is another way to do it which may fit their word use of "decoupling" better.

The way to do something like this would be to print electronic money and put it into people's bank accounts as high interest.  
This way holding cash becomes worse. Imagine having 10% yearly interest in your bank for example. Many would be tempted to ditch cash.  
Printing this money will cause extra inflation, but this extra inflation will primarily be felt by cash holders.  
The goal is total control which you can't have with anonymous cash.  
There are many side "benefits" to such a plan like forcing banks you don't like out of business for not having the extra rate and taxing the fake interest rates.

You should never let people down.

I have to hand it to this sub; you make some good memes. The third cart should be from 2017/2018 with a car in it though.

Cheer up, people are scavenging trash in Venezuela.
(Also maybe consider just saving in physical gold and silver for your retirement - even you shouldn't be able to mess that up)
