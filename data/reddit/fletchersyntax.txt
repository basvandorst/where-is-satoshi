Don't you think that's kind of a short sighted view? What happens when the general public sees BTC price start to rise? Regardless of it siphoning off the alts or not... money will start to roll in. I've been rolling usd back into bitcoin weekly and I'm sure tons of other people are as well.

This is a good read.

You should proofread your ill thought out propaganda posts.

Solid write up. Fun read. I like your stuff.

If your net worth is $400. There are still a lot of smart, poor people out there in the world. Usually, they're not poor for long.

But I feel like the point here is we have to make steps towards not having to convert back to fiat. If we all just draw a line in the sand and say "well it's all just a payment method for fiat so why bother using it" then we step away from the very point of its creation and away from the end goal of controlling our own money. I say pay the fee, replace the coin, lose a few dollars here and there, it will be worth it in the long run. Think about the Boston Tea Party. We had to dump some tea to make the point.

10% content, 90% ads bordering on porn. Seems legit.

Missed the famous quote from Bill Gates about how the Internet would never take off.

I'm not saying op is wrong, I'm saying it's pedestrian. Everyone already knows why the market is dropping. This post has about as much worth as me saying "it's light outside because the sun came up". It's just a waste of time and energy.

Weather I make a boat load of money this year or this turns into a retirement fund makes little difference to me any more. One thing it seems we all can agree on is that it will return, so I'm gonna keep buying in.

Totally still works. I wonder if I start causally using it if people with adopt this. Hahaha.

This might be the most pointless post I've ever read.

I love when these gloom and doom types who have no clue what they are talking about scream "sell while you still can"... Then 8 hours go by.... And look at the price.

I kind of like Sparc though.

Did anyone else notice they say "Robinhood can monitor and track market data for 16 cryptocurrencies"? I'm only seeing BTC and ETH. Am I missing something here? Perhaps I'm not reading this correctly?

Can coins be transferred out to a wallet/exchange? What are the costs of withdrawal? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:12:33
Thanks for clearing that up. Also, I think that bot got an attitude with you.

I'm always looking for something better than coinbase. I really like gemini but the wait to be verified seems endless.

That's absurd. I noticed they didn't actually explain why they closed your account in that letter. Would have been cooler if they did. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:38:18
That is some solid TA.

BitUniverse is hands down the best portfolio app.
