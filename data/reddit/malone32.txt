No, definitely not. I guess it's either heavy overload for them since everybody wants to buy with cash or they just stopped it for some reason. 
Just waiting if somebody tried it now.

No, it was cex problem or they simply disabled it, who knows. Guy above says it's working again but I can't check on mobile cause of ccv. I checked with other people and nobody could deposit which sucks since people couldn't buy dip. Btw don't deposit big amount at once, while searching about this problem, I found some people complaining they wait for deposit or withdrawal for month and more. 
Edit: Still not working.

Nice to hear, I checked with more people last night and nobody could deposit.

I tried now, still not working.

What you want to do is not investment but taking a risk.

Why bitcoin then and not some other, new crypto. What guarantees you it will be bitcoin? Real gold can't become silver or iron by time.

Just another mtgox scenario and here we go back to 1k lol

But make sure to sell on time and send money to your bank account before bubble bursts. Good luck

I got a feeling bitcoin owners live in their own world. That's why they think bitcoin generates value with deflation just like that. Like other people from outside will come and buy their bitcoin for 1 million each. It may work for a while but then, bubble will pop.

True but this is used all the time in media to hype population about bitcoin. That's actually cheese they put on mouse trap for people that don't take time to educate or are too greedy. No sane person should buy bitcoin now at 13k just for saving it, but people buy. There is no real reason bitcoin should sky rocket this much, at least nothing we know.

Or it could not. Price multiplied so many times that now it's just a gamble. Not like you throw in few hundreds, let's say even thousands and what happens, happens. 
Now people persuade others to invest and spend tens of thousands. People are selling cars, houses, everything they have some value to invest in bitcoin while it's 16k. 
This is not investment, this is gambling.

Exchanges can rig the price by buying btc from people, with money from other people. Then price goes up, as it does, people get excited, "invest" more cash to get profit, more people joins. But guess what, at one point it will stop, no need anything bad happens, just people will lose interest. Price will drop faster than it went up and they will have no time to exit, unlike people who started all this.
When I say this to people, I get laughed. Yes, many got great profit but it's late now, risk is too high.

This lambo costs 200k so he sold btc at 5k.

I could deposit again now.

I feel people are burnt a bit. Initial hype is gone. It's hard to make people open their wallets twice in a row in so short period of time. All those whales will push it with their own money, only if there is enough fuel in sheep to buy high.

Thanks, it was solved yesterday at 15h, I could deposit more and then at 21h I deposited a bit more and got the same card rejection again. Yesterday I deposited less than 2 days ago. 
I read they let new users register yesterday so I thought it's up to that but looks like it's something else. I'm waiting 21h today to see if I will be able to deposit again after a full day from my last successful deposit. 
My bank says nothing wrong from their side. No limits broken neither on visa card nor cex. 
I'm fine if it's letting me deposit every day a bit. I can get a new visa or master card later if it stops completely but I hope it will work again.
