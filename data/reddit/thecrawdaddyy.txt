Love my Ethereum and love my Bitcoin. They currently and always will have their own bifurcated market niches. You could see Ethereum as stealing Bitcoin's market cap now, but at the same time, anyone could make the argument that Ethereum is simultaneously growing Bitcoin's market cap in the long and short term by increasing awareness of blockchain technology and crypto assets' market cap as a whole. 
Bitcoin (like any company or commodity that holds value), will always have a competitor if it is going to increase that value sustainable. In this case Ethereum is a pretty lucky option for Bitcoin. I wouldn't spend so much time complaining about a competitor (needed) that fills a separate niche, yet raises adoption (not such a bad deal). 
Look, my 'coding' is limited to mediocre SQL queries and I am still trying to wrap my head around the moving pieces within a blockchain. For all I know, there could be faulty code embedded in Ethereum, but can you honestly look at the list of members of the EEA, the capital, the time that is being invested into developing solutions around the technology and tell me that those companies are getting scammed by Microsoft?? 
Really dude?
I know that there is hate from both side of the line of scrimmage and I get that. What I do not understand is how destructive I have found the dialogue to be from both teams. 
Bitcoin needs a competitor. With time, one day that competitor will be fiat currencies, gold, silver, etc. The adoption level is not there yet and the market is not stable enough to really have that conversation right now, but that is okay. Until that time, it needs a competitor within the same market (or technology). 
Bitcoin has many obstacles that it will have to overcome - Ethereum is not what you should be focusing on right now. Please get over it

I saw something about this on the ethtrader thread also, where Kraken emailed him/her about issues that they were having with their payment provider. 
At the time, I had all of coin in Kraken, but have since moved it to a Trezor wallet and figure I would use set up an account on a separate If I needed to withdraw to USD.

True, I have never had too much luck in the past trying to trade it. Understand people do successful though

Depending on how many coins were in that wallet, I would be at the dump covered in trash right now

Do different alt coins take different GPU's? If I were to set up a mine for Bitcoin or Eth and realized I couldn't do it profitably with Bitcoin or hit the Ice Age with Eth, would it be possible to use the same rig to mine a different coin?

I don't really understand the advantages of using Coinbase over other exchanges. Seems to always crash on high volume days and the fees are crazy. Not talking shit, just curious

Jeez, when will it stop?? told myself to look away and check back at the end of the day, but it is like a train wreck - I can't stop watching the carnage

I think he jerseybrogrammer was being sarcastic (hints the time not being valuable) part

Thank you very much for your reply. A lot of info out there, which also means a lot of info for a notice to try to wrap his head around. much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:21:54
Well... Shit
Respect man

Agreed! I have lost too many coins trying to trade these dips. The overall upward trend is too strong to predict when it is going bounce back up. I've learned my lesson

Thanks Hodlemort. My Wallet and ego are still recovering from the damage that the long horns of the bull did to them

Could you make money on a $2-4k budget for a miner? Have always been interested and think it would be fun to do, but literally know nothing about it...

I think you know what I am asking. grow up

So I may or may not have gotten into bitcoin originally through impatience with how long it would take to get my money out of an online gambling site and realized transferring the USD to a bitcoin wallet would be the quickest approach. Saw ETH as an option so I decided to throw some coins in there thinking maybe one day it would take off and I have ~200 coins that are actually worth something significant. I at some point I got figured with all of the money I was making on Bitcoin, I would be better off putting all of my eggs in the BTC basket. Of course I went on vacation that next week and it wasn't until a few weeks later when I realized that the Eth I had abandoned took off in that time frame. Put some more money in to get back into Eth, but boy were those coins more expensive than when I had bought them only a month or so before. Lesson learned - I like having both

It was not a very fun lesson to learn
