There are some types of people who don't care much why something was created but care more about what something can do to fill their needs.

This is seriously pissing me the fuck off.
I mean, I'm not in it for the investment. I'm one of those "believers" who just want to use it instead of USD. But I know I can get one hell of a hefty bonus by buying when it's low. I wanted to buy at $300, then at $250, and then at $200. Now it's going up as I thought.
But I'm poor as shit. I'm making good money, but I'm still paying off my credit cards and I have no emergency fund.
I didn't miss this because I was ignorant. Only that I'm still changing from Starbucks to an office job.
Watching the before, during, and after of this increase is a huge fucking tease.

Are they going to ban math too?

It was more of a first reaction than it was an analysis

Yep :) Thank you

Umm. You can put your bitcoin into physical form. It's not a product. You do it yourself. Buying a product is only for aesthetics but doesn't change the process, only adds to it.

There's probably a vocabulary word for that, but it's pointless to drool over what could have been.
You didn't know. Nobody could have known, even if they guessed it would be. Absolutely no way to know. You did fine trying your best to be responsible. What if you put it all in then it dropped? Be responsible. That's more important. Next time, say fuck it, I'll put in 25%. You won't get much of a gain, but it's still a great gain. If you lose, tough. Have to work a bit extra but at least you didn't lose too much.

I'll be happy if it just stays the same price without moving up or down. I don't want an investment - I want a better currency.

I told myself I will buy multiple integers of bitcoin the moment I got out of debt.
That was true.
But this is my punishment for not getting out of debt soon enough.

Some machines you can come out even so it can be fun to feel like Tony Stark with one hot spinning thing :)

What are the conventions for the project? I don't have time to contribute much, probably at all, but I'm curious and want to see what a cool community project does today.

So mining is just a program on a computer hacking another program? And the puzzles are so complicated that to get to the coins it will either take forever or you need to do full blast 100% processing on it?

If code is like sticks, a framework is sticks glued together. Since you shouldn't use a framework without knowing how to make it anyway, you can make you're own framework.
Identify why the other framework is better and see if you can take the lessons from that to work with what the project already has.
You don't need to make it all at once. You can just pick one corner/room and make it clean. Make sure to find out what breaks because it wasn't following modern concepts strictly before you try to be committed to any one solution.

Does it use regex or something similar?

To make it official and link it? They would need the API from reddit

Disclaimer: I'm sleepy and I'm about to pass out.
This sounds like this is the base, and other interfaces can use it.
Would all the different interfaces share the same stands/shops/businesses?
Do you support shared garage sales without the neighbors having to make a shared account (shared shop, but each product would go to a different account)?
Can you set it up to where you can split the profits? What if you and five other boat makers made a boat and wanted to split it evenly, do you support split profits?
Can gaming tournaments (or poker parties) use this to get a pool filled, then split the money with the help of a mod or trusted third party (tournaments would be good because you can mix monies, products, and services)?

Serious: You can give some to me.
$10,000 would go a long way in making my goals happen and more to come out of it. No matter what, I'll get there, but the sooner it happens, the more that will come out of it. I'm working to be a software developer. No promises, but I excel at everything so only good will come out of it.
I'm a slave to the world. I would not use it on luxuries.
Entirely different idea than what you're looking for, but this is honestly a good working solution for at least that much. Very self-centered, but the honest truth. I don't even need a specific amount. Any would do. I'm only spending time on reddit and not working on personal development, software, or my day to day job because my adhd medication hasn't kicked in yet, but it's about to in a minute so I'm off.
For specifics: Video games, education, fix slow processes like the line at the DMV. However much I can do. I'm starting out with automating as much as possible as I learn the best coding practices. Once I can write shit that maintains itself, I'll have very very extremely tiny programs that do very specific yet entirely generic jobs that work in any situation, and use those to build extremely fast and working systems that are easy to maintain across all projects because the reuse and automated updating when you update one program will be maxed. I'll also be taking advice from people who are smarter and more wise than me.
To close: I don't need your money. I'm a fucking boss and I'll rip through this world to get it all done. But if you want to help, I'm letting you know I exist.

If you're not retarded and don't give money to me, do the second paragraph from this guy.
