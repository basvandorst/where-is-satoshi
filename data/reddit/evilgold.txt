GPU mining alts is more profitable, but for it to be comparable you'd need a lot more GPUs. 1300watts worth of GPU miners would be at least 5 or 6 Cards and earn you about $8 a day. An S7 uses the same amount of power in a much smaller amount of space but would only earn around $3 a day right now. 
When you do account for power costs bitcoin mining just barely breaks even where as you'd still earn about $5 in profit mining Ethereum or some other coins after power.

It's a hell of a lot cheaper to exchange btc for xmr than it is to pay for btc mixing. only requires one transaction, and it doesn't take over an hour for xmr to be credited to a wallet on a market.  Also xmr is just generally more secure in most ways.

Coinbase has instant buys when you verify properly... if you can't be bothered to setup instant buying then you will have to wait. Hell you could have had your money (either in coinbase or refunded) by now if you had just done a standard buy order on the website using your bank account. $40k is a suspiciously large amount of money to send according to the US government who see anything over 10k as a red flag.  Your money is being held up because of regulations, they won't talk to you because of regulations that say they can't while it's being investigated.

Time and fees are what make it difficult. Sure everyone would love to do as you suggest but it takes having cash and btc ready to go, and youll have to wait for the btc to send from one exchange to the other. Price differences are usually in part due to how easy or difficult it is to get money in and out. If you but for usd and sell for euros then what? How much fees are you going to be paying before you actually have cash?
Go ahead and try it and report back.

You can try paxful or local bitcoins but most sellers will require at least a verified PayPal which I believe would require linking a bank to the PayPal first.

My main interest is something like shapeshift.io used to be but with no risk that they can hold my funds for whatever reason they make up. Personally I mostly want to convert into XMR and ETH.
 I've used wallets with shapeshift and changelly built in but I read all the time about those exchanges holding funds and demanding all kinds of info and ID before they will release any funds, even a refund, so I want to try and avoid them in the future. It seems like something decentralized (perhaps built into a multi-coin wallet like coinomi, jaxx or Exodus) would be ideal.

Google: Butterfly labs, KNC Miner , Cointerra (all mining hardware companies) + the word "lawsuit". You should get the idea. Basically companies will accept "pre-orders" then mine on the hardware themselves until its no longer profitable, THEN they ship to the customer. 
Bitmain and a few others don't do it that way and seem to run an honest business, they usually only deal in bulk orders tho so if you only want one or 2 miners you'll have to find a good re-seller.

Usd isn't required just something other than ETH tokens. 
Personally I'd like something like shapeshift.io but cheaper. They more or less instantly do the exchange and send the new coins to you. 
There isn't a way to go from even say BTC to LTC without giving an exchange at least temporary control. So do we just accept that or is something in the works to allow for exchanges where the user has full (or even partial) ownership of the keys?
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:05:25
That's not a transfer of Bitcoin it's a transfer of private keys. There could be many copies of that USB each with the same wallet and each capable of spending the coins. if the coins are in the same wallet then the original owner can still use them if he kept a copy (and moves them first).
This would be like if you opened a bank account by depositing cash and then gave someone a (possibly duplicate) ATM card and PIN to that account instead of just giving them cash or writing a check.
 The money hasn't moved and it would be incredibly foolish for a person to accept a USB stick with a wallet on it and not immiditly use it to send the coins to a new wallet that only the new owner controls the keys for.
This is not only a scam it's a bad one because they have no way of proving there was a payment. How is it any different if they claimed it was paid in cash in a bag? I'm not a lawyer but I don't think "you can't prove I didn't pay" is the same as proof that they paid. They should have sent the coins to an exchange then claimed the exchange address was the person/business receiving the payment and then withdrew the funds in a different currency so as to at least establish some trail and show the coins being moved.

It connects to a PC to sign the transactions doesn't it? So if the PC is compromised, the trezor is compromised... maybe it wont give away your private keys, maybe the data (ie what address to send to) gets manipulated on its way TO the trezor. 
I'm not trying to knock trezor specifically, I'm just saying there are ways to hack anything, bugs and exploits happen from time to time. Eventually I'll get around to testing out a trezor for myself out of curiosity but for now I just use electrum which is just as good to me without the added hardware.

You could try to resubmit or double spend the transaction with a higher fee to get miners to include it sooner. At the moment there are about 10,000 transactions waiting for confirmation, and the blockchain is pretty close to its transactions per second limits (until block size is increased). The only way to get faster confirmations is to use a higher fee.

So would this list be a large enough list of nodes: 
Have a script that picks 3 random nodes, verifies that they are all honest nodes with the right payout addresses, and then sends the payment to any one of them.

I didn't downvote you, but i just upvoted both your replies. I'm glad you understand my point of view.  I'm personally a huge fan of new and not always stable software, and I often have to explain to friends how just because something looks awesome and is usable for me, it doesn't mean its ready for everyone.  
The bitcoin reference client (bitcoin-qt) is actually fairly stable for end users, but these exchanges have to maintain their own version of a wallet, they can't simply drop in the reference software and expect it to hold up. In some cases (like cryptsy) there are dozens, or perhaps hundreds of different wallets to be maintained.
I would expect that at version 1.0 the exchanges will no longer be needed (completely decentralized)
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:16:52
 I don't think a sybil attack is likely, but it can be accounted for. If i'm wrong let me know, I am going to figure out how to make this work.
Say we pick a random number between 3 and 9, scan verify that many nodes (twice with a different set to be sure), we only count nodes that have active miners (verified against the payout list), and we recheck with a completely different combination of nodes at least twice a day (or however often is needed). If it becomes a problem we could also maintain a blacklist of known bad nodes.  
I suppose the  best way to accomplish this would be to build it on to the p2pool interface, that way all nodes who wanted to run it could, and a malicious node could be flagged by the non malicious ones or if there are too many malicious ones, donations can simply be temporarily halted until all the nodes are in agreement.

This isn't Mining, its just a loan to someone else who is (hopefully) using it to buy new hardware and paying you back in increasingly smaller amounts each week. They claim to be selling 5 year contracts, but its unlikely that single contract would actually end up generating income for that long, you'll be lucky if you break even.
In order to actually mine coins you need to have access to the physical hardware, or at least be able to control it. None of these "cloud" services will give you any control over what pool it mines on and most don't even have any proof that they actually have mining hardware.
I've been keeping track of PBmining for about a month and I'm very skeptical that they even have any hardware. They increase the minimum contract amount at each difficulty change, so for example a couple weeks ago you could buy a contract for 8ghs and it would cost you 0.03528732BTC Total, and today that changed to a minimum of 10ghs for a total cost of 0.04108732.  They encourage users to refer newbies to the service and reinvest their own earnings into more contracts.

I think they attempted one against a dice betting service, which is itself an attack on the network so generally we would consider that a fair test. However it either wasn't or at least shouldn't have been successful, because there are already ways for sites to detect and prevent double spends. If you check the double-spend page on blockchain.info you'll notice that double spend attempts tend to work themselves out after a block or 2. 
Ghash and several other pools, going all the way back to deepbit and slush have had close to 50% at one time or another. It's going to happen once in a while, and people are probably going to lose their shit every time just like the old media does whenever they predict the death of bitcoin over one stupid thing or another.
This is nothing new, some pools have even gone over 50% at times.

That's not really possible, if your private key gets stolen and someone else spends your coins you have no way of proving it wasn't you. If the insurance company holds the private keys for the coins, they still wouldnt have a way of replacing them if their service was hacked.

While I wouldn't exactly call it "cloud mining" (I hate that term) you can rent hashing power from [BetaRigs]( and point it at whatever pool you like and see the results instantly, no trust required. Miners set a rental price for their rigs, and you can rent hourly, daily, or weekly blocks of mining from them. There are some other site like [Nicehash]( that offer similar services, but betarigs is probably the most user friendly for newbies.

I just checked and I'm going to have to call bullshit on this post. P2pool.org is a totally valid p2pool node:
Here is the public address for my personal node:  
I'm running my own local copy of p2pool, my miner is actually pointed at 10.0.0.X, but I've made the node public so i can have other miners on it (i rent from betarigs and nicehash fairly often). Its located in my basement, on a VM, so its about as authentic as it gets.
If i add p2pool.org as a backup pool and split my shares between them, my mining address clearly shows up on p2pool.org as having already been credited for the shares i submitted on my own node. 
Screenshot: 
I am mining to the address "1CAcTUS..." P2pool.org on the left, my local node (10.0.0.12) is on the right. Predicted payout (shares i've been credited for) is the same on either node.
Not everyone has the time and knowledge to setup a personal p2pool node, but anyone who mines on any public node is still contributing to the same sharechain as other p2pool users. This kind of misinformation is what scares people away from using p2pool.
That being said, p2pool.org charges a 2% fee, so there are lots of better nodes to choose from. I recommend

what if i'm wrong and ghash decides they want to attack the network?  It would be a temporary annoyance at most, and cause more problems for ghash than it would for the rest of us.
I'm not predicting the future, I've just been mining long enough to have seen at least 3 other pools get up to or over 50% of the network Ghash has done it at least 3 times so far in the last year i think. They aren't a malicious actor so it doesn't really matter.  
If you want a pool to control less of the network complaining about it here isn't going to make much of a difference, you'll have to start your own pool and make it more attractive to other miners. Right now no other pools offer a good incentive to mine with them over ghash. That and they probably have around 30% of the network on their own hardware anyway.
 I mine on my own p2pool node normally because I want to mine on my own node and I like also running a bitcoin node, most people just care about earning money and wouldn't even know how to setup a p2pool node (not that its very hard). If i wanted to earn regular payouts and get the added befits of merged mining I'd probably use ghash too. 
I'm pretty sure all these posts about ghash are from people who don't actually mine.

The interest rate depends on what the demand is from the market, right now my USD swaps are at 0.2% a day and BTC is getting me 0.0065%. I keep about most of mine in BTC when the market is bullish because the price usually ends up increasing more than the return on the USD swaps.

Well thats hardly even an ad in my opinion, Im totally okay with product placement or refferals. If you actually use the thing being shown and its relevant to the subject Its more an endorsement than an ad from my perspective. That is more the direction I expect things to go, and it will get more people into the habbit of spending money to directly support content creators (while also getting a little somethibg themselves) instead of just putting up with some random car company ad at the start of a video . I'm actually likely to want to buy gallium after watching that video. Now if you had cut to a 30 second clip of you telling me how low your car insurance premiums are or some other completely unrelated product, I'd probably skip over that part manually and there would be zero chance of me spending money on the product.

So how does it work than, give me a source that explains how money is not created out of nothing. Or maybe you can learn [how it actually works]( for yourself, instead of defending a system you really know nothing about yourself. 


Right it wouldn't disappear because its never really existed outside of everyone's imagination to begin with.  The people using bitcoin instead of fiat would lead to a loss in fiat buying power though. Nobody wants to store their money in a constantly devalued asset.

You start with an amount of fiat and bitcoin in the exchanges you want to use arbitrage with, and you have a bot hooked in to both exchanges APIs to trade between the two of them when the spread is what you want. 
It doesn't take 5 days to transfer bitcoins into an account at least not at any of the exchanges i've used.  Maybe 30 minutes at most.

Bitcoin shouldn't really be considered deflationary for another 10 years, it will have an inflation rate of 1% or more a year until 2024. 100 years after that in 2124 it will still be increased by a over a million satoshis a yeah. I can understand why that seems deflationary compared to the billions of usd being printed every month by the fed. If the feds rampant money printing isn't causing people to abandon saving it, I don't think bitcoins controlled supply at a predicable rate will cause people to hoard it either.
I can't comment as a business owner, but as a customer: 
I'd never used overstock until they accepted bitcoins, in fact I barely even knew they existed (apparently they advertise mainly on some old type of centralized media service called television) . I ordered from tiger direct for the first time in probably a decade when they started accepting btc. I use gyft to pay for all my amazon orders (why wouldn't I when it gives me 3% credit back). Hell I even paid for porn for the first time in my life because bitcoin was an option . I usually buy coins as I need them with coinbase and spend them right away. I also trade and regularly buy small amounts to save once a month, but I try to keep most of my savings in swaps (which I can't just spend whenever) on bitfinex so it earns me interest. 
As for hoarding coins, I am also a miner, and I do hoard my newly generated coins, not always, but most of the time. I change addresses once a month or so and that address only holds fresh newly generated coins which I've mined on my own p2pool node. I suppose its mostly a sentimental thing, but I do think fresh coins are more valueable because I'm the one who mined them into existence. Plus the way I manage my operation there is no way of anyone tracing the mines cons to me personally and I like that becase I value my privacy.

I'm against regulation because it does nothing but create a false sense of security, and could actually lead to many more problems. Historically we've also seen how companies like HSBC will violate regulations, and happily pay a fine that is well below what they earned in committing the violations while no one is held personally accountable.
Regulators can make mistakes, or be lied to, bribed, etc. They are also completely pointless because scammers will just operate outside their jurisdiction and use bitcoin similar to how they make use of services like western union today.  
Establishing a  "common sense" set of guidelines can be accomplished by the community, and enforced by the community. Anyone is free to take the risk of ignoring the community guidelines, just like anyone today is free to wire money to the prince of nigeria or bernie madoff jr, and when those people get burned the rest of the community will be unaffected.
 There is no reason exchanges can't regulate themselves, establish proof of reserves and maybe some concrete "best practices" for security of cold storage. Perhaps use multi-sig escrow on cold storage which is then shared between multiple exchanges. Each exchange on an individual basis can not access the cold funds, but after 3 or more exchanges have done an audit they can all agree on a withdraw.

I'm a miner, but I already mine on P2pool. The thing with Ghash is that most of the people "mining" on it are actually just investors in the pool and have no control over the hardware (nor would they know what to do if they did control it).

So the largest P2Pool node i can find right now has 22TH, assuming the huge difficulty increase and sudden lack of stats doesn't already tip anyone off, what would that pool owner do with 22TH?
Obviously if you aren't running the pool you are putting minimal trust into the person who does, but you're still contributing to a decentralized pool as long as the node operator isn't malicious. Even if they are malicious there really isn't much they can do with a single node. If you switch pool nodes, you still get credited, that's pretty decentralized in my book. 
Not everyone is a sysadmin. You should get off your high horse and encourage people to join p2pool regardless of their technical skill levels, they are still contributing in some way that will result in an overall improvement to the bitcoin network.

So a miner controlling 51% of the network is going to do what then?  Finding blocks is based on luck, not just hashing power. Eventually with the other mining pools working together their chain would larger than the malicious one and it would have to start accepting them again. 
This has been discussed and planned for since the invention of hashcash. The time when such an attack was actually possible is long gone.  
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:33:36
The limitations of P2pool right now are basically that you only get paid ever couple of  days, we've gone up to a week without making a block, most people want to get paid daily or at least see the payout balance in their pool account going up. P2Pool doesn't merge mine all the other things that Ghash does. A lot of people also think p2pool gets more stales or other issues that where either only problems in the early days or just completely fabricated.
I'm not sure if there are any other advantages ghash offers, but they would control around 30% of the network just with their own in house hardware. It will be a while before p2pool can take back a sizable chunk of the network, but we'll get there.

You aren't actually mining bitcoin by doing this. At best you are giving someone a loan to buy more hardware and at worst you are getting scammed. How do you know pbmining isnt just going to give up tomorrow and run off with your money and keep the hardware they spent it on? Do you even have proof they are generating new coins? All mining operations should be able to pay out in new (zero input) coins, or at least show that they are earning them. PBMinings payments are once a week, and you'd have to go pretty far back in the blockchain to actually find when the coins where created.
If you insist on loaning money to someone else's mining operation, why not invest in my operation instead. I at least [have proof]( that I'm generating coins and not a ponzi scheme. Notice under "from/to" it says "Generation", that's because I'm actually mining with my own hardware on my own pool so i get new coins.
 I could always use some new hardware, so PM me if you want a deal. You can see exactly how much i've earned this month (I use a new address each month) so you can pay me slightly less than that and I'll point the hardware directly to your address for a month.

Yeah the linked op would definitely be in the first. I'd say a majority of people who are actually doing things with bitcoin other than speculating that it's fiat exchange value will increase are part of the first group. The second group is by far more common (or at least louder), because it requires much less understanding of bitcoins actual purpose, but they add little to it's actual value or direction.

50% is arbitrary really. To pull of a successful double spend youd only need about 30%, possibly less if your lucky. For a government or other malicious entity to attack the network there are other more effective ways. A pool can also easily just hide it's hashing power as multiple pools/IP addresses. Its honest of ghash to report their hashing power as they do. The pie chart on blockchain.info is as much a representation of luck as it is hashrate. P2pool has been making a comeback and had a good run of luck during this latest 50% panic and as such even with our fairly low hash rate we are showing up on that chart now.
Any attacks on the network would be detected and fixed fairly quickly, but such a theoretical attack would not come from a major pool like ghash. It goes against the very purpose of why we all mine.

I blame cloud ~~miners~~ suckers, for helping to finance ghash through cex. I can't really blame ghash though, they found a market full of people who are willing to throw their money away in hopes of it magically earning them more. I wish I had thought of it first.

Maybe I'm not understanding your system correctly but I'm not sure how it would prevent a scammer from taking advantage. It sounds like "down payment" isn't the right term for this, maybe "insurance payment"?
If I'm understanding you correctly this first payment would be released to the same person, and both parties would have to pay it up from. 
A buyer would be paying more up front, and the seller would also have to make a payment. Would these 2  payments be equal? It seems like this wouldn't really be very attractive to many people because they would both be risking more of a loss in the event of a scam.
Using my previous example of a laptop, lets say you are selling me a laptop for 1BTC, what would our down payments be?  Then what would happen if after receiving the laptop i stopped contacting you and our funds where both still in escrow? 
And what would happen if the scam where reversed, our funds go into escrow, and instead of sending me a real laptop you send me a fake [P-P-P-PowerBook]( instead.

Its probably due to the majority of recent growth [coming from coinbase](  and the transactions being done [off blockchain. ](
New merchants are using coinbase, So if a customer sees some merchant he already uses is now accepting bitcoin and they do so with coinbase, there is a very high probability that they will also sign up with coinbase, buy (and maybe sell) their coins using the service and pay using coinbase. 
 I keep most of my coins offline but I primarily use coinbase when I want to buy something.. Usually I will buy the coins I need from CB and then spend them with a merchant that is also using coinbase so those transactions won't show up on the blockchain unless sending money to or from another wallet. 
A lot of exchanges also use off chain transactions too.

I'm pretty sure I know when I'm looking at an ad, I don't use google and I normally block them, but last time i looked google adwords where pretty obviously NOT search results. And advertising for someone is not an endorsement. 
No one is here to hold your hand to protect you from scams, if you aren't comfortable with that, don't use bitcoin, it isn't ready for you yet. Google didn't even scam you, it was probably some random dude in Russia or something, at best you can maybe get google to reveal the IP that was used to pay for the account, but it was probably a proxy.

Yeah, we all learn that lesson at some point. It's called Due Diligence.  Don't trust a single source of information, especially if "a ton of money" is involved. 
The site you mentioned came off as an obvious scam to me for several reasons:
1. It was on a wiki page (wiki's are by their very nature editable by nearly anyone, they should never be used as a primary source of information. That's why sites like wikipedia insist on citing sources)
2. The video on bitmixer was not very well done, it has broken English and sounds like its either being read by a computer ("Bitcoin is called anonymous payment system") 
3. The site has an "available on google play" icon that links directly to an APK file instead of the app on the play store. This is a big red flag, for any sort of android application.
4. Most mixing services are scams, It would be easy for any mixing service to selectively scam, say one out of ever 1000 people, and still have lots of good reviews. If you need to mix your coins, you'll need to do it yourself and not rely on a service that claims to do it for you. 
4. It's using scare tactics to entice you into using the service. It's targeting people who are more likely to be criminals (or otherwise want to hide from the government) so they are unlikely to report the stolen coins to authorities. 
6. There is no information regarding the site's creators/owners. The "Help" option is the only way to attempt contacting them. You should generally look for both an email contact and phone number of any entity you are going to send money to.
That all being said, it is shitty that the wiki is in such sorry condition. I actually made myself an account there last september specifically to add warning to a group of sites i learned where scams (want to guess how i learned about the first one?). Bitcoin is a community, it's all of our responsibility to make it as safe as possible.  Personally I think should be the first sidebar link instead of the wiki, it is in the sticked post for newcomers, but that's obviously not enough.

1) Yes, I have about 60-70ghs locally and i rent more from time to time on betarigs, but you should be able to get payouts with anything above 10gh/s these days (and if you have less than that you can always rent more to add to it)
2) Its a decentralized pool that works on a lower difficulty shared chain,  The wikipage explains it in more detail, but the TLDR version is that no one who runs a p2pool node can take your money or do things like double spending, even if the p2pool network reaches 99% of the total hashrate it won't be a problem because no one has control over it. Payouts are made when blocks are found, they come directly from the block to your bitcoin address. You will see them as "newly generated coins"  and they will require extra confirmations (100 i think) before you can spend them. see:  for more info
3) It's possible, but I'm not sure how many public nodes support it. I'm currently in the process of setting up merged mining on my node,  supports devcoin mining. You could probably find others that support more if you search bitcointalk.
4) just point your bitcoin miner at a public p2pool node like this:
    cgminer blisterpool.com:9332 -u YOURBITCOINADDRESS -p x
With your own bitcoin address, the password doesn't matter, you don't need an account so any password (or none) will work. If you want to enable merged devcoin mining with blisterpool visit their site (  )  and link your bitcoin address to a devcoin one.

Hypothetically If Eligius (or another pool running the same code) becomes too big, and miners still act selfishly like they did with ghash, their eligius shares wont be paid to them until they reach a set amount of BTC on eligius, but if a single P2pool node is too big users can hop to another node and still expect a full payout anytime a block is found. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:44:56
Thanks for the tip :-)
1) Yes pretty much, with any pool its a small part luck and a larger part hash rate that determines how often the pool finds a block. If more people joined, it would be paid out more frequently because payouts are made whenever a block is found. The coins that are generated from finding the block are the ones used to pay miners, so another sort of benefit actually is that there is no chance of the pool operator keeping your funds, even if the node you use goes down, you can switch to any other P2Pool node and you'll still get full credit for whatever shares you put in on the old one.
2) I think its possible, but I have not look into it yet myself. I'm pretty sure at least namecoin could be merge mined, but I don't know the specifics of how to set it up, and Ghash just automatically does it for people.
3)I would like to think so, again I have not looked into it yet, but I will eventually get to poking around and trying to improve my node. So far I haven't really noticed any major annoyances myself, the things i vaguely remember people talking about on IRC and forums are definitely not an issue anymore. 
I don't think ghash having so much power is as big a deal as its being made out on While its not ideal for sure, we've had several pools that went over 50% or close to in the past 3 years. Deepbit was I think the first to do it and they soon after offered a bounty for someone to create a site for monitoring double spend attempts and hash distribution, Blockchain.info provided it some time later. Slush and BTCGuild have also gotten close, BTCGuild increase their fees, and layed out some rules for how they would adjust if it happened again.  Even Ghash had a press release in jan when they last had a large portion. We are fairly lucky in that the people behind these operations all know exactly whats at stake, and what they have to gain by acting honestly. Not that I don't think they should just do nothing, but at this point i'd only start to get concerned about it if they stayed at over 50% for a week or more. 
I'm working on developing a guide to help more people get started mining independently. I'm still very early on, basically just helping people on reddit and IRC and keeping notes as I go, but I live in a place where BTC is fairly popular, so eventually I'll be teaching classes at a non-profit space here and then try to launch something with a website on a larger scale. 
I get the feeling you and I aren't the only ones who would like a larger p2pool, people just need a few good folks to show them the way first.

That doesn't really offer any advantage to either party though, it seems like more of a disadvantage to both. 
 I could keep the laptop, and say that I'll only release the funds if you give me a 0.3BTC refund to a non-escrow address, which would mean you have the option of taking a 0.3BTC loss or 1.1BTC loss. I might also risk loosing the 0.1BTC, but I still have a laptop that I can resell. If I manage to extort a few discount laptops out of people this way it might even be profitable for me.
I know I'm being overly cynical about the scamming, there are probably some situations in which having both parties contribute insurance, but I think the majority of things would either be better with no insurance or with the option of having a dispute mediator. 
Anyway, you should check out this project: 
It's pretty much what you described but instead of paying for insurance, you can optionally include a dispute mediator's key and in the event of a dispute they would receive a small % as a fee.

In the current non-crypto system the majority of disputes are resolved either withviolence, imprisonment, or the threat of both (either by a legal system or by drug cartels). Its not possible to do this in a free and anonymous market, so the "criminals" found a more civilized way of resolving there disputes.
In crypto contracts The 2 parties who enter the contract first decide what 'unreasonable' is and usually select a 3rd party to act as arbitrator in the event of a dispute . Take the popular underground market places that have all appeared to replace silk road for example. Most have a set time period like 2 weeks where funds remain in escrow (either held by the market, or using multisig escrow) the buyer can decide to release payment at any time (presumably when he revives his goods or service) but if enough time passes they can also be released automatically or in the event of a dispute (product not as advertised, etc) the buyer and seller will end up in arbitration and the trusted third party (ie the market admins) will have final say on who gets the funds (or perhaps issues a spilt refund).

It's a pretty close margin, it can depend a lot on the luck of the pool your mining with. The last few days p2pool has broken even with the rentals i've had from betarigs, and if you count the donations that have been coming to p2pool miners its a tiny bit of a profit. 
You are renting something from someone who could otherwise be making money from it, so its safe to say you wont make a huge profit just by renting machines, but it's a good way to get started and contribute to p2pool, without risking too much of a loss (as you would buying new hardware). The most you'll loose is a few millibits, but on a good day you should take in a small profit.

Well I'm not trying to say it's riskier than Gox, I was just saying even huge companies that are trusted can be hacked without warning. It's not an apples to oranges comparison, it applies to any information you transfer or store somewhere thats accessable over a public connection. That's why i also mentioned target and ATT. I'm not trying to scare anyone away from using the service, I just think people should ALWAYS be concerned about security, and one of the best ways to minimize your risk when you do choose to submit private information to a company is by keeping an eye on your credit report so you can dispute things or report your identity stolen ASAP if it does actually happen.
As for accepting credit cards, again I'm not trying to scare anyone off, the only people coinrnr are going to be hurting is themselves by doing that. Do you honestly believe that in the post TOR/SilkRoad era credit card fraud will be on its way out? It's not all that hard to photoshop fake identification documents, and being able to cash out a stolen credit card directly to bitcoin is pretty much the holy grail to online criminals.

Well I disagree with you there,  most people don't actually want advertising, they just accept it. 
Ad blocking is inevitably going to increase. These days every major cable provider (in the US anyway) offers DVR services with the ability to fast forward over commercials.  No one likes ads, but until recently the average joe hasn't had much choice in the matter, and as the amount of people blocking ads/skipping commercials increases, content creators are going to have to find new ways of generating revenue. 
People do want the content supported by the advertising, so whenever we reach a point where its common place to block online advertising, people will start donating more in order to encourage new content. Personally I can't wait for [patreon]( to start accepting bitcoin, because a number of youtubers I want to support are already using it.
Another potential option to replace online advertising (more for blogs than youtube) is that websites can have visitors run bitcoin [mining as a javascript application] ( in the background . While it might not be more than a proof of concept at the moment, it has serious potential.
We aren't there yet, but i think its pretty clearly on the horizon.

I honestly don't care if you use bitcoin. I'm using it because I'm a crypto-anarchist and I don't think governments should even exist let alone control the supply of money. I'm more comfortable keeping my savings in bitcoin than trusting some government to keep the value of their money from going down the toilet. 
 If you want to live in a fairy tale land where the government is always looking out for whats best and takes care of everything, that's fine by me. When the bank/loansharking industry collapses again dont't come crying to me about how they took your house/car/firstborn/ect.

It won't work because "mining entity" isn't a thing. You're just assuming that because blockchain.info reports where blocks come from, that's somehow detectable. It's actually voluntary.

Really its all about being able to do math and plan ahead. I started in 2011, have reinvested in hardware about half of what i earned. I'm still pretty small compared to a lot of the groups out there (I just mine from my home) But I've managed to make at least a small profit just about every month since i started. Here's some of what i've learned along the way:
* Don't order hardware if it won't ship to you before the next difficulty change (2 weeks). 
* Don't order a lot of hardware at once and blow your whole budget. Space it out and buy quarterly or bi-annually. Hardware gets cheaper and better all the time (The Antminer S1 was incredibly well priced for example). 
* If you're just getting started, start small, even if its something that won't earn you a profit like a USB Antminer U2 for $20. Learn about how everything works first, check out different pools, and gain XP before you go throwing down thousands of dollars on serious hardware.
* Use accurate profit calculators to find the price you feel comfortable paying for hardware, instead of trying to figure out how long it might take to ROI, see what your first months income would be at a given hashrate and see if that would be enough of a return for you. Most hardware I've gotten has ROIed (in BTC) in 3 months or less. Some hardware will never ROI in BTC and so you are better off buying coins (except as I mentioned if you are just starting out and want to spend under $100)
* Don't "invest" in "cloud mining", even if you expect to make money off selling the shares instead of mining (I've not personally made this mistake, but i've seen others who thought they would make out by "buying on the dips" and lost almost everything). 
  * If you want to outsource some extra hashing power, daily or weekly rentals from betarigs or nicehash are better options. You get control over where they mine so depending on the luck of whatever pool you choose they are at least potentially a small bit profitable, and at worst you are still supporting an independent miner and not some huge corporation like cex/ghash.
* Don't buy anything from Butterfly Labs (I'd be a millionaire right now if I had not made this mistake, but it was a lesson that many of us had to learn first hand when the market was new)
* Make sure you can afford the power bill (or any other bills) without having to sell your mining income every month. Price volatility and/or difficulty increases can really bite you if you depend on the income to pay the bills.(it seems many miners still don't understand this).
* Most importantly, don't get into mining just to make a  profit. Obviously that should be a part of your goals, but bitcoin mining is as much a fun hobby as it is a profitable one. Enjoy being part of something that is bigger than just you or your money.
* [Bonus] If you can equip your mining location with solar power, DO IT.

I first learned about hashcash in the early 2000's and dove head first into the cypherpunk community as a teenager. It's really amazing, going back to the early 90's how these really incredibly smart people who invented things like PGP (still used today) and actually broke the US governments (back doored) encryption standard. A lot of what they predicted and prepared for has already started happening. 
People question bitcoin and the blockchain without giving the same scrutiny to the old banking systems because they have been brainwashed into believing "that's how it's always been", but eventually something will click and people will start to wonder about things like "Quantitative Easing" and central banks that maintain negative interest rates on deposits. 
The oligarchs have to be really careful about how they react to everything now, they have actual serious competition from something that they don't  have any control over. That's never happened before, and they clearly where not prepared for it. They are smart enough to realize that its a direct threat, but their old methods of violence and extortion aren't going to work against bitcoin, the only thing they can do to save face is act like they are still in control and hope enough of the population doesn't catch on.

 In the end you will get nothing in return from them, hell they don't even do a good job at stopping smaller scams, just look how long madoff lasted.

I don't understand why that would matter. If you just used 2 or more separate nodes and compared the payout list from both. If the lists match than the nodes are all honest, if there is a discrepancy with one, blacklist it and try another. 
P2Pool isn't only for running locally anymore, there are hundreds of public p2pool nodes running, the only scam I've seen is nodes that have 100% fee which is still shown on the stats page anyway so its not even that good of a scam.

Probably DFish will over power them in a few months. It was only like a year ago that BTCGuild and Slush where combined making over 50% of the pools.

We're actually helping by using GHash. I switched over from using my p2pool node last night to help push them over the edge. 
The problem is just going to be ignored until they actually get there. In the past, other pools who reach too high of a % would do things to encourage users to leave, Ghash can't do that because they actually own and control all the hardware, most of their "miners" are just financing loans through cex.io for them to buy new hardware with. 
Just hang in there until they get to 51%, they won't do anything to harm the network (it would also harm their profits) , they will just look stupid and hopefully people will stop funding them.

Perhaps there would be a way for coinbase to contribute to p2pool miners and node operators in a way that would improve it as a competitor to more centralized options. We've been getting a significant amount of donations lately, thanks to setting up a donation page on his node. ( 
Ghash (and other cenrtalized pools) seem to offer 2 things that p2pool in its current state doesn't: Merged mining of compatible alts, and regular payouts. Most p2pool nodes already have a 0% fee, and GHash more than makes up for the lack of mining fees by charging 10% to cex.io users and possibly from withdrawal fees.
P2pool can work with merged mining, but setting it up is difficult. I'm in the process of doing so on my node right now, and even with it setup the merged mining would only be paid to my local node. I would have to manually pay miners in each coin (or convert them to BTC), There isn't an automated (and trustless) way to do it yet. 
Would it be possible to have coinbase donate regularly to p2pool, and then be paid back from what nodes could generate by merged mining and whenever a BTC block is found? Donations go out to miners right away so people wanting regular payments would be more likely to join (and stay) if they saw regular payouts, instead of just one big payout whenever a block is found.  I think that would be a huge advantage if it could be done. 
Another good addition would be implimenting a p2p version of something like nicehash.com or betarigs.com that would allow users to rent/buy hashing power without needing to do any of the hard work. It wouldn't be very hard to compete with Cex either given how inflated their prices and maintenance fee's are at the moment.
I'd be glad to help with developing and testing something if you think these are good ideas.

Switch to litecoin if you honestly feel threatened by this problem. It's already changed and even if its more power costly, anyone with a GPU can still compete in the arms race, so if a single pool ever does gain too much power everyone can just fire up their GPUs and hash away until things get better.
A pool with as much invested into hardware and housing isn't going to initiate an attack though.

You don't understand how p2pool works. Miners are paid the same (unless a node has fees) and contribute work to the same sharechain regardless of what node they use. I use my local one, but i have a couple of backups set for when i end up breaking things (like today as i try to get merged mining working).  The credited shares from my local node carry over to any other p2pool node I use. There is no way for other P2pool nodes to steal or otherwise mess with my shares, although I could withhold blocks from them they can't withhold payments from me if i find one. 


Socialism is pretty much the exact opposite of anarchism, I'm not sure how you could have wealth redistribution or state ownership of things with anarchism, Maybe you are thinking of Anarcho-Syndicalism, which I think is alright, but its not socialism. It's nice that you think there are only 2 sides to things and can group me with the left side (socialism?) while also putting anarchism into that same side. Anarchists don't view politics as some one size (or 2 sizes) fit all ideology. Libertarianism is basically just anarcho-captialism/voluntarism with a nice suit and tie on so that more people will buy into it.
You can classify me as whatever you like, but I call myself a [Crypto-Anarchist]( and I don't buy into this left and right red and blue bullshit.

I'm deducting all my gpus and a % of my electric. they have a limit on the amount you can deduct so my room mates just became contractors for a mining llc. now not only does the irs NOT get any money from me, they actually subsidized my expenses. I guess I understand why bankers like this sort of treatment. Thanks IRS.
im not going to track my mining income In usd though. I only value bitcoins against other crypto currencies. I don't exchange them for us dollars so there really isn't a capital gain there.  Maybe if the irs made a fedcoin I could have something that's a real comparison, but comparing cryptos to fiat is pretty Much like apples and rocks where I'm coming from.

Its stupid for sure, but I could probably make a good enough argument that at least some developers would be swayed. It wouldn't even really have to be specific to bitcoin, there are lots of reasons why developers should avoid apple. 
I'm not actually going to waste my time doing it, but I do think its better than asking apple to allow this or that app to be allowed into their walled garden. My version would be aimed at thousands of different people who can all make their own choices. Apple is a single corporate entity and they answer to share holders not online petitions. If you OP really wants apple to listen to him he should buy some shares instead of wasting everyone's time.

Also, if I do have to pay taxes for mining does that mean i get deductions for my electric and hardware expenses too?

Currently it looks like their shares are 0.007BTC/GH. Most hardware sells for about 0.003BTC or less. So you would be paying at least twice the value of the "commodity" you're getting in return.

Well the official proposal we had going around was for them to gracefully step down, admit they don't really have any idea what they are doing and appoint satoshi nakamoto as head of the new world banking system.  Satoshi would then accept by signing a message from one of his original addresses (and probably also his PGP key just to be double sure). Part of  his original mining earnings would be used to bail out the first world economy, a slightly larger amount would go into funding the modernization of third world nations so they arent constantly wasting resources by killing each other over silly disputes about imaginary lines or natural resources. The Satoshi would be the standard unit of value world wide, and everyone would be given a solar powered ASIC miner to prevent any one company from controlling the network.
Personally, I thought it was a pretty good idea, and Alice, Bob, even Chuck from down the hall thought it would work out. I emailed Satoshi about it, and he said he'd be down as long as he could get a free lunch out of it,  but when we showed the rough draft to some of those banking guys and they told us it sounded to much like a Ponzi Scheme. 
So unfortunately, its looks like we're going to be competing with an increasingly more violence police state attempting to keep everyone else in line until bitcoin starts being widely used for [Assassination Politics]( and the original cypherpunks all coming out of retirement to say "I told you so" while they watch the AP Market do its thing. It's not an ideal solution, but the bankers and politicians all seem to be very adamant about going down with the ship. 
Either way though, once we get all this uncivilized war and slavery business behind us, we can start doing awesome stuff like exploring space and colonizing our solar system. When people around make references about going "to the moon" they aren't being figurative, its actually the fist place we planned on colonizing.

Yeah and he explains in that video how insanely impractical that would be.  Why would ghash attack the network that they've invested millions of dollars worth of hardware into supporting? Also people are over looking the fact that 2 or 3 pools could just as easily collaborate privately to do the same thing, but they won't because its not in anyone's best interests to do so. 
This is nothing new, some pools have even gone over 50% at times. When they get there they do something to drive off users. Unless/Until we reach that point the free market will decide what is the most popular and Ghash apparently offers the best deal for greedy people.

I think you're confusing 2 separate things as being one in the same. Hosting a pool and having mining hardware are 2 different things. I can setup a node for you on a VPS if you like, but if you want hashing power, your best bet is to rent some directly from a miner using a site like [betarigs]( or [Nicehash]( 
unless you plan to have a lot of other people share the p2pool node with you, there isn't much need to host it on a dedicated server or VPS. I I have my own node running in a VM at home (  ), and I rent hashing power from betahash as well as having my own hardware pointed at it.

Nope, AdblockPlus works great on youtube video ads. I tried without adblock enabled and the ad played, but adblockplus blocks them by default, but I've been aware of those ads for a while, I only ever see them on devices that aren't mine.  AdblockPlus does have a policy for [Acceptable ads]( which is to discourage the type of video advertising youtube has, among other things. 
I get what your saying about how people will choose annoying but free over donating, but I my point is that I think that is changing (slowly). Netflix isnt as popular as Cable TV, but i think it (or something similar) will be eventually (like in a decade or so). 
The mining example is as i said, more proof of concept, but if bitcoin's where worth $10,000 or so, it might make sense to run a javascript app instead of having a paywall. That would sort of be similar to the "annoying but free model" you could give people the option of paying 0.000001BTC per article, or you they can run the mining script while reading.  If difficulty is too high for BTC, it could be done with dogecoin or whatever, the point being its one potential model that i can see people finding preferable to advertising.


Have you looked into patreon? [A friend of mine]( has had a fair amount of success with it so far. He's getting $800 in donations a month, for doing something way less cooler than your stuff (I also convinced him to accept bitcoin on his site, although i'm not sure who other than myself have donated to him that way just yet).  
I know I'm in the minority for now, but I'm also the sort of guy who the non-technical majority go to for advice and help with setting things up. I've got my mother in law from a $60 cable bill down to $20 for internet and a Roku w/ netflix. I've installed or introduced more people to adblock than I can count. It's still a very minor impact I'm sure (i'm just one guy after all),  but I do think these things will spread more and more rapidly as time goes on. 
If i had to guess, I'd say what we now consider normal "traditional" online advertising models, have about 10 years left. However long it takes I'm sure there will be enough time for content creators to adapt gradually. I think the same thing about the recording and movie industry, although they are obviously going to be putting up a hell of a fight. Crowd funding will eventually replace the old ways. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but I'm at least going to do my part to help make the changes I want to see happen.

I'm confused about how you would expect this change to be implement into bitcoin. It seems you are presenting permacoin as if it would be implemented on top of bitcoin, but the if the goal idea is to replace PoW with PoR, that would mean creating hardfork or a completely new blockchain, and the result wouldn't be part of the bitcoin blockchain anymore. Am I not understanding it correctly? Would SHA256 ASICs be used for PoW in combination with the storage some how? If not then wouldn't ASIC mining operators prevent you from implementing the change?  
I realize it's just a proof-of-concept, but It sounds like it would only be possible as an altcoin and not as a part of bitcoin.

There is no such thing as a "typical" bitcoiner at this point. But the origin of bitcoin traces back to the Cypherpunks , which tend to lean mostly towards libertarians or minarchists/volinaryists in regards to their views on taxation. 
If you really wanted to simplify it you could say that there are 2 types of typical bitcoiners: The first group are the one's who think bitcoin will take over and replace all fiat currency (and possibly governments in general). The second group see bitcoin as a novel idea like the paypal or amazon that's sure to make a lot of people rich fiat currency but not revolutionary enough to change the world.  
I think the more you learn about bitcoin and its origins, the more likely you are to be in the first group.

It probably wouldn't happen like a traditional bank run, most people would buy their coins using digital bank transfers so the banks don't really have any reserves to run out of, its just numbers stored on computers. They have been cooking the books for almost a century now, so they are pretty good at pretending everything is fine and creating money out of nothing.
There will be a massive amount of inflation (or as the call it "Quantitative Easing") in fiat currencies over the next few years, or other accounting tricks to try to "fix" the problems like how today the ECB started implementing negative interest rates. Most of the banks don't see bitcoin as competition yet, and they probably won't realize it until people stop keeping their money in bank accounts. 
Eventually, the exchange rate of bitcoin to fiat currency wont matter because people will start pricing their goods and service in bits once they notice the buying power of their government money constantly going down.

That only works if both parties are honest and very specific about whats expected. If $SCAM-BUYER orders a laptop a pays in escrow, but refuses to release the payment after he's received it, he isn't really at much of a loss.  There are also going to be times when the 2 parties ideas of "like new" or "mint-condition" are different. 
But when you use 3-party escrow along with a reputation system, its more likely that people won't try scams in the first place so there is rarely any need to actually interact with the 3rd party.  The third party doesn't need to be a human in order to set up the transaction, it just need to programmed to get a human in the event of a complicated dispute.

I dont think amazon is fucked, but companies accepting credit cards in general and not bitcoin might eventually be fucked if fraud gets popular enough. 
Being able to transfer stolen credit cards into bitcoins is the holy grail of credit card theft. Thats why companies that sell BTC for CC wont last no matter how much they over charge legitimate customers to offset the costs of chargebacks. 
Purse.io users might get contacted if something sent to them was paid for with a stolen credit card.

I'm working on getting as many second hand USB miners as i can for dirt cheap so I can have something to physically send to anyone wanting to contribute to p2pool.   Even if they aren't really profitable, they add to the hashing power of the network and with enough small miners it will be harder and harder for the centralized pools to compete.

Keep in mind, if you have less than 10Gh or so, mining on P2pool may be pointless because you won't be contributing usable shares (and you won't get paid). For low hashrate miners, a smaller pool like slush is probably ideal.

You're missing the key point I'm trying to make, and the major advantage to p2pool.  Suppose a single p2pool node grows large enough that they control whatever amount of hashing the community decides is too much (I'd say 25%),  members of that pool are able to easily switch to another node (or start their own) and not loose any shares or face any other disadvantages like they would today when switching between a pool like Ghash. 
It's pretty clear from the people who've come out as being in favor of using GHash that one of the main advantages to it currently are the more steady payments they offer over other pools. If P2pool grew to be 99% of the network, and one node was getting close to 50%, there would be no excuse for miners to not switch, they would have nothing to lose, so we wouldn't be facing "the exact same problems". 
It could still be a problem, but it would be much smaller and easier to deal with.

You should always have security concerns about uploading your photoID to a random company over the internet. MtGox was the largest and most trusted bitcoin exchange in the world for years, they required photoIDs and had their database of said IDs stolen not too long ago. 
The best way to mitigate the security concerns of sharing your ID with companies is to regularly monitor your credit report. You don't really have to pay for identity theft protection or anything like that, just use creditkarma or at least be sure to check your credit report once a year.
  Anyone who has your information could go rouge or be hacked. Even huge companies like Target and AT&amp;T have security breaches.  
As far as CoinRNR specifically, I don't really see any major red flags, other than that hey accept credit cards which is a bad idea on their part because it will attract scammers looking to cash out stolen cards. You should be fairly safe.

At the moment I am focusing on writing educational material, I probably won't have a site up for a while. My primary goal is in decentralizing the mining network, I think the best way to do that is by having more well educated and independent miners. 
My idea is to start people out with small hardware they can use on their own as a reward for helping to crowd-finance bigger hardware which i will host myself and pay back with mining shares. Eventually when has earned enough to buy a full unit for themselves, they can get it at a discount from me, or have the knowledge to judge for themselves what ASICs on the market are a good deal for them.
As for investing, I'm hoping I can mostly find investors who also want to become independent miners but I will have to see what i can come up with as far as an expected return for people who just want to invest. I was going to start off locally, by giving classes at  [FreeGeek]( where i've taught classes on bitcoin (not mining) before.  I do plan on having a web presence eventually and open up to non-local users, but its a lot easier to develop a teaching strategy when you have people in the room with you.

You didnt think this through or you would have realized that mining pools are solo mining too, small/home miners would still have the same disadvantage. A lottery on difficulty changes nothing.
There are coins that do lottery type rewards, and you can solo mine them, but again pools still have the advantage. 
The best way to ensure decentralized mining is to use multiple algorithms like digibyte, it will never happen with bitcoin though.

The video tutorial is kind of confusing but i think i can break it down to this:
* make account
* send bitcoins to account (okay but i thought this was about BUYING bitcoins)
* withdraw bitcoins to a e-coin debit card
* add e-coin debit card to paypal
* Use e-coin debit to add money to paypal account (why??)
* Withdraw paypal balance to wirex/e-coin 
* Use e-coin debit card to buy bitcoin from wirex
So it actually took me watching twice before i realized how it works. I could be wrong because i don't know paypals policy, but its my understanding that the user is **withdrawing** funds to their own account (in this case the e-coin debit card), they will not be able to initiate a charge back since its not any kind of a sale, its just a transfer from one of the users accounts to a different account, same as withdrawing to a bank account.

Cloud mining isnt profitable, no one sells hashing power for less then it earns. Any site claiming otherwise is a scam.

Its legal except possibly in NY.
If you have to ask  about making a profit then mining probably isnt a good fit for you since it requires being willing to take a huge risk with whatever you invest in hardware. all sorts of things can go wrong, and you might end up having to pay a $500 electric bill but only earned $300 worth of btc that month (and $280 the next month, etc till you give up).
Mining works well on a small scale as a hobby. I spend about a hundred bucks or so on hardware every year and can afford the extra 20 or 30 $ on my power bill each month regardless of how much btc i earn. Its rewarding enough to take part in the process, and i spend the btc i earn on games or some other thing i also enjoy.
If you find yourself making a good profit as a hobbyist, then you might be ready to scale up, but you will know what you're getting into at that point and wont need to ask anyone else for advice.

I'm fairly sure the 1MB limit was introduced relatively early on due to spam attacks. Sure it wasn't meant as a permanent solution and it wasn't part of the original software, but it's not been 8 years of no block size limit, it's been 5 or 6 at best. I've been mining since 2011 and I don't recall a time WITHOUT the 1mb limit. 
It just wasn't an issue until now because there wasn't much incentive for bitcoin based companies to take advantage of it. Back when you're options for spending bitcoin where basically just gambling or drugs, there where not enough people using it to reach the limit. Now we have companies that are betting the farm on bitcoin being the top layer of all these other technologies like lightning network, etc. These people (and their investors/supports) depend on block sizes remaining small so that they can pretend to innovate and hopefully corner the market as a secondary layer to bitcoin. 
It's really a lost cause at this point. By the time anything gets decided it will result in 2 seperate forks just like ETH/ETC, and now we see other coins such as ZEC/ZCL basically proving the same thing, miners are more interested in making a profit FOR THEMSELVES they don't care what the developers do, and they will likewise follow whatever is profitable, and from a miners perspective forks=competition so the more forks the better.

Well TorWallet is a scam so its not secure at all. Using Electrum with tails is pretty secure, you can use a new wallet every time if you want. Be careful with tumblers too, a lot of them are scams and the ones that arent charge pretty high fees. The easiest way to tumble coins is to buy an altcoin like ethereum and convert it to bitcoin using shapeshift.io to send to your bitcoin wallet.  If you use circle to buy bitcoin, then buy ethereum with those coins, circle has no way of tracking what you do after that.
That guide is pretty out of date, you might want to look for a better, more up to date resource to guide you. I'm not sure what lead you to TorWallet, but it is obviously not a resource you want to use.

Circle only uses bitcoin, they only track bitcoin (how much they even track it i don't know).
 One good way to do it is send your money from circle to an exchange like bitfinex, buy ethereum on bitfinex, send ETH from bitfinex to shapeshift, which you set to convert to BTC and sent to whatever your final destination is.
If you're more paranoid, use different altcoins, multiple exchanges and/or shapeshift more than once. Every time you change the currency you break any direct links. If you do each step a few hours apart it makes it even more impossible to link anything back to you.

Capital gains can also be capital loss, which results in a tax credit if you lose money on an investment for more than a year.
I think people need to keep this in mind, if you sell at a loss, you can write that loss off on next year's taxes. That gives crypto a major advantage since it can be anonymous, the IRS can't prove the difference between if you sell to a random person at a loss or just move the funds to a new wallet. Now Just like the big banks we can socialize losses and privatize gains.

It's a waste. You might as well just make a brand new wallet each time and do your own mixing between them over time, it would probably be less obvious that way too.
If you want to anonymize your coins use an exchange or shapeshift to get them changed into monero, then use xmr.to (or shapeshift) to convert back into BTC and send to your destination.

No its not normal but with trading bitcoin for reversible funds you generally need to establish a level of trust with the person buying btc. 
You will of course find details one the coinbase website on how to improve your account limits. The short version is send your id, link at least one bank and one credit card and you should your instant buy limit increased to $100 or so a week. 
 Do a few buys either instant or with the week hold,  once youve spent enough your instant buy limits will increase over time. For an example i can buy $2000 worth of btc instantly and 50k a week with holds. 
Yes holds are a pain but look at it from coinbase's perspective. They would fail as a company due to fraud if they did things any other way.  Many others can and have failed trying to make things "easier".  You have to either take the time to establish trust or pay a premium to someone on localbitcoins who is willing to take a risk on you.

coinbase is pretty much the only alternative for most use cases. It will allow you to buy the exact amount you need at the time of payment. Its instant IF you are fully verified and havent gone past whatever spending limit they set for you, otherwise it takes a week to fetch the BTC.  Verified accounts can do instant buys, how much per day depends on how much you've already used the service but my account for example allows me up to $2000 a week instantly and up to 10,000 a week with holds.

yeah, its possible for sure. There is a good amount of competition with gift card buyers and sellers, I'm not sure how easy it would be to compete in bulk but there are clearly a number of people who do it.

The thing about all the companies you mentioned is that they all charge a variable maintenance fee (the % of what you earn that goes to cover power costs), and eventually this fee will be higher than the amount your contract is earning, unless of course you regularly buy more in which case it may well be a ponzi -or- the price of bitcoin keeps going up to make up for the increase in difficulty/power costs in which case you would have been better off buying bitcoin and holding it. 
The people behind the cloud mining services know this, and they know most of their "customers" don't, so they play off that, they encourage you to bring new users with referrals and try other things to keep the money coming in constantly. The first month or so of the contract things will look smooth, a person might even make half their investment back in a few months and think "this is totally working, I should invest more before its too late", they might write a good review for the service with that in mind. Then 6 months or so down the line, suddenly there is little or no money coming back in and its really too late to do anything other than HOPE that you break even before the contract expires (and it wont).
Bottom line no one rents a money printing machine for less money than it prints them. By renting cloud mining you're basically just helping real miners pay their power bills, or worst your supporting a ponzi.
Check this for more info: 
@_date: 2015-08-31 05:20:36
That company probably won't last that long, if it does it will get to a point where there fees are higher than the return your "contract" would bring in  (I see one of the 2 they are offering already has 100% fee at least they seem to be honest on that). Cex.io is already at this point and they are one of the few somewhat legit cloud operations, they admitted the fees where too high and shut down their cloud service, though you can still buy "shares" but they won't be mining anything. Besides that, there's no way of predicting ROI beyond a month or 2, you can't predict price, difficulty or new hardware developments and how they will affect mining.
But if you do want to cloud mine, you shoupermalinksaveparenteditdisableld at least rent from actual miners using [nicehash]( where you can direct the hashing to the pool of your choice (thus verify that its actually REAL hardware not just a ponzi) and rent by the hour instead of having to pay 19 months worth of mining income up front for a 5 year contract.
Edit: Oh and just a heads up, eobot's rating on the [ponzi risk assessment]( list is not good: 6/7 signs of a ponzi + possible malware/wallet stealing software. EEK! I hope you didn't install their software.

@_date: 2015-08-31 05:11:39


Except its also a waste in that case because you could just buy bitcoin instead of having to loan it out to a cloud mining operation and hope they pay you back over time.
It will NEVER be profitable to cloud mine, because no one is going to rent out their hashing power for less than it would bring them back mining (and also power costs). It's barely even profitable to mine with your own hardware if you have ASICs.

In order for you to sell freshly mined coins you'd have to sell the private keys rather than sending the coins since if you send them they aren't fresh any more.  The other way to get fresh coins would be to have someone else mine on your behalf to a wallet you already control.  Either method requires trusting whomever you get the keys from or pay to mine for you and adds more risk without adding any real value.
I do like fresh coins, which is why I mine with my own hardware, I wouldn't trust someone else to do it and even if I did the coins would lose the extra appeal that I see in the ones I know where mined with my own hardware.

It seems like both sides are working primarily for their own self interest. Isnt that how crypto-anarchism is supposed to work? Both sides are disingenuous to the others solution but from a user perspective it really doesnt seem to make much difference. 
If anything bitmain has the better argument here, whatever optimizations they have made can be implemented by anyone, having first mover advantage doesnt mean they will develop any kind of monopoly or have a negative effect. If that where the case butterfly labs or ghash would be controlling most hashing power still. 
Its a near certainty that this all ends with 2 coins just like when ethereum split over the dao. Even if its just bitmain supporting the fork, they have more then enough power to keep it going indefinitely.

Bitinstant or bitfloor with cash bank deposit is the easiest way I've found. It doesn't require ID, just a deposit slip with the right account number. bitinstant lets you deposit to any bitcoin address.
If you want to fund with your dwolla account, you'll need to have an a balance with dwolla (not just money in your bank account). 
Intersango is also good to use until you've been on MtGox for 30s and get verified. They allow funding and withdraw through dwolla, without the more complicated verification process MtGox gives you. It's not as big of an exchange of course, but until you can use MtGox its worth a go.

Buy from bitmain, either the R4 or S9, those are the only ones worth getting at the moment, You could try something older like the s7 since you dont pay for the electric but you still need to find it at a cheap enough price in order to break even.
Also check  for statistics about what coins to mine and what you will earn from a given hashrate. Its more profitable to GPU mine something other than bitcoin, but the hardware takes up more space and generates more heat so it depens on how big of an office you have, how good the AC is and what level of noise you can tolerate.

Part of what defines bitcoin is the 21m limit, if that changes it's not bitcoin anymore it's some other bitcoin fork.
Look how the block size increase happened, that wasn't even a defining factor of the original bitcoin (it was added later as 1mb limit and is only now set in stone), just something that cause massive disagreement. You can rest assured if there ever was a change in the number of coins it would only result in a new coin like bcash and not a change to the main bitcoin block chain.

Everyone's pretty much admitting that the ASIC isn't the point, so what's this "software stack" do that actually adds value to the raspi? What does this do that I can't already do with a $35 raspi?

Then why develop a special one when they could just use a cheap already released USB powered miner that costs $20.
What's to stop me from cloning a 21inc device using a raspberry pi without a miner and saving myself $350.

Ill believe hashing and power rates when I see them..50-125gh is a heck of a variation and its not even a matter of how power efficient it is, 125ghs isn't going to earn 1.74btc before it becomes obsolete.  
Is it really that strange to accept that mining hard isn't profitable for consumers? Yeah its also a "Dev kit" but that's just the $35 raspberry pi.  Even 21 says that you won't profit from the mining alone and that you can earn more by using the device to sell things as a pos. So for $35 you can do pretty much the same "Dev kit" stuff, and spend the left over  $365 on BTC for a much better return.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:10:49


It seems like its half of an idea someone had I'm guessing it went like: "Hey what if we could strap a low powered ASIC to a small device to have it mine bitcoin while it does other stuff" What other stuff can it do? Well umm... let's just let the consumer worry about that" 
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:45:24
Okay but even at 10k a coin ROI is still calculated in BTC, so at today's price $400 is about 1.74btc, These devices will never earn back 1.74btc. They will stop earning anything long before they earn even 1btc. Maybe on a really long time frame if it was solo mining it MIGHT roi. This device is just such a half baked idea I really don't see how it even got funding but I guess that's bitcoin for ya. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:05:52
It's an over priced raspberry pi with an ASIC strapped on to it. Whatever you'd do with a raspberry pi you can do with this, but also it mines bitcoin, although the amount it will mine in its lifetime will never come close to the $350 added cost for the ASIC. 
Basically it's just a gimmick that people will buy without thinking and then quickly get bored with when they realize how pointless the mining is.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:59:56
Yeah but literally all they did was strap an ASIC to a raspi and bump up the price by $350..the raspberry pi itself is a $35 Dev kit. The miner is the only added value.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:10:15
Sorry but this is complete snake oil. You do not need to mine in order to "sign digital contracts", you can do that with bitcoins that you buy. Specifically you could build a clone of 21incs machine with a $35 pi and still have $365 left to spend on bitcoins for signing said contracts.

Nope, the price of bitcoin doesn't matter either way, thats a very common mistake people make in general.
Assuming the price of BTC will double in the next 2 years what would be the smarter choice to make right now:
A) Buying a raspbery pi and 1.5BTC  (total cost: $400)
B) Buying a raspberry pi and a 21BTC ASIC (total cost: $400, about 1.74BTC)
With option A in 2 years you still have your initial 1.5BTC which is now worth $700.
 With option B, if we assume a 10GH/s hashrate (I couldn't find the actual hashrate so im guessing based on the fact that its usb powered), you would be lucky to see a return of 0.04BTC in 2 years, so assuming the price has double, thats equal to about $20 (a loss of $380). 
If the price goes down, its obviously not good for either option, but no matter how much the price increases, buying coins directly is ALWAYS the better option. 
That being said, mining is still a great hobby, its just that this thing is not really a great miner, nore is a great dev kit. I could pretty much put one of these together for a cost of about $100 each by buying up used USB ASIC hardware and raspberry pi's.

If you want to mine buy something from BitMain, if you want to develop for bitcoin related IoT just get a standard raspberry pi.
The reason the 21 computers only mine to their pool is because they advance you bitcoins. Supposedly this is somehow a better alternative to just buying bitcoins or mining them on worth while hardware, but the point is if you don't mine on their pool they would run out of money very quickly and there would be no benefit for them to keep going. 
It makes sense if you read all their materials, but they don't really go out of their way to point it out because their business model would look pretty bad if they where more open about it.

Why dont you get that im literally doing exactly that with a standard pi. I can load my 21co wallet with satoshis and use the api marketplace just fine without a miner attached. 
They are selling miners, their business model is basically getting other people to provide electricity and hashing for their mining pool. Its a classic bait and switch. Overall its a brilliant plan for them if it works, but im still going to call bullshit on the claim that the mining is required to make the rest of it all work, its not.

There is no real reason for it beyond selling the hardware as a shitty type of DRM to force "developers" to use 21cos mining pool and mine for them. People want to believe theres more to it than that but it really is nothing more than a raspi with a higher power requirement. '
I was able to set up a normal pi using the same software minus the miner and it worked just fine. I plan on returning the miner to 21inc for a refund now that i have the api software i dont need the miner. I can just as easily load my bitcoin wallet with $400 worth of coin and use that in place of the tiny sums that the device could mine. 
The fact that they only sell the units with miners when they could just as well sell ones without for way cheaper says a lot about the company..obviously they are more concerned with selling miners than actually attracting developers.

Honestly I use amazon prime these days , netflix was just an example. Nice link but I'm not sure what your point is in posting it. Mine was that people who pay for cable are over paying suckers who don't know any better, just like the people buying these 21inc computers. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 13:58:57
Yes, it works exactly as it would on a 21inc machine except i don't use the mining and all the transactions are on blockchain. The main difference is adding "-p onchain" when buying things. I've tried a few of the tutorials on  and it all works fine.
Why is it so hard for people to understand this? It seems pretty obvious to me as both a bitcoin miner and a developer (the target audience apparently) that the mining aspect of the 21 computer only serves to make 21inc money.
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:17:23
If anyone is interested in building a DIY "bitcoin computer" out of a standard pi you can find the files contained on a stock 21inc sdcard here: 
The blockchain is not included, you can find a torrent of it elsewhere. The archive i made should be bootable on a standard Pi2 as long as you create a 102mb fat32 boot partition containing the files in /boot and the rest of the files go on a second ext4 partition. You'll need a 64GB or larger sd card if you want to store the block chain on it, although the actual 21inc software and OS is only about 1-2GB. I'm not sure yet what of the 21 stuff works without first having the block chain but i don't have the bandwidth to upload the entire thing.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:38:11


No. Im not bypassing it. I can accept payments from either "wallet" and im connected to the 21inc network. If someone else wanted to use "unflushed" coins to pay me off blockchain using "21 buy" they can do that.


You dont get to use an argument about how this is better for end users when it doesnt even have a gui interface. This is not an end user device and it makes nothing for the end user easier. Aside from that people dont want "a miner in every device" its impractical and expensive and the alternative will always be cheaper and more appealing.

Tell me something though, do you want or already one of these computers? Are you a developer? I see lots of people defending 21inc but not many people actually developing anything useful for them. I have a suspicion that most defenders are not actually owners or developers but rather overly optimistic neophytes. I can see how someone fairly new to bitcoin and development might see these computers as a great innovative thing, but personal experience shows me otherwise.
I think the most useful thing i can do personally is to make the same technology available to people without $400 burning a hole in their pockets, so thats what I'm doing. I see it as an improvement. For less than $400 i can load a normal pi with more bitcoin than a 21inc computer will mine in a year, so not only would developers have to pay less, they also get access to the bitcoin right away instead of having to wait for "21 mine" to send them 20,000 at a time. How is that not better?
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:06:01
Why do people pay for netflix when they can just torrent stuff? Well I personally do because I like the shows netflix puts out, also i feel that $8/month is reasonable for me and my family to have access to the library easily and on demand.  I don't however pay for cable TV, and i question those who do so at this point, why would you pay $100 a month for something you can get for 1/10th the price. A rasberry pi is 1/10th the price of the 21 computer, what does the 21 computer do that makes it 10x more valuable? Its not mining i can tell you that for sure.
As a bitcoin miner, the 21 Computer does nothing new, I can already much more bitcoin at a low enough power cost on my current gen hardware (antminer S3+), which i paid about $200 for. The "21 computer" (aka raspberry pi) doesn't require a miner to do any of the things people say it can do, all those things can be done by the pi alone.  Even if you wanted to mine "for fun" or whatever, you can find cheap USB powered ASICs for under $50 on amazon, since the 21 co's miner will never earn the $400 cost back in BTC the efficiency of the miner is largely irrelevant . 
Even assuming there is some benefit to their software, its still just software that anyone can run on a $35 raspi. There is no reason to pay $400 for this "computer". 
TLDR: The 21 Computer is what happens when a bunch of idea guys get together and make a "product" without actually creating or improving any of the technology involved.

All you need here is an export/import of the keys. Its not going to break anything, just dont change the key (ie dont remove or add letters to it)
You have 2 options, either import the key for that address or wait until the tx is cleared/rejected on its own. If messing with private keys is too scary then youll have to wait.
Now that you know WHAT the private key is, you need to specifically learn about how to export and import them with electrum.

While i will look into using 21.co's centralized proprietary system once its been made available, I again just don't see how it offers anything that bitcoin itself cant already do. If I want an api for receiving payments I can use coinkite or a number of similar services. If 21inc wants to sell an API or whatever thats fine, just be honest about it and don't try to also sell obsolete out of the box miners with it, or least sell the miners separately as an addon. 
If they honestly want people to develop on their platform they should make it completely open source and freely available to anyone.

you can "program the cpu of the computer" to mine, but it wouldn't have enough power to actually generate shares or ever find a block, you'd literally just be wasting electricity. The reason for this, in simplified terms is that a CPU is designed to do many things, but only handle a few things at once (ie you have a 4 core cpu means it will do 4 things at once), its a general purpose kind of processor, a GPU on the other had is designed to do a much larger amount of things all at once (calculating 3D shapes, lighting, etc) and quickly, which makes it hundreds if not thousands of times better for a task like mining, but largely over kill for general purpose tasks like those done by the CPU. The next level up is ASICs, which are designed to do one thing EXTREMELY fast, in the case of mining they are programed to calculate hashes, they can not be re-purposed however so outside of their targeted single use they aren't useful for anything else. 
The way mining works, due mainly to how computing power and hardware advances over time, and the price of bitcoin doesn't go up nearly as fast, you will only be able to mine bitcoin if you use ASICs.  Previously GPUs where possible, and still are with other coins but because bitcoin is dominated by ASICs, a single CPU, or even a whole room full of CPUs is not going to be fast enough at hashing to contribute anything.
If you want to mine with a CPU there are very few options, mainly because anything a CPU can do a GPU can do much better, and once someone develops GPU mining for a coin it no longer becomes useful to mine with CPUs. 
If you look hard you might find a few that you can mine with only a CPU, you'll likely not earn enough to cover power costs, probably only a few cents a day but you can try. The 2 that I know of currently are [Aeoncoin]( and [MyriadCoin's]( Yescrypt algorithm.  Monero might also still work with CPU mining but Its largely moved to GPU mining.
You could try any of the other algorithms supported by [cpuminer-opt]( but most of them have too many GPU miners for it to be worth while.
[Minergate]( also has a usuable CPU miner with their software if you want to try it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:31:05

Yes, my Pi can literally do everything thing that 21.co's machine can, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. How does running a paid http proxy benefit from the mining chip?  I can receive micropayments just fine without it.
It's a free market for what exactly? Hotels already run pay-as-you go wifi proxies, and EVERYONE Hates them. I can do that if i want to, but why would i want to be "that guy" who charges people micropayments to use the internet... even if i owned a coffee shop, why would people go to it when they can use the wifi at mcdonalds or starbucks for free, or tether the cell phone they already pay for. Who is the targe audice for the services you think people are going to develop for this thing?  
I already use my raspi to control my ASICs for heating in the winter, I'd say thats pretty useful, it saves me from having to buy oil, keeps the house warm without running up the power bill with constant mining. Way more useful than any of the repackaged ideas I've seen people throwing around for 21in computers. Sure I'm using ASICs (antminers) with mine too, but the difference is they actually have a purpose in my case.

If you use BitInstant's bank deposit system you won't need to give any ID. I think bitfloor also allows anonymous bank deposits too. If you live in/near a big enough city then you could probably use localbitcoins too. I myself use both, receiving coins via bank deposits and then selling locally for USD.
 The hardest part is actually getting USD from selling bitcoins into your bank account without giving out a photo ID. I was for a short while using intersango without any need for identity documents, but they've since shut down their USD market.

Man, I miss bittorrent. ~~netflix~~ Cable TV is so expensive, especially since I have to pay extra for HBO just to watch Game of Thrones.

Hopefully you got an AMD GPU so you can mine altcoins and cash them out to get your bitcoin back.

Sorry to be a noob but how does one access this feature?

I run 4 USB ASICs on linux, Archlinux and Debian, but the distro doesnt really matter much since I compile cgminer from source. The USB miners are plug and play with the current version of cgminer.  
I find coinbase.com to be a very easy way to buy coins for USD. It has its down sides too (BTC is not available right away but price is locked), but it works well for me. 
And to add to what's already been said, Mining with an Nvidia card probably costs more in power than it will generate in BTC. My AMD 5770 machine is now close to negative returns and its hashing at around 200mh/s.

thanks for sharing this, the thread was very amusing


LOL, I don't code and I'm pretty sure if i sat down for a few hours I could figure out how to put a basic HTML5 app together without any extra people. Maybe he wanted the $5000 to hire a teacher or take a class in coding.
Thanks for helping the bitcoin community with your app GrainElevator.
