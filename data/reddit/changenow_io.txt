Thank you so much for this shoutout! 
We work just for this reason -- to know that someone uses our service and finds it fast and no-hassle! Stay tuned for our updates here on Reddit and on Twitter: [

Our priority is to make a refund possible for you and other users whose funds were subject to a replay attack.
We, on our side, warn our users about the danger of unsplit balances and encourage our partners to do the same. And we always do our best for our users and refund unsplit coins.
We’re sorry you have to experience this. There’s no doubt that you will be issued your refund, it just takes plenty of time to access these funds, but the probability to get access to them is 100%.  
Thank you for your patience!

I wanna an update on how much you've got there!
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:55:23
We’re sorry you’ve experienced any inconveniences while using our service.
Unfortunately, we can’t speed up the refund process: your BSV and BCH balances weren’t split before the exchange and were subject to a replay attack — the importance of splitting your coins before sending them anywhere is explained here in our FAQ  
The access to such funds on our side is only possible manually and requires a number of approvals by our financial department. We can’t give an exact ETA, which was stated by our support team and Atomic Wallet team as well. The total ETA in such cases is usually from 1 to 2 months. The approximate ETA in your case is 2 more weeks. We’ve got more than 100 successful refund cases of unsplit funds, and we do refund them in all the cases, though not all exchange platforms consider it possible or necessary to refund funds that were sent in an improper way.
Thank you for your patience, our support team will contact you as soon as your refund is processed!

Hey! Thank you for your feedback and your interest :-) We’re here to make it clear:
We don’t have mandatory KYC procedure, and registration is not required for performing swaps. 
However, we do have risk management system implemented which results in selective KYC checks. If for some reason your exchange is subject to it, we deal with every particular case as fast as we can.

Hello!  
Clearing this situation up.  
1. As a money services business, we comply with market standards and legal requirements that any legitimate exchange service must comply with, which obliges us to have AML and KYC implemented. This is clearly stated in our FAQ, our Terms of Use, and our Privacy Policy, and one automatically accepts them when using ChangeNOW. 
2. This client's (u/ni23457) activity was deemed suspicious by our risk management system. We asked him for his ID in order to pass KYC. He sent us a fake ID which prompted an investigation, during which his funds were placed on a cold wallet, only to be released when the situation clears up. 
3. The only step of the investigation left is the video verification procedure. We asked u/ni23457 to participate in a video call with his real ID to complete the KYC procedure. He has refused to cooperate so far, has been sending completely unbased defamatory messages everywhere, revealing our team members' personal data in various public spaces, harassing them and their friends and families on social media, and sending us threats. Despite everything, we're always open for communication, are constantly talking with him through our support, and would be happy to release his funds after the video call.

Considering Apple Card as a competitor to crypto would be going in the same direction as comparing Bitcoin to, say, PayPal or Visa. Pretty sure Apple Card was created to be a competitor of the latter.

On one hand, taxation might hinder mass adoption (why use crypto if it's just as taxable as fiat?) but on the other hand it might be useful to tax big miner units because of all the electricity they consume. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

@_date: 2018-10-30 21:36:40
I can definitely see Bitcoin being taxed possibly, but what about private coins like Monero or Zcash? You can't track the amounts of transactions carried out nor the owners of the funds sent. How would you tax something you don't have any kind of access to?

Thanks for mentioning it's fake I almost believed it...
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:44:53
That's fair. Also taxing income in crypto would make sense, I guess. Then again, you have to fugure out how to do that with, say, private coins, where you can't track the amount of funds moved from one wallet to another, as well as the owner(s) of said funds.

@_date: 2019-04-18 17:38:07
Look, man. I do see where you're coming from, OK? Our team got sentimental and our founders decided to make a donation to Notre Dame. We thought it would make sense to tell people that we are participating in the restoration of an important historical landmark and offer that people try it too. 
We understand that there's a ton of other awesome causes to contribute to and we will be considering those in the future. 
After the launch of our payment system we will be doing a lot of awareness work on how easy it is to accept crypto payments, and the service itself will be zero-fee. 
Again, do you think that donating to a certain cause that you personally don't like or think there are better causes out there makes us bad people?

Isn't that copyright infringement though?

Hey there,
Educating local communities is certainly a great idea, but we're located in Europe. As a private business, we're free to use our money where we see fit. 
However, creating a space for educating people on the beauty of crypto is awesome. u/ip_address_freely, feel free to email [polina if you'd like to have someone to bounce ideas off of. I'd be happy to help.

We are literally releasing a zero-fee payment service tomorrow to give small businesses an opportunity to accept crypto in a transparent and secure way - this is out of the scope of this conversation, though.
We made a donation - we wanted people to know about it. There's no reason to be unreasonably angry right now.
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:34:25

Hi! Thanks for your question. ChangeNow strives for the best user  experience and convenience of the interface. As a complex service, we work with a number of partners and trading platforms to bring the best rates to our customers. However, the transaction fees for fiat purchases depend on a transaction volume and a type of currency for conversion. To this point, the ability to buy crypto for fiat is in Beta version, that's why the rates may be different from the ones offered on major exchanges and the difference can reach up to 25%. We do have room for improvement and are planning to tune the service in compliance with community demands and needs. We'll appreciate any feedback, so feel free to leave it here or in DM.

Hello! I know this is a bit late, but I felt like it is necessary to clear up the situation. 
We had been anonymous up until April, when it was still possible for an exchange service like ours to offer our clients anonymity. After that, our policies have changed; welove our clients and are doing to make our service as easy to understand and operate as possible, however, due to market conditions and certain requirements from regulatory authorities, we had to implement selective KYC checks. After our recent policy changes, we no longer freeze our customers' funds in case of a failed KYC procedure - we simply refund them to the addresses they came from, subtracting the network fee. The user from the article, ni23457, has received his refund; the other one, Privcoin, we are still waiting for to turn to our support and confirm their refusal to pass the KYC procedure. 
The KYC procedure on ChangeNOW is normally fairly painless and, to be fair, doesn't happen very often. If you're a regular law-abiding citizen, you don't have to be afraid of KYC checks on ChangeNOW.

If you've read the article carefully, with your own eyes, you'd see that from 15 to 25% of miners still use non-renewable sources. They are mostly concentrated in places where cheap hydro/colar power isn't accessible - in Europe, for example, those are Russia and other post-Soviet countries, because the local leaders don't seem to believe in green energy. Doesn't do much on a global scale, of course, but locally the impact is insane.

Hello! It appears we are due an update on the situation.
There has been a incident with a hanging verification case. However, during all this time we were conducting an investigation, during which we were collecting information and consulting with lawyers on what would be the best way to handle this situation. Afterwards, we have made a decision to issue the client a refund, blacklist the deposit address, and make our policies more concise and understandable.
In our updated KYC policies, in case of a failed KYC procedure (if a client refuses to send an ID or any other reason) the deposited funds are returned to their owners. 
Overall, the KYC procedure on ChangeNOW is highly selective and doesn't happen often - if you're a law-abiding citizen, you have nothing to worry about since it's highly unlikely that you will be KYC'd.
You can read the whole statement here: [

If this is true, then we don't have anything to fear wrt the mining industry being harmful to the environment. However, we can't miss the fact that a fair amount of miners still operate on nuke/coal power, which isn't ideal. lso, to be honest, it's not like hydro power plants are super great for the environment.
