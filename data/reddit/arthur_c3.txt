The purpose of the index is to attempt to track (albeit imperfectly, for a few reasons) the return an investor would make by buying and holding a same amount of shares of each asset of the exchange. In other words, it tracks the average stock price on the market, so when it goes up, it means that stocks in general are going up, and vice versa. As an investor you basically want this index number to go up, not down...

Also I should mention, just to be clear, that the performance history displayed on my website corresponds to the net (after all fees) returns on investment.

I'm not disclosing which funds specifically I'm investing in (also it changes dynamically as their performances and risk profile change) -- but it includes ETFs and closed (non-tradeable) funds, some of which are not open to public investors.
It varies a lot for the fees. Usually it's between 1 and 2% management fee, and some of them have performance fees of 20% on the profit generated.

And the funds I invest in, invest in two main "types" of assets: crypto-currencies (btc-e.com, cryptsy.com, etc.), and stocks/bonds (from exchanges such as btct.co, bitfunder.com, crypstocks.com).

I'm not sure what you mean. The BTC index contains about 47 securities. And yes, an investor could buy a share of each one -- and that's exactly what the index is trying to track (minus the dividends).
