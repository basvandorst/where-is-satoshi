It is correct that there is no need for hubs, but I think they will arise naturally on the network from use of exchanges and other large services, where people looking to send their first LN transaction will be opening a channel to the exchange/service
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:06:17
The timelocked transaction is never broacast unless you or the other end broadcasts it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:29:13
I do. BitPay charges you **their** miner fee, and it's always higher than what it should actually cost them normally, and way higher than what it would cost them if they were using segwit.

Nothing is stopping you from downloading and compiling lnd and running it in mainnet mode.

I fully support the project. But nobody is using it right now.

I can only hope they get beat out. God knows I'll support other services that do it better than them, which won't be hard.

Samourai supports custom fees and uses segwit addresses by default.

Decentralized exchanges are cool and useful, but do not serve the same purpose as a payment provider
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:48:28
In a real-life scenario, I believe a likely case would be that the coffee shop wants to sell their Bitcoin, or otherwise use it, so they have a channel open to an exchange, or a service like BitPay (or a better alternative once it comes along).
Since the channel would be "in the direction to" the exchange/service, they would be able to receive payments through that channel.
Say the shop has a channel open to Gemini with a capacity of 1 BTC, and they've sent 0.5 BTC to Gemini through that channel to sell it. When you go to make a lightning payment through the LN, you would likely have a route to a large lightning hub like Gemini, who could then route your payment to the coffee shop. This would simply move some funds in that channel back to the coffee shop, so the new balance of the channel would be something like 0.4997 BTC on Gemini's side and 0.5003 BTC on the coffee shop's side.

Nobody wants to use mainnet yet because everyone wants to be entirely sure that they've ironed out all the bugs.

LN does not require a block size increase.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:15:38
It's not about the transactions being timelocked, but bugs that prevent you from being able to properly close channels or send transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:13:37
The lightning network is absolutely for small transactions. That's the whole point.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:36:07
If Bob doesn't have any wallet beforehand, when you send Bob his first transaction, it can be a channel opening transaction that includes your payment to him. That way it paves the way for Bob to be able to receive additional LN payments in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:29:04
It is if they're charging you a "network fee" to cover their transactions, and they don't even charge an accurate amount.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:55:28
Honestly if you have to ask, you probably shouldn't be setting up a lightning node on the mainnet. The reason it's discouraged is not only because it's difficult but also because breaking changes are still being made to the software, and there are plenty of situations where you can end up with coins lost forever still. Patience is a virtue.
If you really want to help, test it on testnet.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:19:20
For Coinbase, I believe they would use much less space just implementing batching. They could consolidate many on-chain withdraws into a single transaction, and because they have so many users, the delay between withdrawing and seeing the transaction on-chain would be minimal.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:38:36
Bitpay is the largest payment provider in use by companies. If I want to be able to pay with Bitcoin on many websites, which I do, I have to use them. Convincing companies to move away from bitpay will take a lot of effort and time and additional failures from bitpay.

I'm sorry that you don't fully understand how the lightning network works.


You do not give this money to Steam. In this situation, in the unlikely scenario that you do not already have an open channel (who that channel is to does not matter) you would open a channel to Steam, or anybody else really. This creates a transaction where any amount of money (doesn't have to be $100) is sent back to you. You can close this channel any time you want. The money is not sent to Steam, it is merely the "bandwidth" or capacity of the channel.


Your $100 is not locked, because it is available to you in your lightning channel. Assuming we live in a world where merchants accept lightning network payments, as you have because you're sending money to Steam in this case, that money is available for you to send to anybody on the Lightning Network. In any case, it's no more "locked" than any other amount of Bitcoin anywhere else. It has significantly more freedom because it is in a position where you can make instant fee-free payments with it.
The Lightning Network is fantastic because it drastically increases scalability and reduces fees. Your lightning channel can remain open nearly indefinitely, and once you get close to the capacity of your channel you can simply "refill" it by having lightning transactions sent back to you, i.e. from an exchange or other wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:08:32
This is a slightly technical, but very helpful explanation of how the network operates: 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:16:51
I don't like BitPay because they
- Charge you their network fee, which is usually higher than they would need to pay for a transaction. This tacks on another $10-$30 to your invoice
- Don't support segwit, which would:
  - Free up more space in blocks because they process a significant amount of transactions, lowering fees for everybody
  - Allow them to charge you less for their network fee that they charge you. (This is not the miner fee that you pay when you send your transaction to them. This is **their** miner fee that they pay, and they don't want to pay it so they make you pay it instead).
- Are onboard with coinbase and support BCH, which has dubious people behind it.

I can't wait for the freedom and possibilities that the lightning network, atomic swaps and all the other upcoming technology will bring.
I've compiled and run lnd and roasbeef's fork of btcd and I've used it to run my own testnet lightning node and send coins back and forth between friends and htlc.me. Very excited for what 2018 holds.

No, we're blaming him for not using the solution we have to a problem.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:19:48
A lot of people have answered your question already but I would like to point out that afaik, channel factories will allow you to close your current channel and open a new one in the same transaction, meaning that if you ever need to re-balance your channel on-chain, you can do it in a single transaction instead of two.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:03:53
High fees are not a good thing. What the core developers value is keeping the block size small to keep running a full node accessible to as many people as possible, and not using "band-aid" changes that only work for a short time, opting for long-term fixes instead. A block size increase is a short term fix.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:23:01
I don't agree with everyone in the space. If somebody is saying fees should be that high I don't agree with them. But I do think there's a reason behind less incredibly breaking updates (like the kind of hard fork a block size increase would require). Every time you do something like that, you have to get *everybody* to start using the new code. Bitcoin has a massive user base. That kind of stuff is difficult. Segwit was nice because it's backwards compatible for clients, and we can implement lightning network without a hard fork.

Decentralized exchanges like Bisq already make use of multisig wallets, I think payment channels are unnecessary, but I suppose could be helpful for people that want decentralized exchanges AND frequent trades.

IIRC change is still sent to legacy addresses

My mistake. I've edited my post.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:37
If you talk about it like that, everyone supports segwit. Segeit addresses are just P2SH addresses, which have always been in the protocol. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to send to them from anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:58:27
SegWit is not difficult to use in wallets that support it. It's no different than normal addresses from the user's perspective. See the ledger wallet, segeit addresses on exchange, etc.
Lightning Network will not be difficult for users. Payment channel opening will be automated with systems such as LND's autopilot and made user friendly with easy to understand interfaces. See the Zap client.

It could be possible without any changes now, if you scan a qr with a link to a third party service which converts the currency amount to Bitcoin then opens a Bitcoin URI. Theoretically this would allow you to scan the code on your phone then it would open a wallet app with the amount and address filled in

Hey, as someone who read the Storj white paper I'd like to raise a counterpoint: **The whitepaper explicitly states that payment can be made in any form you like**. Right now the platform is still in early development and StorjLabs runs the only bridge. This means that if you want to store data you pay them directly and they pay the farmers. However, once other people set up bridges and nodes, you will be able to pay the farmers who store your data with any payment method they accept.
