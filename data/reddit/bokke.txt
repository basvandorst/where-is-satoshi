Ok, fine, minimum of 23.8 transactions @ 0.042 BTC :D
thanks for the insight though, I'll have a read, ta very muchly.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:14:39
I...like big bits and I cannot lie, you other brothers can't deny.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:42:04
I think you're dreaming, but hey, who am I to tell you otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:58:47
Ye, but aren't one of the shitcoins going to be the new bitcoin? See, we still have a chance.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:25:58
So if you never sell and BTC loses all traction and disappears into nothingland. So I never sold and I still lose. Your point is not valid. People should make decisions based on what they feel comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:46:35
If the dip is deep enough that they buy back in in the new year and still profit, they're not fools. Just saying.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:48:12
Invest in something else.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:50:54
Proof or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:18:03
What on earth are you talking about.
We already have 1 dollar = 100 cents - how is this any different?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:22:48
From what I've read, that's an indicator that the upward trends will now become downward trends, right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:31:04
So are you saying this isn't a shoulder head shoulder pattern?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:04
I think the word soon is an overstatement. You don't forget about a brand 'soon' - walk down the street and ask someone if they know about Bitcoin. The answer is yes, they've heard about it. Ask them if they know about Monero or Dash? That's a tumble weed  moment right there. So, ye, soon hey, I think not.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:47:26
We're going deep. I hope you have some tissues ready
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:48:35
The same thing happened last Xmas and New Year too, the price plummeted and then again after a short bull trap. Be Careful! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:54:15
In other news, water is wet. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:54:52
You and everyone else, don't stress. You may think you're the only one losing a bucket load of money, but you're not. You'll get your money back, but you'll have to now wait a long time. Unless of course, you bought at 19k then I suggest you pray, my friend, pray hard.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:50:11
or you could sell and cut your losses. life is too short to stress over money. if you lose a couple grand, so what, your health is far more important.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:54:24
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:34:55
Why not both? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:55:15
the majority of Bitcoiners will gloss over this point. You get greedy, you lose. Extracting small amounts to live your life is a very good and valid thing to do. No good having all that money and not spending it, simply because you might drop dead tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:34:53
Sure, but you would have sold them all when it hit $100, and you would still be kicking yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:57:31
Oh, go on then. 1 BTC minimum though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:00:59
No, please explain?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:43:43
 I get that you want to be rich because you bought a bucket load more of your favorite coin, we all do, but I think you're wrong. To say bitcoin won't exist is naive and shortsighted. Bitcoin is a brand, however, the technology behind bitcoin will evolve into something completely different than what we know it as today. Mark my words, bitcoin will be used as a daily currency whether you like it or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:53:06
Bitcoin is 9 years old. It's had plenty of time for someone to poke many sticks at it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:33:20
It would fall quicker to $1 than it would rise to $100k. I think $1 tomorrow is far more accurate. I hope not, for the sake of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:03:26
Only you can answer that question. is the money you want to invest something you can afford to lose? If yes, invest. if no, stay clear!
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:29


Ye, good luck with that. The only way to forget about your coins is to buy and do not look at any charts! As soon as you see mass panic, you'll panic. That's my advise to you.

" The patent also notes that transaction latency could be eliminated by having user funds custodied by the payment network itself, allowing Square to simply update its internal ledger rather than writing any transactions to the blockchain. "  
How is that decentralized?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:14:50
Because it's easy come, easy go, little (actually a lot) high, little low

Play silly games, win silly prizes. I hope he extracts some of it before the inevitable correction. Otherwise he'll have to wait a while to enjoy it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:04:11
Was or is?

Crypto will evolve to implement security measures and protect your money. It is still in its infancy. Unlike a commodity, the software can be developed to make it as good as we need it to be, if not better.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:46:25
You would have sold them all for $1000 each and still be in the same boat. Don't sweat it. Buy in if you still believe in the technology, even if a smaller amount. Who knows what the future holds. You might be saying the same thing in 10 years. 
I had 0.00001000 and I sold them to pay rent!

Why doesn't he just setup a wallet and accept donations of any amount, after all, this is a I'm sure a few here have some spare.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:37:34
Or a single investor in both. In that case, allow me to offer a shoulder and some tissues.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:53:08
Losing gains is not the same as losing your investment. How much are you down on your initial investment? That's the answer we want.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:42:31
I felt sorry for you, now I don't . :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:49:02
You go down with the ship. If someone is stupid enough to invest more than they're willing to lose then they're idiots. If you have only invested what you're comfortable losing with then holding should make absolutely sense and should not create stress. Boggles my mind how many people do not heed that advice. It's said so repetitively that it's hard to miss
