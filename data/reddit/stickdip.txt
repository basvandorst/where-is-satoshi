Because standard transactions like a cup of coffee or buying gas shouldn't be as difficult to deal with as hundredth's and thousandth's of a number.  even though our money in the US and UK is closer to 1, the majority of the world has currency in the 1,000's. $100 is $4236 Rubles, $13089.98 Rupes, $1350 Pesos, all of which are easier to deal with than .00347.

Sorry. Should have scrolled through your comment history. You're habitually mean on reddit, resulting in lots of down votes. Sorry for wasting our time. Cheers.

You don't look at the price of things? You just scan and go?

But you'd have to agree that the common every day small purchases should be easier to deal with than hundredth's and thousandth's of a number, right? Why should you have to figure out how many zeros go after the decimal but before the important numbers just for buying gas?

Agreed. I don't like using "no one" anyway. I can never remember if noone  is a word or not.

So if anyone has dealt with new business revolving around new hardware, it is well known that how much you get out of the product in the early stages depends on how well the business supports the product. You can't take the thing to the genius bar or call the geek squad to manage the break\fix, so you're taking an inherent risk when going in on a system like this.
The saving grace to new products and early out-of-the-gate purchases is that vendors and manufacturers also know how much the customer is going to rely on you. That said, Jordan knew full well what he was getting into from start to finish here. I'll be he deals with this stuff every day. I'll also bet he's overwhelmed with similar issues from other customers. It's how well you respond to the issues that matters most. He responded very, very poorly here. Taking a loss for issues like this should be considered in the business plan from the get go; he also needs to rationalize the difference between lawyering up and owning up.

Very well written. Google docs with images are way better than imgur captions.

Why is he an idiot? And why on earth would you insult a person willing to venture or risk invest money into a product which will ultimately gain awareness of bitcoin and help build a business structure surrounding something we are fans of?
I'm guessing if he did this to support Bitcoin he and his partners aren't exactly making their kids skip breakfast so he can spend money on toys; he's got the cash. Just because you don't have the investment capital to have fun doesn't mean he should be insulted for doing so. If I had an extra 25k I'd use it in the same way.
Your response to this situation is bad for all of us. He's wanted to support Bitcoin, dude. You are the idiot.

Damnit, 5, again? Look man, we have good times, but you've got to slow down. I'm not saying quit, I'm just saying take it easy on yourself, bro. People are noticing.

Maybe, just maybe, regulated markets exists because of scamming? Maybe.
