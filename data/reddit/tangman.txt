I was being colorful with the words; in the sentence "debt" would more precisely refer to the debt-money system as a whole.
Indeed, in real terms it makes debt unbearable which causes loans to default.  This sets off a chain reaction, where loan defaults lead to money destruction, margin calls, further deflation, and more loan defaults.  If left unchecked it could destroy all over-leveraged parties in the economy (basically, most of the parasitic financial &amp; banking sector).  This is why deflation is the enemy of a debt-money system, and why a central bank with infinite money creation capabilities is a prerequisite for today's debt-money system.
In contrast, the current practice of "shrinking" debt, inflation, only replaces current debt with *more* debt.

Such is the mind of the banker who has his eye on Joe's ability to repay his loans, should Joe ever take a pay cut in nominal terms.  In an economy where every unit of currency is a unit of debt that must be paid back with interest, deflation is like the medicine that wipes away the cancer of debt.

In the long run money is neutral anyways.  People can always adjust for inflation or deflation as long as it remains stable.
The real issue is of course DEBT.  When you have a monetary system that forces everybody to use debt as money, and hopes to collect interest on the tremendous debt-money supply, deflation is a problem because it makes loans more difficult to repay.  Deflation destroys the banking system's monopolistic, parasitic grasp on the economy, and that's why deflation is poison.
