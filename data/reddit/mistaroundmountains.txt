When is lightning network coming? What steps need to take place?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:25:13
I agree all the alt coin demand 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:23
I’m perplexed as well

What’s driving everything down right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:07:43
Wall Street buying for exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:18
What! How?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:48
Please explain?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:41
What moving average does it always bounce back on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:18:12
Can you explain... what does a tall vs short green vs red wall mean?

Segwit2x compatible with lightning network? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:01:54
Why would they say we need Segwit2x if lightning network solves the speed problem? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:16:06
This is bitcoins weakness.. why don't we split them more so people can use larger numbers when transacting? 
I'm not talking about dilution.

@_date: 2017-08-25 03:49:38
Is the lightning network compatible with segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:03:18
Super dumb question: does Lightning solve the transaction speed issue with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:01:08
Does this mean transactions will be super fast? And reduced fees?

Homeland security chief brought it up? Seems like a way for them to justify control
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:01:27
I still don’t know how to use the lightning network...
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:50:48
Please don't put all of your pay... 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:17:17
Dumb question... does this lower fees? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:11:48
