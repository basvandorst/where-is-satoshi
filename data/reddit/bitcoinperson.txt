No words of wisdom from a business perspective, but a big good luck to you! I think what you are doing is great for bitcoin awareness as well as for the community you will be servicing.
One note on your site: Perhaps updating the graphics on the top of the page to be more bitcoin-centric? I'm no photoshop guru, but I could try and help you make a few banners for your rotating images to promote what your services are. This way any new user that finds your site will see immediately what your site is about.
Also, a bit of SEO work on your site could help you get more hits on your site. For example, your homepage title is the name of your site, but since you are very specific in what  your site is about, you could include the mention of Albuquerque and bitcoin, so search engine results show that and increase traffic from there. PM me if you have any questions!

How would this work, end to end (really asking)? I'm not a finance person so I'm looking for a genuine answer if possible.
* Example 1: I buy 1 bitcoin which costs me $100 at the time. I decide to cash out of it and now it is worth $105. Do I get taxed on the $5 gain? 
* Example 2: I buy 1 bitcoin through coinbase and later sell it through mtGox. Do I get tax on gains, even though it came from different websites? Will the fact that different sites and exchanges use different methods of values of bitcoin factor into the ACTUAL gain/loss of my purchase?

I really like the idea! 
One thing though: Unless I am totally missing this on the screen, you should display the enemy's life as well. Of all the TD games I've played, you always see the enemy HP. This helps you determine if you have time to build defense, or if sending one more creep could finish the enemy.

+1 for me too. I sold 1 bitcoin on the 29th of October. It says completed and that it would of been delivered by Nov 1st, but I don't see anything.

I ordered 2 of their wallet cards 3 weeks back. Got them about a week later, but I haven't used them yet. 
As far as reliability, yes they ship their product. As far as use, keep in mind that the empty wallet cards are supposed to be a one-time paper wallet. This is best used for the long  haul, where you want to store a large amount of bitcoins but don't want to use them anytime soon. When you are ready to redeem, you follow the instructions on the card to load your paper wallet onto a service (blockchain.info, coinbase, etc) where you can start to send and spend your bitcoins.
Hope this helps!

I followed the transactions and it looks interesting. The address it was sent to then sent that balance to two other addresses. If you track those addresses down, they also keep doing a forked balance split by sending to two other addresses. I am not very good at digging deep into this stuff though, so maybe someone else has an idea of what is happening.
