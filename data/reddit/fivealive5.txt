This is really not a good time to be selling, unless you really need the money right now I would advise waiting.

How on earth does this create jobs?  It takes what, 1 employee per 500 servers, if even?  This just creates a ton of money for whoever owns this place, and most likely kickbacks for whatever govt employee approved the grant.

Not that anyone cares to know details, but starbucks out sources their wifi to AT&amp;T, level3, and google.  There are two different vendors who install and maintain the equipment, one is Vital Network Services and the other is Accuative.  Vital uses freelancers from an online market place that are barley screened and pays the lowest rates in the industry. I would not be surprised at all if one of the Vital techs set this up.  Either way there is no scenerio in which anyone from starbucks has legit access to the equipment.  
*edit* I just noticed this is in Argentina, still my point is this is not the doing of Starbucks corporate, but of whoever they hired down there for wifi.

I was GPU mining with a high end gaming rig prior to mt gox even being a thing.  I honestly don't even recall bitcoins having an official USD value attached to them at all back then, let alone having a place to sell them at.  A new battlefield game came out that got me back into gaming so I stopped mining and just abandoned my coins.  I also remember having some paranoia about bitcoin being a possible scam and my mining software being a front for some hackers botnet.  Seriously, there wasn't a lot of information on bitcoin back then so it was hard to know.  I have no regrets though, how was I suppose to know those coins I abandoned would be worth millions in 10 years.   No one saw that coming.

Imagine if one of the tulips had a set amount and somehow it was impossible to grow more of them, if that was somehow true, then maybe that particular tulip could be compared to bitcoin, problem is that tulip doesnt exist therefore the comparison is foolish anyway you want to look at it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:58:53
Yes I do!  I did that as well

Split up your buys and spread them out.  Look up dollar cost averaging.

Instant upvote for clarifying real Bitcoin vs Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:39
Right and there is a finite number of bitcoins ever, huge difference.  Were talking about speculation, if you know another harvest will happen that makes a difference.  After the last bitcoin gets mined thats it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:01:17
They would have a short position to hedge the mining operation.  This is actually the original reason futures were created, they were meant for people who produce goods to be able to hedge against a bad crop year.  So as an example, if your a bitcoin miner you could put 10% of your money into a future contract shorting your product in-case something crazy happens.  But believe me, they don't want that to happen, they would rather bitcoin go up because that is where the other 90% of there money is.

If someone already has a bunch of bitcoin and wants to live off it then yes of course.  They have to cash some out to pay bills anyway, and every time you turn BTC into USD you owe taxes, so yes of course they would want to pay bills in BTC whenever possible.

Let them spread the FUD so we can buy cheap.  In the end the truth will win out.

bcash is becoming bcrash
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:22
Not really, they would just make these guys even bigger whales.  There is a finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist and these guys already own huge chunks of it.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:34:15
So these guys have all this money invested in mining bitcoin, are sitting on piles of bitcoin, and you think they want to conspire to crash the price of it?  Just stop and think about what your proposing.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:22:36
One thing grows from the ground in unlimited quantities and the other has a finite limit of how many will ever exist.  It is foolish to compare the two under any circumstances.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:12:20
Everyone I know who mines is making money.  I would be willing to bet everyone saying otherwise does not actually mine.

I grow one tulip and I mine one bitcoin, I loose both, I regrow my tulip just as easy as before, mining my bitcoin however is now exponentially harder and if my timing ia late not even possible.  It will always be possible to grow another tulip and the difficulty will never increase.  I can always grow another tulip therefore they are unlimited, why they all have to exist at one time is some nonsense you or somele brought up not me, not all bitcoins are available at one time either, this is neither here nor there and has very little to do with the fact that comparing bitcoins to tulips is foolish and shows a lack of understanding what bitcoin actually is.

I get what your saying, however its just mental gymnastics.  It makes no difference if you use USD or BTC to buy the car, at the end of the day you could have bought BTC to hold with that USD instead of the car and your in the same spot.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:21:52
That's the point, buy when its down sell when its up.  No one knows what the bottom or top will be so its usually safest to be buying during a downward movement and selling during an upward movement.

Because people only make like 1 USD per day in a lot of countries.  But do you really want to retire in the third world?  Actually, maybe, but I still would want 1st world money so I could live like a king. lol

agreed but the marketcap is so much bigger now that comparing current btc to btc of the past is apples/oranges.

People need to understand that parabolic growth is not a good sign, ever.  Corrections like this are a good thing!  It gives me a lot more confidence in my investment.  I was getting a bit worried that it was taking so long for this correction to happen and I had a big sigh of relief when it did, then proceeded to buy more to increase my holdings!  errr, hodlings!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:08:40
you only lost if you sold, and if you sold you deserve the loss, sorry.

Both sides are just speculative bs.  No one has a clue where its going and thats why everyone will eat up whatever article that attempts to predict it.

I'm happy about it, I was waiting for a good buy day and this was it.  I was super close to pulling the trigger at 8200 but I second guessed myself and ended up buying at the first rebound when it was 8700, its now back down a bit but I don't even care, I was ready to buy at anything below 10k, and under 9k I really feel like I got a bargain!
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:31:40
This ship is going to 17k once again.  Lol, both statements are equally speaking out of ones ass. Honestly, I don't think it will drop to 3k but I would be thrilled if it does.  I want to buy up as much of this finite pie as I can get.
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:48:48
Your right, and I meant to put bitcoin.com not btc.com
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:47:58
The BCH community doesn't care because Roger Ver ([btc.com]( was one of the miners and they would rather blindly trust him as an authority over the network vs having something truly decentralized.
