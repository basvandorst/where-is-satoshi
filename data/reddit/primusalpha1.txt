Price is important but i am facinated by sentiment such as on bittsanalytics, there i mange more than 200+ crypto coins

If you put plain faith beside, much more value could be made using super HODL -SHODL -&gt;Stay long strategical but use active tactical allocation
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:05:47
is it possible to attach picture to comment?

From our experience we know that market goes from different stages. what we are noticing at the moment is uncorrelated moments of different currencies. If go beyond HODL, much more money can be make on risk adjusted level. Since more and more people are joining the party universe is changing "we are not in Kansas anymore". Thus is vise to look for additional information advise to be on top of the game. Sentiment analytic platform can help you on the way.

It is always some feedback loop but often it is egg before the chicken. If you focus on sentiment shifts you can notice some really nice hints, some examples is on this link:

Time runs fast in crypto world :). It feels 1 crypto day is 10 normal day. And more exchanges are open 24/7
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:21:49
My experience is that trends/either google or twitter or any social media is just one part of the story. What goes on top of it is sentiment analytic. Especially sentiment change. I do not know how close are you with financial vocabulary but sentiment change of the market can be good Beta predictor and sentiment change compare to overall market is actual an ingredient for pure alpha. 
I have to admit is not a perfect fitting but... if intelligent mind or smart algorithm can extract a lot of value from the data.   
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:49:35
Because of exactly that point, in a hype it is important if you want to play the crypto hot potato game that you drop the HODL attitude and focus more on fundamentals of price moment. On the other hand, the tokanization is great refreshment in capital allocation. Old stock market or "partia" system has somehow lost steam.

Thank you, for comprehensive factor analysis, will write it down. I will for sure need some luck and courage to catch the falling knife. hope is more buy on dip :)

Based on my 10y+ experience in finance I would be very careful when making investment decision on charts. The logic reminds me on my first years in business. I tell my rookies to go beyond charts into the content. Factor influencing crypto is for sure sentiment, you can track more than 200+ currencies on a platform such as  for example to save the time at least if not money.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:59:56
Hope in understand your point, i am really discovering a game change. Thus i am more focusing on tactical drifts, focusing on correlations and relationships among different currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:10:13
We believe it is our mission in crypto universe. To share and care to each other in order to lift communities up. To go beyond pump and dump. Or to find it and take advantage of it
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:52:43
:), it is true, i am new here and thought people are more serious or naive, i will adjust...
thank you for quick wake-up call 
but never the less i still think that crypto in slowly entering new stage, here HODL is somehow gone
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:04:03
We are noticing sentiment is stacked at 0.2 lvl and gives appearance of culling down the hype
Regarding the mentions, having wider recognition, i would expect more mentions.
Especially taking account the "commodity" status of the currency. To watch it happen it is important to focus on price unrelated mentions such as i paid my train ticket using Bitcoin etc.

I would say it is more headline bias. People like blood. And in time of correction there is a lot of it. I have very live memory from the financial meltdown.
But on bitcoin... volume of mentions means... it gets wider recognition... and recognition could lead to increase of demand... since supply is almost fixed...
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:15:20
would be nice to see more such actions confirmed in practice

Why would i need to respond to your comment as a joke? I appreciate any response, good and bad, and unfortunately you are not the only one on reddit reading my posts.

Thank you for your feedback. I will tray to do that. Since it is a manual process we post interesting charts on tweeter first and i attach a link to my reddit account. I am new on this platform and i have to learn a lot.

If you loose money trading BTC it is not me to blame. You can easily skip my posts and save your self time for spamming my posts. You might be better off searching for factors influencing BTC instead of HODL.

You would be surprised how robust the algorithm is. It is a nice additional factor in decision making and not as a magic bowl. 
What we have experienced is that sentiment move is strong factor influencing the movement. It often start to move before actual pump and dump happen

and to answer thejlb i am putting it up to give alternative and holistic view on the market situation
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:42:46
My intention is spread that sentiment analysis is important factor when it comes to investing in crypto coins and tokens.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:27:57
When i am looking for making the investment i try to search for factors which influence price movement. If i find one or two it is great. Than i focus on assigning probability of winning. If odds are in my favor i jump in and hope for the best. Thus it is important to have the best tools available.

One line from financials markets: bulls makes money, bears makes money and pigs gets slaughtered. 
Still questioning myself, where hodl qualifies 
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:19:30
LOL, will research and hope you are not referring to the final battle, where hodlers are dumped. I write a lot about SHODL - smart HODL
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:14:24
and a lot is price dependent
