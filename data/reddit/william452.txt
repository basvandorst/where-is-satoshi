Just trying to figure out how this bot works, heh. Got it wrong twice before it worked

He dosen't mean it like that. 10% is not the credit card processing rate, it's simply the percentage of your gross income that's taken by the rate.
If you took in $1000 and paid $700 for the goods, you're left with $300. However, if you had to pay 3% processing to accept the $1000, you just paid $30 on $300 profit, meaning a 10% decrease in profits.

Money from internet startups that I got lucky with.

Why $200 at once to someone who already holds a bunch of bitcoins? Why not spread it to a bunch of others in or maybe even posts?
I mean, if they goal is to spread awareness, shouldn't you target people who aren't already extremely well-versed in bitcoin? I'm not saying that you shouldn't have, since it's obviously your own money, but I'm just curious as to why you chose to do this.

I don't spend my parent's money, but thanks for making assumptions

17 years old, $9000 at $161.22 when averaged over a couple weeks. I think I'll hold and forget

I would be interested in purchasing your site. I already own multiple steam-based sites and communities, as well as being an owner and user of bitcoin. PM me to discuss, if you're interested.
