After going through your post history, about 500 comments worth ... You really seem like you may need some help. 
I'm not sure if you are feeling that threatened by Dogecoin or what but you, my friend, need some help.
You say you don't visit their subreddit, but if anyone was to pay attention to your post history they would know that is a lie. In fact, I bet you have some invested in Doge as well. At least if you were as smart about cryptocurrencies and investing as you claim to be you would.
My last advice to you would be to use RES and filter the bot and hell, even the word "Dogecoin" since you get so butt hurt about it. 
Look at your post history and the massive amount of downvotes, either:
A) You are in the minority of the way you think and your hatred to Dogecoin. In which case you should step back and open your eyes to how blatantly stupid you are being and how you sound like a little bitch.
B) All your comments about Dogecoin not being a huge subreddit are wrong. Surely if the "Doge Army" was downvoting you the big, bad, awesome, massive Bitcoin army would have your back and negate the downvotes, no?
Get over yourself.
