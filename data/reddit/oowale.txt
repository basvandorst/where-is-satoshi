Update: I've been using them for while now and they seem reliable (for card deposits and withdrawals). For bank accounts? not really!

They're probably getting paid by exchanges like cex.io for "A" reviews.
I've had my ~$9k stuck there (Cex.io) for 43 days, tried to withdraw after 32 days, they claimed my withdrawal details were incorrect. asked them to credit my usd back to my cex account so I could by btc and get out of their scammy exchange, but they've asked me to wait ever since and they've been giving excuses not to return my money ever since
There's more, they have a 3.9/10 rating on cex.io and at the bottom of their website they're claiming "79 of last 100 users satisfied"

They're doomed to fail/Gox in the long run (if they keep these withdrawal problems up).
A whooping 50 bucks on withdrawals yet they're taking months to process one, they think users are going to come back???

I'm okay with paying $25 for the swift doc (my bank charges around the same). But where I'm suspicious is they've replied my emails after I requested for a doc but they didn't give me details on how to pay the $25 which means they're planning to reduce my withdrawal by $25 for the swift fee *which means the money hasn't been sent yet like they claimed* (CHECK UPDATE ABOVE).
Without the swift document to verify that they've truly sent the money, I'll be concluding that I've been scammed - already reported to UK's police fraud dept.
Exchanges like these are the real threat to bitcoin not hard-forks or the guys.

That's what I thought, but they asked me to wait.

If you're considering cex &amp; reading this. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAMMY EXCHANGE!.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:31:45
*NO* I don't
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:16:52
Any updates on yours?
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:27:18
Dude, stay away from cex.io. You're going to regret using them in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:24:16
*very crappy exchange*
I've been waiting 30 days for a ~9k USD transfer, nothing yet.
According to them "withdrawals can take 20 banking days". I'll be waiting some more before reporting to the Authorities.
Lesson Learnt!

Got this four days ago:


1) you will provide us correct account number and your funds will be send back to your bank account.  
2) your payment could be returned back to your CEX.IO account.  
We kindly ask you to choose one of the suggested options.
Asked them to return it back to my cex account, still waiting on it.
Any updates on your withdrawal ?

I transferred some Bitcoins to the [Cex.io!]( exchange  | on the 8th of June and requested for a withdrawal  to my Polish account on the very same day. It's been 33 days and I still haven't gotten a hold of my money.
[Tons of other users are also having the same problems](

I have no idea why a swift document should take 2-3 working weeks and a transfer should take MORE THAN A MONTH when a transfer from my bank in West Africa to my polish account takes less than 24 hours.  
I'll be needing the swift document.  
You have to understand that I just can't keep mute about a 9kUSD transfer while I suspect some kind of foul play. I'll be waiting one extra "working week" before reporting to the Police &amp; Financial Conduct Authority in the UK &amp; the Police in Poland.  
Thanks.

I requested for a simple swift withdrawal that shouldn't take more than 48 hours at most, I didn't ask for the money to be sent by courier. They're asking me to pay $25 extra and wait 3 Whole weeks for a swift document after charging a $50 withdrawal fee at inception.
I've reported this to the UK's actionfraud police dept already.

That's uplifting to hear :)

You Should!, you wouldn't give $10k to a stranger for a month would you?
