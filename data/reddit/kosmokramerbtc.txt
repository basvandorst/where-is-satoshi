This calculator used to be the best and has exactly what you're asking for, but it appears to be offline at present:

PM sent! I'm trying to interpret your title - is there a promotion for the first 10 customers? Or are you just asking for 10 orders? :)
@_date: 2013-06-19 07:01:42
I am 'RunBTC' and your happy transaction was with me :)
You're right; I no longer sell these on coingig (various reasons, some which are touched on in this thread) but have a unanimously positive following on both BitMit and BitcoinTalk under the handle "kosmokramer". Happy to help you in any way that I can!!
@_date: 2013-06-23 05:51:17
Happy hashing Stephen!! I guess there's no need for a block erupter now, haha!

I've had similarly crappy experiences with Coinabul ... never again!! 
I placed my first order with Amagi Metals just a couple weeks ago (paid with BTC) and it still hasn't shipped, nor has Amagi informed me of any delay or stock issue. Any ideas?
My large order includes a single Bradley Manning coin that was listed as in-stock at the time and I just wanted as a novelty; however, I can no longer find it on their website. It may be what's holding up my order, but I'm blown away that they wouldn't contact me telling me this!
I'll wait until this is resolved to provide a review of my first experience with them, but I sure wish they would communicate a bit better in the mean time.

If anyone is looking for a trustworthy seller of this hardware, find me on BitMit or BitcoinTalk. You won't find a user selling them who has better feedback. I actually am the one who sold the OP the real ones (coingig user 'RunBTC') but I no longer sell on coingig for various reasons. 
I'm out of stock at the moment but working with ASICMiner to get more in stock ASAP.

Ah yes, but you're neglecting to consider future technologies. If we thought this way when people were mining with CPUs, imagine what the calculated dollar value would have been based on only THAT technology with today's difficulty? A year or two ago, someone could have said the same thing..."Do you know how many millions of dollars in CPUs it would take to face a difficulty of 26,000,000?!? NOT GONNA HAPPEN!"
You're essentially saying the same thing ... "Do you know how many millions of dollars in ASICs it would take to face a difficulty of 1.2 Billion?!? NOT GONNA HAPPEN!"
Hard to predict the future, but like I said, where there's money to be made, you can bet someone is going to find a way. What's after ASICs ...

Are you serious? If this is the official BitPay account, I would encourage you to review ticket  I have it in front of me.
At 7:16pm on May 30 I was aware of what you were requiring and commented on the ticket:
"I’m happy to provide you with all of this documentation that you’ve requested. I have a passport, utility bill, and articles of organization for my LLC that I can send to you – please advise a secure way to send."
The very next day, at 5:19pm on May 31, after not hearing back, I responded again:
"I have not heard back regarding my message from yesterday – is there anything else you need from me to get this going? We need to get this store up and running – was hoping to have it up by the weekend. Thanks!"
And then the last thing I ever heard from you guys was June 3, a very vague response:
"With high dollar items we require an EV SSL certificate."
I apologize - if you just expected me to email you those documents, you should have said so. But I don't just assume that your email or ticketing system, which I have no control over, is a secure transmission method. You should really review that ticket and see how I was attempting to follow-up with you guys after never hearing responses. In addition, I've now called and emailed Paige several times; if there was something you needed, it was NEVER brought to my attention. And "three times by my count"? I'm looking at the support ticket and I see one and only one request for that information, 6:09pm on May 30. Where/how/when were these other two requests made? 
I would just like to add, you've now made another request for my documentation, but again failed to tell me how to submit it. Don't you agree that if you're going to ask for the submission of sensitive information, it might be wise to provide clear instructions on how to safely do so? I have the highest level of verification on both Mt. Gox, CampBX, and BitMit, and all three of them made it VERY clear how to securely send them such documents.

Got it - this was the item I was trying to order: 
@_date: 2013-06-21 23:52:49
You can also buy them from me - trusted ASICM reseller in the US. I happen to have just a few to ship out tomorrow. ASICM appears to be out of stock at the moment so this may very well be the only way to get new block erupters shipped out ASAP!
@_date: 2013-06-19 06:39:45
Can I clear something up here? I am user "RunBTC" and I sure as hell hope I'm not being labeled as a scammer. 
I shipped real, new USB ASICs that I sold on coingig. 
I no longer sell on coingig because I find their service to be inferior to BitMit and their fees too high. I now do all of my business on BitMit and BitcoinTalk under the handle "kosmokramer" and I have an impeccable following. 
Trying to get more shit in stock because customers are absolutely floored with my service and that makes me happy. 
Please do not insinuate that I'm a scammer, glassuserr.  Read the customer's complaint and his response below. I will reconsider giving coingig my business when the fees are a bit more inline with BitMit. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:31:10
I had the same suspicion, but couldn't find any dirt on them. If nothing else, I wanted a post here with their URL so next time someone tries to search for them, this discussion is here. Would have saved me some time :)
@_date: 2013-07-02 08:49:52
How about some more codes!
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:52:42
Worked! Paid through BitPay and now order status says "pending". Is that what you expect? Love the website!!
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:56:29
Do they have a cart tool ([similar to BitPay's]( I really don't need a complicated website. Just selling one product right now. I'd love to just work with a payment processor that fits these two simple criteria:
1.) Has friendly, responsive customer support
2.) Has a shopping cart interface that I can drop onto my website
I'm a simple guy selling just a single product right now. I thought BitPay fit those criteria, but perhaps not.
**EDIT**: I just signed up for a BIPS account and it seems pretty basic, unless I'm missing something. No shopping cart - mostly just functionality that can be accessed via their API. Is BitPay truly the only payment processor that has cart functionality built-in??
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:34:43
I ordered from BitMunchies and received my order (drop-shipped from Wal-Mart) in a few days. If I found something I needed again that was competitively priced, I would not hesitate to order again.
@_date: 2013-06-08 06:24:34
Holy buckets! Then I'm charging waaaaay too little for [mine]( I worry for that seller - what's stopping people from buying them, hashing for 30 days, then asking Amazon for a refund?
@_date: 2013-07-05 08:26:00
Can we get a TL:DR of that story for potential customers to be aware of?
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:23:25
I was hoping to be one of the first 10 customers, but it won't even let me check out!
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:27:10
May I ask how you knew what customer you were talking to just by reading my post? I didn't give out my name or email, yet you seemed to know the exact status of my account creation. Honestly just curious - that's fine detective work!

Documents submitted. I see Kevin's reply on both the 4th and 7th on that ticket, neither of which were emailed to me. I do appreciate you providing me clear instructions here to proceed though. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:53:27
Thank you. To validate your statement: they asked for documentation on May 30th at 6:09pm. My next response to them was merely an hour later, at 7:16pm inquiring how to submit it. As a wise jedi might say: fail to deliver clear instructions, they did, and still do.
@_date: 2013-06-07 22:44:08
It's frustrating being ignored by someone I'm TRYING TO GIVE 1% of my money to. And I really don't even want to convert to USD - I want it all to stay in BTC - so it seems like all of this caution is unwarranted since I'm not "cashing out" to fiat.
@_date: 2013-06-08 05:28:22
I really didn't want to convert to fiat anyway, so it may not be a good fit for me. I want to operate entirely in BTC. Someone else just PM'd me about something called Magento with Mt.Gox plugin. I'm looking into that at the moment since BitPay is not responding to my support requests. I have inventory arriving Monday and would like to be ready to accept payments, but I bet they're shut down outside of the hours of 8-5, M-F :/

What the hell kind of bitcoin address is this?!?!   
Not exactly a trustworthy sign when they can't even generate a valid bitcoin address.
Is this on test net only?!?
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:02:36
Oh, I didn't realize you were under the assumption that difficulty was not exponential. Doesn't the difficulty history indicate otherwise?
I guess I don't agree with your statement that there are a finite number of manufacturers and production capabilities; every day, I see new hardware companies springing up and, as CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC has shown, someone always comes up with a faster hasher.
As long as there is money to be made, I have no doubt the growth will continue to be exponential.
@_date: 2013-06-08 06:09:18
Sweet video! You may not remember me but I met you and your SO at Bitcoin 2013! [I happen to be a re-seller of these sexy little miners if anyone's interested.]( I don't accept preorders, but will have inventory on Monday afternoon!
@_date: 2013-06-28 03:12:30
I bought my first vehicle with BTC last night. Fuck yeah!

Hi! I didn't see any tracking info come through yet - is that because of the Fourth?
