Trezor support?

If you generate a new sending address for any transaction, which I think most clients do by default now, it makes tracking transactions very difficult. There are also options like Darkwallet. However, if someone had sufficient power, they could get the purchase information for that prepaid card and know which store it was bought at. If they then contacted that store, they could get your identity (again assuming "they" are a government or card company).

At least Dwolla is better than Paypal.

I've found Coinbase to be the easiest exchange so far. However, if you get really into trading, other platforms are more robust.

Trezor has a manual "coin control" that lets you choose how to combine inputs. It sucks that less wallets are deterministic, hopefully that will change. I do agree that Bitcoins aren't always private now, but I think they have potential for total privacy whereas cards don't.

Look into multisig transactions, its a good way to "escrow" money.
@_date: 2014-06-09 02:09:10
Thanks for being an asshole!
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:15:52
is not a marketplace.

Yeah, and Yakisoba is friggin delicious!

Bitcoins can have reversible transactions through Multisig. This is what is being done on projects like OpenBazaar. I do agree that many people here push for adoption just to raise price, but plenty of us honestly want Bitcoin to be more accepted so we can spend Bitcoins instead of cashing out or hoarding. 
Also, looking at your comment history, you REALLY seem to hate Bitcoin? Is there a reason you stick around on this sub? I know the community here is pretty shit most of the time, but your comment isn't really contributing. If you don't like the community here, try to balance out the zealots with more rational arguments, or don't engage in the community.
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:56:09
I go with this rule.
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:38:23
Ok, sounds good. Thanks!

If something is possible in theory, we shouldn't wait until it is a problem to fix it. Besides that, he JUST gave you an example. However, ACTUAL confirm times aren't likely to change, as it would involve a complete rework of mining systems. Therefore, I think systems like this are useful. If several services like this existed, high value POS purchases could be done with much less fear of a double spend, and without sacrificing speed.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:46:27
How would that help me?
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:56:41
However, in most cases it massively reduces the risk for the merchant. This system in my opinion is a big advantage over Bitpay (who I still love), because Bitpay totally acts like a credit card company, in that it takes on the risk of double spends, which reduces the value of the entire mining system. If Bitpay were to use a system like this, it would help them be able to worry less about double spends, thereby reducing their losses, and keeping their service free.
Edit: [this]( comment states that Bitpay already uses something similar, so there you go.

Thank you for spreading the btc love!
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:25:08
Well, the Trezor does display the address on device before sending, so unless wherever you got the address from was hacked (or changed via man-in-the-middle), the payment address isn't as insecure as with a regular webwallet.
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:00:51
If you aren't worried about the cost of replacing it, you can always recover from the 24 word seed on a new Trezor.
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:01:52
Armory and myTrezor both do it by default. What wallets don't support it?
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:33:21
We need some gpg up in here.
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:09:18
I used the word relatively there intentionally. I'm not saying banks are totally trustworthy (especially compared to a trustless system like BTC), but compared to other options for sending money overseas, it's massively more trustworthy than say, going to a freighter and giving them a crate of cash. I don't totally trust my bank, but I put my paycheck into my bank every month with a pretty high level of confidence that when I wake up it won't be gone, and it's value won't have halved. (Sidenote, I am mainly talking about banks in developed countries, in places like Argentina your argument holds significantly more weight.) I'm not saying it won't happen, but it's "comparably" more trustworthy than say, holding all my money in beans.
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:40:53
Because banks have a history of being comparably trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:19:08
Which is exactly why mining needs to be re-decentralized.
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:08:56
I'd think it's fine if he discloses.
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:29:16
For putting the same wallet on different drives, would you advise against setting one up and then cloning to the other drives?
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:45:30
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:35:21
Sorry -_-
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:42:44
 Governments are just people, prosecutors are just people, conspiracies are just groups of people.
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:29:04
For Trezor support you mean?
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:08:36
Yeah, it is kind of a shitpost. Sorry, it's just an IFTTT bot running on Google's Bitcoin news feed...
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:59:54
I'm under 18 and use Coinbase just fine... Did you go through identity verification?
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:28:06
I got a Trezor, pretty nice form of storage.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:17:32
Yup, they said it was way harder than they expected to manufacture.
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:01:21
Have -10000 BTC, @_date: 2015-05-31 21:39:27
Not just the government. It is really hard to keep large groups of people quiet when they are doing something they could do to prison for, and have the entire case thrown out 
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:49:47
I don't think this is a never. Just have a trusted company handle it for you, just like we do with way less secure electronic banking. Or use something like a Trezor.
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:47:57
If you have a Yubikey, you can use Yubico Authenticator. Same thing as GAuth, but you have to tap your NFC enabled phone with the NFC enabled Yubikey to load up new codes.
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:44:25
I totally agree, plenty of services do this. Just send a digital invoice that is api friendly. Coinbase could auto send money, but if you don't use Coinbase you could set up your own program to auto pay invoices given conditions (Invoice sender, value, due date, etc.)
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:37:49
Nah man, he was just roll playing. /s
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:53:28
Hmm, kind-of, he told people he had their money when he didn't, making it seem like he had more BTC than he really did. Bad wording though. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:24:22
You realize if Amazon was willing to do something like that they could just start their own VPS instances... Why would they steal their own service from themselves? Maybe other nodes would be shut down, but no reason to take them over.

I thought deflation is bad, and bitcoins deflate all of the time. Doesn't that make them not a good currency? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:32:51
Yup, its a little tricky though.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:57:15
Can we get the r^2 for both graphs? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:59:16
Most graphing programs will do it automatically. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:55:21
I believe Latex has support, along with any Ti calculator ^_^. But there is one more piece of software that does it, however I can't think of the name. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:31:28
Computers just won in go, look it up. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:58:55
Are you saying you didn't just calculate your line of best fit? Graphing programs let you choose your transformations... 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:52:56
I was kinda joking, ti's are waaay overpriced and under featured.
