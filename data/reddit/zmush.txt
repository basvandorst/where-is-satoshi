Note: Circle also has a fee for using a credit card, so if any source could eliminate that too, that'd be awesome.
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:21:53
Circle has a 3k limit.

On the Electrum website, it says:


which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.


private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.
Is this the correct way to redeem my BCH?

I'm using cryptowatch and it's fine for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:35:53
It is now
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:25:22
Mine is 100$ right now...how often does it reset?
@_date: 2016-09-22 21:54:31
I also use currently coinbase and blockchain. Is there any benefit to keeping both/merging to just one?
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:09:28
Are these all applications for managing my wallet?
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:09:41
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:57:08
How would I go about doing that first part? (making the associated private key that is never connected to the internet) And what function does it serve?
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:29:23
gdax, gemini, any exchange basically.
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:57:49
What do you mean by get out of coinbase?
@_date: 2016-09-23 13:58:48
Whats the difference between blockchain and something like jaxx?
@_date: 2016-09-23 01:45:24
Please elaborate
@_date: 2017-07-09 04:04:28
Theres a difference between being impatient and wondering whats going on 10 days after the transfer is initiated when the site says 2-4 days.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:41:48
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:17:31
First transfer took over a week
@_date: 2017-07-08 21:57:15
When I add $ to gdax from bank transfer.

My question isn't really about whether i should or shouldn't dump them, I'm asking HOW to dump them if i decide to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:19:20
How would I differentiate which coin I am sending to the exchange (from my electrum wallet)
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:58:17
Is there any way to generate an electrum wallet on an online machine that functions as an offline wallet? I don't have an old machine lying around. Also, since my wallet is technically online its not cold storage is it? In order to be fully protected for the split I have to create an offline wallet or will my current online wallet suffice?
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:46:54
Is it possible for me to have an offline wallet such as on electrum without having an entirely separate offline device?
For example, can I just make it so that my electrum wallet does not use the internet even though the rest of my laptop functions normally?
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:34:33
What is ath?
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:53:09
Is this also the case for Gemini? Considering making the switch
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:12:23
How about blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:13:04
Are there any specific tutorials out there that you'd recommend?
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:00:39
What is the point of a hardware wallet if I'm going to be constantly trading with the btc that I have?
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:14:38
What's a core wallet? Cant afford a hardware wallet atm.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:05:11
So on august 1st we should move our bitcoins to a local wallet to prevent them from being attacked?
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:13:13
Can you ELI5 this ELI5 pls
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:06:15
And gemini?
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:05:44
Im looking to set up the easiest but also safest way to trade.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:51:40
Can you please ELI5?
Would I buy from gdax and send it to my coinbase address?
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:57:29
It says july17th which is cutting it pretty close
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:51:51
I use coinbase but just yesterday I made an account on Gemini and am planning to make the jump as soon as I get verified.
Between CEX, Gemini, and Kraken, what would you suggest and why?
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:26:32
That one doesn't have gemini though
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:05:13
So do you recommend staying with coinbase or switching to something like gemini and using mycelium?
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:16:13
What is your experience with dollar cost averaging?
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:25:04
Does this include something such as Electrum or blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:51:16
Its 80EU including shipping and also currently out of stock.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:37:46
So I'm good on blockchain?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:20:22
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:03:36
Website says july 17th mate
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:44:04


As in blockchain? I'm a bit confused as to what your comment is saying. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:06:03
So storing on coinbase/gemini is safer than gdax?
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:48:04
So you recommend buy high and hodl? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:16:56
As in you have to want it to profit from day trading?
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:20:30
Charts differ across exchanges. I have yet to find a decent free chart for gemini exchange which is why I was asking.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:53:06
How would you compare it to something like a paper wallet?
