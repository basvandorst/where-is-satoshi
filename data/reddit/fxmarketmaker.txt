No.  SecondMarket is for Accredited investors.  Pretty fucking big difference.

No.  An action being illegal is exogenous of whether it was committed or not.  The phrase you're looking for is "You're innocent until you're proven guilty" which IS NOT the same as "An action isn't illegal unless proven you did it".  Fraud is still fraud.  Whether he is guilty of fraud is for the investigation to find out.

Um... willful blindness and criminal negligence are both illegal.  If he was willing to accept deposits and use those deposits in attempts to make up for lost coins (by using those deposits for funding withdrawals) then he has engaged in criminal fraud.

Because insurance requires something called "pooled risk" in order to be economically viable.  Something bitcoin most definitively does not have.

Yep.  Haircuts on deposits aren't fun.


The fact that people believe btc would be immune to any future seizures.


Realistically, this venture is just going looking to take advantage of the decent amount of laundering that already flows through Cypriot banks.  It'll add another layer and the owners are looking to capitalize on the dirty flows from the eastern bloc that no longer trust the banks after the haircut in hopes that it being btc will obfuscate the ability of the Cypriot govt to levy haircuts on their deposits in the future.

You're right.  I don't think it's a reasonable assumption to believe a trial and conviction would have occurred in 12 hours lol.  
The point is, you can't make an objective statement such as "his actions weren't illegal" until an investigation occurs and finds out what really occurred.  You will see in my post, I didn't state that he was doing something illegal.  I was saying if his firm operated like that then it would be illegal.

So you just directly contradicted yourself from:


Just because you don't leave evidence doesn't mean its not illegal.  Not to mention "What Karpeles did" assumes you know in fact what already happened.
