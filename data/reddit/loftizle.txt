As always if it costs too much people will just switch back to BitTorrent.

True, although I have nothing to do with American politics it does seem a lot of people I speak to aren't intelligent enough to understand him.

Bitcoin is shit, it takes way too long to do anything. It really needs to improve or be replaced with something more usable.
@_date: 2016-04-07 23:20:07
Just because I'm good at it doesn't mean they like me haha. This sub has no sense of humour :/.

On the roulette table if you put your money on black or red (bitcoin) you have higher odds of winning but the reward isn't as large as if you put your money on a number (altcoins). The tradeoff is a higher risk with the altcoins.

Why shouldn't you use TrueCrypt 7.1a?
@_date: 2016-04-07 10:26:38
I don't completely buy it or trust Veracrypt any more than the version of TrueCrypt that I have. Is that exploit easily accessible out in the wild? I really only use it for basic encryption needs and there isn't anything overly valuable stored in there (if it were broken you wouldn't get much).
EDIT: For information I followed the entire TrueCrypt saga and was using it for a long time. This has never been an uninformed or ignorant decision.

I did quite well off one that I bought because the coin initials were OMG.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:38:51
I know it is ridiculous but you could give me a coin or two and change my life completely.

I'm glad I'm out of it now but I hit a rough patch for a while after a relationship and would internally groan anytime someone offered financial advice. I'm not sure a lot of people get that when someone is stretched to the point of not buying food for themselves a couple of times a week (not for long thankfully) then there really isn't any room to budge.

I almost feel bad for the guy, if I were a millionaire I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be angry about something like a name.

Are my bitcoin going to be valuable soon?
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:00:01
I've got a tracking app that says the entire market cap is $605.24B AUD with 36% of that being BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:27:26
No one was trying to prove anyone wrong, I just checked as I've never been certain if it was accurate or correct.

Where is the dinosaur drawing, that made me feel better about it all.
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:25:37
What? I've watched bitcoin go up $100 AUD in the last 48 hours. It can't peak before it is even in widespread use.

Stuff that, I wish you guys the best of luck but to me that is straight up gambling.

You have bitcoin now, you don't take orders from a month.

Looks like we have an alternative solution.

It is if you trade from BTC to BTC but BTC to x currency is a completely different scenario.

There is also a coin for that.

Because life probably sucks pretty bad already and the chance of success is worth the risk.
I'm not putting in money I can't lose but I can sure as shit understand why people are. Also I'm only in this position now because I put in all I could (which was fuck all) when it was $300.

It became my life savings when I had almost nothing beforehand and it blew up.

I'm sure I could find an appropriate gif to demonstrate the image in your head if I looked hard enough.

I did the same for $700 and saw it drop back down to $300, didn't sell and look at it now.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:20:41
