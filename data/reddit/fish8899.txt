They could attempt to bruteforce my password if they're smart enough to think "maybe he used a fake wallet and maybe the private key was used as a password for another wallet" right?

The offline computer is already in place, with bitaddress.org html file and everything :)
One more question: is Bip38 harder to break than SHA256 because of the evolution into Asic mining? Or is there something inherent to Bip38 that will always make it harder to break than SHA256?
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:50:38
Yes I had that thought as well :)
And the reason why I'm not sure I want to use Bip38, is because I read that not all services where you can retrieve paper wallets, support Bip38 right now?
Or did I misunderstand that? I notice the public key will be the same before and after bip38 encryption. So I can just enter my public key on Blockchain.info and then enter my bip32 encrypted privatekey on bitaddress.org and decrypt it to get the "official" private key back and then use that to clear the funds on blockchain.info?

Bip38 sounds great, but I read that bip38 generated offline wallets cannot be retrieved by all online services yet?
Can I easily get my money out of a bip38 generated address using blockchain.info?

Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear enough. So I print out the fake paperwallet with privatekey 5JgaDt6kLrmuSaYcAbynTmKt8S2anVh4eiFmoytkoDj3oyoKZ8u and leave that around my house. 
But then I use 5JgaDt6kLrmuSaYcAbynTmKt8S2anVh4eiFmoytkoDj3oyoKZ8u on bitaddress.org to create a brainwallet, which results in a new public address and private key:
So this will be my real details that I use. So if a burglar steals my paperwallet, he will still need to figure out that I used the private key of that fake wallet to generate a new address.
And changing it to a 5 when using bip32 would be a good solution yes...

I'm actually quite sure it's safe, I'm just a very neurotic person. And this is all new to me, so I'm just trying to learn. Nothing wrong with that right? How am I supposed to become experienced at this without talking about it with people that know more about this than I do?
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:31:35
Why do you need 3? 
If I generate an address with privatekey offline, the private key is random and very long. And if I also add a passphrase, why shouldn't that give enough entropy?
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:16:00
But isn't the SHA256 hashing impossible to break anyway?
For instance, if I generate a regular wallet and the private key is 5JgaDt6kLrmuSaYcAbynTmKt8S2anVh4eiFmoytkoDj3oyoKZ8u and I use that to create a brainwallet, that should be impossible to crack right (at least with todays computers).
If I use 5JgaDt6kLrmuSaYcAbynTmKt8S2anVh4eiFmoytkoDj3oyoKZ8u on 
I get: Length: 51
Strength: Very Strong - More often than not, this level of security is overkill.
Entropy: 269.8 bits
Charset Size: 62 characters
This is still impossible to crack right? 
The only downside I see with Bip32 is that the private key suddenly starts with a 6. If a burglar takes the stolen Bip32 generated paper wallet to a tech savvy person, that person can see that it's a bip32 wallet since the private key starts with a 6. 
In that case, aren't you back to square one? Couldn't someone use some type of system to crack my passphrase if it's too simple?

Cool, I'll read some more about that. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:51:01
So if you choose to generate an offline wallet with bitaddress.org with bip32 turned on, it will first generate a random key and then after that change it around again with the bip32 passphrase encryption?
So it's sort of all the steps I described above condensed into a quicker way of creating something that can't be cracked by hackers and also not deciphered by a burglar?
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:18:37
Yes that's what I thought. SHA256 is a one way street right, so there's no way to get any clues about how a particular address was generated right?
So if I use a randomly generated privatekey for an offline wallet and use that privatekey to generate a new address, it will be impossible to break for these hackers that are trying to hack brainwallets, since they just simulate lots of words and combinations. But a random privatekey in itself is impossible to break, so a private key based on a private key is impossible to break as well right? Bitcoin would not be able to exist if we could crack privatekeys that are randomly generated.

Yes, I'll do some practice runs. Thanks for your help :)

Can't I just enter my public key on Blockchain.info and then enter my bip38 encrypted privatekey on bitaddress.org and decrypt it to get the "official" private key back and then use that offical key to clear the funds on blockchain.info?
