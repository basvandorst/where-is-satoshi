Bitfinex and Binance don't have fiat  gateway :)

In Bitcoin you pay for the weight of the transaction and not the percentage of the transfer. A $100 transaction can have the same weight as $500m, can weight more or less.
Such high fees make Bitcoin not suitable for commercial use.

Why do you think real transactions will be able to pay higher fees than garbage transactions?

Is there any evidence for these 3 theses?
How does a spam transaction differ from a non-spam transaction? As far as I know, blockchain is a chain of blocks filled with messages and there is no division between spam and non-spam. A black person transaction will have the same priority as a white person transaction, subject equal fees. There is no way to get the intentions of individual transactions.
In any case, if you recognize the problem of spam, then you recognize the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities should be eliminated. Waving hands and blaming others will not fix the problem.

Block space is an offer, transaction volume is demand. If you reduce the supply, you either increase the fees or harm the demand.


If we reduce block size we either increase the fees or reduce number of users. Less users, less nodes. There is both downward pressure - less users, less potential node owners and upward pressure - less node price, more node owners. And we can not know which one is stronger.


Can you back up your words with numbers. What is the numerical expression for "a lot"?


How do you know? What is the price after which users will turn off the node? What happens before: the user is not able to pay the fees and turns off the node or the user is not able to pay the node and turns off the node? What is better and what is worse?
Increasing a block is an increase in supply, putting downward pressure on fees, which contributes to a better UX, which attracts users who may want to launch a node. Thus, it is possible that an increase in the block size will cause an increase in the number of nodes. Although I do not claim this.

There is no way to distinguish intentions. The only person who can voice the intent of the transaction is the sender, while there is no way to know how sincere his response. And in the end, who are we to judge the intentions of others.
In my understanding, spam is an attack whose goal is to create conditions under which the network is unusable.
Fees are a kind of anti-spam protection. Obviously, the smaller the block size, the cheaper the spam attack. If we imagine that fees worth $ 1k make the network unusable, then in a world where the block iclude 10 transactions, the attacker would need $10k to make the network unusable. In another world, where a block iclude 1k transactions, an attacker would need $1m. Therefore, it is difficult for me to see the logic under the assumption that block decrease solves the problem of spam. No, on the contrary, it aggravates the problem, it reduces the price of the attack.
You can argue that while the attacker is paying, the network is fine. This is true, except that the attacker is a temporary/fake user who, by his actions, makes permanent/real users go away (disappointed). And then when they leave, the attacker will leave too. And now you have an empty network that nobody needs even with free translations. This is especially true in a market with decent alternatives.

Why people from 3rd countries will run a cheap node if the fees of a single Bitcoin transaction exceeds their daily salary?

It was very fine when i send it. Is there crystal ball in sell for bitcoin users?
@_date: 2018-11-10 18:44:18
Place that i need accepts only btc and bch. If i had a more choices i would use eth. Never was a fan of altcoins but meh, look at this place, look at this experience, on the community reaction. It is difficult to remain part of this madness.

No, i sent segwit coin. I think this one is still called BTC. [

You do not understand how Bitcoin works. It is a shadow chain that is no different from the main chain, but has more POW which automatically makes it the new main chain. The old main chain will be orphaned. This is actually the reason why we need honest miners.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:51:15
But many Core developers said that increasing the block to 2mb would destroy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:38:10
How it helps?

Who told you about this logic? I read the paper and it says nothing about it.

Ok i will wait a week. Good advice, appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:08:40
Because they want more $?

Not sure that is good for me. My transaction has been stuck for hours.
