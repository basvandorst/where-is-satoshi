Price is just what it last sold for.
How much is &lt;enter anything here&gt; worth = What the last person paid for it.

Corrupt governments would and have.  It is undemocratic in every sense of the word.
Corrupt democratic governments would probably attempt other means than to directly legislate against it.  But thats all conspiracy theory stuff ...

I purchased $1000 through simplex and the BTC did not arrive, but I received all the normal confirmation emails.
Just after I purchased the price sky rocketed.
I have been in contact with me and they keep assuring me the BTC will arrive and the transaction was approved.
Now 3 days later I get an email (after BTC has increased over $1000) saying they are refunding me my money because there was a technical issue with the BTC delivery.
It is obvious to me these guys are just holding the BTC and taking the %gains.
Shocking really.

Don't take that crap man, I have told them I don't want a refund in cash I want the BTC otherwise I have to pay all the credit card fee, foreign exchange etc
It's blatant stealing.  I got all the normal auto confirmations that my BTC was ordered and delivered.

I can’t see that page.  For me it goes to this page:

Maybe it is because i am on my phone?  Or maybe you clicked the bitcoincash link?

Mass adoption requires more security and ease of transfer, i do not want banks involved personally.
