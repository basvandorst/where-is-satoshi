I see that you have no experience at all in ecommerce so I will try to enlighten you here. Cart abandonment is huge problem for online stores. Anything that gets into the way of a customers buying an item, and paying for it immediately reduces % of successful sales or "conversion rate". Simple things like having a box that say "Enter Coupon Code Here" can discourage people from going through with the transaction. What OP is doing is very basic, standard A/B testing of these effects.

Okay so the two examples you cited are: 
1. Hedge against fiat
2. Eliminate third party costs. 
You can already hedge against fiat. There are already many investment options with different scales of risks. What advantage does Bitcoin offer? It's volatility and moon potential?
As for third party fees, guess what? There are still fees converting from fiat to Bitcoin. Unless the entire world adopts Bitcoin, there will always be conversion fees. Otherwise, why would companies like Bitpay exists? Bitpay = Visa for Bitcoins.   
What your posts illustrates to me is how crazy and fringe your ideas are. Have you ever wonder WHY most people are not running to buy Bitcoins? Hint: it's not because we are all too stupid to understand "the new paradigm". 
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:59:49

@_date: 2014-12-13 04:22:20
The price is not changing because the value of bitcoin is not correlated to its utility; its value is purely speculative. If you are a true believer of bitcoin, you know that it functions perfectly at 1 dollars as it does at 10K but everyone here is hoping that each positive event will propel bitcoin to the moon. Oh and by the way, merchant adoption has no impact on price because it doesn't create ANY buy pressure at all. It's still much much easier to use a credit card or even a Microsoft gift card to buy Microsoft points than bitcoin. It's not a way to attract new buyers but a way for existing users to cash out. So yeah, things are getting better, but Bitcoin sti has very few competitive advantage to existing solutions. And you all seem to assume that companies like Visa or Paypal wouldn't adapt at all, just waiting for bitcoin to wreck their business and take 100 percentage of their market share. That's just so ludicrous. Even a crazy disruptive concept like Airbnb and Uber has not eliminated hotels and taxis. Bitcoin is not even in that same category at the moment.

That sounds like a good plan.

Am I missing something here? Using Western Union's online tool, WU charges me ZERO fees to transfer $1000USD from my bank account to a bank account in the Philippines (this takes 1-3 days but so does Rebit.ph). If I transfer money from my bank account to a local office, it still only costs $2.99USD. On Rebit.ph, shipping to a pawn shop or local office costs $20USD in total fees. Even if I ship the money to your office directly, your fees (at 9USD) still costs more than Western Union. How are you competing vs them?

Dollar averaging in a thin market like this can actually have downward pressure on the price. If your goal is to make a profit or break even, the more you "average down" the less of the price has to be before you break even. So if you bought at $600, and now your average cost is $400, you might be way more tempted to sell when prices hit $400. You can imagine what happens when a majority of holders do this.

It's not helpful for everyday consumers. Bitcoin benefits merchants.
B2B transfers and remittance are the only useful markets, but remittances is highly dependent on TRUST. This is why Western Union has been successful despite high fees: they can guarantee cash in hand almost instantly. Any remittance services will need to have brick and mortar locations globally. Investment in BTC is not there yet to do that. 
BTC's success is directly related to competition as the technology does not exist in a vaccum, and there's HEAVY competition in the payment space. You might know PayPal and Square, but there are about 20 heavily funded start-ups RIGHT NOW trying to disrupt everything from payment gateways to end-user experience. Visa, MasterCard and all the big players are rolling out e-wallets (like PayPal) so that people don't need to enter in their CCs online and so they can pay with their phones/NFC. People in this sub seem to think that BTC is THE innovation in payments, but as someone who does a lot of market research into this field, this is untrue.

It's ridiculous that people here seem to think that Bitcoin is the ONE AND ONLY digital currency that has any relevance. I'm not saying that any alt-coins at the moment has any value, but I can easily see more "localized"  digital currencies in the future.
One idea would be for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to issue custom pre-mined coins to those in need that is guaranteed to be able to be redeemed for local fiat currency or for specific goods within the needed area. The coins would be developed and backed by the foundation. This would eliminate a lot of downsides to direct aid in that it is hard to track where the money goes after it's been disbursed.

The BIGGEST issue is that bitcoin is not consumer friendly. The apps that are developed around it have not solved this fundamental problem. People are used to instant transactions (even waiting 15-30 seconds for something to be confirmed is a step backwards) and buyer protection. Bitcoin just does not have any features that appeal to the everyday user.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:59:31
People don't tend to do rolling averages over 365 days. 7 days is reasonable and shows a completely different and more accurate picture.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:55:54
It actually makes no sense for an exchange to NOT support additional digital currency. How does dilution even work in an exchange setting? The user is not purchasing an item and facing multiple payment options. 
Once you have USD deposited in the Coinbase exchange, why does Coinbase care if you buy BTC or LTC? If anything, opening it to other currencies will just increase their user base.

Stocks have actual fundamentals, bitcoin does not. Publicly traded companies have quarterly reports that detail their revenue, costs, debt obligations, etc. There are way more information and tools available to evaluate the stock market than there are for bitcoin. For bitcoin, we don't even know how many transactions are real. Even things like active users is simply a guesstimate based on the number of funded wallets. It is suspected that exchanges are the only ones making real money trading because they have so much more information than an average trader.

It's simple, really. The big 4 banks do not depend on user deposits to make money. People still use them because they have a lot of physical locations and many people still feel more comfortable talking to a teller than just depositing their paychecks into a machine.

i just told you EXACTLY how to do that. what? you like sucking federal reserve cock or something? maybe you like rubbing green paper with occult symbolism all over your dick. green paper that's probably got shit, stripper ass-sweat, and AIDS blood from coc. snorters on it...printed as much as they see fit. this is like if i gave you some steak but you don't have a fire going. take some initiative (10 minutes) link a bank account [start a fire]and then you will have your precious "real money" [cooked steak]. I am trying to educate you guys about a paradigm shifting technology, and got shit on for it. As a gamer i thought you might actually think it was cool, but instead you took the opportunity to insult me. Insult me just like many of the greatest minds in our history books. The cryptographers, the I.T. geeks, the software and web programmers/developers, Tesla, Willheilm Reich..... I'm going to try one more time.  or  (under 10 minutes)|||  or  (show developers of the organization). I can hardly believe this is your response. Especially when you are donating VIDEO GAMES, NOT MONEY. Some things are obviously more important than this world wide scam you refer to as "real money" and i refer to as federal reserve notes, because that's exactly what it is, like a fucking i.o.u from your worst bully on the playground. Assuming you have a bank account i doubt you told your banker "no, real money would be better" when they handed you a debit card. So, please take a moment to ignore our little "clash" and realize that if you take a matter of minutes to link a bank account you will have what you seek and might learn something great in the process. if you want me to send you "real money" directly why don't you post your mailing address for all of us to see, and i can mail you a green piece of paper...no thanks, this method is easier, quicker, safer, more private (for both of us), more secure, and FREE. I appreciate what you're doing otherwise. please don't let my rant get in the way of feeling good about what your organization does.

The problem is that there's no way to objectively evaluate bitcoin. There's no way to know how many active users there are in the economy. Volume can (and has been) faked. Wallet stats are ever increasing since no one can actually delete their addresses. No hard metrics = no informed decisions possible. I would rather invest in a Series X funding round than in bitcoin because there is at least hard data in any companies making it out of the seed round.

If you followed his advice and sold your bitcoins when that article came out, you would have saved a lot of money.

Imagine if you are at a store and an employee approaches you saying, "Hey have a free sample but please tip me if you think this is awesome".

I don't see how bitcoin will be easier than credit cards for Uber. If you use the app, it's already stupidly simple to enter your CC info by taking a photo of your card. Plus, Uber is a demand-based service, not a retail outlet so unless you attach a Bitcoin wallet, you would have to resend your bitcoins each time you use it.

People who redeem those papers would overwhelmingly be people who already know about bitcoin.

If fiat collapses, you really think that having some internet tokens will make your life better?

I thought bitcoin was supposed to reduce the cost of sending money and it can barely compete with Western Union now even with subsidizes mining rewards when taking into account the cost of buying and selling bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:12:52
Actually, miners can decide if they want to include any transactions or not. Theoretically, they mine blocks faster by not accepting any transactions and they also do not risk the block getting orphaned. Since mining rewards outweigh transaction fees significantly, I reckon this trend of not accepting txns will only become more popular.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:59:17
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-02-14 04:40:23
Sure, except for the fact that they haven't figured out a way to make money. Their total transaction so far is $100k, and if they plan to implement a 1% fee, that's a whopping $1000. lol
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:01:15
"For now." Isn't that what bitcoin supporters always say when discussing how bitcoin is not currently primed to take over the world or even manage more than 3 tx per second? The lack of self awareness here is epic.

Because of this quote: "Though no airlines will accept bitcoin at launch, Khan expects the partnership will do much to encourage these businesses to enter commercial agreements with his firm."

Why do people still buy Litecoin, hoping to get rich? Why do some people on claim that they will "hodl" until zero? People don't deal well with sunk cost.

If everyone is already aware of the bubble, does the bubble happen?
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:31:20
Why would anyone do that, especially someone who is graduating from a top MBA program? An investment fund will pay just as much as a start up. VCs are already risky. VCs working with Bitcoin is doubly risky. Those with opportunities don't need to take unneeded risks.

Oh look...another Rebit spam. This site posts at least 1 "article" about itself at least once a day to I can't imagine that your spam would even be that effective. How many people have families in the Phillipines and visit You are better off spamming @_date: 2015-02-09 17:57:02
How could the halving affect anyone who is not aware of Bitcoin?

So why is merchant adoption such a big deal if it's not meant to be used as currency?
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:06:24
Funny enough, when bitcoin prices drop, people say that 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Same thing here. You can still buy the same local goods with 1 Euro as you can a day before. Relative value to the USD doesn't really matter for most consumers. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 18:48:34
Why do most bitcoin supporters think that altcoins are completely useless and will never overtake bitcoin? Same logic.

I agree. Banks already have a profitable business model: they provide loans and charge you with fees. Coinbase is still running on VC funds and has yet to prove that they've made a profit yet. Just wait until Coinbase's VC funding dries up and see how shitty it gets.

Do you realize that a million dollar worth of new coins is generated every day? It's obvious who is dumping: the miners. Every other theory is stupid because traders make more money when prices go up then they do when it goes down so even in an environment that allows shorting, going long is still not profitable.

Brands are all about authenticity. It's not about selling you a product but an experience. Paying someone explicitly to like your product breaks that illusion.
