It is a very ballsy claim to say both these "commodities" will increase in price following the same pattern forever... Both gold or Bitcoin could crash well below their current level and never recover to ATH.  
At least, there is a chance it could do that.

Hey thank you for your answer.
Obviously, after all your contribution, I have a better understanding. I don't want to spread FUD for the sake of it, just to be proven wrong, which you did so thank you.

Interesting, but why would it cost so much to attack Bitcoin, while the site says otherwise ?

I also never look what my portfolio is worth now. You already know if you won or lose money when you trade, but you surely don't want to feel bad or too exited cause that impairs your ability to plan the futur decisions

The good thing with Holding, is that if you can't make the distinction between volatility and downward trends/corrections, you are better off holding because if each time it dips, you sell, and each time it goes up you buy, then you are just being dumb.

The wife may not be the best person to hold your coins, the moment she becomes upset, she may go away with it and you are screwed.
Parents and old persons are the best :). Also burying it is a good idea.

Because governements have legal power, and you dont.
Bonus point, in democracy, poor people are manipulated into thinking government will help them. So they vote for socialism, and then they have to tax someone else to feed the voters. This creates other problems but don't worry, more government will solve that ofc.
On the other hand you have very rich people who pay politics so that they can do their business unarmed.
And you are in the middle.
