There's no such thing as the bitcoin network, you are referring to the blockchain you would need to download the full file to do this (160GB or so). Most wallet connect to server that have the blockchain. This is why Ledger and other had issue sometime showing balance, they also need those server to help broadcast the transaction

Better use a site like this  to determine the correct amount, if you are sending from a segwit address you can lower it by about 25% safelly

even with your seed an attacker can't steal you if you also use a password (25th word). You can use many password too so the security doesn't just rely on the seed and as other mentioned you can enter your key in a random manner, plit it etc. However encrypting it on a regular PC is not ideal...

Yes the seller could still have the private key so you have to trust the vendor that they did the right thing (destroyed any copy of the private key once the labels were printed), remember bitcoin back then were not that expensive and they had a reputation to protect there's no record of any issue with such product.

To fork the chain and to be able to move coin from Satoshi would still require the private key so their only option is to premine. 
I expect forked coin to start at a much lower value in the future, it is the exchange who are actually loosing that new created money, if major holder of BTC would cash on their BCC they would be in trouble...

Do not expect too much from that fork, they claim they will 'seize' satoshi old bitcoin, this itself is very unlikely, in a fork of the original chain they still would need to have the private key to be able to plit them so all of this sound very fishy...

Just to clarify, your coin reside on the blockchain (as a matter of speaking), inside your ledger is simply the private key, your seed allow you to restore not just inside a ledger but into many different wallet. You are better of not doing so but if for any reason you loose your ledger you can restore without one. Your seed word is really what you need to backup twice :)

It depend on WHEN you do the transfer, if you transfer to a wallet before the block they are forking you can split them from your wallet, if they are on a exchange it depend if the exchange want to put work to let people extract them. On an exchange you do not have any right to forked coin unless they are willing to give them to you

It is possible that the key that was used before was not the first address of wallet, by moving the BTC to the first address generated they may have simplified the discovery. People should re-check their seed just in case.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:10:02
it is called a seed and yet it will allow to move the BTC to your own wallet

BIP 39 standard and the image...
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:36:30
right, he should simply post the damn private key!
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:24:35
they generate different type of address but the 49 is probably the correct one to use 
you can search for those terms in google or use the link on Ian Coleman site

There's 1 BTC hiden in that windows
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:33:12
you need to find a seed which is probably 12-24 word, they need to be in a specific order as well.
Google the BIP39 keyword to get some explanation, you can see this at work by running the following from your browser
The seed allow to generate address pair (private and public). 
You can see this in action here,  however it is better for dafety purpose to try this from a local copy
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:05:20
it is a combination of word that allow anyone to re-create a list of BTC address and their corresponding private key (send or receive BTC). 
Those word are defined in a list called BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39)
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:41:21
Nobody know for now how many word or if it is even a seed we are searching for...
The seed word can be hand picked but the last word need to be calculated...
This question was asked last week, maybe the OP was looking for the formula to ass a checksum work to selected seed word :)
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:30:31

@_date: 2018-05-27 17:34:02
maybe ask in the thread instead of this useless one...
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:59:28
yes, 12 18 and 24 are more probable if we are search for a seed due to the 'pair' clue, if we are searching for a private key then all the other number and some of the seed word would be required (all seed word can be translated to a number) We do not know for sure yet what we need to find but "hidden in plain sight" clue may be an indication that it is only a seed.
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:36:32
You cam claim the price thry Roger Verr CEO of Bitcoin.com

@_date: 2018-05-21 01:43:51
A cat named Satoshi?
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:35:00
right, he should simply post the damn private key!
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:26:53
download this in your computer
the 12-24 word need to be tested in the box called BIP39 Mnemonic (we do not know how many word are required but those word allow to derive all the public address and private key)
the derived address in bip 49 can be tested on a blockchain explorer but this will not be easy if you do not understand the basic of how those work.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:08:26
yes, the BTC would be there as one of the address (probably the first one) would be the one the OP posted and sent the 1 btc to.
This only of you had the correct seed word as the key pair are generated from those word and are always the same variation for the same seed word.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:08:42
Since the BTC was sent to a Segwit address m/49 is what we are looking for. 
Anyhow if you have the seed it is possible to use the xpub to see the balance of all address
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:29:30
hmm.. 
the painting was VERY hard... I do not think the concept behind it is the same as this one, OP seem to want this solved a bit faster than the other one..

@_date: 2018-05-19 23:38:09

@_date: 2018-05-26 16:40:22

@_date: 2018-05-25 01:59:43
My bad, it's 257 - 1 + 1, pretty important
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:47:03
Nope, you need to scroll down, select the bip49 tab then scroll down to the derived address list, if you have the right see the address of the current bounty should be listed there and you would use the private key to swipe the content of the wallet into your wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:06:34
since we are dealing with valid seed word you will find many valid combination that will yield to empty wallet... OP didn't do anything in regard to those... 
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:56:56
Coffee alone did this to your brain?
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:53:35
yup go to the bank and ask to deposit it in your account...
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:26:20
assuming you have all the word without the order it would take a bit more than a few year...
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:33:38
change the 44 for a 49 to make it the correct format (or click the BIP49 button)
@_date: 2018-05-20 02:19:03
Those are cool card... definitely going to look into those
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:53:53
You use this
 with the BIP49 Option tab
If you enter the word in the correct order and the address generated should match the one were the BTC is. If so you use the private key to transfer it to your own address
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:29:22
You do not need an email, simply use this
And test the address on the blockchain... anyhow if you get it right the first address would be the one with the BTC assuming he used the first derivation...
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:33:41
What about Bitcoin Nylon it is a great coin to put in your crypto socks
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:51:53

@_date: 2018-06-17 20:25:31
it is part of the bip39 standard... 
nothing can prevent a checksum word to be the same as one of the word or as 2 or even 3...

from day one it was an attack to the bitcoin protocol, same algo, same address format, same port, hashrate attack thru difficulty bug and they tried to steal the bcc ticker! People around it also spamed the blockchain with transaction.
As for scalling, BTC community didn't close the door to on chain scalling however there was no need to rush such thing except maybe for the artificial issue of fee created by spamming BTC
Now that they fixed most of those issue (Address, Port, Hashrate) it is behaving like a normal alt, people who like it can use it if they want... but do not rewrite history, Bitcoin.com is still acting like if it was the real thing... it is not! Personally I find BCG more innovative than BCH and again BCG is a clone of VTC... lol

You do know that it will not happen during your lifetime tho? 
Even if everybody reading this sub test a new wallet each second it will not happen... this is the basis of crypto, you can not randomly find a wallet someone else randomly generated unless they used flawed method to generate it... 
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:29:50
You are assuming a lot... 
from day one it was an attack to the bitcoin protocol, same algo, same address format, same port, hashrate attack thru difficulty bug and they tried to steal the bcc ticker! People around it also spamed the blockchain with transaction.
It failed miserably and migrated thru a fork to fix those attack vector as it was failing. 
Litecoin was a friendly fork, bitcoin cash fork was not friendly nor usefull to BTC
Litecoin allowed testing segwit and other BIP feature before putting implementing them in the BTC protocol
As for the team around BCH like most alt they are scammer using a cloned variant of the original cryptocurency like many other

They are passing the right to own a bitcoin. All the bitcoin move into their wallet. 
This is quite different than recycling an unspent random coin from the blockchain which take an insane amount of computing power for a single one, especially if it is an old coin since you would need to re-mine all block after...

TD, Tangerine, BMO, Scotia have all sent letter with the same wording... 
To me it does seem like they are concerting... not sure why RBC has not done it yet but don't hold your breath...
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:45:42
It is writen on their site they accept USD... they still accept bcash too if you are so enclined but hurry value is getting lower by the day
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:55:18
Damn we can trust anybody nowaday not even random stranger on Ebay. 
There's even a guy who was selling a picture of a ledger nano S for $99...

Soon they will be called the Winklevoss Quintuplet

Do a replace by fee it will cost you less than taking the time to post such a useless post...

@_date: 2018-02-10 22:06:23


I can send you 1 BTCt if you want
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:19:03
a BCH chill...
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:22:19
As a sage once said if you do not get it I do not have time to convince you. 
Personally I think that litecoin is superior to bcash care to prove me wrong...
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:57:39
bcash is an ALT it is as simple as this... 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:13:36
Bad idea, why use a single word and reduce it's randomness by using the BIP word... as other mentioned, you have only 2028 word to try so it would be prety quick...
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:16:49
I had this one, not better but different...
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:23:42


Yup! With only one big coin man!

Not even they know nothing about cloud...

Hence the buy when there's blood on the street saying...
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:36:20
No interest... accepting BTC should mean seller listing in BTC and buyer buying in BTC
If they mention payment processor then they intend to convert BTC to USD... I'll pass...
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:37:44
Just do a replace by fee with 5-6 satoshi no need for a post...
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:16:14
As long as they categorize them as cash advance and allow them it is acceptable. People want to invest in bitcoin and earn cashback "fiatback" lol...
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:22:05
I think it's a Bi, as in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:04:55
RBC will probably follow suit, it seem all of them are following guideline from central bank...
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:53:44
We need to stop suporting who hurt us, part of the correction length is due to the bullshit some judas spread... 
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:53:29


Reversing trade on an exchange is fine as long as we do not generate a bitcoin binance fork to fix this :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:55:11
That's a token available from multiple vendor for a few $
If you search Leanna or Casacius you will find another type that has a key attached to it (they are actual wallet). Lealana or Casacius do have some value due to scarcity, this one I am afraid worth only a few $ still not a bad way to spread bitcoin awareness...
Not my sales, lealana.. Casacius sometime goes for 10-20K each...
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:52:58
Round as a bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:33:44
use the xpub key from your wallet and load it with Sentinel (from the maker of samourai wallet), it will tell you the full balance related to the private key (this doesn't involve moving anything so it is safe...) From there you will maybe understand what is going up with your mycelium, SPV wallet need a network to work (even ledger as they use api to show the balance (total) of all your address from the blockchain) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:10:08
No me for sure, I do not promote scam coin... 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:40:31
Ever heard of conversion fee...
If the interest of this news is to see larger bitcoin usage using payment processor is not really such a big news for bitcoin... 
Ebay Adoption should mean FULL use of the bockchain to confirm payment period. They will not do this... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:05:53
If you start seeing running inflation then May Be... 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:13:47
Go on :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:19:10


This is probably the reason, even without the correction people were probably not cashing out to pay their card especially in December.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:55:03
Yes but not everybody will go buy it in a walmart parking... this has impact believe it or not...
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:30:30

so is 2003,1993,1983...
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:28:06
People see value in alt when there's none for the most part, marketing team are doing their job and help pump scam coin. Those who control those alt then trade them for BTC and cash out or pump their coin again. 
The current drop is probably due to the pump of December in many alt. Inflation is back in a crooked way
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:19:22
They sent letter as well, didn't get the memo?
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:51:15
I heard of a Japanese assent man named Satoshi who trowed away the key of his bitcoin and went into a Tibetan monastery to meditate on the monetary system
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:42:47
Tangerine is doing the same, Bank of Canada directive probably... they preffer people to buy bitcoin in a wallmart parking...

BCH is already obsolete not need to change anything in bitcoin.

Free bitcoin airdrop would sure convince me :)

You do realize how big this number is right?

I hope his password is better than his email password... seriously this is not how bitcoin security work... 
you have one chance out of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. give or take one '0' to find 1 single used private key and it could very well be empty... you should concentrate on powerball instead...

You select receive and you will get 1 address that you can share... as for the extended part you will need to extend what you mean...
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:32:19
a bit extreme... an ATM doesn't do RBF... 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:05:51
This is also a method to put pressure onto the wallet manufacturer to support their shitcoin no wonder they are a bit nicer with Ledger who support more alt... Wallet support does increase the likelihood of people buying their stuff
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:58:27
Damnn there back... must be time to buy
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:48:36
Should rename this to Chinese wishful thinking
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:25:48
That is the very reason why bitcoin is not a luxury but a need...
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:22:34
I think you are in the wrong subs, Bitcoin is not meant to be regulated and can't. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:52:05
Sound like a great idea let's fork bitcoin and call it...
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:09:01
The exchange lost it not someone, exchange put your deposit in a wallet and from there what you have is an 'enticement' to BTC withdrawal, the fact that they allowed you to withdraw more mean they are not going to balance at the end of the day. 
They will find out and ask you to send it back most likely... 
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:34:58
Try tasseomancy  or TA for a short prediction
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:36:53
It doesn't need an interface, interface are simply a meant for some people to get it quicker, but a lot of people will work or sell goods for bitcoin. Each ATH strengthen it's intrinsic value... 
F.. the interface :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:27:17
Monero is a privacy coin, not dash it is a Guru Coin...
As for mixing you need other to do this as others post pointed out.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:39:56


Hmm, if they loose money it can't be good for their user at the end... 
any explanation on why this happened somewhere?

I'll pass on this one...

This is why I prefer not to state my opinion just in case I get blamed for it :)
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:01:57
Yup, and nobody's crying because they reject crypto...
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:12:57
Ok now can we start a debate on TP IP packet size, I feel we should have been included in this debate too... 
I also wonder why we are not debating about the alphabet used in the key. W could be confused with VV so we should remove it from address...
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:53:53
Altcoins are not real alternative so no point at all...

 do not think that there's doubt about Hal Finney identity...
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:10:39
Yes you can generate a private key but the chance of generating one that belong to someone else address are astronomically small even if you spent your life generating them you would not find one already used... in fact you would need almost as much power as many sun to find one and it could still be empty...
here's a simple explanation... 
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:34:13
As someone once wrote in bitcointalk.org, if you do not get it I don't have time to convince you...

cause he's an as... 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:08:57
Definitelly not on a PC... 
Load a hardware wallet, generate the seed and create a password (25th word), generate a receiving address send the BTC then learn the seed and erase the hardware wallet
You can also keep it arround as a backup, make more backup by loading the same seed in each of them...
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:34:18
Forget fiat buy Bitcoin, be your own bank they say ;)
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:37:15
You can use something like this to attach a new fee to the transaction, use google google to find transaction accelerator, there's other too like btc.com has one
I believe your transaction will eventually return, but no idea on the actual process
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:02:51


More payment option, pay with bitcoin is on the option
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:30:29

You mean the previous one :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:56:03
When I see this posted on bitcoin.org then I will worry... 
If really bitcoin is such in need of developer then it is not a good news for people looking forward to see it evolve (and I am not talking about 2x...)
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:50:26
Nope, it is bank token not your key not your token lol
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:36:48
Great for confirming receiving address of a hardware wallet as well

hey you have some breadcoin and coffeecoin but miss some peanutbuttercoin. 
we can exchange some of the breadcoin we sold you last week at 2% premium for a 4% exchange fee, now you will be able to make yourself a decent breakfast...
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:48:54
Exactly, their use nickname like legacy, classic and now B1X show this is really a takeover attempt...
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:41:43
Many different people are working on what they like most, this is what make open source and decentralized system so great. 
They are luckily not bound to what Reddit issue of the day discussion.
People do not realize enough that there's university course on bitcoin and block chain (they use blockchain so that it stay politically correct I assume)  
There's a reason why they study Bitcoin and not some other alt too...
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:25:01

I would had that you need to be careful with paperwallet not all site that generate them are safe and the process to do so is also important. Also you need to 'empty' a paperwallet, you can not partial spend from it. A trezor or a ledger would be a better idea if you plan to keep investing. There's plenty of good phone wallet too that are prety safe for small amount. You can move the fund to them, backup the seed and remove the apps
