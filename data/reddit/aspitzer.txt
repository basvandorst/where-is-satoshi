That seems like a terrible plan. 0.01 BTC and then you get ads via SMS.

I don't care about Wikileaks at all. It does nothing for me and I am neutral.
I care about Bitcoin. I want it to succeed with the least amount of obstacles in its way.

they are useless. I did a test with 5 of those, and only got 35M hashes/sec. I have a video card that gets 320M hashes/sec.

No CPU mining... it is a waste of time.
the MSI-890FX-GD65 have 2 slots spaced far apart:
the MSI-890FX-GD70 actually has 5 slots, but you can only fit 3 cards in without any risers:
Otherwise, if you dont mind your computer looking like Frankenstein, you get risers:

Nope, just that it is harder to make them. The value is unrelated to the difficulty.
The difficulty is driven by how many people are mining. It is getting close to the point where it is not worth mining. People will drop out and the complexity will go down again, and mining will be profitable again (hopefully!)

No.. I did not miss that... What I would like to miss is all the other politicians that will start rallying against it now that it is thrust in their face.

I tar, mcrypt, gzip it and send it off to another server offsite in a cronjob

CPUs are pretty much a waste of time. 1 x $200 ATI video card is equivalent to about 50 x Dual CPU (Quad Core) Dell PE1950 servers.
I got 32M/h/s on 5 x Servers (running on all 8 cores), and I get around 320M/h/s on a single video card.

you can't do that without consent from the site, otherwise there is no way to prove that you were not trying to break in.

less choppy? what do you mean? I dont have any issues.

I am not sure why I am getting down voted for this. I am just stating that this will cause the Government (who hates Wikileaks) to attack Bitcoin, just to stop Wikileaks from getting money.

I have a Radeon 6870 @ 285M/s and a Radeon 6950 @ 320M/s. Don't use NVidia cards, they are like 10X slower then Radeon cards for this specific function.

I have 1 machine/2 cards and I am making 1btc/day. you will probably lose money on power is you really have a house full of machines.
@_date: 2011-06-09 10:45:49
you better pay off your credit card or the 8-18% interest will kill you. how much is your power bill?

this sucks.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:30:24
that sucks... if politicians did not know about bitcoins before, now they will. This is going to cause a lot of unneeded attention and will cause at least a couple people to start rallying against bitcoin. :(

what a bunch of fucking idiots.

The mining applications make use of all the GPUs on the card. Where a desktop CPU can mine at like 5000 hashes/sec per core, using one of these card can get you 360M hashes/sec. People put up to 4 cards into a machine to generate up to 1Bh/s.
To give you an idea of how slow it is mining, I ran a test overnight on a 6 multi core servers. I was getting a aggr of ~30M h/s. In 12 hours, I made like 0.02BTC.
Soooo... Unless you have a couple hundred servers lying around, your best bet is to build a machine with a couple video cards in it. At like $800/card, it is a bit pricey.
If you look at this  it says that if you spent a couple grand on a 4 card machine that could do 1G h/s, you could make:
Coins    Dollars
day: ฿2.31	  $24.40
week: ฿16.86	$177.92
month: ฿70.31	$741.77
unless the bottom falls out of the btc economy... or the hashes get a lot harder.

I have a 6950 which does 325M/s and a 6870 which does 290M/s in a 890FXA motherboard. Runs like a top on Ubuntu 11.04.

The US government (as well as those of many other countries) hates Wikileaks, and (so far) really don't care one way or the other about Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is all of a sudden funding something they hate, that gives them a reason to hate Bitcoin, which was benign to them earlier.
@_date: 2011-06-16 20:49:06
Well the complexity just changed yesterday (if that is what you are looking at).
Last Week: 600Mhs =~ 1.05BTC/day
This Week: 600Mhs =~ 0.69BTC/day
@_date: 2011-06-16 20:52:58
I get 324/Mhs with a Sapphire 6990 (non reference/not unlocked).
Linux, poclbm.py -v -f30 -w128

aticonfig --odsc=840,1250  --adapter=2
@_date: 2011-07-06 21:57:34
it's getting awful hard to justify mining these days... I am down to only like 0.33 BTC/day, and the hash rate is going up in the next day or 2. :(
@_date: 2011-06-10 13:16:11
It is a speculative investment on the future - like buying gold, investing in pork bellies, or trading foreign currencies.
We are putting some money into Bitcoins in hopes that some day it will be worth something. Like all investments, risk is involved.
Some people are investing actual money in bitcoins (just like trading other currencies). Others (like myself) invested in computer hardware and are mining. Mining has a much smaller risk than actually buying BTC, but the payouts are much less and it requires a lot more time.
I would never sink all my money into BTC, but rather make sure that I have a diverse portfolio of investments.

It was down a whopping 20% last night, which the Dollar has done in the past...
@_date: 2011-06-10 10:49:09
it is just not cost effective yet. you will spend more than you make.
