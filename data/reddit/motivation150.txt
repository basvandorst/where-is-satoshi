Interesting. Don't remember them asking to print one, but I was really young when I downloaded it, and really didn't know a lot about Bitcoin (this was 2013, after all). 
I've got al of my other stuff on a paper wallet, but I'll be sure to check for those on my PC. Thanks for the advice.

Gotta do what you gotta do. I might sell mine to pay off student loans. 
Naturally it'll just to 1 million each once I do. But priorities I guess

Because I don't have a time machine. 
Also, because the moment I sell, it would have skyrocketed. That's how it works. Also, that was when it was rising like 2k every day. It's still in the early phases.

Down for good? I'm sure this isn't the first time it's been down.

yes, this was my main concern. Even the small fractions I bought for fun are now worth a few hundred dollars. Is there a way to do this without losing my money?

I did, he has a fairly common name unfortunately, couldn't find him. Oh well.

Ill never forget a few years ago, maybe around 2010, this kid gave a presentation in my public speaking class about why we should invest in bitcoin. Nobody really took him seriously. I don't think I was even paying attention. I wonder where he is now..
Update:  I just found out he went on to Co-found MtGoxLive. And to think I was sitting in a community college class with him, haha. Oh man. Good for him.

I meant mtgox live, Im on my phone, I apologize.

I hope so, he seemed like a good guy. I just can't believe I had such a huge opportunity right in my face and I was too busy probably texting or something to listen

My biggest concern is losing my BTC. if I do this, will I lose them?
