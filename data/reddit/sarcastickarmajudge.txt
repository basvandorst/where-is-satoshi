It's literally as real as Bitcoin. The seed is different, and neither seed is more correct than the other. It just has less branding.
In short, the only reason to prefer one fork or another is your attachment to the random seed number and the brand loyalty. Which to be fair, is strong for bitcoin for the time being. On the other hand, you can actually use Bitcoin cash to buy things without $40 transaction fees. Imagine that, using Bitcoin to buy things it was actually intended for rather than to day trade.

Unless it's denominated in a superior cryptocurrency. It's the same paradox with religions. If a religion is the one true religion, it's a matter of time before everyone converts or is forced to. Unless they really weren't the one true religion..

You have a basic mis-understanding of math and computer science here. To illustrate, you cannot argue that because a system cannot handle and *infinite number of transactions*, that it is not scalable. Rather, you talk about if it scales linearly with transactions in time, storage (i.e. memory, packets, etc..), and processing. Thus if you double the number of inputs N, as long as those other factors do not increase exponentially, it is more than scalable.
It is entirely reasonable, for example, for VISA to double their storage and processing, if the number of transactions double. That's linear and what we call scalable. It would not be reasonable if they had to increase it exponentially - that would not be scalabe. VISA cannot handle an *infinite* number of transactions. Don't be stupid.

Buffet compared crypto to the early days auto industry, where out of 200 competitors only 3 survived. And he's absolutely right about that. 99% of crypto currencies will die and the survivors will be the new currency we use. You're deluding yourself if you think otherwise.

I can use it to go to Michellin starred restaurants and see myself justifying a $40 commission. This $30 commission isn't much compared to the full tab, or even the gratuity. But I can also see how for a regular restaurant why $60 might not justify the convenience.

Correct. This is exactly the same situation as Coke. There is no longer just Coke, there is Coke Classic and New Coke. That's how hard they forked the two recipes - they threw away the old name entirely.

Lots of forks replace the original, all the time. In software it's literally far more common for a fork to replace the original than for the original to never get patched. Certain bugs and features demand it. One of the most basic fixes being proposed for Bitcoin, and seriously considered, requires a hard fork.
The recipe for Coke has changed dozens of times. In fact the most recent "fork" *changed the name of the original* into Coke Classic. When a previous version is famous enough, it's quite normal to "re-name that" the Classic.

It depends entirely on the "1) character 2) source 3) timing and 4) amount of the gains"
So the fact that you can do this with impunity as a tourist in Europe does not allow you to day trade currencies without reporting taxes. That's the same fallacy as saying I paid no duty on clothes I bought in Europe so let me start an import business and skip VAT. They've thought of all that already, in great detail.

Lottery and Las Vegas are textbook gambling - i.e. the expected result is to lose money. The only way for a person to make money, is for someone else to lose *even more*. It's a negative sum game.
Investing is a positive sum game. If it did not make more money than it lost in the long run, it would not be, by definition, investing.
The only value of gambling is for entertainment. The value of investment is it is a natural and necessary party of the business cycle.
They're two totally different things, just FYI.

Of course. He doesn't have a strategy. He says he buys bitcoin because he *wants to buy things with them*. And he no longer can, so he sold all but a handful to play with. He's not day trader looking to make any profit.
People who used to use bitcoin have now been replaced by day traders. This is good for bitcoin, right?

In pump and dump, by definition some newcomer fool believes it and is left holding the bag. That's exactly what happened.
People who used Bitcoin to buy things (its actual purpose), didn't believe it. Neither did most long-term investors. People who day traded Bitcoin, did.

In a very real sense, you lose all your money any time you convert it into crypto. And unless your crypto is stolen, you still have it. 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, full value.
You only regain your investments, in terms of money, when you sell them. This is an important concept:

Even if the exchange is a scam, that doesn't mean bitcoin has to go either way. MtGox is one of a long line of examples of that.
A ship full of gold getting robbed by pirates doesn't change the intrinsic price of gold. If they spend it all right away, it might devalue gold in the short run, that's about it. Change of ownership itself or even fraud isn't the issue.

True, and it could even go to $500,000. Or roughly $0. It could.

So instead of paying someone a commission to exchange currency, like done for thousands of years, you exchange them for a fake piece of paper run by a ponzi scheme. Great, you saved your commission.
The history of Dutch banking is a great example of the pains they took to verify deposits. A different group of people would be elected every year to go into the bank vaults and physically verify the deposits, swear oaths, and run the bank without any personal ties to the money going in and out. Just goes to show you how much we're reinventing the wheel now.

Steve Woz give some great advice on why he sold bitcoin - he just didn't want to live day to day caring about its value. He actually only bought bitcoin because he wanted to *buy things with it*. Imagine that.

Right, he's going to stop laughing now because you have some money. Your happiness and his are not mutually exclusive.

How many of these bubbles have you lived through as an adult? The first thing you learn is almost everything gets devalued. The Madoff ponzi scheme was a great example where people were forced to sell a "sure thing", not through any doubt about it being a golden goose, but in order to cover their other losses. That was the only reason that ponzi scheme collapsed.
While there are isolated bubbles that pop, most are due to something more fundamental, but are also a normal part of the business cycle. Bubbles are perfectly natural even in a rational and healthy economy.

They don't charge you $40 to hand a gold coin to your friend, and another $40 to hand it back. Both transactions taking anywhere from seconds to fornever.
Oh, and people don't routinely exchange their gold for IOUs from a company they don't know and will never meet, in order to save on commisions.
The biggest scam in bitcoin is that people now willingly exchange them for fake crypto. Tether being the best example right now. "Just trust us" is not a real currency.

So does bitcoin. Which is exactly why we're pushing lightning as a 2nd tier solution. Not to mention that bitcoin is, *by intentional design*, not scalable in mining. There are a finite number of bitcoins on purpose.
