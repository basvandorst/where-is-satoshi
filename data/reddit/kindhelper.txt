Too late/risky when hype has already set in, wait for it to subside. Most of it is speculation/emotion atm its disgusting, way above neccessity with those swings.
Or put in* what you dont care about losing 50% of and start using it for reals.

  mobile phone topup (and internet),  
  VPN subscriptions,  
  Utility bills,  
  Groceries, everyday food and stuff at the supermarket,  
  Gaming (steam etc),  
Will be using it for:  
  Shopping online, clothes, electricals, whatever.  
none of the stores get my bank details or even know i use btc, none of the irl stores have any buisness with my id. UK resident.

Same, what an association of words pushed into view. I'm sure pro banking and government institutions WOULD relish this one. What a ..king stupid post. Quite a little trojan horse that is, way to go OP with that implication.

They are recommended in the sidebar of this very sub and shilled in most of the posts to enquiring newbies. Place needs to shape up tbh.
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:55:20
as more people continue to sign up and hand them their government ID, because they are endorsed and trusted on the r/Bitcoin sidebar ----&gt;  
Coinbase 'fans' have free play to shill it all over in the posts here to newbies too.
What a complete shitshow.

Well the person advising you to sell on an exchange posted the thread on bitfinex exchange fear, be careful who you take advice from obviously and best of luck anyway.
from coinbase own words:
[Coinbase | IRS Notification](  
Cashing out from there I have no idea if you will be required to pay your taxes on it. There may be AML &amp; anti structuring safeguards in place even if cashing out slowly.
Personally I would test out small amounts to check the fees and ease of it if youre curious, but even then be wary that the account could get limited or frozen suddenly at some point (search on here), and coinbase employ serious blockchain analytics.
However, it has gotten so easy to set aside amounts into a mobile wallet and start using it to live off, and with discounts. just saying, you should try this anyway if you arent already :)
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:57:24
  
  
(the dot com and info are the same thing as far as i recall)  
  
best be careful taking recommendations from here at face value.
also why not just hold the coins yourself? That way you know theyre yours to actually use, without the risk of the exchange limiting your account at any random time.
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:59:30
sorry, cant help, but..  
  
  
curious to see what happens, gl
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:51:38
Maybe, if there're no hoops to jump through and wallets can interact with it natively. Not if it uses crap like bitpay.

might? :D

[Free inbound lightning channel](  
(takes a while to open, since they open it for you, no cost to you)
actually works. but yeah
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:50:40
[get a lightning wallet]( send some small pocketmoney to it from the exchange and open a lightning channel. 
Its not true about needing to run full nodes and whatever to start trying it, plus lots of people lurk in here that are involved in altcoins trying to put people off obviously :D
!lntip 2000  
now you have coins on lightning, you can use this tipbot as a custodial wallet even, withdraw to your own wallet once you get it sorted.

Dont go back. Zoom out, artificial pumps.  
[scam coin?](
going over looking for answers and advice from them would be like like going back to a dodgy dealership, youll get lies from alt accounts all talking nonsense and be persuaded to flip-flop.
[Jul 30 2017](
Be careful, be happy you gained some legit useful value and move on.
e: watch for randoms talking at you in secret, trying too hard to convince you, its for their own reasons. A scam is a scam, scammy people will scam, words dont change proof that is there. See link ^ and date, solid proof of intent.

Hes advising people to "sell on exchange" after posting this too. Strange that.
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:57:43
going by how often the sub and posts are trolled by bcash sponsors, possibly any new users will be led away by them first, maybe its a sneaky plug? "I have never purchased any bitcoins before.".."We make money on bitcoin". All other exchanges may as well not exist at this point, coinbase won, 90% recommend it in any post here, r/bitcoin subreddit officially recommends it.. why give a fk if fools and their money cba to just search first.
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:58:13
Its possible theyre thinking to liquidate a lot. Being primed to throw it all back on any shady exchange when all of the warnings are there, wouldnt be good.
You can however use it, without going back to any of the shady exchanges to risk losing it.
which exchange has a good track record?

if people come here for research, theyre gonna end up on coinbase :( it gets the majority vote in the comments when someone asks and its officially recommended in the sidebar.

You'll have to wait days/weeks 'till your ID clears and even then risk having account frozen. Look at the bother people have with coinbase.
buy stuff with it instead, live off it, buy gift cards, top up amazon funds, refil mobile creddit etc. it literally takes seconds.
edit: just re-read, seriously do not send it back to coinbase.

tbf, BTC(dot)com wallet (bitmain) is stickered on the bitcoin.org wallet section giving it legitimacy and a perception that the (dot)com is the official one somehow, BitPay sits right next to it.
Further, coinbase (also much hated underminers of bitcoin) is  endorsed and trusted exchange in the emboldened "How to buy bitcoins worldwide" link here on the r/Bitcoin sidebar ----&gt;
Its some kind of ridiculous shit show tbh, funny games all around, and some really just dgaf.
Another question could be ['What should be done with the bitcoin.org account?'](
