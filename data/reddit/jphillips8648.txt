It's just you. You cant measure bitcoins reach by social media alone. Their is also a large silent majority that doesn't even participate because this shit is still technically taboo.

Ready for the pumpers to start quickly dumping as fast they pump...absolutely always ready for the same old repetitive shit!
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:27:04
Exactly! What does this market mean!?

You're right, unpopular the second you said "ban". That's not the way I want to see bitcoin become triumphant. I hope to see bitcoin dominate with its decentralized silence as opposed to depending on centralized control over ANY entity!
