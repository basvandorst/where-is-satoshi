retirement is a luxury not everyone should receive.  there is no solution for the masses if huge sacrifices are not made.

the point is we need to encourage saving in large quantities, both for retirement and things like a house or family.  this "I'm saving 3% for retirement" bullshit isn't helping anyone.  people seriously need to be saving upwards of 30% of their earnings and for some reason consumer savings is only at 4% in the US.  a negative savings interest rate would encourage no savings at all, which is horribly near sighted.
I max my 401k every year I can and then still only spend 48% of my post tax net income.  I'd like to buy a house and actually retire someday.  this is really the only way it's going to happen with certainty.

And yet somehow there are people who earn less and they haven't died..

The point is that I'm not spending every single thing I earn.  Everyone can live below their means.
