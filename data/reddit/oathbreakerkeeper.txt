SOVEREIGN CITIZEN

Is this the SUV or is it a hatchback? Either way it's nice, I was considering between the two myself. How do you like it?

How are you handling taxes? I hope you set some aside to pay for the taxes, and then what's leftover to pay what I assume is student loan debt?

Well even if it is true it seems like a bad idea. 
If it crashed to $5k over the next month or two and you had an emergency need for some cash, would you be OK?

I'm not currently in a financial bind as you  are, so I'm lucky with that. But I was born into a terrible family and abandoned/neglected by my birth parents. My adopted parents also treated me really poorly and abused me, and so I never learned how to properly socialize or have self esteem. On the surface people think I'm doing pretty well for myself but what nobody knows is that I have no family dating or social life. I've cut off my terrible family so I've been on my own my entire adult life. 
So I will probably die alone. You're much better off than me, OP. Even if I became wealthy from bitcoins (which I'm not) I wouldn't have anyone to share it with. I don't know that my life would really improve very much aside from being able to buy a car so I don't have to take the bus to school.

Don't you get more space? Cargo space and seating? I'm asking, not being rhetorical.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:16
Why would you have to wait till the 1st?

Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of selling though, since the crypto's tend to be correlated. You sell BTC for some other crypto and then if BTC goes down the one you just traded to does as well, so you may as well have not sold.

RemindMe! One week

The other poster seemed pretty sure that the SUV is better "after much reaearch". I'm wondering what those reasons are. I am gonna consider both pretty soon so I'd like to know the pros and cons. 
Personally leaning towards hatch because I can get 2.5L motor with manual transmission, and I don't think either of those are available in the SUV. But having space in the SUV seems pretty attractive, though not sure it would actually be put to use most of the time.

I want a reminder to read your link about futures when I'm done with finals. Why so aggressive? If there was nothing worth reminding about in one week it would mean your post contained nothing of interest to anyone and had nothing worth coming back to. You should be happy someone found your post useful. 
Do you know about the "RemindMe!" bot? It sends you an alert in the time that you specify, in my case a week from now.

How loud are they and how much heat/

Would there be any way for him to send a tiny chunk of btc to some other address and somehow anonymize it? A tumbling service or something, or do those not work? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:14
That's not my question though. Would you be able to survive through such a drop is my question. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:38
How long does it take? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:44
For bitcoin a 90% drop would not qualify as Black Swan. Such a drop would not surprise me nor many others. I almost expect it to happen at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:07:12
I could be wrong but I think he/she may have been referring to the gains on the BTC? Do you have capital gains taxes in the UK? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:19
You mean compared to the hatch? What makes the SUV better?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:39
How do you find your private key? i'm assuming it's inside wallet.dat? But how do you view the private key? I'm not planning on signing any messages but curious about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:26
What fee does coinbase charge? (i.e., how much, is it % of the total transaction, etc)?

Are there brackets for long term capital gains taxes? I thought it was just a flat 15%? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:51:22
Can you explain more what's going on? I'm a clueless bystander.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:06
How long have you been HODLing yeah or no
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:45
I'm not shorting anything.

Ah, they have same space? If so I can't understand getting the cx5.

What are some examples of such assets? Stocks, real estate are the first that come to mind. Are there other less obvious ones?

This post only seems to enforce the argument that it is a bubble

Please tell me you can afford to lose a good portion of that. Not that you will, but in the case it does happen, it's a loss you can live with.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:08:42
The crazy order is also the first thing I noticed. The one that stuck out at me was how far up an emergency fund was.
