The objective is to be as cheap as a taxi (or cheaper) since green electricity is half the price on running LPG and payment processing can account for 10% of costs. Then there is the deflation too.

It is an interesting point. there is an inherent problem though that prices need to trend downward over time for the same service or product as BTC value increases. This makes it easier just to price in a dollar denomination.

@_date: 2014-03-31 00:26:05
Not at all, the best trades are either when your personal wealth is maximised, societal wealth is maximised or an optimal point in between these two. This covers all of the "best trades" regardless of where you lie on the politic spectrum (besides being an a-hole). The set of 'your personal wealth maximised' does include the set of reducing others financial wealth (unfortunately), but increasing personal wealth by taking it from others is sub-optimal for a society and unnecessary personally when a fair currency can deliver an increase in personal wealth significantly faster in a large network.

His ignorance and arrogance are astounding. On one hand he says a currency has to be mainstream to work, yet on the other he claims the silly niche stupidity of Doge is what makes it work - and also claims Bitcoiners don't understand basic economics. He can't have it both ways. The reality is, a currency only needs a network to work, and the greater the network is, the more valuable the currency (per unit token).
Then, to marginalise a whole community with a very diverse set of goals, many of which originally are the ultimate humanitarian goal (many now also have greed/ corruption etc.) as "crazy Libertarians" entirely misses the point of how economies work. The money is agnostic to the ideas of the users in the economy besides the single idea that is shared "these tokens are fair and just as a means of exchange." That is it. One common belief, with no dictates on anything else in your head. Crazy libertarians, republicans, democrats and reddittors all use USD too. 
So go fill your head with Doge or alt crypto baloney memes and trade with that with your friends that agree. But please, stop waxing lyrical like a fool with egregious generalizations and hypocrisy and let the rest of us that care to believe in a fairer monetary system for all humanity to get on with the job of growing our economy. You don't have to be part of it, you are free to choose which rocket ship takes you to the moon, however together, we are more likely to get there.

You say 'the economy' like you are referring to one global economy or perhaps a national economy. I'm referring to the economy of a specific set of people/ society using a common currency. So what I mean Is, trade between those people, with that currency grows that economy. When the trade is between two societies then the global economy grows. The important difference is, growth within the Bitcoin economy benefits all participants equally, where as growth with other economies has a bias towards benefitting the money printers and fractional reserve lenders.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:19:44
Thanks again. I had thought about this, however, given the rate of production, supply is going to be reasonably low and there is always Uber for excess capacity. (Which is fiat). So, for these reasons, I feel that the you will fail assertion isn't totally justified. That said, your point is valid.

I'm not entirely sure I understand what you mean. Trade generally has the most direct impact of benefitting those involved in the trade - if it is considered fair, that is each person values what the other person has equally then they should feel the have both individually benefitted from it. A by-product of the trade though is an increase in wealth as it is not always zero sum - for example materials combined in new ways to make something novel.

It isn't panic selling, it may be Gox selling. Step 1, flood your own exchange with Gox coin. Step 2, Attract fiat (this may not work in their current state), but it will lower the cash debt that they owe as people buy cheap Gox coin Step 3, Use fiat to buy cheaper BTC on other exchanges. Step 3, Settle BTC debt on Bitcoin builder at 0.4 of what they owe. Step 4. Gox becomes the owner of all the Gox coin with no outstanding debts. (A long shot, but maybe)

Think about that for a second, it is a really bad idea.
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:42:40
I think he is great and has very well formulated ideas. There is no reason why different communities might choose different types of hard money though, as the game theory would dictate that by choosing one currency is ceding a lot of power to those that have it accumulated. So there is a trade off in the choice that optimises for time, power and other utility. People are individually optimising for power, and sometimes that is collaborating with a community, sometimes it is forming a new community (unfortunately). Bitcoin benefits from still being a relatively small community competing against outdated money and monetary policy.
This means that it is likely that other currencies will rise, but may not become the standard reserve to measure against.
I love his ideas here, but I am dumbfounded by his ideas on $TSLA. I have a bet with this guy, although nothing at stake, that $TSLA will be successful, just like I did with Hal Varian that Bitcoin would be successful. I love having some stake and reputation on the line for opposing views on big ideas.

I was on board very very early and supported from the fundamental belief that this could lift all humanity up. Censorship resistant money, a sound economic basis, untethered from authoritarian rule. This piece is the first great explanation I’ve read while trying to have a rational discussion about the issues involved in scaling. I never realized the full scope of power concessions that were potentially being traded by big blockers (although it can’t be exactly quantified but there is definitely some trade off here). I also didn’t realize that full nodes (which I run) had this consensus (or individual consensus breaking) power either. As an aside, doesn’t this individual power lend itself to an exploit?
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:44:36
This is true, the holder generally eats a drawdown.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:58:30
But surely more than one is required for consensus. Think of two scenarios: one everybody - miners and users (except you with a full node) change. Two, you just decide to make up some new rules to reject blocks because troll. Both seemingly look the same but surely in each case the one has no power. The would at least need to be a few running a common validating rule set? It’s been almost a decade since I read the white paper....
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:39:53
100% agree, I just mean that it seems incredibly powerful that one honest node (user node) rejecting blocks can prevent blocks being validated. Am I reading that correctly, how do you know they are honest if they were the last node standing on a legacy rule set (say from a social attack)?

"Fertility declines [due to legalized abortion] for black women are three times greater than for whites (12 percent compared with 4 percent). Given that homicide rates of black youths are roughly nine times higher than those of white youths, racial differences in the fertility effects of abortion are likely to translate into greater homicide reductions. Under the assumption that those black and white births eliminated by legalized abortion would have experienced the average criminal propensities of their respective races, then the predicted reduction in homicide is 8.9 percent."
