How much do drugs cost in states where it is legal? 
This would be great way to prove your point. 
Is dime bag 1$ in states where it is legal as opposed to 10$ in states where it is illegal? Do they call it a penny bag now?

Thank you!

By law, they do.  To what point do they care then? 20,000$ ?

Thank you homad, I forgot about this. Have you used it before, does it work well?

I have never filed a 1099 before. I am researching the proper way to do so because I do not want to make any mistakes.  From what I have read so far, FIFO method is the best way. I have also thought about hiring an accountant.  That is how careful we all need to be.  I have only sold one time for a gain of 3$. As the law is written I have to file for 3$ gain.  I am just afraid of doing something wrong, and in which case I am looking into hiring accountant.

I have used coinbase and gdax.  Will it know how to calculate from both?

Thanks for your response, I appreciate it very much. 
As for trading one coin for a different coin, would that be a taxable event or no? 
Example: at the current rate, we can trade 1btc for 20eth.  
Is this a taxable event? 
There is no fiat involved so my guess would be no.

Well in your opinion there  is a lot of idiots because the irs claims only 802 people between the years 2013-2015 reported gains or losses 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:17:28
I have never withdrawn. But the IRS states every single transaction within the exchange (gdax) needs to be reported, gain or loss.
