Greater demand to buy and hold for percieved future profit, not to use as an exchange.

It is a pretty good argument
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:20:33
Why would you use a currency as an exchange if there is a chance it could be worth more in the next 10 minutes?
The inherent volatility of the value of bitcoin makes it a poor currency. There is no reason to use it as a means of exchange, for neither the buyer or seller, if its value is not consistent.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:29:46

I'd take this to personal finance and discuss it with them. My own personal advice would be to sell immediately.
I'd wait for the housing market to turn around to purchase your house, but sell immediately. This is *way* too volatile of a commodity for you to have your livelihood sitting on.   
Think about it man. You literally gained and lost $600,000 week to week. It's just floating around. You lose and gain tens to hundreds of thousands a day. That's ridiculous, and you need to put that money in a more secure location ASAP. This is your life; get it out of that volatility. Put it in something less risky ASAP.
If I were you, I couldn't sell that shit fast enough. Every second that it sits in BTC I'd feel the insecurity of my funds.
And tell your wife for fucks sake. Like really?

@_date: 2017-11-23 02:05:51
There are a couple things here. Honestly, this entire sub feels like a community that is working together to raise the price. The whole hodl meme, the general attitude to buy in asap and never sell... all of it generates a self fufilling prophecy of buyers that drives up the price. Like, of course the price is going up if everyone is buying indiscriminately, and no one will sell. It is, really, communal market manipulation. How much of the aggregate bitcoin community is doing this is unknown.
Also, I am also concerned at the possibility that there are wealthy investors who don't give a shit about crypto waiting for the right time to drop their holdings. They could be buying in large volume continuously, working together to keep the price climbing.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:10:30

Right. It has already gone through several significant corrections. It was accurate then, and it is accurate now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:58:23
Because the billionaires who have invested massive volume in it this year are driving up the prices and hype along the way, waiting for the right moment to dump their holdings and earn their buck at the expense of everyone else.
And nothing is going to regulate that manipulative and exploitative activity because of the nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:15


Bullshit. There are countless options for investment to protect your dollars from devaluation. You are taking your savings and throwing it onto the roulette table. If you want inflation resistant savings then invest it in something that has proven durability. You know, like your financial advisor would tell you to.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:46:16


That isn't the reason, that is secondary. Bitcoin's ledger is secure because many, many computers are working to validate it, yes. But there is absolutely no reason why that cannot be done within an industry.
The security and integrity of records can be continually validated for integrity via the chain by a large number of machines that are private rather than public. If you don't trust them, fine, but I guarantee you will see this implemented.


I highhhhhly doubt that. If that is indeed the case, then it is a very temporary issue, and it is certainly not the end-all-arguments point for private implementation of blockchains.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:30:39

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:12:48
I completely understand blockchain's implementations and potential in security through distribution.
You are the one making a mistake. An illogical jump. You are missing the fact Bitcoin contributes and constitutes nothing of the sort. Its blockchain serves itself, and itself only. Nothing else. It is a complete mistake to think you are investing in blockchain technology if you buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin fosters Bitcoin. That is it and that is all it seems it ever will intend to be.
Ethereum is really the tip of the iceberg and the first project that has begun to offer blockchains for developer use, and I see this as something to keep a very close eye on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:24


Only insofar as it stays the most relevant one because of it's chronological head start. As more practical and *useful* implementations of blockchain and cryptos emerge, Bitcoin will be challenged.

In order to have a valid teaching credential in my state, you have to:
1- Have a B.A. / B.S.  
2- Complete a full year of unpaid student teaching. 
3- Complete two full time semester's units worth of Education credits, including Education theory, pedagogy and English Language Development techniques. Usually taken during student teaching; *insanely* busy, 12 hour days not uncommon with no income from it.
4- Complete a Performance Assessment, in which you film yourself teaching for 20 minutes, and write a massive, 5-part analysis of the unit, the parts being Community Context, Lesson Planning,  Implementation (teaching), Assessment, and Accomodations. To be graded by state trained university professors. Mine was 35 pages long.  
5- Upon completion, the credential is only valid for 5 years, in order to make it permanent, you must enroll in a two year program upon employment in which you are observed by a state approved coach, and complete more performace assessment bookwork throughout your first two years.
6- Continuing education units are required to renew credential every 5 years, once it is permanent.
7- Masters in Education preferred on top of this.  
I have been in 5 different school districts, and by and large, I have been greatly impressed by the teachers I have encountered. They have all worked incredibly hard to get where they are. There are exceptions, but it is not the rule.
Yes, education is screwed. More so in some places than others. Teachers are not root of that problem. Yet, they get blamed. Consistently. And as such, they get more administrative and regulatory bullshit put on their plates every year, because everyone *thinks* it's their fault. When no one else is left who is willing doing the job and consistently deal with the low pay and these shitty blame-the-teachers attitudes, maybe people will look inwards and take responsibility for their own child's education.

You have confused the concept of *price* with the concept of *value.*
The cost of production has *literally* no application to the current price of bitcoin. The cost of production is used to track the value of a product during manufacturing to calculate the minimum price for profit. This is simple; a car's value is, at minimum, the cost of all components and labor that assembled it.
Go ahead and try to think of something that is manufactured that has no utility.
In contrast, the current price of bitcoin is not even *close* to a reflection of it's cost of production. Are you seriously going to sit there and argue that the total cost of resources (electricity, components) to produce bitcoin has increased $5000 this year? No, it hasn't. Electricity is constant, components are nowhere near that level of fluctuation. This is calculable if someone wants to do the math. No fucking commodity fluctuates in cost of production by thousands and thousands of dollars daily. That's not how production works. 
So, what's the missing link?
Value, as opposed to price, is the amount of money that someone is *willing to pay* for a product. It changes. The value of an item is subjective to each buyer and their circumstances. Hype leads to irrationally high prices. It happens all the time.
This is the bottom line; the current price of bitcoin has *nothing to do* with it's cost of production, and *everything to do* with the perceptions of the buyer that the price of bitcoin will continue to rise into the future. It is not based on any kind of real world utility other than exchange, and will fucking *tank.*
It continues to be a means of exchange that has irrationally high value being fueled by people getting caught up in get rich quick hype, which is likely being pushed by the *real* investors who are waiting to dump their massive holdings in Bitcoin at the opportune moment.

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:15
Is it not credible to you that someone else, also well read and interested in the potential application of blockchain technology and distributed networks, could look at the same data and come to a different conclusion?
If you are indeed as well read as you are on the technology, then I would also surmise you have the ability and intelligence to research and identify large scale speculative bubbles and their characteristics, and make historical comparisons from previous bubbles.
If you see the correlations, then it logically follows that you would respect the fact that the volatility and speculation that drives Bitcoin makes it inherently risky, i.e. gambling, and should treat it with extreme caution regardless of the efficacy of the technology.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:48:55


This is anecdotal, and I can tell you this is absolutely the opposite of the case in my state. The longer someone is teaching, the better they are at managing it. It is the young and inexperienced who are mediocre teachers. They are overwhelmed with the stress; and often working with the hardest kids with the most behavior problems, the most chaotic classes. Older teachers have it dialed in and have the seniority privilege of working with the higher level students. It takes *years* to get organized to the level at where you're able to be not working and planning day to day.
But what do I know, right? I just live every day of my life in the system, but clearly youve read some articles, don't mind me
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:51:03


If it is poorly managed and invested over a time period of decades... bitcoin hasnt even existed in that time frame yet to prove it's durability.
It is illogical to point to Bitcoin as an alternative currency just because of inflation. Bitcoin has guaranteed volatility, which is a terrible state for savings. Which is what we are apparently talking about if youre arguing about fiat depreciating.
I mean you could just be honest and say you're gambling
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:54:23


Yeah, blockchain and distributed networks as a whole. Bitcoin is but the first iteration of it, and there is no reason to believe Bitcoin represents investment in blockchain technology as a whole.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:53:38


This implies that wealth is always earned and deserved, and poverty is always a result of laziness. It's an absolute horseshit mentality. Some of the hardest working people in my life are the poorest, and conversely, I know plenty of well-off people who sit around all day due to their fortunate circumstances. 
I'd like to provide an alternate perspective; you never succeed or fail entirely on your own. Always be humble in your victories, and never beat yourself up over your failures. You will *never* accomplish anything in your life in a social void.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:54:10
Now you can get all your coworkers asking what it means
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:56:03
The only value bitcoin has is the amount that people are willing to pay for it. It will always be that way, it is a means for exchange, not a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:01:39


Dude, if you have an entire community that *never sells* and can justify buying at all time highs over and over again, how is that a *healthy asset*? It is a self fufilling prophecy.
The price will undoubtedly continue to rise until it reaches a yet unknown psychological threshold, at which people who were previously hodlers dump their holdings. Which causes a panic and causes others to sell too. Not everyone is going to stay disciplined when the shit hits the fan. And it is a fact that it will.
Before you know it, it's back at 3k. Or 2, or 1.
And that is okay. But a lot of people will lose everything along the way.

I think I do, if I'm not mistaken, your point is the public nature of Bitcoin's process is what gives it it's inherent security. I understand the point for sure, I just feel like we'll see variations of that process in the future that aren't public.
At least public in the work, publicly visible data makes sense. I am thinking about applications like voting and other paradigms that will shift once it's taken seriously.

It is a means for exchange. It has no intrinsic value. Precious metals have intrinsic value due to their utility. It is not complicated.

I beg to differ, in that I do know what is going to happen. I just don't know when, or to what extent, and therefor am not willing to take the risk of being on the wrong side of the cliff.
I also feel vehemently that Bitcoin will never, ever be a mainstream currency, and it's long term value will reflect that limitation. I look forward to seeing what other projects utilize blockchain for practical purposes, i.e. Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:19:11
This will not end well
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:14


I do. And you should too. Bitcoin is not exempt from basic market forces. It is proven volatile, it is inherently unstable given it's purely speculative nature, and will continue to be so.


That's great and all, but the quantity of people buying it to hodl it and treat it an as a wealth asset greatly exceeds the quantity of people who are actually using it as "money." So, call it whatever you want. Neither of those terms, currency or money, accurately describe the buyer's current attitude towards Bitcoin's use.
Which is, coincidentally, further evidence that the current price is extended far, far beyond it's value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:44:43


It isn't though. This community used to have the goal of increasing adaptation and acceptance to mainstream vendors. It hasn't happened, if anything, people are even more skeptical.
The value isn't going up because more people are accepting it as currency. It is going up because the entire community is working together to drive it up with promises of infinite exponential growth. Read the comments.
It is a pretty bad sign when a crypto community is no longer pushing and promoting mainstream acceptance as a currency, and instead treating it like a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:00:07
Hm. Just remember this whole thing could very likely be a speculative bubble being driven by market manipulation. No one knows if this is "the future."
The prices havent gone up because of mainstream adoption or acceptance from vendors. That much is obvious. It may soon collapse back to its 2015 levels, regardless of whether or not it is indeed the future.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:01:50
If a business recognizes the value of the ledger, there doesn't even need to be a reward as an incentive for "mining," or proof of work for that matter. A dedicated industry can produce the work needed with their own resources, and the incentive/reward is the security and guaranteed integrity of their records.
