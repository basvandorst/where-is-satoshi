Sorry, when I mentioned seeing it as a viable business model, I meant that in response to a couple of other replies in here.
May I ask, why exactly would you suggest against it? If there's a reason then at least it will save me time going forward with ideas. As long as you stick within the guidelines, and protected yourself against fraudsters, wouldn't it be a viable business model?

Thank you for your advice. Now that I can see there's a viable business model here, I'll start researching thoroughly.

That's a really good point, actually. 'Matchmaker' is a great way to describe it. I think you're right, I knew the concept seemed a bit too straightforward.
Even to earn just £1000 per month at 10%, I'd have to be selling £10,000 worth of Bitcoin each month which is obviously going to raise flags everywhere, and that's before any expenditures I would have.

Yes, essentially. My 10% value would come from giving them a direct, secure one-to-one service. It seems like a relatively straightforward model but it almost seems too good to be true.

Thank you for your reply, I appreciate that.

Thank you for the reply. I'm in the UK and actually wouldn't have any issue with filing the necessary documents, and registering with the financial authorities. 
I've run businesses before and I'd really like to go into the Bitcoin market as a professional broker, if it's something that can offer a viable financial return.

I see. Between your reply and another comment on here, I see enough reason why not to look further. When I stumbled across the concept earlier I thought it was a little too straightforward, and assumed there must be a bigger issue at play. Thank you for your input, anyway.

I can totally imagine this being the case. That being said, so long as everything is done above board, are they still prone to shutting companies down for dealing with Bitcoin? There are enough Bitcoin exchanges here that I assume there must be some way they're operating with the banks letting them stay open. Thanks.
