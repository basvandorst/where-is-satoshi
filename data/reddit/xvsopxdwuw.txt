No taxes if you bought some bitcoins with fiat. BUT if you turned around and bought some altcoins with those bitcoins then a taxable event did occur. If you bought the altcoins directly using fiat then no taxes yet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:35:13
OTC exchanges. Not sure how accurate the bottom text is but is probably close.
You meet with a company that provides OTC services. Come to an agreement on a bunch of things (price, timeline, fees) and then they will give you money in exchange for your coins and they work to sell off those coins OR to sell them to someone else wanting to buy.

Moving them is not a taxable event. You would need to exchange coins for other coins, or coins for usd/ some other fiat.

If you have the money now buy now. DCA is great but don't just sit on money so you can say you did the DCA. However you should really make sure you are financially sound in other ways. Have a solid emergency fund and the like. You don't want to have to sell your hodl when an emergency strikes and you need the cash. Especially if it is a widespread emergency that's when the hodl will really pay off.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:30:23
They could be considering the ease of use as well. Tis easier for someone to buy on Coinbase if they are unfamiliar with exchanges.

People start out wanting to hodl but then start playing the What-if game. What if I sold around that last high and bought back on the dip? Seeing the price go down doesn't feel good, even if you are a hodler. Lose aversion makes people do strange things. If you think about BTC in terms of USD then it feels like you gain and loose. If you think about it as 1 BTC today is 1 BTC tomorrow, it will probably help more.

@_date: 2017-07-08 08:02:32
If that happens, weak hands may sell and bring BTC down. If so, then we get to see how deep the pockets of those playing in BTC are now. I suspect there is more smart money every day looking for the best opening to get into BTC. Companies and funds that are watching and waiting. 
But that only happens under a scenario like you discuss. If the fundamentals of Bitcoin are in question, then the confidence is not there. If some kind of ETH bubble bursts soon near this SegWit stuff...no one may make it out alive.
This grand experiment continues.
