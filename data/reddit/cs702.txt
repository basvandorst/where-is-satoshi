I'm the author of that essay. You're right: in order to complete such a replacement, the world's central banks would indeed have to buy bitcoins to build the reserves necessary to support a fractional-reserve banking system based on Bitcoin -- akin to a gold standard but with Bitcoin instead of gold.
I didn't delve into this for several reasons, including: (1) I wanted to keep things as simple as possible and felt that a discussion about fractional-reserve banking would add unnecessary complexity; (2) my goal was to move the subject toward estimating how much cash is circulating around the world; and (3) such a wholesale replacement of currencies will clearly never happen in practice.
In hindsight, I probably should have added a footnote or a brief reference to this -- in fact, I meant but forgot to do it.  I will add an ed note to the essay pointing to your comment.
Thank you for bringing it up.

I'm the author of that essay.[1]  It has attracted visitors every single week since publishing -- from almost every country on earth.
Its two main predictions seem to be holding up pretty well so far: (1) that so long as Bitcoin works as advertised, it is bound to gain worldwide credibility over time as more people use it to diversify away from local currencies and/or financial institutions, and (2) that because the number of bitcoins is fixed, all else being equal, the greater the number of people who want to use or hold bitcoins, the higher their price.
What *has* surprised me is how FAST these predictions have come true!
