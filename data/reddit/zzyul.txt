The US stock market it heavily regulated to fight small groups manipulating it. Bitcoin and other cryptos don’t have any of that regulation so investors seeking to manipulate the market have free reign. The first rule of playing the markets is you don’t know shit and there are a lot of people out there that are a heck of a lot smarter and better at it than you are. This is why all investing needs to be long term

Women give gold value, same with diamonds. Almost every woman wants gold jewelry. As long as the population continues to increase there will be more women wanting gold jewelry. Guys want to have sex with these women so they buy them gold jewelry.
Flip the genders and look at the sales of big trucks and SUVs. Why pay $20-30K more than a car when 99% of the use a car could do? B/c women see them as masculine and women want to have sex with masculine men.
Want to give bitcoin value that will never go away? Start the trend of giving your fiancé 1 btc when you propose. Then hundreds of millions of women will expect it and it’s value will stay high

Yes, something huge happened. Coinbase announced they were going to investigate themselves for insider trading. The most reputable coin index just admitted their employees were involved in insider trading and that there isn’t a regulatory board that is going to investigate it. If I’m a casual investor or someone looking to get rich, which a lot of btc’s investors are, then I’m getting out because I just learned that people are cheating and there isn’t anything to stop them from doing it again.

What would happen? Is there an international regulatory body that monitors bitcoin that would punish them through sanctions or tariffs?

This is an important point. In a typical market when the price drops below production costs then production stops. But with bitcoin the miners have invested huge amounts in computers that can’t do anything except mine coins. They will keep their rigs running, even at a loss, in the hopes that it bounces back. This will continue to drive the cost down. There is a breaking price, we just don’t know what it is right now
