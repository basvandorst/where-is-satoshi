Ive brought so far 0.95 of bitcoin at $5100 , $5300, $5500 &amp; $5800 AUD since august 13th will continue to buy and hold and see what it brings in the future. I beleive in what the technology is headed and feel this current price is inadequate for the potential it offers

I hold because when I'm ready to purchase I hope to see my investment increase 10 fold and by that time i shouldn't have to think about if bitcoin is accepted or not.

Great points.
**1.** with the free coin and people investing to get this "dividend" so they could cash out.
**2.** still has more of a degree than me. The one who controls the power can manipulate
**3.** 100%
My argument is vague/simple how it may or may not have happened. But it's happening the next few days will be interesting that's for sure

Take into account that the CME futures market (if approved) would mean a lot more money pooring into Bitcoin.
Then we have the network effect of Bitcoin which just keeps on growing with only a small percentage of people at the moment actually using Bitcoin.
It will be volatile while big money is coming in/going out. (Buy those dips) 
I see the potential of the technology,  it's getting too big to just die overnight in my opinion
A $50,000 Bitcoin is not too far fetched when you look at the money that has been dumped into it this year alone and all the possibilities of how this technology can change our lives.

You price the item in fiat to receive in bitcoin. At the end of the day you are buying bitcoin regardless of it raising or dropping in price..
Did I understand the question correctly?

Buy now and have the mentality to see it at 50k one day rather than waiting for a dip which may or may not come.. a dip of a few hundred to a thousand is nothing when you look at the broader potential where this is going

 is good if you decide to trade as you fund a cash account which lets you buy/sell instantly for 1% but I find the market price is quite high
 for instant purchase has a market rate anywhere from $50-$300 on the going price dependent on the price spikes.
 for lowest market price normaly about $10-$20 on the going rate with $1 fee per transaction &amp; a $400 limit per day. I've deposited at 4pm to have it be in my wallet no later than 9am next day

Blocks are found on average every 10mins
More hashing power by miners means difficulty is increased to keep blocks at 10 mins
If all Chinese miners closed up tomorrow difficulty would eventually become easier based on the lower hashing power.
