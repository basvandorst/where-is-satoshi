Google where you can buy bitcoin.  Also Google how to buy bitcoin.  It will be far more efficient than waiting for answers on here.

Nothing can stop the big money from buying up all the btc and suppressing its price though.  
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:51:00
Lol ok dude.  You know everything
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:59:25
The public buys on the high and sells the dip. Absolutely big institutions control btc price. We are just little feeder fish in the ocean of whales.  Research kill zones. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:04:44
Not necessarily.  They create liquidity events.  The public sells they buy. They have been fiddling with the price since Nov-Dec 2017.
Here check this.

price manipulation. the big boys are up to something
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:06:41
Youre very naive.  It's price manipulation. The value of btc has nothing to do with btc. Else we would have hit 100k by now.
