It went from $1 to $48, 2 days after reaching ATH and crashing, bitcoin price crashed. Check out the ltc/btc chart for BTC-E. If trend continues to hold (and so far it is) litecoin will be a good indicator of when bitcoin is at the top of it's bubble.

We recently shut down our market due to lack of interest, probably from our technology being dated and an unwillingness from our developer to update it. We were hoping BitWasp would have been further along by now but we don't want to roll out another incomplete marketplace.

Not sure about the porn films, but I chose BTC.Blue domain because I wanted a short relevant domain and every other TLD domain for BTC was taken. It was right about the time colored coins came out and blue was just introduced as a new top level domain so I thought it was the perfect name to be able to offer bitcoin services.

You could issue some tokens in your name and personally make them redeemable for favors. You could then give them out as gifts and your friends can redeem them, save them for later, or trade them to someone else for something. Or if you were a company presumably your could issue stock and pay dividends. Just an example.

Nice work, Xapo team. What is the delay for? Are we waiting for Lawsky's regulation to go through to get our cards or is there some other unknown reason we are forced to sit on the sidelines?
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:03:45
Yea, that's my thread. I never sold any tokens worth $400 because my wording was clear and we give our customers more credit than that, I raised a total of $18 which was less than the cost of my giveaway and I gave them back their $18 since it wasn't going to come close to cutting it. I had one listed for that price but as I said, it's my property I can list it for a million if I want. I have also worked on my pricing. My blue tokens if you must harp on them are more divisible than bitcoin so you don't have to buy a whole one, that was my reasoning on the price. But I have since lowered the price to $1.00 for the blue ones and if my customers feel like spending $400 on them in the future then they can just buy 400 of them.
The marketplace isn't pointless, we have a seller on there selling vinyl decals and patches, I ordered one of the glow in the dark ones myself. That is just the start, anyone can sell here so I'm actually providing a valuable service to the community and giving it away for free.

No, I'm not. BTC.Blue is a marketplace where anyone can buy or sell for bitcoin, litecoin, or any of the traditional payment methods. You are welcome to create your own store and sell your assets for whatever price you would like at  for free and we don't even have ads or anything yet. We do have our own store on the market where we list our coins and assets at  but our most expensive coin is only $10 because I only have one of them and I don't particularly want to part for it for any less. That's my option, if you don't want to buy it keep moving but be careful when throwing around false claims you might get sued for slander.

Makes sense to me. By the way I am having a hard time navigating the new app as I haven't had much time to spend with it. I can't find a list of my transactions and it took me forever to realize I had to press the enter key on my phone to get the send button to pop up. Not sure why the button isn't there otherwise?

Nah, there is a dynamic that adoption follows between the 2. Basically everyone jumps on the bitcoin train until they think it's over valued and then they jump to whatever is undervalued, once that is overvalued too the gig is pretty much up and it's time to cash out.

We clearly specify that the collectible line is novelty only, you are making an issue where there isn't one. The collectibles were the first line and now I'm working on another token that will be redeemable for advertising on my site or upgrading to a premium store which will clearly have value. It's called innovation brother, don't hate.

You should mainly just use coinbase for what it's really designed for.. purchasing bitcoins. After that send them to your personal wallet and once that is complete you will have no more questions and no more wait time for sends.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:31:31

You can see the page where we sell them here 
They are considered novelty collectible coins. They aren't backed by anything and are just to play with. You could create a new coin yourself and make it backed by something creative like favors and send the coins to friends. Your friends could then redeem the favors with you, save them for later, or trade them to your other friends for favors or something else. Just an example.

Many of these you can probably get for free if you know where to look, or if you have a few cents worth of bitcoin you can create your own coin for your own project. Of course you can also buy many of these coins, here is our collection of colored coins we have listed:

No, but maybe the developers do. It's still under active development so things are likely to change. The best way is to just try it out and poke around.

I suggested this to them not long ago, that didn't take long. Although, the app still says sing up. I don't think they will be using it much longer in it's current form once the debit cards get sent out since it just asks people to signup and doesn't actually do anything. 
Also, the debit card is looking promising:

I have worked on my prices since we first launched. Are you looking at an old cache of our site from months ago when we first launched and were trying to raise funds for the marketplace you see now?
@_date: 2014-08-04 21:28:46
There was some problems with the colored coins system.. I broke it. So I have to wait another day for the unconfirmed ones to cancel out and I will try sending again.

It's a marketplace similar to amazon where you can buy and sell digital assets such as CounterParty Tokens/Colored Coins with digital currencies like Bitcoin/Litecoin. 500 bits

 Anytime, maybe since they are the most distributed of all the colored coins they will one day be listed on a colored coins exchange and be worth something.
