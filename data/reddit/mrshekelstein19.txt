This basically means they control our inflation. They could fuck us over at ANY time.

you sold early for a house.
now can you live with this fact when bitcoin reaches 100 grand?

This isnt surprising that someone would attempt this.
A lot of people are hiding money in bitcoin right now which is why the price is so high.

They gain more money out of it without question. They convince you to invest your money somewhere then over inflate the market to make your savings useless and your job unable to cover your expenses while you fight for a higher wage which takes time.
Soon after that many people lose their homes and cars but you keep just enough people in the game to keep any revolution at bay.

Kinda the reason I dont bother with bitcoin right now.
Its an obvious pump and dump for now.
