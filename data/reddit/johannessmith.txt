No matte what price it is when this price is on boobs.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:30:58
Good luck!

I see. Ok :)
1. You need more space near text in app store pics. App looks nice but I don't feel like the same team was working on marketing materials.
2. Bitcoin price is important for retention. I have not found fiat prices in design. That's important. Users are not sending their Bitxoin everyday. But they checking how much money they have. And if you have good retention you have a better ASO.
3. I haven't found anything interesting in terms of features and vision. Yet another wallet. No step forward for the industry. Just a waste of time. I am almost sure I can predict your next steps. And I don't see there is anything you can give to us.
4. Anyway I hope you'll do something better. And wish you good luck.

Don't you have two Russians in your team? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:14:14
we are totally ok with that, man! ��
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:04:24
Stay tuned and we'll find them. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:08:13
we have a special price from [tittygram]( (there are prices on their website)
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:32:39
we've added this "buy bitcoin" button just to make [tittyticker.com]( *a kind of a business*.

What do you think sexism is? And what is your personal opinion on girls making a photo of their boobs with BTC price on it?
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:45:37
Sure.  
If you just want a picture with some message you can use [tittygram.com]( (our partner).
Or DM me if you want to have your message (or other price tickers) to be featured on TittyTicker. But we are in beta still.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:37:50
No. It's more complicated. I don't think that sexism is good. But I think that it's not bad when it's not pointed on some specific person and is a symbol of some sexual freedom. A freedom for someone to like boobs.
People are trying to remove sexism from our daily life. But isn't it something similar to any other censorship or social restrictions? 
That what we are standing for. Sexism is a part of ethical decentralisation we need in blockchain future.

[ \- here is previous winner!
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:32:00
I don't think so. That's what makes blockchain so valuable. People who are submitting ideas. In 99% these ideas are useless. But 1% is priceless. I am sure [TittyTicker]( is going to change the world with its revolutionary vision. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:48:55
We are also planning to make a service where users will be able to check their dick size based on the price they have brought BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:35:55
I don't know. In my office it's required to open that link.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:18:05
Where is your lambo, dude?!
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:40:18
[  here you can have a daily update
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:30:47
But what is "electrum"?
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:29:34
No, we are not that naive. We were thinking of making an ICO later. But it's a secret plan, you know. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:00:29
Thanks! May we use it as a review?
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:59:05
Are you requesting a feature?))
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:52:03
Relax and wait for the better rate on [tittyticker.com](
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:53:53
Yep! But we have already paid girls for two months forward so they will keep posting ... We can't stop it. ��
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:00:34
If the price will be 10000 I'll do it ))
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:50:54
Sexism, platitudes and lust are what we want to preserve in blockchain culture. These are not signs of evil, but signs of freedom. Be honest with yourself; the Internet was made for porn, not for kitties!
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:36:33
THESE PHOTOS ARE REAL :)   
These girls are making them for real.

I mostly believe in centralised wallets such as Coinbase. But they'll become more like traditional banks. Decentralisation is the great idea, but in terms of mass market it requires too much from the ordinary user. 
There was a cool panel on Blockshow in Singapore. The main idea was that decentralisation is perfect on a base layer, but Blockchain services (b2c) will be centralised. 
Storring paper wallet in bank is the same solution as storing coins on Coinbase. imho

Hahaha! So cool that I've found this article right before deploying ERC20 contract. Will pause it for a while. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:47:07
Thanks man. Can you tell what is the difference? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:34:32
The are not ERC20
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:05:48
I'll take care of it. :) Will be available for sale tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:31:46
What do you mean? Do you want me to show my tits?
