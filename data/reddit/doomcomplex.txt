Presumably that functionality would be built into the software. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:44:27
They also don't work well and have terrible customer service. Plenty of good, legit reasons to grief Coinbase. This is not one of them. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:50:14
I wonder, though, how's the security? What if someone steals my card data?

*Wow,* now the UK too can experience the joys of *almost* being able to purchase bitcoin. *yawn*
Get your shit together.

Unfamiliar with Arizona, eh?
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:15:43
Sweet, I'll definitely check it out!

We all want the D... Unfortunately Krave closed again. ;-)

Haha, fucking Coinbase.  No matter how many hoops I jump through, they won't take my money. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:18:20
Dammit Woz, I'm waiting for a price crash here!
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:47:31
Way cool! I'm going to Vegas next month and I will make a trip to the D just because of this!

No, people are not fungible and never have been. Identifying the person sending the money does not affect the fungible nature of a bitcoin. Rather, it affects a person's willingness to transact with a particular person or business. That's the same thing that happens with cash, and it doesn't mean cash isn't fungible. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:46:16
I do not see how this could affect  fungibility.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:19:45
Agreed, and really the users never were fungible.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:47:28
Nah, it was never truly anonymous, especially not now with ID requirements everywhere. This isn't what makes bitcoin special. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 22:40:14
Likely what is happening is that you are using Blockchain.info's default send settings--which will automatically send from your "primary" address (the address that it created for you when you first made an account). If you have funds in a different address that is also held in your Blockchain.info wallet, all you need to do is go into "send money &gt; "custom" and you will be able to select which address(es) to send funds from.

I have seen multiple redditors comment that Coinbase refused to honor their original price on large orders when the price of bitcoins had increased significantly while they waited for the transfer, even after contacting customer support.
I can't say if those reports are true or not, but I have seen them.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:43:15
I'd call it more of a *de facto* currency. No need to make up a new word.
@_date: 2013-03-13 19:15:04
There's a lot of gambling sites out there. One that I've never played but have a morbid fascination with is  Such an odd concept. It's like bitcoin hot potato!
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:28:59
Mind explaining? If he's untrustworthy, I'm sure most folks around here would like to know. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:11:50
I think your worry is justified. I placed my first order last Sunday and got an email yesterday (one hour after they told me to expect delivery),  saying that they had cancelled my order. That's pretty shady, in my book. It's also a breech of contract. 
In the email they didn't provide any explanation of why I was declined or how I could go about getting my order reinstated. I sent an email to customer support and was (promptly) told that Coinbase would whitelist me and perform the transaction at the price originally agreed. I've still not been delivered any bitcoin, though.
I'm very displeased with their current fraud prevention process. It's not transparent, they don't notify you that they have cancelled your order until after delivery should already have been made, and they never give you any way to prove yourself to them so that you can have your bitcoin delivered on time (instead of being cancelled and later reinstated).
I think that Coinbase is reputable and that you will eventually get some bitcoin from them. However, don't expect to get your bitcoin any time soon or at the date and time they give you.
Update: Coinbase has now delivered my Bitcoin.

Quite enlightening, thank you. :)

Dear Esteemed Redditor, 
My name is Prince Dukku von Beedleborken. Due to recent events in my home kingdom of Beedlevania, I have found myself deposed and exiled...blah blah blah... money in an overseas account... blah blah blah... cash this check and send me bitcoins... etc.
Sincerely, 
His Royalest of Real-Life Actual Princes, 
Dukku von Beedleborken

I see, thanks for explaining that! I looked around the site and hadn't noticed that expected return link. I guess I was sort of expecting the "help" button to show the payouts, like on a slot machine at the casino.
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:40:20
Some of us (ahem) weren't aware of the issues when we first utilized the service. Consider my comment as a way of making others aware of the problem that I myself didn't get a heads up about. Further, hopefully bitching about the problem will get Coinbase to up their game.
As for using another avenue to get my Bitcoin: that's exactly what I plan to do.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:15:17
Well thank you for the... incorrection?
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:40:26
Bummer! I'd send a tip to make it hurt less, but I'm still waiting for the coins I ordered from Coinbase back on Sunday.

Long live "Dollar B"! (Although, who knows, in 10 years we might be calling the dollar Dollar B. ;)

Can you help me understand how to monitor this? Right now I'm just looking at 
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:49:50
I didn't even think of that possibility but, yeah, good idea.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:55:11
Just sit back and enjoy the ride...
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:52:29
Great idea! I like Intrade, but I don't think they take the concept far enough. Specifically, I'd like for users to be able to submit suggestions for propositions or post props without moderator intervention. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:33:04
Well, the market's currently 4 dollars below its high from yesterday... popping already?
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:04:22
I feel like cBTC and mBTC already do a fine job as-is.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:08:08
Yeah, I thought of those things too. I don't have a good solution, but at least giving users some way to suggest/request a particular prop would be a good resolution for me. AFAIK, Intrade doesn't even have a way to suggest props.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:01:47
Just remember: Bitcoin is an **experiement**. The value really depends on how the experiment turns out.
@_date: 2013-03-13 19:09:32
I'll confirm this. Bitcoin Video Casino is my favorite bitcoin gambling site. It's simple to use: you are given a unique URL and deposit address when you visit the site. From then on, you just use the same URL to play with whatever funds you have deposited. The games are all well designed and easy to play. Craps is my favorite.
My only issue with this site is that the progressive pays aren't explained anywhere.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:49:14
That's what I was thinking. People already know and understand these prefixes, so why not use them?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:47:48
Ah, the old "cut down on the memes" meme...

Haha, nice catch... my spellcheck didn't catch it due to the asterisks on either side. :P

I imagine they are inundated. It's a pretty small operation, no?

"We takin' all yo money, bitchez!"
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:08:52
Wow, embarrassingly bad punctuation and grammar (and customer service) for a business. I wouldn't do business with them based on this...
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:04:03
I prefer bitcent to centibitcoin too. I also slightly prefer bitmil to millibitcoin. However, these words could be used interchangeably with cBTC and mBTC and I think people would get the meaning.

Some miner is going to be very happy!
