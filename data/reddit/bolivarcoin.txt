That increase in localbitcoin volume since march it's because an employer of the venezuelan exchange surbitcoin got arrested and some of surbitcoin money its on the bank account of this person, after that surbitcoin it's not working at 100% and it's users left and are using bitinka, yabit, localbitcoin and cryptobuyer.
Surbitcoin keep publishing lies on media, they paid writers like codiox on cointelegraph,
They been publishing lies like.
Venezuelan government block bitcoin.
Venezuelan government its jailing bitcoin users.
Bitcoin its 20% cheaper in venezuela.
Venezuelans are turning into bitcoin.
Surbitcoin users double after venezuelan newspaper publish an article about bitcoin, (so it double it users in 24hrs, they are for real?)
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:48:37
Yes, apparently bitcoin its booming in Venezuela but they only show one data of one exchange, leaving the others exchangers like they even exist, as I said, bitcoin in Venezuela its the same, nothing has changed.
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:35:51
there is no increase on volume :p

U are wrong, surbitcoin had more than 250 btc volume, I dnt remember exactly how much it was, I think I have a screen capture of it. Even Rodrigo said that he was very happy because that.
There is no historic data of any exchange in Venezuela, only localbitcoins, if I post the screen capture here maybe will change nothing and some will say its fake as for some im a scammer.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:45:56
Again, media publishing lies about venezuela.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:52:35
you are lying again, they dint leak their customer information, omg you are a serious case "It seems like the reopened last week. Good to have competition, but not looking forward to operating with an exchange who leaked all its customer's data to the internet."
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:15:17
What are you talking about Rodrigo? did you read what i wrote? that the reason localbitcoin Volume increase its because of you and Randy Brito, your employer Daniel Arraez its in jail and since then your exchange Surbitcoin its not working properly and you told your customers to use Localbitcoins instead, were is the lie? this screen capture support what im saying  if you say that im a hater because i want others to know whats really going on in Venezuela i really dnt care, if you say i have a blog or bitcoin multiplayer scam site then prove it, if you say that i defraud surbitcoin then go to the police, if you want to talk about my shitcoin then go to Bitcointalk, if you say im a socialist then prove it, here the one that lies its you  "stop lying to the people. Everybody knows that you are surbitcoin hater, created a blog just to spread lies about surbitcoin.
The truth is that we banned your account because your repeatedly fraud attempts.
Please, go back to your shitcoin you socialist."

Another lie about Venezuela, now this post will ne translate to spanish by people like codiox and posted in cointelegraph and themercle and then translate again into spanish promoting speculative lies about bitcoin in Venezuela.
Here is a list of food prices in Venezuela 
This will be promoted by the same people that say other lies like botcoin was banned in venezuela or that surbitcoin is the biggest exchange in venezuela and hide the truth like daniel arraez case, thanks codiox for being a trusted source of information, keep me update with more lies
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:34:01
its a shame that  dnt keep historical data 
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:10:04
No one has been arrested in Venezuela for using, mining, or any other activity related to Bitcoin.
Two miners were arrested because they import mining equipment and didnt declare import tax.
A Surbitcoin employee was arrested because he move a big sum of money to his personal bank account, something thats illegal in Venezuela.
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:59:57
Yes. A bug that was known first by rafael moraos and he use it to take bitinka out of business in partnership with randy brito
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:46:22
How can you say that venezuela broke a record on transactions taking only one source (localbitcoins)?
Are you taking in consideration bitinka thats its trading 1000 bitcoins a day?
Just saying, this article its based only on one source, and you didnt said that surbitcoin its practicaly out of business after one of its employees got arrested and now it's doing 10 btc trade a day when used to so 250 btc or more.
250 btc are  140k. So the trade volume in Venezuela its the same, just moved from one exchange (surbitcoin) to another (localbitcoins) and others, this article its inaccurate and promotes the bullshit you guys are doing, spaming the web with lies about Venezuela, bitcoin its not booming, its the same. As I being saying, dnt belive anything that comes from Venezuela, they are the same that said that bitcoin was banned, that Venezuela its prosecuting bitcoin users, bitcoin its 20% cheaper in venezuela, etc etc. 
Just lies and lies and it never stop
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:18:24
now the english sites start to spaming shit too 
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:53:07
Venezuela its not breaking trading volume, please stop spaming reddit with your shitty blog, get another hobby. You write a post on your blog in spanish and practically  everything you wrote there has nothing to back up what are you saying more than just a picture of a chart from localbitcoins leaving the others venezuelan exchanges out, then you post it here with an english title and dnt even post a link to google translate so non spanish speaker can read it, and all this with the intention on driving traffic to your blog and generate some revenue with the ads, its lame, yes bro, go to a faucet and get some doge, please leave us alone.
And saying that venezuela its first in south america on volume its the craziest thing i ever hear, like you have no shame in saying that, argentina trade about the same than venezuela and mexico its huge, i will not do maths but its something like this: 1 Brasil. 2 Mexico. 3 Argentina. 4 Venezuela. please next time you spam us with lies about venezuela be more original.

you are the troll, do you think we are stupid or what?[–]gubatron[S] [score hidden] 4 hours ago 
so more to the case of the article, that's localbitcoins alone... it's actually more when you consider the other exchanges, despite what you say about SurBitcoin, there's a couple more exchanges, plus all the private (people to people) bitcoin exchange.
here trolly troll, here here troll
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:49:12
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:15:50
1000 BTC - 62 BTC = 938 BTC, so this means that BitInka has a Volume of 938 BTC in other countries, so please do the maths and confirm that Venezuela its number 1 in Volume in South America, please do my friend codiox
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:12:49
That post its a lie, like many other info coming from Venezuela
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:49:52
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:11:27
no dude, you check your sources, Bitinka its operating in Venezuela, in fact, its trading more Bitcoins than Surbitcoin, today BitInka traded 62.62 BTC and Surbitcoin did 28.46 BTC you can see the volume by yourself here  and also you can see that LocalBitcoins its trading less than BitInka with 42.86 BTC
 here is the screen cap 
"[–]codiox [score hidden] 3 hours ago* 
Bitinka is not currently operating in Venezuela, so those 1000 Bitcoins you said are the daily global volume (for latin america). Check your sources." (Copy what  Codio said cos he its known to delete his posts and then say that it wasnt him, an example its when he said that Yabit are scamers) 
@_date: 2016-08-11 21:14:52
Dnt up vote this post. There is a reason that localbitcoins its increasing volume in Venezuela and thats not because people its using more bitcoin, it's because bitcoin exchange surbitcoin got an employer jailed and since its not working properly and they told teir customers to use localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:58:14
Fake news, they were arrested because they didnt pay impor tax for those miners, cryptonoticias toke the news from another newspaper and its a cheap copy paste with lot more of fake .... Bla bla bla.
Importing goods and not paying tax its illegal in Venezuela.
Its simple, you smuggle into the country and if u get caught then u go to jail.
There is a regulation coming, lets see what happen.
@_date: 2016-11-28 10:44:20
LoL, in Venezuela there is a culture of spreading false news about the prices of products and other things like foreign currency, it creates disinformation and people panic and only those who control the masses benefit from it.
This news from Venezuela damage Bitcoin adoption in that country. 
There are websites that Venezuelans use to get the Bitcoin price in VEF bitven.com btchoy.com btcparalelo.com etc and they all give the wrong price and the owners of those sites use it to make money. And the person who its writing this article always mention "Surbitcoin" on his posts, an exchange that was under investigation but not anymore because some say they paid to drop the case. And also the writer forgot that in Venezuela exist other exchanges than surbitcoin and that work better than surbitcoin, like Bitinka, Cryptobuyer and Yabit
Please stop it.
Make Venezuela Great Again
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:42:20
well, lets be honest, Bitcoin will never pick up in Venezuela,
when you talk to people that are not well informed about Bitcoin, they said that Bitcoin its something that u get from faucets and you can spend playing dice.
some people yes, use it for receiving money and for sending money overseas.
Then there grups fighting for control of the Bitcoin information and market.
i will not say that this division its ruining Bitcoin in Venezuela, because its already ruined.
Exchanges fight with eachothers in a dirty war were they call eachothers scammers.
Admin of the famous secret group of facebook BTCVEN call developers of altcoins scammers.
And then there is the disinformation by some of the "GURUS" of Bitcoin in Venezuela, i seen amazing things.

State owned and biggest ISP in Venezuela have blocked all Bitcoin related domains, websites and pools by rdymac in Bitcoin
[–]rdymac[S] 6 points 2 days ago 
A good number of them does usually buy/sell that amount, most of them don't hold the bitcoins for a lot of time.
And yes, 6000+ members, with over 1500 banned people, and hundreds filtered each day. Most of the current members are active or have at least been reviewed.
"most of them don't hold the bitcoins for a lot of time."
So they use it to move money in and out as this post says.
Typical compulsive liar, no credibility, creating rumors to scpeculate, what is worst, creating rumors with others to speculate together.
No moral 
@_date: 2016-05-21 10:56:19
ok, so, this post its 16 days old and i just saw it.
and its so annoying that this continues
i been accused by rodrigo de souza since i refuse to do an interview for cointelegraph, you can check it out in this tweet 
I reply the journalist, that i will not do the interview, instead he can do an interview about a friend of mine that worked on Surbitcoin and its in Jail because that, his name its Daniel Arraez and Surbitcoin forgot about him.
Since then i been false accused for the fallowing things:
That i used surbitcoin coldwallets to play on a ponzi.
That Bitcoin clone Bolivarcoin its a scam, something i want him to explain 
That i scam Venezuelans with Bolivarcoins, the bolivarcoin marketcap its 2 btc, and i have like 300k that its like 0,5 btc,  i want to know how can i scam with bolivarcoin
That i own a ponzi and i scam with Bitcoin
That i own an exchange in Venezuela.
That i ask them to list Bolivarcoin in Surbitcoin.
And now that, im reddit user Bitcoinloco, im reddit user  RedOctober10, that i own a website called venbitcoin.com and that i was banned from Surbitcoin because i tried to defraud, 
First of all, i want to say that i never register on Surbitcoin.com, and i never try to defraud Surbitcoin and im not using bitcoinloco or RedOctober10 accounts and im not the owner of venbitcoin.com website.
I been reporting all this scam accusations to the Delitos Informaticos Division of CICPC in Venezuela, as in Venezuela by law i have the right to defend myself of this accusations.
I been also accused of
Bolivarcoin wallets stole Bitcoins
Bolivarcoin wallet has a Virus
Bolivarcoin creator its a dangerous person "so please be carefull" :)
Bolivarcoin its the owner of a shop that sell chinese car spares parts.
Bolivarcoin and Chavezcoin are the same person
Bolivarcoin and Chavezfuerte are the same person
Bolivarcoin owner its a comunist, a socialist, a capitalist.
Bolivarcoin its a pump and dump.

Rodrigo knows a lot about journalism, he was the one who started the rumor that Bitcoin was blocked in Venezuela, and yes, be a good journalist and ask Surbitcoin about Daniel Arraez, he was an employer of Rodrigo when he got a letter to report to police, Daniel was told "Dnt worry we have the best lawyer in the world, nothing going to happen to you" then he was arrested, and now he its left in jail and surbitcoin said that he quit his job just hours of him getting arrested.
And also ask Marco Santori if he its going to visit Venezuela regarding Daniel Arraez and the two miners in jail also related to Surbitcoin.
and also ask Santi Subotovsky, Kurt Thams and Juan Llanos.
And regarding my political views, im full right wing, no bullshit, VOTE TRUMP

This is part of surbitcoin cheap propaganda,
Venezuelans are not turning into bitcoins.
Some of the lies they said are: venezuelan government block bitcoin, bitcoin its 20% cheaper in venezuela. Venezuelan goberment its prosecuting bitcoin users, surbitcoin it's the biggest exchange in venezuela, etc etc.
The trut is that venezuelans use bitcoins for two things, and this are; money laundry and moving money in and out of the country.
In January, randy brito, apparently he is the founder of bitcoin in venezuela, have an interview were he said bitcoin was used for money laundry trough surbitcoin, soon after this venezuelan police detain his friend and he it's's in jail since, and randy is been silence.
90% of news related to bitcoin from venezuela are lies, dnt belive it

Selling bolivarcoins.
Owning an exchange in venezuela and use it to scam Venezuelans.
Owning ponzi sites.
Etc etc
They want to follow cryptsy path. They blamed lucky7coin. Surbitcoin blames bolivarcoin.
My friend daniel arraez itit's in jail because of surbitcoin. He was an employee following orders . I hope he it's out soon.

Dnt belive in Rodrigos lies.
He said that I defraud surbitcoin. Hack its it's cold wallets. Use the cold wallet stolen bitcoins in a ponzi. He also accused me of owning an exchange in venezuela and scaming people by selling bolivarcoins. And much more. I belive they are doing like cryptsy, stop withdraw, stop processing account verification, lowering the price of the coins and finaly shut down the exchange  and blame lucky7coin to be the responsables while big vern was living in a mansion and her whife driving luxury cars.
I want all you to know that we have nothing to do with rhat exchanger. Rodrigo attack us after we refuse to do an interview for cointelegraph . We reply the journalist on Twitter that he better do an interview about daniel arraez, a friend of us in jail, arraez was an employer at surbitcoin.
