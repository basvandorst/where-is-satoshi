Well if you got a job maybe you should try to ask your boss to pay your salary in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-04-22 10:28:50
Im from EU and i usually use coinbase.

fuck thats a lot of money, im really sorry, but why the hell didnt you just buy a hardware wallet? hw wallet costs peanuts in comparison.
@_date: 2015-12-27 05:58:09
In my country it's really hard to get an hardware wallet, I live in a really small country in europe and almost no one knows what is bitcoin here, I might start a project to raise awareness of bitcoin in my small country. Thank you for your time and replie.
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:13:46
Thank you a lot!

@_date: 2015-12-27 05:25:35
Wow, you guys are crazy, in a good way! I didn't expect so many replies and all of them are good! I enjoyed reading all of them. I didn't expect such feedback, you guys are making a really nice place, such a great community :) I guess the smartest thing for me to do is to hold on them now and enjoy a crazy ride which im pretty sure bitcoin will bring. Best of luck to all of you on achieving your goals for 2016!  
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:54:54
Thank you guys for replies, i guess i will try out electrum :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:07:18
Thank you all for your replies, i didn't expect so many answers! damn i appreciate all of them, looks like bitcoin reddit is really friendly and gives good advices!!
Thank you all =] I guess I will just sit on them and I'm using breadwallet now.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:03:44
So I just installed it and now on the left bottom it shows "not connected" and the adress which i need to send my bitcoins to is  in the receive section?
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:12:39
Well if u lend your money to someone else there is a chance that he doesnt pay back...
@_date: 2015-12-27 05:18:36
Thank you for ur kind words! I wish best of luck for you too, I hope you will get that 1btc by the end of 2015!! 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:37:21
thank you for the information, ill take a look on it!
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:00:06
yeah i have an iphone, ill give it a look too. thank you 
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:45:25
But when i want to send bitcoins from breadwallet to another wallet i need to use QR code to get others bitcoin address? sorry for silly questions im just really new and want to do everythin right!
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:51:05
hi to you too.
@_date: 2016-03-26 15:08:15
If I remember right newegg accepts bitcoin, but i might be wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:28:44
Thank you for clearing this up to me, I didn't even expect to receive so many answers, but now I understand. 
I got my self in pretty bad situation with bitcoins..
I bought like 3.5 bitcoins at the price 316usd, I sold 1 bitcoin at 216usd because I got in panic and didn't want to loose a lot, but now ill just stick to my 2.5bitcoins and hope for the best. Yeah that panic sell was stupid, but im very new to this and want to discover something new, have some new journeys. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:15:13
Hmm okay, then I'm wondering where are we going with bitcoin, hope everythin works out just fine, we have been through worse times..
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:55:25
I use breadwallet too, so far I haven't had any problems.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:25:28
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:56:20
Well I'm deleting spam from them daily.. it's just annoying as hell, it's not like I receive 1. message a day from them, it's 2 or even 3.
Well I don't know, we can't actually find who's responsible for this, who's behind it, but holyfuck.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:08:53
@_date: 2016-03-28 00:44:32
yeah this actually is really good, great to see these kind of people in bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:19:02
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:04:39
Well it is possible. I bought 17. bitcoins at the price of 460 usd and now i feel kind a sad, because current price is 367usd, so  yeah, well invest only what youre not afraid to loose, i did a mistake i put everything i have in btc and now im pretty scared, so yeah dont make the same mistake i did. Well it's possible to make great profit.
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:37:58
Thanks, I appreciate your tip :)
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:49:57
Banks are afraid of bitcoin, because we can be our own bank, they can't monitor us
I doubt that blockchain will go bankrupt as some banks do and people loose a lot of money because of that.
We can transfer bitcoin from (A) country to (B) country really fast with very low fee
It's future
No one can steal our information ( like credit card and so on, sorry i can't go in more details for this point, because my english is really bad , but you probably understood my point )
And most important reason is - bitcoin is just cool.
@_date: 2016-01-28 01:15:07
He is a smart man, I doubt that he left any clues.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:16:59
Thanks, yeah I will hold on them =]
@_date: 2016-01-01 04:13:34
:D that's pretty good one
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:06:20
What will happen now? can anyone sue him? is anyone looking for that son of a bitch?
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:12:01
well if chinese people will quit mining bitcoins that would fuck up bitcoin that's for true... i hope they won't, because i have invested a lot of money in btc, i bought at 460 and now its even below 400, pretty sad 
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:39:26
So if I understood right, china is going to make her own digital currency? so, that would impact btc price pretty badly, right?
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:56:13
Well i already thought that, behind those squiggly lines hides only fake info anyway which i edited with "inspect element" , i just added lines, because i have habit for that
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:55:32
yeah u can transfer them to any wallet you like, there is a section "send/request"  press on it, just enter the btc address, the amount and ure golden.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:08:26
Bitcoin is not DAO or ETH. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:05:39
 might not be the best picture, but i think u will understand
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:20:58
I think if u buy directly through bank your buy limit is 300, but i might be wrong. I know I registered recently ,but my limits were never that low, Havent logged in coinbase since i bought btc
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:31:37
so why is it dead actually? because its stable for a while?
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:23:21
some good moon kush
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:21:30
im kinda in panic too, but i think i will hodl
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:10:37
If u are using iphone i would recommend Breadwallet, its a standalone wallet. meaning that if they stop their service your btc will be safe, just save your recovery phrase.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:55:56
Wow, Thank you a lot!!
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:32:06
Well I just sent a payment worth 60 USD and had only 4cent fee
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:02:26
Its in the primary page 
Find where your balance is displayed and right from there u can see a "i" icon and a text "wallet address" just click on it and u will be able to see your wallet address
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:10:02
Well sometimes I just think that media is being controlled by someone and that someone is against bitcoin, because if they actually took their time and studied something before writing their shit, I think that the news would be totally different..
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:03:11
There is a  special reddit for bitcoin gambling.
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:25:37
Thanks, that's a great reply there :)
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:40:44
Thank you all for your replies, I much appreciate all of them :)
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:15:24
Well, I think you bought them and now u are trying to get back money from your bank by blaming their security, in the end they can't take your bitcoins back. So now you are trying to get your money back for the bitcoins you bought, in the end you will have your money + bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:24:11
Well I didn't say on any sentence that my decision will depend on some "random dudes on the internet" 
I just want to see your opinions
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:34:01
Can anyone please explain what does bitcoin fork mean? how does it affect bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:25:06
Most likely create my own bitcoin project, probably gambling project.
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:30:55
well i bought 17 at 460... still waiting for bitcoin to rise
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:22:46
I just posted a request there, but it takes time to approve my request or something, Have you ever used fiverr before? do you have any people you recommend?
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:42:49
If there is a bitcoin split or something like that, I'm leaving that's true.
@_date: 2018-11-02 01:02:57
If this is legit than you Muricans are in luck, 
To op thanks for doing this
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:33:25
Never is a very strong word, should have used "might" instead.
@_date: 2018-11-02 01:06:06
No, because I wont store btc in a bank account
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:56:46
same here, when i want to check confirmations it directs me to this page 
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:41:44
sorry i think i wrote something wrong, em let me try again :D 
I mean how big are the fees if i send 5 btc to someone? and how big are the fees if i send 14 btc to someone.. 
sorry for confusion, my english can be pain in the ass sometimes. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:51:37
thank you for the second reply :) that's truly awesome!
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:43:58
and seed in breadwallet is "recovery phrase"? 
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:39:52
Well i have used coinbase for a while now, had no problems.
@_date: 2016-05-27 22:42:03
I have used coinbase a lot for my btc purchases and sells, I have never experienced any problem, if you contact them im pretty sure they will sort everything out. good luck
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:58:34
I think i just received it. :) thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:43:56
