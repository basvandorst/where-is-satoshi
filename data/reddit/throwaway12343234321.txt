No I'm 20 years old and don't currently care about gold. That said I would consider jewelry that contains gold to be an investment, depending on the quality of course. My point though is that there are far fewer unknowns with regard to purchasing and storing gold vs purchasing and storing BTC.

Also, .2 could be a lot to someone. As a college student, I would know
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:49:57
Or the people that are interested in buying gold already understand how to buy it, but Bitcoin is relatively uncharted territory so they are googling.

They did nothing that Bitcoin wasn't designed to give them the ability and right to do.
I would agree that there should be consequences, but what has happened already is consequence enough.
Few people trust them anymore, and, in a decentralized system, that is a big deal.

Bitcoin is designed specifically not to remove anyone's right to fork however they want. Correspondingly they have the right to be so irresponsible as they want.
Either have Bitcoin not be "in the peoples' hands" on order to prevent this from happening, or leave it as it is and allow these things to happen; Pick one.

Have you ever heard of rainmeter? It's a Windows desktop customization tool. It's got plenty of abilities like using web APIs (so, getting data on price, addresses, transactions, the local weather, etc.) and running scripts.
What I've done for myself is make a small display in the corner of my second screen that always stays visible even with other windows open. It's partially transparent, but if i really need to see what is behind it, I made it far more transparent when I hover my cursor over it. Also, I made it not clickable so that I can still interact with things behind it. It displays the price of BTC according to what source I want it to get that data from, it displays my important public key, and it displays the amount associated with that key converted to my fiat currency. The best part is that I can ctrl-click the public address to copy it to my clipboard, ready to be pasted anywhere. The price and corresponding amount I have are updated every 5 minutes, but you can lengthen or shorten that too.
You don't need to do something exactly like that, and if you don't want to make it yourself you can have someone else do it (I made my own, so I could adjust it to your needs if you want).
As I said above, Rainmeter is a desktop customization tool. Most people use it for interactive themed desktops with quick access to certain features, resulting in something far prettier than a bunch of icons on top of your favorite background. That said, it's a little bit of overhead because you have to download Rainmeter itself which manages your "widgets." On the flip side, if you care, it opens up a lot of neat possibilities for desktop customization.
PM me if you're interested in learning more, as Rainmeter definitely has the capability to do what you want and more.

I wouldn't say it's IMPOSSIBLE for btc to be widely accepted and 100k, due to its deflationary nature. However, I'm not one of the people who suggests or believes it will achieve that high value.
Also, litecoin attempts to cover the "not so easy to transact on a day to day basis" aspect and complement bitcoin.

You're not alone. I've only recently invested (1 month ago) and I'm trying to figure out where the truth is in all this. This subreddit will shout no2x all day while they btc subreddit pretty firmly believes that s2x will succeed and be the new btc. Personally I have read so many arguments from both sides and it's hard to tell what's factual and what isn't.
When I first heard of the fork it seemed to be about whether or not the change is good to apply right now. The fork will come with a block size that is twice as large as the current block size (hence 2x vs 1x). Many concede that this change will be necessary but is bad right now for one reason or another.
Both sides seem to agree that a majority of mining power says they support s2x. Some would say that that means that s2x will be more widely accepted despite the bitfinex futures being valued around 1/5 of current btc. Others maintain that miners will follow the money no matter what and thus the futures value matters more than what the miners report. Personally I'm not sure. Why couldn't a miner consider mining for the s2x chain as an investment? We already know they're investors since they needed to get hardware to have any relevant hashing power these days.
My assumption would be that if most miners actually choose 2x then 1x will slow down considerably and values would change accordingly. If someone could give a reason why miners following where the money is implies mining for 1x only, that would be nice.

What makes hardware wallets so great? I am a college student so spending $50-$100 on hardware just to store my investment isn't really feasible. I can't imagine what would make it worth it regardless though.
Who has one and can enlighten me?

Wait i still don't understand. Why would I believe glad I got a trezor? I can see why it's better than keeping in an exchange but what about compared to a brain wallet? What perks are there?

 I feel like I will do a poor job of explaining my thought process here:
I decided on a defined amount of BTC, where, if the value of that is at least how much I invested initially then I sell that much. That way if the worst happens after that I will not have lost any $.
Beyond that amount I keep until I feel the time is right. I'm a college student so I feel like I'll have a good reason to cash out for a big purchase sometime in the future.
Until then I watch the market/news and contemplate buying more.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:01:46
I wouldn't disagree, but only because blockchain is a far broader concept with applications to almost anything. It's like comparing apples to apple trees.
That doesn't change that cryptocurrency is based around said concept and that's what gives it usefulness.

US resident here, and In interested in getting a BTC/LTC card that I can fill/refill with however much I want (don't care about large amounts) just so I make the occasional purchase in hopes to support crypto.
I was looking a little bit into it but I'm not sure what's trustworthy. Any ideas?
Also I'm willing to wait until late November in case the fork brings in uncertainty for cards (like I know people are cutting xapo cards).
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:22:27
Are you sure that's all I need to know? Surely there's more to it. How do I take advantage of the equivalent amount of gold that I should supposedly receive at the time of the fork? Is there software similar software to core wallet for managing gold that I should make sure I have beforehand or will that only be after the fork?

I like to watch how many Bitcoin ATMs there are throughout the world. There are apps for that. I think a steady flow of newly placed ATMs will indicate increasing acceptance and buying/spending.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:28:55
When you say swap, you simply mean find software that manages both or at least use software that manages 2x while still keeping core around for 1x?
Also am I personally in any worse position for running &lt;.15?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:51:19
If someone can't understand that 1 BTC is further divisible, then I wouldn't expect them to understand what measures should be taken to protect their own BTC. Perhaps it's for the best this way until layers are developed.

Typing a "." as the first character in the "fiat exchanged" field causes the app to crash. Seems like you might not be using the right kind of input? It's showing the digits-only keyboard though so I'm not sure what's up.
Edit: to clarify, nice little app that I'll be using. One thing on my wishlist for it is to be able to select between various price sources.

Can you explain a little more why core isn't safe? The private key is mine for that program, yes? 
And do I have any options if I don't really have the money to buy a hardware wallet? Kinda used all the money I was willing to invest buying cryptocurrencies themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:51:41
Have you looked into the full implications of blockchain/crypto? There are several potential benefits beyond having as much anonymity as you want, like the ease of transactions on a global scale (the point of litecoin is to capitalize on this idea with shorter confirmation times and lower fees).
Bitcoin is moreso speculation that the technology is going to hold some sort of economic usefulness in the future. Maybe it is a bit of what you said too, I haven't really thought about it like that, but there are certainly aspects of cryptocurrencies that give it value. Is Bitcoin itself a bubble? Maybe, but at least one cryptocurrency will stick around for sure because it's useful.
