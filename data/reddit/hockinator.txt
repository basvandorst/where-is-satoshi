You could be like me and buy a bunch when it was $100, only to be an idiot and hold it all in an exchange that got hacked.

Yep exactly. Plus when you buy that cheap, it's just gut-wrenching to buy again when it's 100x the price

Gotcha.  I meant state as in "state of being" rather than "nation" seems a system where workers own the means of production is more of a temporary way of existing rather than a permanent structure..

"Market socialist" - what does this mean?

The economics of the situation makes it impossible for some entity to "make it disappear."  Even if the entire US government was hell-bent on eliminating the internet to stop all bitcoin usage, lots of people would still have connections (via satellite, mesh net, or anything else that sprung up to fill that gaping hole) and everything else would fail before we couldn't use bitcoin.  And of course there are always other countries.  
It can never be taken away, already.

Doesn't that imply socialism is a state (and maybe an ephemeral one at that)?  I always thought it was more of a government structure.
On another note, what kind of social safety nets to market socialists propose, if any?

And Internet would fall under the "electricity" umbrella and electricity would be under the science umbrella and science is under the "human ingenuity"  umbrella.  It's a pointless abstraction to make.

So just 100 years, then.

Yeah,  if you are saying the "light " cancels out.  For a range of 100 light-years,  given the signal is traveling at the speed of light,  the block time would be 100 years.

I live in Hollywood.  I would go out of my way to spend bitcoin on a sandwich for sure.

And it will be until the price of bitcoin is at all stable..
