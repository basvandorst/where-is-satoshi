Then why did he put leave $77,000 for __________? Just for one example. And a million other things you have no idea about lol. Wanna tell me his favorite color too? Or the last thing he said to me? Gods will be done.

The 77,000 wasn't for my name. I'm not giving you specific details of mine or who's that was far. As far as "good sister"--- I'm pretty sure I already beat myself up on that daily, considering he died by suicide and it kills me. When I found out, it was so traumatizing for me, the memory I have of finding out is literally in third person. It's by God's grace I didn't follow him and my guilt in grief to "the grave." Anyone that knows he &amp; I, knows I loved him more than words, but sadly, mental illness doesn't always care to help you think clearly with impulse decisions. I don't know what type of person you think you're talking to, or why you feel the need to overstep your boundaries and dictate your personal agenda on me, and punch me where I already punch myself, but I can assure you-- I'm not some money hungry "worldly" girl. Most people say I give too much, but I don't advertise when or how I help others for good causes, because I wasn't raised that way.

Why do I need to post the format?

My inbox is being flooded, I'm trying to keep everything in comment section. The part that sucks is that my brother's laptop is in the tech family member's possession* and I feel like he's being kind of vague. But, I can't straight up steal it back. The best thing I can to is try to gain as much knowledge as I can before going over there and bring someone with me.

Thank you for the input! My dad literally always says that my brother would be a millionaire if he were alive, every time I see him. But, he tends to exaggerate and I'm not sure if he understands bitcoin.

Thank you so much for your kindness. We were very close. &lt;3

I'm going to post what the family tech member I mentioned in previous post is saying, feel free to give me input if he's being fishy ::::
HIM: 
"I didn't have it. **** did. I think I helped him wipe it, but I'm not sure. Maybe we never got around to it? I'm really not sure. I'm not terribly familiar with how Bitcoin miners work, except that they accrue a certain amount of Bitcoin currency per Watt or something like that. If I can help in any way, please let me know."
 Side note (I messaged his wife first) then him.

They are nice people but this is frustrating. They said they suggest I use it there, and they are updating it, and that I am welcome to come anytime and use it, and they will be glad to to see if they can help retrieve it in anyway. But didn't say I could borrow it, or buy it off them.
However - literally Just now, I found some papers I have of his with weird numbers and letter combinations, and what looks like passwords. Also things are labeled bits, local bits, wallet.

Yeah I messaged my uncle about it this morning who has it. He confirmed he has it, and the laptop has virus issues. I asked if I could borrow or buy it off him... to which he never replied, but read the message. This is very frustrating, because the family tech member lives under the same roof as him who has the laptop. They seem willing in words to help, but not much.

We have one of them, but one of them was given to a family member who rebuilds and fixes laptops, pcs, cell phones etc. I'm going to see if he still has it. I actually asked this family member a few months ago if he could help me when we were going out to eat, and he was quick to say yeah, but never heard back from him about it. He already had my brother's laptop in his possession at this time, but I didn't know that was even needed with bitcoin. He would have though, so kinda odd he didn't mention that aspect.
