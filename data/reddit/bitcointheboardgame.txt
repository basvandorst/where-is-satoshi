Classic analogy and quote in the Fortune article by Spencer Borgart, head of research at Blockchain Capital...
The article refers to how when the Platypus was first discovered (late 18th century), scientists suspected it may be a hoax. It didn't fit and conventional taxonomic categories. It looked like a mole, had a duck's bill, beavers tail, and otters feet.
Borgart's quote: "Just like the platypus is not good at being a reptile, a beaver, a duck, or an otter, but it's great at being a platypus; Bitcoin is not good at being a currency, a commodity, or a fintech company but it's great at being Bitcoin."

I think the days of 2009-2017 Bitcoin year over year percentage gains are over. No more $1,100% annual gains. From here on out, people should expect market crushing gains of between 20% to 100% annually. Who in their right mind wouldn't risk 5% of their investment dollars and take a flier/hodl position on bitcoin?

Exactly. Might be the best example available. 
You up for starting a business called Amazon Cash? We can copy parts of the business we like. We'll temporarily improve things we don't like...that is until Amazon figures its issues out (in which case we're meaningless). In the meantime, lets see if we can't create enough confusion to gain traction and eventually try to hang on for dear life. We can always blame Amazon for not sticking to EVERY one of their initial business ideas and just say Jeff Bezos wouldn't have wanted it that way. I've found the first Amazon business plan and they've made changes. We can nail them!

Fee market capitalism will work. But, until there's a competitor with a clean user interface that's as easy to use as Coinbase, people will use it. I'd love to know the percentage of Coinbase account holders who literally know nothing about Bitcoin but can open a Coinbase wallet, add a credit card, and own bitcoin, ethereum, or BTrash. That's the key to Coinbase so far. They've dumbed the interface down for the masses.

With the CME and CBOE adding futures recently, I think that's a real possibility. I also wonder if, because Bitcoin is now "under the thumb" of the futures markets, less volatility and more "regulation" will cause people to move away from Bitcoin and into cryptos that are free from all this.

Fees are definitely another big bump in the road for bitcoin. We've seen many bumps in the road that Bitcoin has gotten over...and pretty successfully. Ultimately, I don't see how the community will not figure this one out too...with history as our guide.
You either limit the number of transactions by focusing bitcoin on big money transfers, store of value, and big ticket transactions or dramatically increase scalability...and soon.

Only invest money you can do without. I believe the "put a big chunk of your cash" (by percentage) days are over. If you bought longer than 3 months ago, I'd stay in. Higher Highs...Higher lows? My opinion is the new floor for Bitcoin is somewhere between $7k-$10k. Big range I understand but it goes back to my other comments. 3 months ago, BTC was under 5k. If you bought then, a 7k floor is better than 30% on your money. In the scheme of things, that's a fantastic return.

I'm not a fan of Coinbase. I'm not a fan of Roger Ver. But, based on all the vitriol around Coinbase launching BCash, I thought I remembered the Coinbase mess around first deciding not to support BCash, then threatened by lawsuits, reversing course. Here's the article link but I've pulled the quote below...
Coin Telegraph Story from August 4th...
A change of heart
"Coinbase now seems to have flip-flopped on their decision as they announced on their site that they planning to have support for Bitcoin Cash by Jan. 1, 2018"
So...if Coinbase announced they would have support for BCash BY Jan 1, 2018 (other than some possible insider trading some in the organization have to be worried about) should we be wishing for Coinbase to burn for all eternity? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:55:05

News/Rumors around Lightning Network is the only thing I'm aware of that might bump Bitcoin higher. Love to get a heads up about other potentially positive things coming down the pike. It seems like it was easier to follow the impact events in the past (Segwit, Bitcoin Cash, China, Futures, etc.) You didn't necessarily know which direction it would take Bitcoin but it wasn't a blindside like Coinbase yesterday.

BTC was driven by news in 2017. The momentum started with the NY agreement. While many see that as a failure, it was fantastic for momentum. The BCASH hard fork also drove positive momentum. Those days are over...forever. Future forks will only further divide and water down our community.  Today, we see how, although initially the BCASH fork was a positive driver of BTC price, it’s become a real negative for BTC. 
I think BTC will regain momentum when a scaling solution is implemented and the approval of one or more ETFs. Hopefully, Lighting can be part of the long term solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:51:53

Also, I've heard coin forks defined as a civil way to handle a civil war. If a segment of the community doesn't like the direction of the coin, and cannot come to a compromise, then fork it and go your own way. Leave the other alone and try to make your forked version work best. That's fair. Roger Ver has decided to try and create confusion and turmoil because he didn't get his way with Bitcoin and was forced to move in another direction. He should be ecstatic with how Bitcoin Cash is doing for goodness sake.

Don't mine for bitcoin. That ship has sailed for people in our position. As several mentioned in this post, you're better off owning BTC and trading out of gains to accumulate cash. If at all possible, just buy want you can and hold it for as long as you can (15-20 years). I Bought bitcoin and have sold 3/4 of it because it became an uncomfortably large percentage of my net worth. In other words, I couldn't afford to lose it any more. 
But, the rest of it...I will only sell at retirement which is more than 20 years away.

I'm not spreading uninformed information. It's been my experience. That's where people like you need to be very careful. I've been a bitcoin HOD'ler for over 3 years but have also sold a bunch of my holdings. While you're post and experience may be accurate the average person does not have your level of knowledge and are finding high fees more common that I think most bitcoin supporters want. Do you only think bitcoin should be available to those who need a ramp up period to use the methods you use or do you think widespread adoption is the result of bitcoin being able to be exchanged in straightforward ways AND with low fees?? 
Stop seeing bitcoin through rose colored glasses and embrace the struggle of bitcoin to work through its problems and growing pains. ALL new ideas see massive challenges. Bitcoin is no different. High fees for people without a PHD in bitcoin is a BIG CHALLENGE.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:35:38

I had some bitcoin 2 years ago I bought inside a retirement IRA (have sold much of it). But, because I was doing it through a company who had fees, expenses, etc, I understood paying a transaction fee...Especially considering I was buying BTC with pre-tax money.

@_date: 2019-06-26 16:51:54
In mid November of 2017, I sold a big chunk of my bitcoin holdings after it had grown 1,000% in 11 months basically because it had become too risky (as a percentage of my portfolio) to keep it in bitcoin. I did so, even though 2 weeks later it got as high as $20,000, because there was so much uncertainty (what would happen when future trading opened, Lightning Network was just starting to be used, high fees were weighing on people's perception of it as a "currency," people were still trying to use the "BTC is only for criminals" narrative, etc. etc.) 
This time around, it feels completely different. I still hold bitcoin but my confidence level is completely different. Maybe it's because I'm a grizzled veteran and have lived through a huge downturn. I think it's more because of the sentiment out there. 
Thanks to the community and development of bitcoin over even the last 18 months, virtually ALL of the above things mentioned above no longer are being mentioned. Credit to the Bitoiner's who are the ones really driving this bus. 
I really believe this is the proof it's not about price. Price follows growth, development/advancement in BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:11:41

That wasn't how it happened on the way up to the ATH. I noticed a bunch of "curiosity" in advance of bitcoin's price jump ($2,000 to $20,000). Lot's of people coming to get information, learn, etc. 
The usage after a price drop is understandable.

This is a perfect example of why integration with bitcoin is right and creating your own coin is wrong. Dorsey is creating a team just to focus on integrating the largest blockchain/cryptocurrency on the planet. Others are creating teams to launch new ICO’s from scratch. There is WAY to much distraction out there. Stay focused on bitcoin, grow the ecosystem, hodl some, and use soon BTC in your everyday life...x 500,000,000. = adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:15:03

You have to have a massive ego to ICO any coin without understanding how much work and development will be required after launch. I am really almost shocked at how many are going somewhere other than bitcoin to get into crypto. It’s going to be a bloodbath for all except a handful of coins.

Agreed. The ads Google are banning have little or nothing to do with bitcoin. Does bitcoin even advertise? Maybe bitcoinIRA or Coinbase. Is Google banning these types of ads?

The guests need a lesson on eating quietly!! The clanging and banging is annoying.

I'm as big a supporter as you'll find but WOW. If I had to create the most shill and shocking headline I hope will happen it wouldn't be in the same zip code as this one. Tim needs a good nights rest.

IMO...This is the kind of post that should be upvoted. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:41:38
Yes...may be a used one though. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:28:08
I'm an newbie when it comes to accepting bitcoin. Forgive me for not understanding. Do I need bitcoinway.com or not? From your response it seems like I only need Electrum and woo shop?? By "woo shop" you mean woo commerce right?
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:16:21
Unfortunately, you make a very good point.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:44:45
Can't disagree with that.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:27:56
Thank you Andreas. Thank you all who support him and have donated to him. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:39:35
Good point. For all the free pub BTC community has given them...its time. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:13:56
I agree. I'm creating a game and the price is driven up and down by both news and developments within bitcoin but have named the cards "News Cards" and am having second thoughts about it. "News &amp; Development Cards??" "Dev Cards" "Development Cards" ...

It's Satoshi. He's back.

Bitcoinway.com does not appear to be active. Last update says 2 years ago. Their support section on their website also appears to be very stale.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:45:16
I’ve never played but I’m going to. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:35:54
Agreed. Read the white paper Rogoff. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:21:08
Thanks for the explanation and resources. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:40:53
So we're at the point where miners should stop mining for bitcoin if the cost to do so is greater than the current price?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:16:12
Ahhhh....Learning as I go on Reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:44:48
It's one of the following: Jamie Dimon, Chinese Gov't offical(s), South Korean Gov't official(s), Roger Ver, Warren Buffet, or Jordan Belfort.

UASF - User Activated Soft Fork...for us tech challenged bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:19:17
Fair point. But, would you consider him/them a "founding father of the technoloogy/currency or more "really important/infuential" to adoption, growth, etc?
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:06:02
Do you think the price of bitcoin, since its been in existence, is more influenced by news or development?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:27:01
Totally agree with this. Seems like too much focus is on price sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:56:59
Satoshi's whitepaper spends a significant amount of time addressing how the network works best when "honest nodes" control the system. Let's hope "honest nodes" continue to keep attacks isolated and while these may represent temporary pain, bitcoin itself will act and progress like it always has.
Nice work btw.

This is going to make the 2018 Bitcoin The Board Game Expansion News Cards Pack!! Very cool.
Can you feel the Pumpening?

Question: are you ok with this? Do you want your real name or is your Reddit user name ok?

If BTC is going to survive and thrive, it has to under ALL conditions. BTC has moved from pennies to close to $20,000 per BTC. Did you EVER think governments would just let all that go and leave it up to us to self regulate? Come on. Billions of people live in regulated to very regulated economies. Did/do you really believe developed economies would/will allow the little guys (you and me) to somehow create a global currency without these Govt's saying ANYTHING about it?????

Cryptocurrency, as you know is a new (less than 10 years old) asset class. Bitcoin is, by far, the largest crypto in this asset class. The major financial news organizations follow it regularly. The SEC, per this post, has already considered and is re-considering a BTC backed ETF. It's not small. Yes, compared to money...it's small. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:58:26
Bitcoin is not small. The comparison doesn't apply. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:26:53
Done. The more attention on bitcoin the better. Scrutiny and attention lead to innovation, adoption, usage, etc. etc.

I started following bitcoin in mid-2016. I bought in early 2017. In late 2017, I sold 75% of it far below its high. I've held onto the remaining 25% and will do so until I retire (in 10-20 years) unless some really dramatic circumstance forces me to sell it. I watched my remaining 25% get to $20,000 and crash to under $4,000. It hasn't phased me. I check it as often as I want. I checked my keys for the first time in 18 months last month. I get 2 bitcoin e-newsletters and read about bitcoin daily. I occasionally come to this sub and look for stuff worth reading. But, having been through this for the last almost 3 years, I really could care less what's going on short term. I really enjoy owning it as it gives me a good reason to follow everything that goes on. 
Most of all, I believe bitcoin is on its path. I believe it has a very bright future...regardless of what both ends of the spectrum say. I'm equally skeptical of both Novagratz and Buffet.  
Because what I have won't break me if I lose it all, I can afford to sit back and "enjoy" the ride. I recommend that every single person interested in bitcoin owns enough to really participate. It's so much more fun when you have skin in the game. BUT, don't own more than 10% of your investment dollars in Bitcoin (or any investment for that matter). 10 years from now, you'll be glad you bought some BTC!

It's really as simple as sph44 &amp; kynek99 say. We can ask him to do a million things but only one thing matters...proof of bitcoin ownership from Block 9. 
Bitcoin is built on PROOF-OF-WORK for goodness sake yet he wants to demonstrate proof by copywriting the white paper as his proof?!?!?!?! This the first time and last time I'll give any mindspace to this until CSW sells a few Block 9 BTC.
