Good to know, thanks. I look forward to the day that the seed transformation and key derivation algorithm is universal across all wallet software. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 03:09:33
Piling on... It also doesn't convey information very usefully. Normally we'd look at a pie chart to quickly understand relative proportions. But since the time scales of each slice are completely different, the viewer ends up confused. I'd love to see the same chart with constant time slices.
Regardless, great work collecting and presenting the data, and thanks for sharing!

So is it not specified how to handle change in the HD BIPs?
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:22:51
What about my response was dickish? None. It was useful constructive feedback. In fact I went as far as expressing my appreciation and thanks.
So basically, fuck off.  Now that's me being a dick.

Interestingly, when I did this with the Hive web version it seemed to just work. So I guess they're using the same parameters as breadWallet. 
Also, this may mean I'm waiting for version 1.7 of this wallet. :)
Looks like it has some cool features, but the simplicity of breadWallet is hard to beat!
Edit: you're right, I created a second HD wallet using Internal and the remaining balance is there. FWIW, I didn't have to add addresses, it seemed to figure them out. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:37:01
What are the proper settings to fully import a breadWallet wallet? When I use the default HD settings it only sees about half of my balance. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:26:26
It's also BIP32+39 compliant. That means you can easily use the same pass phrase in any other similarly compliant wallet software and simply get full access to your BTC. For example, this works great in the new web-based Hive Wallet.

I ordered a single. Still nothing. Should I be worried? What's the news?

Regardless of his reasoning or circumstance, it either has value for you or not. For me, I found it worth the price I paid.

This does not constitute a strong password.
@_date: 2012-12-20 04:25:11
I think the choice is great. Some paranoid types may want to cash out to a mixed address. But a way to easily send it back to the original address would be fantastic. I think your idea is elegant. 
Really, really, really nice clean solid work here. I hope it does well for you. Also, I'm gonna PM you with some questions if you don't mind. 
@_date: 2012-12-08 15:55:46
It wasn't overcome. It was made better, but the comparison remained. 
@_date: 2012-11-13 04:27:39
By today's standards it provides rather low entropy. It's ill-advised, at best. 
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:14:34
Exactly right. They'd have to be compromised. I too run the javascript checker extension in Chrome.
My point was that it's disingenuous to make it seem so easily compromised, when it's a pretty damn good solution as far as "hybrid" wallets go.
I too am a software developer (games, actually) and a crypto geek.
I just think it's important we explain things clearly and fully to the ignorant.
I'm sorry I assumed your ignorance in this case.
@_date: 2012-12-08 15:54:21
There is a help link listed right in each tip. 
I want more people to understand BTC, but if they can't be bothered to click on "help", I'm not sure what else we do. 
@_date: 2012-12-19 21:25:07
Fucking very nicely done!
I wonder why the cash out can't just return it to the originating address?
I'm gonna PM you with a few more questions.  ;)

Oh, and I absolutely agree that bitcoin &amp; blockchain are not one and the same. But, remember, lots of new people are discovering btc every day. And, many of them, or most of them, do not have the background and knowledge to understand much of how any of this works. To them, blockchain could well mean bitcoin.. and yes, it's important we make that distinction.
But, and I think we're basically agreeing, I think blockchain.info wallets are by far the easiest way to get started. I always recommend a strong password, the browser extensions, and the two-factor authentication. Used that way, it's pretty damn good!
@_date: 2012-12-29 16:33:03
You clearly don't understand how blockchain.info works. Please don't spread ignorant misinformation. It only hurts bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-12-13 03:26:27
I say yes. It's short. It's a bit rambling and disjointed as it's really just a transcribed dialogue with Mr. Assange and several associate Cypherpunks.
But some of it is eye-opening, and I think, important for many people to see and understand. More specifically, I'm referring to the size of the national spy programs and the significant privacy concerns with things like Google and Facebook. 
I too bought the ebook with a credit card. Now maybe I'll also buy a few as gifts with BTC.

Fact is it's in both.

They want to count the bitcoins moving around, which means excluding the change. Now it's easier to know which part of a transaction is change for the period when this bug existed. 
@_date: 2011-07-19 06:36:41
Couldn't you just use another exchange board to convert between BTC and USD, etc.? The just trade here, if you prefer. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 15:59:47
Yes. Speculation tends to bring a good to its price equilibrium more quickly. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 22:44:55
Semantics. I'm sorry, I should have been more clear about my intent.
I s'pose there is a meaningful distinction with regard to tax laws, but I don't know anything about that. Do you?

This. ^^
You sound like someone who has read Rothbard. 
@_date: 2011-07-13 06:19:38
I saw that too, and it was funny. But, it was wrong.
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:25:11
Buying and selling goods with bitcoin is not bartering. It's indirect exchange. Bitcoin, a good itself, is a medium of exchange. It's not money until it's commonly accepted.
@_date: 2011-06-18 18:44:41
What you call "hoarding", in a free market is actually reservation demand. It's speculation. So called "hoarders" are holding their supply in hopes that they can trade it for a higher dolar-price (arbitrage). This activity should tend to stabilize the BTC-dollar price at its equilibrium more quickly.
@_date: 2011-06-06 05:09:27


No. Cases in point.. Rand Paul, Jim DeMint.
But yes, coincidentally, Chuck Schumer is a scumbag.
@_date: 2011-03-02 04:10:55
Do you think bitcoins are easier to lose than gold? If so, do you think this difference matters?
@_date: 2011-07-13 15:51:15
That's right. The police officers were wrong (as in unlawful) to force them to accept the pennies. Legal Tender laws are very misunderstood in the US. 
@_date: 2011-12-30 07:36:31
Why do you think a decrease in monetary supply will cause an increase in prices?
@_date: 2011-05-29 05:13:21
Cool. If this works, it should help the BTC-USD price get to its equilibrium more quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:05:45
The hardware PRNG he's using is already better than what you're proposing.

Came here to say this and you both beat me to it. I wonder why more people don't know about this?
I've been using BTSync for awhile now and I LOVE it. Free. Private. No limitations. I'm happy to say my Dropbox folder is now empty!
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:13:44
Unfortunately they're off on a useless vector. Very disappointing. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:05:55
gotten. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:13:41
I encourage people to replace Dropbox with BitTorrent Sync. While it doesn't quite cover all of the features and use cases of Dropbox, it comes damn close. And it's closed source (for now), but I trust it considerably more at this point. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 06:24:56
Also available as an onion!
@_date: 2013-02-22 06:43:29
Sorry, this is just wrong. Your transactions are signed with a private key, which corresponds to a given BTC address (aka a public key). If the private key is ever found easily, such as by quantum computers, then it can be used to sign transactions. 
If someone gains this capability, they'll simply look for addresses with the highest "balance" (or inputs) and move it to a new address. 
If that's not a problem, I don't know what is!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:47:37
I'm guessing they act as if they have some authority to remove you. But I doubt they do.
Anyway, probably not worth fighting unless you have $10-$20k you are willing to hand over to a lawyer. Though I think at least asking, "aren't I standing on public property?" would be relatively safe in a situation like this. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 06:09:18
The number of mistakes he made in this post caused me to wonder why I've been reading him for so long. Are these sort of gross errors prevalent in his other posts too? This is really poor journalism.
@_date: 2013-01-26 05:10:06
But probably not. In 35 years I'd have expected those NSA backdoors or attacks to have been discovered by cryptanalysts or computer engineers (in terms of MIPS growth). No doubt in my mind that they have capabilities we struggle to conceive, but I think for the most part, the public won.
@_date: 2013-02-06 06:18:50
Exactly. Luckily it emails me my encrypted wallet every time anything changes. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 04:32:22
Why bother? Go try BTSync. It's free. Covers nearly all of the Dropbox use cases. Private. Secure. Only issue is that it's closed source, just like Dropbox. I use it and love it and was very pleased to uninstall Dropbox everywhere. 
Go try it. You may find it as valuable as me!
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:23:26
Is that all at a single site?
@_date: 2013-01-26 05:06:03
Yay for Diffie, Hellman, Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman. And Merkle. We owe these people so much!
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:59:34
Agreed. Though I expect the protocol, at minimum, to be open before long. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:16:21
Weren't you standing on public property?

@_date: 2013-04-13 14:09:21
It's not limited to 8 places. That's only a current limitation in the main client (QT).

blockchain.info's "paper wallet" just prints out the keypairs in your wallet.

Yes. At astronomical odds. As always. 
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:37:15
The reduced supply (halving, speculating) and increased demand (poker, media trends). 
Though I can't imagine these things are attributable to the entire increase.

Lots of different people blog for mises.org. I'd say the Austrian School is split on this. 
My opinion is that many of them are old and nontechnical, and can't understand the inherent utility and intrinsic value in BTC.
The younger, more technical crowd is welcoming it. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:26:02
Ugh. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:08:25
Whatever. All I ever did was point out your incorrect statement. 
You got all butthurt about being so wrong and started collecting downvotes. Enjoy your karma!

I guess it's ok to explain it to newbs this way. 
But at some point you should be clear that the "network" doesn't return change. 
The change destination is built into the transaction which is composed and signed by your client.
@_date: 2013-09-23 16:07:09
so far.

Thanks, I jumped on this. FYI, Coinbase did take a good while to see the transaction. Their little web widget progress bar timed out on the first attempt. Worked on second attempt. 
I normally use RipIt+Handbrake. But it's always nice to have more options. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 16:00:43
I didn't use DropBox for backup. I use it for syncing and sharing. I think there are many others like me out there. BTSync is a perfect replacement for me. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:23:27
This. It was the worst pool I ever tried.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:26:53
The hardware derives the randomness from noise. Which is considerably better than asking someone to shake an accelerometer around.

It'd be more accurate to compare miners to a clearing house than to a central bank. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:55:35
Speculators serve a very useful purpose in free markets. They help markets clear more quickly. That means reaching the equilibrium price in less time. It adds efficiency to the marketplace. 
I know this may not seem so to the uneducated. But, please, go study some economics and you'll better understand. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:00:35
No. They're simply a printing of public and private keys. Some apps may work the way you describe, but many do not. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:20:22
Should have expressed result as CAGR, and of course considered the currency inflation (in Austrian terms) during the time period.
