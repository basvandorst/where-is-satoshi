The price is already up to that level. The cost for BTC is around 4-5k so at its current levels the halving is already priced in.

I go there from time to time and read all those predictions and analysis how the price surely is going to move and then the next period nothing of it actually happens. Quite comical

No problem admiral idiot.
Who the fuck invests money they cant miss in high risk investments. If you are that stupid dont whine about it later. If there is any universal tip anyone with half a brain will give you it is: dont invest with money you cant afford to lose. Please delete your account and dont come back here anymore since you are apparently to stupid to comprehend this basic rule nr 1

First of al thats not an answer to my qeustion.
Second there are 100million+ people who have family abroad or friends travelling/studying in different countries. That is a huge amount of people for whom Bitcoin can be an easy and cheap to use solution.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:55:42
i prefer to have my coins all in one place easy accessible without risk. The fact that this isnt possible (yet?) to me is a shortcoming that should be fixed soon. 
If you say to the average joe: "Hey read this tutorial about setting up a cold storage. This is what you've got to do to keep your coins safe". Im pretty sure they will look at you like your crazy and will never have anything to do with bitcoin.

I kinda wish that is the truth. Then there is still some hope that the key might be found. Also good news that 700k+ bitcoins arent in the hands of a thief and could be dropped on the market at any moment.
I wonder how long it takes to bruteforce a password with probably 20+ digits.

If all you said was "bitcoin = scam" then we can still laugh at you because thats still stupid.  MTgox exchange went offline that has nothing to do with bitcoin itself. Its like saying dollars are a scam because the lehman brothers bank went bankrupt. I can imagine why people laugh at you...
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:47:30
i said it in the first line "an easy way".
Yes, i cant be bothered to go trough alot of hassle to protect something of value when i dont have to with other alternatives (bank account). Thats the way the world works. I see the potential of bitcoin but only if its as easy and safe to use as the currencies it competes with. 
Bitcoin is still developing so im hoping some smart people come up with ways to make storing bitcoin safe and easy. Because if it stays like this most people wont bother with bitcoin.

I see a lot of tipping lately which is great. 
Why doesnt the Reddit team pick up on this and instead of gifting reddit gold. You can gift an amount of bitcoins of your choice where a small percentage goes to Reddit. In return for the fee the post that gets tipped still gets a special icon. 
I think this would get even more people from different subs into bitcoin and people would actually get something usefull (spendable cash) instead of Reddit Gold. It might even encourage more people to post good content if they see they can get tips for it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:17:03
I disagree. 
I bought in at $ 1200. 100% of my investments is bitcoin. And im not panicking. Why? because i knew investing in bitcoin would be a huge risk and the money i put in was not a big deal to me. 
You never invest that which you cant afford to lose. So panicking when the price drops is stupid because there is no reason to do so. If there is you should not have invested that money. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:40:16
i dont have any experience with non windows machines (like 90% of the world) and i dont have a spare machine just for that kind of use. 
No offense but please stay realistic and think about how the average person that wants to get into bitcoin thinks and acts. You cant say its "easy" and then have someone install a whole new OS on a seperate machine that he cant use for anything else.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:15:44
What i find anoying is that there is still no easy way to safely store your coins in your own posession. Im no expert so maybe someone could enlighten me. This is how i see it:
If i store them in an online wallet ive got a chance they get hacked or they go out of business and bye bye coins.
If i store them on my computer all that needs to happen is a keylogger and acces to the wallet file. Wich apparently isnt that hard.
You could go trough the whole cold wallet process with a disconected PC with a fresh linux install etc etc. But thats to much hassle and you dont have easy acces to your own coins to use them.
I tried bitgo but to me it seems when you've got a keylogger on your pc its very easy to steal your coins. So currently im using trustedcoin which halts transfers for 24 hours but it isnt the ideal solution either.

The moment you put money into bitcoin you should have counted that money as lost. Thats what you do with high risk investments. I bought in at 1200 and im not panicking? Why would I? What would that benifit me? There's a real chance the price might go back above 1200 or i can sell at a loss for sure. Why would i choose for the last?

Thats the same proof you've got that its him. This journalist clearly made certain parts of the story up to make her theory look better. A person who cares so much about privacy and not being known.

Have you ever used linux?
do you think its easy to install linux? (if they even know what is is)
and would you buy a spare notebook just to store your money on it?
Almost everyone would answer "No" to al these qeustions. If you ever expect bitcoin to become larger it must be easy to use for the masses. And the masses wont accept this. Hell, my girlfriend cant even install an app on her android phone and you expect that this is all normall?

I agree bitcoin still has ways to go in becoming more easy to use for the masses. That doesnt mean its dead or has no use. That only means its good to be an early adopter.

I geuss your american wich has a slightly different system. In europe we have debitcards connected to our bank accounts. I can pay directly from my payments account. Wich usually has around 400 euro in it. Then theres a savings account connected to that. If i need more then that i can transfer money instantly from my savings account to my payment account. I can do this through an app on my phone or via the website of the bank which is secured with 2FA. This way i could transfer lets say 6000 euro's to my payment account with my phone and then buy a motorcycle with my card.

His argument is logical. When more people want something demand goes up same with price. The only question is IF this will happen. Noone can say that for sure. Thats the same thing with any investment. I can buy 1000 dollars of shares in Tesla anticipating the company will become a great succes. It could just as well fail and i lose everything. So basically every investment is "imagining a certain outcome". If anybody could predict things for sure then they would not be posting here but sitting on a yaught with billions in the bank.

a sharp increase = not overrun. Like i said 0,0005% chance is not a big problem. The original poster said "considering europe is infested with arabs, pakis, hindus, turks". and then you come with 450 crimes on 8 MILLION people. Thats a joke. If it where overrun you would have 100.000 of crimes.

Get out of your basement and go out in the real world. You are so influenced by all the "scary" news that you apparently believe the scary foreigners are out to get us. Im sure all the immigration brings extra trouble since some of them have trouble integrating. But stop the bullshit that we are getitng overrun and that we are not safe in the streets anymore. Just get go out of your home and see that is not the case. Most of them are really happy to be here and want to work hard for a better life. Its also funny that someone who cant even write decent english (something teached in most schools) has such an opinion. If you cant even handle something as easy as the english language then your opinion on important things means little to me and just proves that simple people just like to point their finger at "the brown people who are out to get us". Since they are to stupid to see a bit farther then their nose.
